EAST GREENWICH TOWNSHIP, NEW JERSEY MUNICIPAL CODE 
____________ 
A Codification of the General Ordinances of
East Greenwich Township, New Jersey 
____________ 
Beginning with Supp. No. 8,
Supplemented by Municipal Code Corporation 
____________ 

> 
PREFACE 
    The East Greenwich Township, New Jersey, Municipal Code, originally published by LexisNexis, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Municipal Code Corporation, its successor in interest. 
    During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of LexisNexis under the direction of Susan M. Costill, township clerk. 
    The Code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, Chapter, and Section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
    In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the Code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 8, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
    A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific Code provisions by individual section numbers. 
    This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance No. 11-2018, passed November 27, 2018.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
    This Code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this Code. 
Numbering System. 
    The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the Code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
    A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This Code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, Code adoption and definitions. The titles in this Code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
    Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
    Each section of the Code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the Code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
    There are many tables of contents in this Code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the Code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
    At the end of each Code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 8 a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
    The statutory references direct the Code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
    When a Code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" Code references in the new Code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the Code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior Code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new Code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
    As of Supplement No. 8, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
    To find a specific ordinance in the Code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the Code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the Code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 8 this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
    Beginning with Supplement No.8, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the Code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the Code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
    If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this Code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
    The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Insertion Guide. 
    Each supplement to the new Code will be accompanied by an Insertion Guide. This guide will tell the Code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the Code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
    When originally published, this Code was numbered with consecutive page numbers. As it is amended, new material may require the insertion of new pages that are numbered with hyphens. (Example: 31, 32, 32-1.) Backs of pages that are blank (in Codes that are printed double-sided) are left unnumbered but the number is "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
    In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version.

Chapter 8.50 - FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION[2] 

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Cross reference- Zoning-Floodplain Regulations, Ch. 16.86. 

8.50.010 - Statutory authorization, findings of fact, purpose and objectives. 
1.1.  Statutory Authorization. The Legislature of the State of New Jersey has in N.J.S.A. 40:48-1, et seq., delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the township committee of the Township of East Greenwich, Gloucester County, New Jersey, does ordain as follows: 
1.2.  Findings of Fact. 
(1)  The flood hazard areas of the Township of East Greenwich are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
(2)  These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and velocities, and when inadequately anchored, causes damage in other areas. Uses that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. 
1.3  Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Protect human life and health; 
(2)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines; streets; bridges located in areas of special flood hazard; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the second use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas; 
(7)  Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and 
8.  Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions. 
1.4  Methods of Reducing Flood Losses. In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and provisions for: 
(1)  Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters; 
(4)  Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; and 
(5)  Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. 
(Ord. No. 36-2009, § 1.0(1.1-1.4), 12-8-2009) 
8.50.020 - Definitions. 
    Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application. 
    "AH zone" means areas subject to inundation by one-percent-annual-chance shallow flooding (usually areas of ponding) where average depths are between one and three feet. Base flood elevations (BFEs) derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are shown in this zone. 
    "AO zone" means areas subject to inundation by one-percent-annual-chance shallow flooding (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average depths are between one and three feet. 
    "Appeal" means a request for a review of the building inspector's interpretation of any provision of this chapter or a request for a variance. 
    "Area of shallow flooding" means a designated AO, AH, or VO zone on a community's digital flood insurance rate map (DFIRM) with a one percent annual or greater chance of flooding to an average depth of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
    "Area of special flood hazard" means the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. It is shown on the FIRM as zone V, VE, V1-30, A, AO, A1-A30, AE, A99, or AH. 
    "Base flood" means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
    "Base flood elevation (BFE)" means the flood elevation shown on a published flood insurance study (FIS) including the flood insurance rate map (FIRM). For zones AE, AH, AO, and A1-30 the elevation represents the water surface elevation resulting from a flood that has a one-percent or greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. For zones VE and V1-30 the elevation represents the stillwater elevation (SWEL) plus wave effect (BFE = SWEL + wave effect) resulting from a flood that has a one-percent or greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
    "Basement" means any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides. 
    "Breakaway wall" means a wall that is not part of the structural support of the building and is intended through its design and construction to collapse under specific lateral loading forces without causing damage to the elevated portion of the building or supporting foundation system. 
    "Development" means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations, or storage of equipment or materials located within the area of special flood hazard. 
    "Digital flood insurance rate map (DFIRM)" means the official map on which the Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
    "Elevated building" means a nonbasement building: 
(1)  Built in the case of a building in an area of special flood hazard to have the top of the elevated floor elevated above the base flood elevation plus freeboard by means of piling, columns (posts and piers), or shear walls parallel to the flow of the water, and 
(2)  Adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a flood up to the magnitude of the base flood. 
    In an area of special flood hazard "elevated building" also includes a building elevated by means of fill or solid foundation perimeter walls with openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of floodwaters. 
    "Erosion" means the process of the gradual wearing away of land masses. 
    "Existing manufactured home park or subdivision" means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
    "Flood" or "flooding" means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
(1)  The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and/or 
(2)  The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. 
    "Flood insurance study (FIS)" means the official report in which the Federal Insurance Administration has provided flood profiles, as well as the flood insurance rate map(s) and the water surface elevation of the base flood. 
    "Floodplain management regulations" means zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as a floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance and erosion control ordinance) and other applications of police power. The term describes such state or local regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction. 
    "Floodproofing" means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents. 
    "Floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than two-tenths foot. 
    "Freeboard" means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of flood plain management. "Freeboard" tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed. 
    "Highest adjacent grade" means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed or existing walls of a structure. 
    "Historic structure" means any structure that is: 
(a)  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of the Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register;

(2)  Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs. 
    "Lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, useable solely for the parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement is not considered a building's lowest floor provided that such enclosure is not built so to render the structure in violation of other applicable nonelevation design requirements of 44 CFR Section 60.3. 
    "Manufactured home" means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". 
    "Manufactured home park or manufactured home subdivision" means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
    "New construction" means structures for which the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
    "New manufactured home park or subdivision" means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of the flood plain management regulation adopted by the municipality. 
    "Recreational vehicle" means a vehicle which is: 
(1)  Built on a single chassis; 
(2)  Four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the longest horizontal projections; 
(3)  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light-duty truck; and 
(4)  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
    "Start of construction" for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (P.L. No. 97-348) includes substantial improvements and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site such as the pouring of a slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. 
    Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways, nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings or piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms, nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    "Structure" means a walled and roofed building, a manufactured home, or a gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground. 
    "Substantial damage" means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damage would equal or exceed fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    "Substantial improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
(1)  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement officer and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
(2)  Any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure". 
    "Variance" means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter that permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this chapter. 
    "Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this chapter. A new or substantially improved structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in 44 CFR §60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

(5)  Upon consideration of the factors of subsection 4.4-1(4) and the purposes of this chapter, the planning board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter. 
(6)  The building inspector shall maintain the records of all appeal actions, including technical information, and report any variances to the Federal Insurance Administration upon request. 
4.4-2  Conditions for Variances. 
(1)  Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing items (i) through (xi) in subsection 4.4-1(4) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
(2)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(3)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(4)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(5)  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
(i)  A showing of good and sufficient cause; 
(ii)  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and 
(iii)  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public as identified in subsection 4.4-1(4), or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(6)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.

    When an in-building radio system is required, and upon completion of installation, it will be the building owner's responsibility to have the radio system tested to ensure that two-way coverage on each floor of the building is a minimum of ninety (90) percent. Each floor of the building shall be divided into a grid of approximately twenty (20) equal areas. A maximum of two nonadjacent areas will be allowed to fail the test. In the event that three of the areas fail the test, in order to be more statistically accurate, the floor may be divided in forty (40) equal areas. In such event, a maximum of four nonadjacent areas will be allowed to fail the test. After the forty-area test, if the system continues to fail, the building owners shall have the system altered to meet the ninety (90) percent coverage requirement. The test shall be conducted using the most current Motorola portable radio or its equivalent talking through the GCER as specified by the authority having jurisdiction. A spot located approximately in the center of a grid area will be selected for the test, then the radio will be keyed to verify two-way communications to and from the outside of the building through the GCER. Once the spot has been selected, prospecting for a better spot within the grid area will not be permitted. 
    The gain values of all amplifiers shall be measured and the test measurement results shall be kept on file with the building owner so that the measurements can be verified each year during the annual tests. In the event that the measurement results become lost, the building owner will be required to rerun the acceptance test to reestablish the gain values. 
    Tests shall be made using the following guidelines: 
1.  With a service monitor or signal meter using a unity gain antenna on a small ground plane; 
2.  Measurements shall be made with the antenna held in a vertical position at three to four feet above the floor; 
3.  A calibrated service monitor or signal meter (with a factory calibration dated within twenty-four (24) months) may be used to do the test; 
4.  The GCER representative may also make simultaneous measurements to verify that the equipment is making accurate measurements. A variance of three db between the instruments will be allowed; and 
5.  If measurements in one location are varying, then average measurements shall be used. 
    Tests shall be made using the designated frequencies used by emergency response personnel. All tests shall be made in concert with GCER. If interference problems are noted, it is the owner's responsibility to ensure action is taken to reduce them. 
(Ord. 14-2008, § 2) 
9.38.050 - Annual tests. 
    When an in-building radio system is required, the building owner shall test all active components of the system, including but not limited to amplifiers, power supplies and backup batteries, a minimum of once every twelve (12) months. Amplifiers shall be tested to ensure that the gain is the same as it was upon initial installation and acceptance. Backup batteries and power supplies shall be tested under load for a period of one hour to verify that they will properly operate during an actual power outage. If within the one-hour test period, in the opinion of the testing technician, the battery exhibits symptoms of failure, the test shall be extended for additional one-hour periods until the testing technician confirms the integrity of the battery. All other active components shall be checked to determine that they are operating with the manufacturer's specifications for the intended purpose. 
(Ord. 14-2008, § 2) 
9.38.060 - Five-year tests. 
    In addition to the annual test, the building owner shall perform a radio coverage test a minimum of once every five years to insure that the radio system continues to meet the requirements of the original acceptance test. The procedure set forth above shall apply to such tests. A copy of accepted tests shall be provided to the GCER. 
(Ord. 14-2008, § 2) 
9.38.070 - Qualifications of testing personnel. 
    All tests shall be conducted, documented and signed by a person in possession of a current FCC technician license, or a current technician certification issued by APCO, NABER, or the PCIA. All test records shall be retained on the inspected premises by the building owner and a copy submitted to municipal officials. 
    All tests will be performed in conjunction with GCER. 
(Ord. 14-2008, § 2) 
9.38.080 - Field testing. 
    Police and fire personnel, after providing reasonable notice to the owner or his representative, shall have the right to enter onto the property to conduct field testing to be certain that the required level of radio coverage is present.

As sewer charges are municipal liens, all charges will be submitted by the sewer department prior to the date of settlement and verified, in writing, to the title company or whichever authorized agent is processing the transfer of property. The title company shall be obligated to clear all sewer charges outstanding on the property. In the event that charges are not paid at settlement, those charges shall remain on the account as a lien against the property. 
2.  Search Fee. The township shall charge a search fee as set forth in Section 13.08.140, Schedule III for sewer on each account. Search fees are due upon presentation.

5.  New Fixtures. Under no circumstances shall any new fixture be installed in a building or dwelling at an elevation lower than the front curb elevation or the street centerline elevation, whichever is higher. The installation of an accessible check valve system with a gate valve between the check valve and the curb is mandatory for all customers requesting such new fixture installation to prevent surcharging of the new fixture installation from the sanitary sewer main because of high flow or blockage. Such installation is at the expense of the customer who is subsequently deemed owner of the installed facilities. All customers are deemed to be responsible for its maintenance. The township is indemnified and held harmless by the customer from any liability resulting from the malfunctioning of any fixture or required installation under this subdivision. 
6.  Initial Billing Date of Newly Constructed Home. The initial billing date of a newly constructed home will be the date of the certificate of occupancy or the date of settlement, whichever is first. 
B.  Garbage Disposals. Garbage disposals will be billed at an annual rate in addition to the normal sewer charge set forth in Section 13.08.140, Schedule II. Charge for the disposal will continue until the customer has notified the township of the removal of the disposal and a house verification by the township has been made. Routine house inspections will be made by the township to determine the existence of garbage disposal systems and the customer will be billed for the disposal as of his or her last billing date preceding the inspection. 
C.  Landlord-Tenant Responsibility. All charges for sewer are a lien against the property and therefore the responsibility of the owner. If the landlord requests in a letter that the bills be sent to the tenant, the township, at its discretion, may oblige after informing the landlord that the final responsibility for any unpaid charges is the responsibility of the owner of the property and subsequent charges will be billed to the owner. 
D.  Discontinuation of Customer Service. In the event that a sewer lateral service will be permanently discontinued, the township shall be notified, in writing, that the service billing shall be terminated. The sewer lateral shall be permanently sealed watertight in a manner subject to the approval of the township engineer or superintendent. 
E.  Inspection of Riser Cap. When the township inspection indicates that a riser cap is missing or damaged, the customer will be notified that the cap must be repaired or replaced within seven days. After that time period the township will replace or repair the riser cap and the customer will be charged for parts and service.

In the event that any industry fails to conform to these regulations or fails to comply with the terms and conditions of their agreement with the township, which failure causes damage of any sort to the township's sewer system or the township's employees, the township reserves the right to cancel any agreement with the industry and terminate service to the industry. The township shall determine the extent of the damage and bill the industry accordingly. If such bill is not paid within thirty (30) calendar days from the date of the bill, legal action may be instituted to enforce collection. 
    The township reserves the right to cancel the agreement, upon ninety (90) days written notice, in the event of repeated failure to comply with the terms of the agreement or the rates, rules and regulations of the township. 
I.  Industrial Waste Flowmeter and Sampler. Where deemed necessary by the township, industrial and/or commercial customers may be required to provide an approved flow measurement and sampling system. The requirement to furnish, install and maintain a flowmeter of the indicator-register-recorder type to measure the discharge of industrial wastes and a wastewater sampler to periodically take and preserve a portion of the wastewater stream is described in subsection F of this section. The flowmeter and wastewater sampler will be approved by the township but supplied by the customer with the cost of such equipment and installation to be borne by the industry. All cost of furnishing, installing and maintaining the industrial waste flow and sampling equipment will be borne by the industry and shall be readily accessible to township personnel. Township personnel shall have the right to enter the establishment of an industrial user for inspection. 
J.  Treatment of High Strength Industrial Wastewaters. High strength wastewaters, including pretreated wastewaters will be subject to a rate surcharge if they unduly add to the expense of operating and maintaining the collection system or surcharges to the township from the Gloucester County Utilities Authority. The surcharge for industrial wastewater shall be based on the strength of the industrial wastewater. 
K.  Industrial Sewer Rates. The industrial sewer rate and surcharges will be addressed in the agreement between the industry and the township. 
    Sewer service charges for domestic sewage discharge from general warehousing/light manufacturing facilities shall be billed on a quarterly basis for sewer service, using actual water metered per quarter divided by ninety-one (91) days in order to establish the average daily flow of sewage. The sewer service charge shall be calculated by dividing the average daily flow by three hundred (300) GPD to establish the number of domestic consumer units, one unit minimum, multiplied by the annual rate per domestic consumer unit currently in use by the township. 
    Users not serviced by public water, but utilizing the convenience of public sewer, must install, at the owner's expense, a direct externally read water meter at the well location in order that a township representative can make the necessary water readings to substantiate the sewer rates. 
L.  Industrial Connection Charge. The following data shall be used to establish the industrial connection charge for industrial wastewater: 
1.  For industrial wastewater not subject to metering and/or sampling, one industrial connection unit shall equal three hundred (300) gallons per day of wastewater flow. 
2.  For industrial wastewaters subject to meter and/or sampling, the number of industrial connection units shall be derived based on the formula: 
Highest Annual Peak Flow or Permit Flow __________300 GPD 300 GPD  
    The industrial connection charge is based on one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500.00) per industrial connection unit. 
M.  Industrial Service Revisions. The industrial wastewater parameters and the criteria for industrial waste limits are subject to future revision or modification as may be required by the N.J. Department of Environmental Protection, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Gloucester County Utilities Authority, the Delaware River Basin Commission and the township of East Greenwich. 
N.  Mobilehome Park and Campgrounds. Each mobile home site shall be charged as one connection unit and, in the case of a campground, every six sites approved by the township shall constitute one connection unit. However, calculations made the by the township engineer may result in fewer sites constituting one connection unit and the applicant will be so notified. 
(Prior code § 10A-5) 
13.08.070 - Sewer main extensions. 
A.  General Provisions. Persons proposing subdivisions or developments requiring a main extension for sewer service shall prepare applications described in this section with the necessary supporting documents. The policy of the township is to permit extensions only when paid for and installed by the applicant. No facilities for collection, treatment or disposal of sewage within the district of the township, which corresponds with the boundaries of the township, shall be constructed unless the township shall give its consent and the township engineer shall approve contract plans and specifications therefore. 
B.  Auxiliary Electrical Power. Auxiliary electrical power is required for all motors used for pump stations and other motor driven equipment as determined by the township. This shall apply to all major projects, which major project is defined as including, but not limited to, major subdivisions, general commercial projects and multiple occupancies in the excess of three domestic consumer units. The township reserves the right to make exceptions to this requirement when it appears that the imposition thereof will be patently inequitable. 
C.  Connections. Residential subdivision containing four or more contiguous building sites or lots or any residential structure to be used by three or more families, regardless of volume of flow, and all nonresidential developments such as schools, commercial buildings, industrial buildings and all other structures will be required to install a sanitary sewer system to be connected to the nearest existing sanitary sewer in the township. 
    Residential subdivisions containing three or less building sites or lots or if the lands are deemed by the township to be too remote from any existing facilities, then consideration will be given to an individual sewage system, with a dry sanitary sewer system for future use, in lieu of connection to existing facilities. Individual sewage disposal systems will be permitted only upon specific written permission of the township and approval by the N.J. Department of Environmental Protection. 
    Such individual system, plant or expansion of the location thereof shall be subject to approval by the township in accordance with the standards and requirements as hereinafter set forth. 
    Any main extension and related facilities installed under the provisions of this section shall be transferred to the township as hereinafter described. 
    During construction, but before final acceptance, the township shall have the right to use any completed portion of the system without waiving its right to further inspection or testing or to order correction of any defects. 
    Use of the sanitary sewer system for the discharge of sump pumps or drainage from cellar drains, floor drains, leaders, downspouts, drainage tile, swimming pools, cooling system drains and other similar discharges shall not be permitted. 
    Unpolluted industrial cooling waters and unpolluted drainage shall be discharged into a storm sewer or natural outlet. 
    These general provisions are and shall be subject to the existing contractual obligations outstanding. 
D.  Connection Fees-Delinquent Charges. It is the policy of the township to charge connection fees for connection of its sewer system following the rates as set forth in Section 13.08.140, Schedule IV. The connection fee is two thousand two hundred and forty-five dollars ($2,245.00) per domestic consumer unit. 
    Connection fees shall be payable within thirty (30) days of approval of the application by the township, unless specific arrangements are agreed upon. If payment is not received within this period, the applicant will be charged a delinquent charge of one and one-half percent per month and a certificate of occupancy will not be issued until the fee and delinquent charges are paid in full. 
E.  Applications-Fees. 
1.  Applications. A sequence of applications for sewer extensions are required for the township's determination of needs, availability of service, effect of proposed extension and inspection of installed extension. Application forms are available from the township. Chart I at the end of this chapter outlines the contents of this subsection and describes the sequence of applications, forms, supporting data, fees and township action that results in acceptable main extensions for sewer.

13.08.080 - Connections and service lines. 
A.  Township Service Line. New connections to existing sewer mains will be at the expense of the applicant, including tapping if approved by the township, fittings, pipe, labor and related materials. Such new connections and laterals will become the property of the township to the curbline, except when the sewer main is located in the sidewalk area, then the township's ownership shall extend to the right-of-way line. The township will maintain such new connections and new laterals from the sewer main to the curbline or property line, depending on the location of the sewer main, after installation and approval by a representative of the township together with the township plumbing inspector. The applicant will be fully responsible for street permits, excavation and restoration and the complete cost thereof. 
B.  Size and Kind of Service Lateral. The township reserves the right to determine the size and kind of service lateral from the main to the vicinity of the curbline, from the vicinity of the curbline to the property to be served or from the main in the right-of-way to the property to be served. Laterals of all sizes shall be constructed of piping materials acceptable to the township. A sketch showing the service lateral from the curb to the building, including the sewer cleanout, shall be furnished, installed and maintained by the owner of the property. A size four-inch lateral shall be laid at a minimum grade of one-quarter inch per foot, and in a straight line from the point of connection to the main, where the main is in a right-of-way, or from the end of the township constructed service lateral to the structure to be served and, where possible, shall be at least four feet below the surface of the ground when final grading of the property has been completed. That portion of the service lateral and sewer cleanout installed and maintained by the owner shall be installed in accordance with the township plumbing code, and shall be inspected and approved by the township plumbing inspector prior to backfilling the trench. Any construction not approved shall be immediately removed and reconstructed in an approved manner. 
C.  Service Lateral Placement. No service lateral shall be laid in the same trench with any gas pipe, water service or any other facility of any public utility company, nor within three feet of any open excavation, vault or meter pit; nor shall the location be in conflict with any sidewalk or driveway. All laterals shall be installed within the limits of the customer's property and be a minimum of three feet from any property line(s). 
D.  Elevation of Sanitary Fixtures. Under no circumstances shall any new sanitary fixtures be installed in a building at an elevation lower than the front curb elevation or street centerline elevation, whichever is higher, unless special precautions are incorporated into the new fixture installation to prevent surcharging of the new fixture from the sanitary sewer main because of high flows or blockage. Prior to installation of any fixture which may be lower than the elevation heretofore specified, the owner shall obtain the approval of the township plumbing inspector on the type of precautions that will be taken to eliminate the potential flooding of premises with sewage. In the event a fixture is found to be installed at any point lower than heretofore specified, the township may revoke the sewer connection permit or discontinue service until the fixture is removed or positive control measures, such as a gate valve and check valve, are instituted to eliminate any potential surcharging of the building with sewage. 
E.  Maintenance by Customer. All connections, service laterals, sewer cleanouts and fixtures furnished by the customer shall be maintained by him or her in good order, and all piping and connections furnished and owned by the township and on the property of the customer shall be protected properly and cared for by the customer. All leaks in the service lateral or any other pipe or fixture in or upon the premises served must be repaired immediately by the owner or occupant of the premises. The customer shall be responsible for notifying the township sewer department of the party engaged by the customer to do any maintenance work in the customer's service lateral prior to work being commenced. Such party shall not backfill any trench until the work has been inspected and approved by the township's representative. Any work not acceptable shall be immediately removed and replaced by work which is acceptable. No used or reclassified fittings shall be used in any sewer connection. 
F.  Responsibility of Township. The township shall in no way be responsible for maintaining any portion of the service lateral owned by the customer, for damage done by sewage escaping therefrom or for lines or fixtures on the customer's property; and the customer shall at all times comply with the applicable municipal regulations with respect thereto, and make changes therein, required by reason, changes of grade, relocation of mains or otherwise. When there is no trap and vent installed between the curb and sidewalk area, the property owner is responsible for service from his or her home to the sewer main. 
G.  Renewal of Service Lateral. Where the renewal of the service lateral from the main to the curb is found to be necessary, the township will renew the service in the location as previously used. If the property owner or customer, for his or her own convenience, desires the new service lateral at some other location and agrees to pay all expenses of such relocation in excess of the cost of laying the service lateral in the same location as previously used, and cutting and disconnecting the old service lateral, the township will lay the new service lateral at the location desired. 
H.  Prohibited Connections. Under no circumstances will any of the following be connected to the sanitary sewers, either directly or indirectly: 
1.  Foundation underdrains; 
2.  Floor drain, area drain, yard drain or drain from swimming pools;

5.  Air conditioning equipment, except condensate which will be permitted under conditions approved by the township; 
6.  Stormwater inlets or catchbasins; 
7.  Drains and floor drains from pieces of equipment or manufacturing processes, except when specifically authorized under the provisions of these rates, rules and regulations. 
I.  Special Connections. Service laterals to public buildings, churches, apartment houses, commercial establishments and industrial establishments shall be installed to conform to detailed plans and specifications approved by the township engineer. 
J.  Special Precautions in Wet Ground. Where groundwater is normally above the invert elevation of the service lateral, the design and installation of the service lateral must have prior approval of the township engineer. Where the trench bottom is soft and yielding, the township engineer reserves the right to require that the service be laid in partial or total concrete encasement. Junctions of two different types of pipe, at the option of the township engineer, may be required to be encased in concrete of mix determined by the township engineer. 
K.  Property Served by Single Service Lateral. A service lateral from the vicinity of the curb or the main in a right-of-way to a property shall not serve more than one property but any such property, upon proper application of the owner, may be served by two or more service laterals, each of which, for billing purposes, shall be considered as being one customer account. 
L.  Single Service Lateral with Two or More Customers. Where two or more customers are now served through a single service lateral, any violation of the rules of the township with respect to wither or any of such customers shall be deemed a violation as to all. Unless such violation is corrected after reasonable notice, the township may take such action as may be taken until a customer who has not violated the township's rules has been given a reasonable opportunity to connect his or her pipe to a separately controlled service lateral. 
M.  Policy an Blockages. While the township has no responsibility beyond the curbline, it will, as a public service, clear the curb cleanout at the request of the customer on his or her initial request. The township will also verify that the portion of the service line between the curb and main is clear and, when necessary, take action to clear that section of the line. 
    Determination of charges shall be as follows: 
1.  If the curb cleanout is so positioned on the property that there is a distance between it and the curb, the township may clear the line and if it is determined that the blockage was between the curb cleanout and the curb, the township may charge the customer for clearing the blockage. 
2.  If the customer requests that the township open the street to clear a blockage and the result of the excavation clearly indicates that the blockage is on the service line belonging to the customer, the customer will be charged for the cost of the excavation and service. 
3.  If a customer has no curb cleanout, any blockage in the service line between the dwelling and the main shall be considered the responsibility of the customer. 
N.  Policy on Missing or Damaged Curb Cleanout Caps. When the township inspection indicates that a sewer cap is missing or damaged, the customer will be notified that the cap must be repaired or replaced within seven days. After that time period, the township will replace or repair the cleanout cap and the customer will be charged for parts and service. 
O.  Unauthorized Connection. No unauthorized person shall uncover, make any connection with or opening into, use, alter or disturb any public sewer, service lateral or appurtenance thereof without first obtaining a written permit from the township. 
P.  Construction Safeguards. All excavations for service lateral installation shall be adequately guarded with barricades and lights so as to protect the public from hazard. Streets, sidewalks, parkways and other public property disturbed in the course of the work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the township.

A.  Submission of Application. Five copies of the application and accompanying documents shall be filed with the township clerk, and the fee shall be paid to the township treasurer, who shall issue a receipt therefor and indicate the amount of fee deposited on each copy of the application in a space provided for such purpose on the application form. The township clerk shall file the original application form, with the time and date of filing marked thereon, and promptly refer and forward one copy each of the application to the township engineer, Gloucester County soil conservation district and the township environmental committee or commission, if one is established, for their investigation, report and recommendation, and deliver the remaining copy of the application to the township committee for action at the next regular meeting. 
B.  Report of Township Engineer. The township engineer shall make a report to the committee concerning the application, indicating among other pertinent information: 
1.  Whether the proposed operation will result in any sharp declivities, pits or depressions, soil erosion, flooding, fertility problems, drainage or sewerage problems, or other dangerous conditions regarding the permit to be issued, as well as areas shown on the map, if any, where excavation should not be permitted because of adverse effects on abutting property or roads; 
2.  Changes, if any, in permitted contours and slopes to be accomplished by proposed removal; 
3.  Area from which topsoil may be stripped before replacement thereof to permit soil removal, with consideration being given to the number of yards to be removed and the duration of the requested permit; 
4.  Capacity of the public roads used for ingress and egress to withstand damage from the proposed operation; 
5.  Other recommended considerations and conditions to protect the public welfare or adjoining properties, roads and streams. 
C.  Notice of Hearing. 
1.  Within ten (10) days of the receipt of the above-required reports and recommendations, the township clerk shall notify the applicant of the time, place and date of a public hearing to be conducted by the committee upon the application. Such public hearing shall be held not less than sixteen (16) days nor more than sixty (60) days from the date of the issuance of notice to the applicant by the township clerk. 
2.  In the event of such hearing, the applicant shall be required to serve notice of the application and the time, place and date of the hearing to all property owners, as indicated on the Tax Map of East Greenwich Township, who are within two hundred (200) feet of the outside boundaries of the premises from which soil is to be removed or excavations conducted thereon and for which a permit is sought. Such notice shall be served personally upon the property owners or by certified mail, return receipt requested, not less than ten (10) days prior to the date on which the hearing is to be held, and the applicant shall submit, at the time of hearing, proof of service of such notice to property owners in affidavit form. 
3.  Also, in the event of such hearing, the township clerk shall cause public notice of the application and the time, place and date of public hearing to be published in the legal newspaper of the township at least seven days prior to the date of the hearing. The publication shall also indicate the premises for which the permit is sought by plate, block and lot number, as well as by a street address or general location. 
D.  Public Hearing-Approval or Disapproval. At the public hearing, the committee may receive testimony and further evidence from the applicant, any interested persons, and reports from any township officials relevant to the application and the issuance of a permit. 
    In considering and reviewing the application and in arriving at its decision, the committee shall be guided and take into consideration the reports and evidence introduced at the public hearing and the effect of the issuance of the permit on the public health, safety and general welfare and particularly, but not in limitation thereof, the following factors: 
1.  Soil erosion by water and wind; 
2.  Drainage or sewerage problems; 
3.  Soil fertility; 
4.  Lateral support slopes and grades of abutting roads and lands; 
5.  Land value and uses; 
6.  Such other factors as may bear upon or relate to the coordinated, adjusted and harmonious physical development of the township and any environmental impact thereon. 
    If the committee is of the opinion and determines that the proposed excavations or soil removal will not have an adverse effect on the above considerations and will not create conditions inimical to the public health, safety and welfare and will not result in the creation of any sharp declivities, pits, depressions, soil erosion or fertility problems, depressed land values, or create any drainage or sewerage problems or other conditions of danger to life, personal safety or property, then the committee shall by resolution approve the application and accompanying documents subject to such reasonable conditions or restrictions designed to meet the engineering recommendations or other adverse objections to the application or proposed excavations or soil removal as the committee may impose. If any application is so approved by the committee and the applicant complies with other provisions of this chapter, then the township clerk, within five days thereafter, shall issue a permit in accordance with such approval and, pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. If the application is not approved by the committee, then the township clerk, within five days of such determination, shall notify the applicant in writing of such denial together with the reasons therefor. 
E.  Approval by Gloucester County Soil Conservation District Required. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, it shall be a condition precedent to the approval of any application or the issuance of any permit under this chapter that an application for soil removal be first filed with the Gloucester County soil conservation district and that the Gloucester County soil conservation district approve such soil removal. 
F.  Bond. After the committee approves an application but before a permit is issued by the township clerk and any work for which a permit is required under the provisions of this chapter is done, the applicant shall file and maintain a bond during the period covered by such permit. Such bond in substance and form shall be acceptable to the township solicitor and in such amount as in the opinion of the engineer will be sufficient to insure the faithful performance of the work to be undertaken, pursuant to the conditions of the permit and the provisions of this chapter. In no event will the filing of a bond be deemed to be approval of a permit required hereunder. 
G.  Issuance of Permits-Term. The permit shall be on a form prescribed by the committee. It shall be dated as of the date it is actually issued by the township clerk and shall be signed by the mayor. The term of the permit shall not exceed one year. All permits shall automatically terminate on the expiration date unless application for renewal has been made in writing; the committee may extend such permit by resolution for additional one-year periods. No public hearing shall be required upon such an extension, unless the committee determines that further investigation or information is desirable in the interest of public health, safety, and welfare. 
H.  Permit Nontransferable. No permit shall be transferable from the applicant to whom the permit is issued to any other person or persons. 
(Prior code § 8-3) 
15.28.050 - Regulations.

Chapter 15.32 - FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION CODE 

15.32.010 - Short title. 
    This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "East Greenwich Township Flood Damage Prevention Code of 1982." 
(Prior code § 16-1) 
15.32.020 - General provisions. 
A.  Application. This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazards within the jurisdiction of the township. 
B.  Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed: 
1.  To protect human life and health; 
2.  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
3.  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
4.  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
5.  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard; 
6.  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the second use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas; 
7.  To insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; 
8.  To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions. 
C.  Interpretation 
1.  In interpreting and applying the provisions of this chapter, they shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of the public health, safety, comfort, convenience and general welfare. Where the provisions of this chapter impose greater restrictions than those of any statute, other ordinance or regulation, the provisions of this chapter shall be controlling. Where the provisions of any statute, other ordinance or regulation impose greater restrictions than this chapter, the provisions of such statute, other ordinance or regulations shall be controlling. 
2.  This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and any other ordinance, easement, covenant or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. 
D.  Reducing Flood Losses. In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and provisions for: 
1.  Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety. and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities; 
2.  Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
3.  Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood waters; 
4.  Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; 
5.  Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. 
E.  Special Flood Hazard Areas Established. The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Insurance Administration in a scientific and engineering report entitled "Flood Insurance Study-Township of East Greenwich, New Jersey," dated June 1982, with accompanying flood insurance rate maps (FIRM) and flood boundary-floodway maps is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. The flood insurance study is on file at the Municipal Building, Cohawkin Road, Clarksboro, New Jersey. 
F.  Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the area of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the township, and officer or employee thereof or the Federal Insurance Administration, for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
(Prior code § 16-2) 
15.32.030 - Definitions. 
    Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application. 
    "Appeal" means a request for a review of the planning board's interpretation of any provisions of this chapter or a request for a variance. 
    "Area of shallow flooding" means a designated AO Zone on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). The base flood depths range from one to three feet; a clearly defined channel does not exist; the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; and, velocity flow may be evident. 
    "Area of special flood hazard" means the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one-percent or greater change of flooding in any given year. 
    "Base flood" means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
    "Basement" means any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides. 
    "Breakaway wall" means a wall that is not part of the structural support of the building and is intended, through its design and construction, to collapse under specific lateral loading forces without causing damage to the elevated portion of the building or supporting foundation system. 
    "Development" means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings and other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations located within the area of special flood hazard. 
    "Elevated building" means a non-basement building: 
1.  Built, in the case of a building in an area of special flood hazard, to have the top of the elevated floor, or in the case of a building in a coastal high hazard, to have the bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the elevated floor elevated above the ground level by means of pilings, columns (post and piers), or shear walls parallel to the flow of water and 
2.  Adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a flood of up to the magnitude of the base flood in an area of special hazard. 
    "Elevated building" also includes a building elevated by means of fill or solid foundation perimeter walls with openings to facilitate the unimpeded movement of flood waters. In areas of coastal high hazard, "elevated building" also includes a building otherwise meeting the definition of "elevated building" even though the lower area is enclosed by means of breakaway walls. 
    "Flood" or "flooding" means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
1.  The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and/or 
2.  The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. 
    "Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)" means the official map on which the Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
    "Flood Insurance Study" means the official report provided in which the Federal Insurance Administration has provided flood profiles, as well as the Flood Boundary-Floodway Map and the water surface elevation of the base flood. 
    "Floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than 0.2 feet. 
    "Lower floor of the lowest enclosed area" means an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, including basement, usable solely for the parking of vehicles. Building access or storage in an area other than a basement is not considered a building's lowest floor, providing that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of other applicable nonelevation design requirements. 
    "Manufactured home" means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without permanent foundation, when connected to the required utilities. For floodplain management purposes, the term "manufactured home" also includes parked trailers, travel trailers and other similar vehicles placed on a site for longer than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days. For insurance purposes, the term "manufactured home" does not include parked trailers, travel trailers and other similar vehicles. 
    "Manufactured home park" or "manufactured home subdivision" means a parcel or contiguous parcels of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.

    "Start of construction," for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act, P.L. 97-348, but including substantial improvements, means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, replacement or other improvement is within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The "actual start" means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of a slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling, nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footing, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not as part of the main structure. 
    "Structure" means a walled and roofed building, a manufactured home, or a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground. 
    "Substantial improvement" means any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a structure the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure either: 
1.  Before the improvement or repair is started, or 
2.  If the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred. 
    For the purposes of this definition, substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term, however, does not include either:

(Prior code § 16-3) 
15.32.040 - Administration. 
A.  Implementation by Planning Board. The planning board is appointed to administer and implement this chapter by granting or denying development permit applications in accordance with its provisions. 
B.  Duties and Responsibilities. Duties of the planning board shall include, but not be limited to: 
1.  Permit Review. 
a.  Review all development permits to determine that the permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied; 
b.  Review all development permits to determine that all necessary permits have been obtained from those federal, state or local governmental agencies from which prior approval is required; 
c.  Review all development permits to determine if the proposed development is located in the floodway. If located in the floodway, assure that the encroachment provisions of Section 15.32.060 are satisfied. 
2.  Use of Other Base Flood Data. When base flood elevation and floodway data have not been provided in accordance with Section 15.32.020(E), the planning board shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state or other source, in order to administer Section 15.32.060(B)(1) and (2). 
3.  Information to be Obtained. 
a.  Obtain and record the actual elevation, in relation to mean sea level, of the lowest habitable floor, including basement, of all new or substantially improved structures, and whether or not the structure contains a basement; 
b.  For all new substantially improved floodproofed structures: 
i.  Verify and record the actual elevation, in relation to mean sea level, and 
ii.  Maintain the floodproofing certifications required in Section 15.32.060(B), 
c.  Maintain for public inspection all records pertaining to the provisions of this chapter. 
4.  Alteration of Watercourses. Notify adjacent communities and the New Jersey State Department of Environmental Protection prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Insurance Administration. 
    Require that maintenance is provided within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that the flood carrying capacity is not diminished. 
5.  Interpretation of FIRM Boundaries. Make interpretations where needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazards (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions). 
    In cases of uncertainty as to the exact limit of the floodway or flood hazard area in a proposed development, the township engineer may, upon the application and with the consent of the landowner, and at the expense of the landowner, determine the precise location of a floodway or flood hazard area limit by close inspection, field survey or other appropriate methods, and cause the same to be marked on the ground, notifying the landowner, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, the building inspector and the planning board of the results thereof. The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in Section 15.32.050. 
C.  Development Permits. A development permit shall be obtained before construction or development begins within any area of special flood hazard. Application for a development permit shall be made on forms furnished by the building inspector and may include, but not be limited to; plans in triplicate drawn to scale showing the nature, location, dimensions, and elevations of the area in question; existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage facilities, and the location of the foregoing. Specifically, the following information is required: 
1.  Elevation in relation to mean sea level, of the lowest floor (including basement) of all structures; 
2.  Elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any structure has been floodproofed; 
3.  Certification by a registered professional engineer or architect that the floodproofing methods for any nonresidential structure meet the floodproofing criteria in Section 15.32.060 (B)(2). 
4.  Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development. 
D.  Procedure. The following procedure shall govern the issuance of such permits as required by the provisions of subsection C of this section. 
1.  The property owner shall apply to the building inspector for approval of development plans, which shall be submitted with the application. Such plans shall include a true and accurate plot plan, submitted in triplicate, drawn to a scale of not less than one inch equals one hundred (100) feet, with contour lines at intervals of not more than two feet, showing the exact size, shape, location and elevation of existing and proposed building and structures and of any proposed fill or regrading; the exact dimensions and acreage of each lot or plot to be built upon or otherwise used; the location of the floodway and flood hazard area limits; the location, layout and elevation of existing and proposed parking areas; driveway drainage, sewer and water facilities and connections, plantings, seedings, screenings, fences, signs, streets and curbings; and such other information as shall be reasonably required for an evaluation of the effect of the development upon flood control. 
2.  The building inspector shall, within thirty (30) days after receiving the application, forward the same and the development plans submitted therewith, together with his or her written report thereon, to the planning board for review. The written report of the building inspector shall state whether or not the application complies with the provisions of Chapters 16.56 through 16.86, Zoning; if not, the report shall specify, and the building inspector shall specify and notify the applicant in writing of the respects in which it does not comply. Neither the failure of the building inspector so to notify the applicant, nor the omission of any zoning noncompliance from such notification, shall relieve the applicant from the requirements of Chapters 16.56 through 16.86, Zoning. If it is indicated that any variance is needed from the provisions of Chapters 16.56 through 16.86, Zoning, the planning board shall nevertheless review the application as hereinafter provided, but approval hereof by the planning board shall not relieve the applicant from complying with the provisions of Chapters 16.56 through 16.86, Zoning, nor shall it constitute a recommendation of any zoning variance that the applicant may thereafter seek from the planning board. 
3.  The planning board shall review the applications, and after giving the applicant an opportunity to appear and be heard with respect thereto, shall approve or disapprove the same being guided in its action by the standards set forth in Section 15.32.060. Approval may be conditional upon the applicant's adoption of specified changes, and as to applications for developments in the floodway, and approval of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. The board shall state its findings and reasons for its action in writing, and a copy thereof shall be given to the applicant. 
4.  If the application shall be approved, the building inspector shall issue a permit for the development in accordance with such approval, but such permit shall not relieve the applicant from complying with such other laws and ordinances as shall be applicable. 
5.  If the planning board shall fail to take final action within sixty (60) days after the date of the submission of the application to the planning board, or within such further time as shall have been agreed to by the applicant, the application shall be deemed to have been denied. 
6.  If any person shall be aggrieved by the action of the planning board, appeal in writing to the mayor and township committee may be taken within ten (10) days after the date of such action. The mayor and township committee shall fix and notify the appellant of a time and place for a public hearing on an appeal, and the appellant shall cause notice of such hearing to be published in a newspaper circulating in the township at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing. All parties of interest shall be afforded an opportunity to be heard. After such hearing, the mayor and township committee will affirm or reverse the action of the planning board, and state its findings and reasons for its actions, and a written copy of such action shall be given to the appellant. 
(Ord. 29-2001; prior code § 16-4) 
15.32.050 - Variances. 
A.  Procedure. 
1.  The planning board as established by the township committee shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter. 
2.  The planning board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirements, decision, or determination made by the building inspector in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. 
3.  Those aggrieved by the decision of the planning board, or any taxpayer, may appeal such decision to the mayor and township committee. 
4.  In passing upon such applications, the planning board shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and; 
a.  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
b.  The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
c.  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
d.  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
e.  The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
f.  The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage; 
g.  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
h.  The relationship of the proposed use with the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program of that area; 
i.  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
j.  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and 
k.  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges. 
5.  Upon consideration of the factors of subsection (A)(4) of this section and the purposes of this chapter, the planning board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter. 
6.  The planning board shall maintain the records of all appeal actions, including technical information, and report any variances to the Federal Insurance Administration upon request. 
B.  Conditions. 
1.  Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing the provisions of subsection (A)(4) of this section have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
2.  Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the New Jersey Register of Historic Places without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this section. 
3.  Variances shall not be issued without any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
4.  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
5.  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
a.  A showing of good and sufficient cause; 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and 
c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud or on victimization of the public as identified in subsection (A)(4) or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
6.  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.

(Prior code § 16-8) 
Chapter 15.36 - AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT FEE 

15.36.0110 - Purpose. 
A.  In Holmdel Builder's Association v. Holmdel Township, 121 N.J. 550 (1990), the New Jersey Supreme Court determined that mandatory development fees are authorized by the Fair Housing Act of 1985, NJSA 52:27d-301 et seq., and the State Constitution, subject to the rules adopted by the New Jersey Council on Affordable Housing's (COAH). 
B.  Pursuant to P.L. 2008, c.46 section 8 (C. 52:27D-329.2) and the Statewide Non-Residential Development Fee Act (C. 40:55D-8.1 through 8.7), COAH is authorized to adopt and promulgate regulations necessary for the establishment, implementation, review, monitoring and enforcement of municipal affordable housing trust funds and corresponding spending plans. Municipalities that are under the jurisdiction of the council or court of competent jurisdiction and have an approved spending plan may retain fees collected from non-residential development. 
C.  This chapter establishes standards for the collection, maintenance, and expenditure of development fees pursuant to COAH's regulations and in accordance with P.L. 2008, c.46, sections 8 and 32-38. Fees collected pursuant to this chapter shall be used for the sole purpose of providing low- and moderate-income housing. This chapter shall be interpreted within the framework of COAH's rules on development fees, codified at N.J.A.C. 5:97-8. 
(Ord. 29-2008, § 1) 
15.36.020 - Basic requirements. 
A.  The township shall not impose development fees on any applicant pursuant to this chapter until COAH or a court has approved the development fee ordinance pursuant to N.J.A.C. 5:96-5.1., except that residential fees may be collected pursuant to the previously approved fee ordinance until such time as this chapter takes effect, and nonresidential fees shall be collected in accordance with the Statewide Non-Residential Development Fee Act, NJSA 40:55D-8.1 et seq. 
B.  The township shall not spend development fees until COAH or a court has approved a plan for spending such fees in conformance with N.J.A.C. 5:97-8.10 and N.J.A.C. 5:96-5.3. 
(Ord. 29-2008, § 2) 
15.36.030 - Definitions. 
    The following terms, as used in this ordinance, shall have the following meanings: 
    "Affordable housing development" means a development included in the housing element and fair share plan, and includes, but is not limited to, an inclusionary development, a municipal construction project, or a one hundred (100) percent affordable development. 
    "COAH" or "the council" means the New Jersey Council on Affordable Housing established under the Act which has primary jurisdiction for the administration of housing obligations in accordance with sound regional planning considerations in the state. 
    "Development fee" means money paid by a developer for the improvement of property as permitted under N.J.A.C. 5:97-8.3. 
    "Developer" means the legal or beneficial owner or owners of a lot or of any land proposed to be included in a proposed development, including the holder of an option or contract to purchase, or other person having an enforceable proprietary interest in such land. 
    "Equalized assessed value" means the assessed value of a property divided by the current average ratio of assessed to true value for the municipality in which the property is situated, as determined in accordance with sections 1, 5, and 6 of P.L. 1973, c.123 (C. 54:1-35a through C. 54:1-35c). 
    "Green building strategies" means those strategies that minimize the impact of development on the environment and enhance health, safety and well-being of residents by producing durable, low-maintenance, resource-efficient housing while making optimum use of existing infrastructure and community services. 
(Ord. 29-2008, § 3) 
15.36.40 - Residential development fees. 
A.  Imposed Fees. 
1.  Within all zoning districts in the township, residential developers, except for developers of the types of development specifically exempted below, shall pay a fee of one and one-half percent of the equalized assessed value for residential development, provided no increased density is permitted. 
2.  When an increase in residential density pursuant to NJSA 40:55D-70d(5) (known as a "d" variance) has been permitted, developers shall be required to pay a development fee of six percent of the equalized assessed value (EAV) for each additional unit above that permitted by right which may be realized. However, if the zoning on a site has changed during the two-year period preceding the filing of such a variance application, the base density for the purposes of calculating the bonus development fee shall be the highest density permitted by right during the two-year period preceding the filing of the variance application. 
    Example: If an approval allows four units to be constructed on a site that was zoned for two units, the fees could equal one and one-half percent of the equalized assessed value on the first two units; and the specified higher percentage up to six percent of the equalized assessed value for the two additional units, provided zoning on the site has not changed during the two-year period preceding the filing of such a variance application. 
B.  Eligible Exactions, Ineligible Exactions and Exemptions for Residential Development. 
1.  Affordable housing developments and developments where the developer has made a payment in lieu of on-site construction of affordable units shall be exempt from development fees. 
2.  Developments that have received preliminary or final site plan approval prior to the adoption of a municipal development fee ordinance shall be exempt from development fees, unless the developer seeks a substantial change in the approval. Where a site plan approval does not apply, a zoning and/or building permit shall be synonymous with preliminary or final site plan approval for this purpose. The fee percentage shall be vested on the date that the building permit is issued. 
3.  Development fees shall be imposed and collected when an existing structure undergoes a change to a more intense use, is demolished and replaced, or is expanded, if the expansion is not otherwise exempt from the development fee requirement.

    It is the municipality's further intent to participate in the county-wide registration program established by Gloucester County and administered by Community Champions Corporation as a mechanism to protect neighborhoods from becoming blighted due to the lack of adequate maintenance and security vacant, abandoned and foreclosed properties. 
B.  The township committee finds, determines and declares that buildings and property which remain vacant and unoccupied for any appreciable period of time become a harborage for rodents, an invitation for illegal occupancy and for illegal activities, as well as a fire hazard, and that unkempt grounds surrounding the property invites dumping and rubbish thereon, that such buildings become dilapidated, contribute to commercial and residential blight, depress market values of surrounding property, requires additional government services, endanger the public safety and health, and generally remain detrimental to the public good. Unsupervised vacant/abandoned or foreclosed properties have a negative impact on surrounding properties and neighborhoods. Owners of such structures and property should be held accountable for the physical condition of the property. 
C.  This chapter establishes responsibilities of owners of the vacant, abandoned and or foreclosed properties and structures and provides for administration and enforcement of standards related to such property and structures. This chapter incorporates the international property maintenance code and all applicable federal, state and local building and fire codes. This chapter shall apply to all vacant, abandoned or foreclosed property and or structure within East Greenwich Township. 
D.  It is in the public interest for the township to establish minimum standards of accountability on the owners or other responsible parties of vacant abandoned and foreclosed properties in order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the residents of the township. 
E.  It is in the public interest for the township to impose a reasonable administrative fee in conjunction with registration of vacant abandoned and foreclosed properties in light of the disproportionate costs imposed on the township by the presence of these properties.

(Ord. 18-2003 § 15) 
16.04.150 - Appeals. 
A.  Notice of Appeal by Applicant. An applicant shall notify the township committee in writing of any appeal as to charges against an applicant's escrow or deposit account, with copies to the chief financial officer, the planning board, and the applicable professional acting on behalf of the township, or the planning board, against whom the appeal is being taken, whenever the applicant disputes the charges made by a professional for a service rendered to the township in reviewing applications for development, review and preparation of documents, inspection of improvements, or such other charges made pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.2. The township committee (or its designee in the case of assignment of responsibility directly to the planning board) shall, within a reasonable period of time, attempt to resolve any disputed charges. If the matter is not resolved to the satisfaction of the applicant, the applicant may appeal to the Gloucester County Construction Board of Appeals, as established pursuant to N.J.S.A. 52:27D-127, any charge to an escrow account or deposit made by an applicant, by any professional or consultant working on behalf of the township or its boards, or the cost of installation of improvements estimated by the township engineer pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.4. An applicant or his or her authorized agent shall submit the appeal in writing to the Gloucester County Construction Board of Appeals. The applicant or his or her agent shall simultaneously send a copy of the appeal to the township committee, the planning board and the professional whose charges are the subject of the appeal. An applicant shall file an appeal within forty-five (45) days from receipt of the informational copy of the professional's voucher for services rendered as required by N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.2(c), except that if the professional has not supplied the applicant with an informational copy of the voucher, then the applicant shall file his or her appeal within sixty (60) days from receipt of the township's statement of activity against the deposit or escrow account required under N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.2(c). An applicant may file an appeal for an ongoing series of charges by a professional during a period not exceeding six months, to demonstrate that they represent a pattern of excessive or inaccurate charges. An applicant making use of this provision need not appeal each charge individually, but shall provide specific evidence as to those charges that give rise to the appeal of alleged excessive or inaccurate charges. 
B.  Rules and Procedures. Appeals taken before the Gloucester County Construction Board of Appeals shall be taken in accordance with the rules and procedures established by said board of appeals. 
C.  Pendency of Appeals. During the pendency of any appeal, the Township of East Greenwich and its planning board, as the case may be, shall continue to process, hear and decide any application for development or to inspect a development in the normal course of such hearings or inspections, and shall not withhold, delay or deny reviews, inspections, signing of subdivision plats or site plans, the reduction or release of performance or maintenance guarantees, the issuance of construction permits or certificates of occupancy, or any other approval or permit, because an appeal has been filed or is pending under this subsection. Nothing herein, however, shall preclude the township from exercising its rights under Sections 16.04.080(B), and (C), and 16.04.090 herein, with respect to any deficiencies in an applicant's escrow or deposit account. The chief financial officer may pay charges out of the appropriate escrow account or deposit maintained on an applicant's behalf, for which an appeal has been filed. If a charge is disallowed after payment, the chief financial officer shall reimburse the deposit or escrow account in the amount of any such disallowed charge, or refund the amount directly to the applicant. If a charge is disallowed after payment to a professional or a consultant who is not an employee of the township, the professional or consultant shall reimburse the township in the amount of any such disallowed charge. 
D.  Appeal Provisions are Jurisdictional. The appeal provisions set forth herein in this section are jurisdictional, to the extent that such provisions provide for a remedy of relief of the first resort, which must be exhausted prior to any appeals to a court of law.

The officer from whom the appeal is taken shall immediately transmit to the board all of the papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. 
B.  An appeal to the board shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action in respect of which the decision appealed from was made, unless the officer from whom the appeal is taken certifies to the planning board that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed other than by a restraining order which may be granted by the planning board or by the Superior Court of New Jersey.

1.  Variances, pursuant to R.S. 40:55D-70c, from lot area, lot dimensions, setback and yard requirements,

M.  Hear and decide appeals where it is alleged by the appellant there is error in any order, requirement, decision or refusal made by an administrative officer or based on or made in the enforcement of the zoning chapter; 
N.  Hear and decide requests for interpretation of the zoning map or zoning chapter, or for decisions upon other special questions upon which such board is authorized to pass, in accordance with R.S. 40:55D-1, et seq.; 
O.  Where: 
1.  By reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness or shape of a specific piece of property, 
2.  By reason of exceptional topographic conditions or physical features uniquely affecting a specific piece of property, or 
3.  By reason of an extraordinary and exceptional situation uniquely affecting a specific piece of property or the structures lawfully existing thereon; the strict application of any regulation pursuant to Chapters 16.56 through 16.86, Zoning, would result in peculiar and exceptional practical difficulties to, or exceptional and undue hardship upon, the developer of such property, grant, upon an application or an appeal relating to such property, a variance from such strict application of such regulation so as to relieve such difficulties or hardship. 
    Where, in an application or appeal relating to a specific piece of property, the purposes of Chapters 16.56 through 16.86, Zoning, would be advanced by a deviation from the zoning ordinance requirements and the benefits of the deviation would substantially outweigh any detriment, grant a variance to allow departure from such regulations; provided, however, that no variance from those departures enumerated in subsection P of this section, shall be granted under this paragraph; and provided further, that the proposed development does not require approval by the planning board of a subdivision, site plan or conditional use, in conjunction with which the planning board has power to review a request for a variance pursuant to R.S. 40:55D-47a and subsection H of this section; 
P.  In particular cases and for special reasons, grant a variance to allow departure from regulations pursuant to R.S. 40:55D-62 through 68 to permit: 
1.  A use or principal structure in a district restricted against such use or principal structure, 
2.  An expansion of a nonconforming use, 
3.  Deviation from a specification or standard pursuant to R.S. 40:55D-67 pertaining solely to a conditional use, 
4.  An increase in the permitted floor area ratio as defined in R.S. 40:55D-4,

    A variance under this subsection shall be granted only by affirmative vote of at least five members. 
    No variance or other relief may be granted under the terms of this chapter unless such variance or other relief can be granted without substantial detriment to the public good and will not substantially impair the intent and the purpose of the zone plan and zoning chapters. In respect of any airport hazard areas delineated under the Air Safety and Hazardous Zoning Act of 1983, R.S. 6:1-80, et seq., no variance or other relief may be granted under the terms of this chapter permitting the creation or establishment of a nonconforming use which would be prohibited under the standards promulgated pursuant to that act except upon issuance of a permit by the commissioner of transportation. An application under this chapter may be referred to any appropriate person or agency for its report; provided that such reference shall not extend the period of time within which the planning board shall act; 
Q.  Direct the issuance of a permit pursuant to R.S. 40:55D-34, for a building or structure in the bed of a mapped street or public drainageway or flood control basin or public area reserved on the official map; 
R.  Direct issuance of a permit pursuant to R.S. 40:55D-35 for a building or structure on a lot not abutting a street;

    No variance or other relief may be granted under the provisions of subsections M through P of this section unless such variance or other relief can be granted without substantial detriment to the public good and shall not substantially impair the intent and purpose of the zone plan and zoning ordinance. 
    The developer may elect to submit a separate application requesting approval of the variance and a subsequent application for any required approval of a subdivision site plan or conditional use. The separate approval of the variance shall be conditioned upon grant of all required subsequent approvals by the planning board. No such subsequent approval shall be granted unless such approval can be granted without substantial detriment to the public good and without substantial impairment of the intent and purpose of the zone plan and the zoning ordinance. The number of votes of board members required to grant any such subsequent approval shall be as otherwise provided in the Municipal Land Use Law, R.S. 40:550-1, et seq., for the approval in question. Any application under any provision of this section may be referred to any appropriate person or agency for its report; provided, that such reference shall not extend the period of time within which the planning board shall act.

A.  Findings of Fact and Conclusions. The board shall include findings of fact and conclusions based thereon in each decision on any application for development and shall reduce the decision to writing. 
    Failure of a motion to receive the number of votes required to approve an application for development pursuant to the exceptional vote requirements of R.S. 40:55 D-34 or Section 16.08.070(D) or 16.10.070(D) shall be deemed an action denying the application. 
    The board shall provide the findings and conclusions through: 
1.  A resolution adopted at a meeting held within the time period provided in the act for action by the board on the application for development; or 
2.  A memorializing resolution adopted at a meeting held not later than forty-five (45) days after the date of the meeting at which the board voted to grant or deny approval. Only the members of the board who voted for the action taken may vote on the memorializing resolution, and the vote of a majority of such members present at the meeting at which the resolution is presented for adoption shall be sufficient to adopt the resolution. An action pursuant to R.S. 40:55D-9, resulting from the failure of a motion to approve an application, shall be memorialized by resolution as provided above, with those members voting against the motion for approval being the members eligible to vote on the memorializing resolution. The vote on any such resolution shall be deemed to be a memorialization of the action of the board and not to be an action of the board. However, the date of the adoption of the resolution shall constitute the date of the decision for purposes of the mailings, filings and publications required by R.S. 40:55D-10. If the board fails to adopt a resolution or memorializing resolution as hereinabove specified, any interested party may apply to the Superior Court in a summary manner for an order compelling the board to reduce its findings and conclusions to writing within a stated time, and the cost of the application, including attorney's fees, shall be assessed against the township. 
B.  Mailing. A copy of the decision shall be mailed by the board within ten (10) days of the date of the decision to the applicant, or if represented, then to his or her attorney, without separate charge. A copy of the decision shall also be mailed to all persons who have requested it and who have paid the fee prescribed by the board for such service. A copy of the decision shall also be filed in the office of the township clerk, who shall make a copy of such filed decision available to any interested party upon the payment of a fee calculated in the same manner as those established for copies of other public documents in the township. 
(Prior code § 12-9.8) 
16.12.090 - Publication of decisions. 
    A brief notice of every final decision shall be published in the official newspaper of the township. Such publication shall be arranged by the secretary of the planning board the cost to be paid by the applicant. Such notice shall be sent to the official newspaper for publication within ten (10) days of the date of such decision.

(Ord. 7-2002 (part)) 
16.14.060 - Guarantees required-Surety-Release. 
A.  Before the recording of final subdivision plats, or as a condition of final site plan approval, or as a condition of the issuance of a zoning permit pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-65, the planning board of adjustment (hereinafter, either separately or together, the "board" or the "approving authority") shall require and accept, in accordance with the standards as contained herein and for the purpose of assuring the installation and maintenance of any required on-tract and/or off-tract improvements, the furnishing of a performance and/or maintenance guarantee(s). No plans will be signed by the township clerk until and unless the required performance guarantee has been approved by the township's attorney and engineer. Any such performance guarantee required by the board shall be furnished in favor of the township in an amount not to exceed one hundred and twenty (120) percent of the costs of installation, which cost shall be determined by the Township Engineer according to the method of calculation set forth in the Municipal Land Use Law, specifically N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.4, et seq., for certain improvements which the board may deem necessary or appropriate. These improvements may include, but shall not be limited to: streets, grading, pavement, gutters, curbs, sidewalks, street lighting, shade trees, surveyor's monuments, as shown on the final map and as required by the "Map Filing Law" (N.J.S.A. 46:23-9.9 et seq.), water mains, culverts, storm sewers, sanitary sewers or other means of sewage disposal, drainage structures, erosion control and sedimentation control devices, public improvements of open space and, in the case of site plans only, other on-site improvements and landscaping. 
1.  Form of Guarantee. The performance and/or maintenance guarantee shall be made payable to, and be deposited with, "East Greenwich Township", and shall be in the form of cash, irrevocable letter of credit, certified check, of performance bond in which the owner shall be the principal. The bond or letter of credit, if such is to be provided, must be issued by an acceptable surety or banking company licensed to do business in the state of New Jersey. The township shall issue its receipt for such deposits and shall cause the same to be deposited in the name of the township to be retained as security for completion of all requirements and to be returned to the owner on completion of all required work or, in the event of a default on the part of the owner, to be used by the township to pay the costs and expenses of obtaining completion of all requirements, as are further set forth herein. 
2.  Guarantees are Unconditional. The performance guarantee or maintenance guarantee required herein must constitute an unconditional payment obligation of the issuer running solely to the township. The performance guarantee must provide that it will remain in full force and effect, and shall not be terminated until it is released by the township. The developer may submit an irrevocable letter of credit as a performance guarantee as long as it provides for an initial one-year term and its automatic renewal for a period of at least one year at the expiration of its initial term. Such letter of credit will further provide that it will thereafter be automatically renewed by the surety until released by the township or until the surety provides not more than ninety (90) days, nor less than sixty (60) days, a notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, or express mail, to the township clerk, that it wishes to terminate its letter of credit as provided for herein. In the event the surety gives notice that it wishes to terminate its letter of credit, the township, at its discretion, may draw down and call upon the full amount of the guarantee by way of a signed demand executed by the mayor and township attorney, even if the development is still progressing in accordance with the underlying approval. At any time prior to thirty (30) days of expiration or termination of the guarantee, the developer may submit a replacement surety to the township pursuant to these provisions to prevent the township from automatically drawing upon or calling the letter of credit for any remaining improvements. 
B.  Cost Estimates of Improvements. The township engineer shall prepare an itemized cost estimate of the improvements covered by the performance guarantee, which itemized cost estimate shall be appended to each performance guarantee posted by the obligor. 
C.  Further Provisions. Provision for a maintenance guarantee to be posted with the township committee for a period not to exceed two years after final acceptance of the improvement, in an amount not to exceed fifteen (15) percent of the cost of the improvement, which cost shall be determined by the township engineer according to the method of calculation set forth in N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.4. In the event that other governmental agencies or public utilities automatically will own the utilities to be installed, or the improvements are covered by a performance or maintenance guarantee to another governmental agency, no performance or maintenance guarantee, as the case may be, shall be required by the municipality or such utilities or improvements. 
D.  Time for Improvements to be Completed. All on-tract and/or off-tract improvements, as required, shall be completed by either (a) eighteen (18) months after construction has begun on the development in question or (b) at such time as one-half of the certificates of occupancy have been issued in said development, whichever comes first. If the development is to take place in phases or stages, then the same shall apply to each phase or stage, once construction has begun on the same. In the event that any or all off-tract and/or on-tract improvements are common to all phases or stages, and are specific to no single phase or stage, then all such on-tract and off-tract improvements shall be completed once one-half of the certificates of occupancy have been issued for the entire development, regardless of the phases or stages begun or completed. The time allowed for installation of the improvements for which the performance guarantee has been provided, may be extended by resolution of the township committee. As a condition or as a part of any such extension, the amount of any performance guarantee shall be increased or reduced, as the case may be, to an amount not to exceed one hundred twenty (120) percent of the cost of the installation, which cost shall be determined by the township engineer according to the method of calculation set forth in N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.4 as of the time of the passage of the resolution. 
E.  Non-completion. If the required improvements are not completed or corrected in accordance with the performance guarantee, the obligor and surety, if any, shall be liable thereon to the township for the reasonable cost of the improvements not completed or corrected and the township may either-prior to or after the receipt of the proceeds thereof-complete such improvements. Such completion or correction of improvements shall be subject to the public bidding requirements of the "Local Public Contracts Law" (N.J.S.A. 40A: 11 -1 et seq.). 
1.  In no case shall any paving work be done without permission from the township engineer. At least two working days' notice shall be given to the Township Engineer, or a qualified representative, so that either may be present at the time that the work is to be completed. 
2.  Streets should not be paved with a wearing course until all heavy construction has been completed. Shade trees shall not be planted until all grading and earthmoving is completed. The seeding of grass and the placing of surveyor's monuments shall be among the last operations. Where berming and/or natural screening is to take place as a buffer due to the development being along either a township, county or state road or highway, and said berming or natural screening is to have trees or other forms of vegetation, such an improvement shall be among the first to take place in the development and shall be completed prior to the issuance of the first certificate of occupancy, and all such trees or other forms of required vegetation shall be fertilized and sprinklerized in a manner to be approved by the township's planner, so as to insure both the survivability of said trees or vegetation and to insure the rapid growth of the same. 
3.  The township engineer shall be notified prior to each of the following phases of work so that he or she, or a qualified representative, may inspect the following work (which list shall be neither exclusive nor exhaustive): 
a.  Road subgrade; 
b.  Curb and gutter forms; 
c.  Road paving; 
d.  Sidewalk forms; 
e.  Sidewalks; 
f.  Drainage pipes and other drainage construction; 
g.  Street name signs; 
h.  Monuments; 
i.  Fire hydrants; 
j.  Water facilities; 
k.  Sanitary sewers; 
l.  Detention and/or retention basins; 
m.  Topsoil, seeding and planting; 
n.  Underground utilities; 
o.  Recreational and open space amenities; 
p.  Buffering amenities; 
4.  Any improvement installed without notice for inspection having been given pursuant to subsection (3) of this section immediately above, shall constitute just cause for: 
a.  Removal of the uninspected improvement at the developer's expense; 
b.  Payment by the developer of any costs for materials testing; 
c.  Restoration by the developer of any improvements disturbed during any material testing; and/or 
d.  Issuance of a stop work order by the township engineer pending the resolution of any dispute. 
5.  Inspection by the township of the installation of improvements and utilities shall not operate to subject the township to liability for claims, suits or liability of any kind that may arise because of defects or negligence during construction, or at any time thereafter. It shall be the responsibility of the developer, and any contractors or subcontractors acting under his authority or control, to maintain safe conditions at all times during construction. 
F.  Upon substantial completion of all required street improvements (except for the top course) and appurtenant utility improvements, and the connection of the same to the public system, the obligor may request of the township committee in writing, by certified mail, return receipt requested, and in care of the township clerk, that the township engineer prepare, in accordance with the itemized cost estimate prepared by the township engineer and appended to the performance guarantee as hereinbefore set forth, a list of all uncompleted, or unsatisfactorily completed, improvements. If such a request is made, the obligor shall send a copy of the request to the township engineer. The request shall indicate which improvements have been completed and which improvements remain uncompleted in the judgment of the obligor. Thereupon the township engineer shall inspect all improvements covered by the obligor's request and shall file a detailed list and report, in writing, with the township committee, and shall simultaneously send a copy thereof to the obligor not later than forty-five (45) days after receipt of the obligor's request. 
G.  The list prepared by the township engineer shall state, in detail, with respect to each improvement determined to be incomplete, or unsatisfactorily completed, the nature and extent of the incompleteness of each incomplete improvement, or the nature and extent of, and remedy for, the unsatisfactory state and nature of each improvement deemed to have been unsatisfactorily completed. The report prepared by the township engineer shall identify each improvement determined to be complete and satisfactory, together with a recommendation as to the amount of reduction to be made in the performance guarantee relating to the completed and satisfactory improvement in accordance with the itemized cost estimate prepared by the township engineer and appended to the performance guarantee as required and set forth herein. 
H.  The township committee, by resolution, shall either approve the improvements determined to be complete and satisfactory by the township engineer, or reject some or all of these improvements upon establishment in the resolution of the reason for such rejection, and shall approve and authorize the amount of reduction to be made in the performance guarantee relating to the improvements accepted, in accordance with the itemized cost estimate prepared by the township engineer and appended to the performance guarantee as set forth and required herein. This resolution shall be adopted not later than forty-five (45) days after receipt of the list and report prepared by the township engineer. Upon adoption of the resolution by the township committee, the obligor shall be released from all liability pursuant to its performance guarantee with respect to the approved improvements, except for that portion adequately sufficient to secure completion or correction of the improvements not yet approved; provided that thirty (30) percent of the amount of the total performance guarantee posted may be retained to ensure completion and acceptability of all improvements. 
I.  For the purpose of releasing the obligor from liability pursuant to its performance guarantee, the amount of the performance guarantee attributable to each approved improvement shall be reduced by the total amount for each such improvement, in accordance with the itemized costs estimate prepared by the township engineer and appended to the performance guarantee as previously set forth herein, including any contingency factor applied to the cost of installation. If the sum of the approved improvements would exceed seventy (70) percent of the total amount of the performance guarantee, then the township may retain thirty (30) percent of the amount of the total performance guarantee to ensure completion and acceptability of all improvements, as previously provided for herein. 
J.  If the township engineer fails to send or provide the list and report as requested by the obligor and pursuant to the requirements as herein set forth, within forty-five (45) days of receipt of the request, the obligor may apply to the court in a summary manner for an order compelling the township engineer to provide the list and report within a stated time and the cost of applying to the court, including reasonable attorney's fees, may be awarded to the prevailing party. 
K.  If the township committee fails to either approve or reject the improvements determined by the township engineer to be complete and satisfactory, or reduce the performance guarantee for the complete and satisfactory improvements within forty-five (45) days from the receipt of the township engineer's list and report, the obligor may apply to the court in a summary manner for an order compelling, within a stated time, approval of the complete and satisfactory improvements and approval of a reduction in the performance guarantee for the approvable complete and satisfactory improvements in accordance with the itemized cost estimate prepared by the township engineer and appended to the performance guarantee as set forth hereinbefore, and the cost of applying to the court, including reasonable attorney's fees, may be awarded to the prevailing party. 
L.  In the event that the obligor has made a cash deposit with the township or approving authority as part of the performance guarantee, then any partial reduction granted in the performance guarantee pursuant to this subsection shall be applied to the cash deposit in the same proportion as the original cash deposit bears to the full amount of the performance guarantee. 
M.  If any portion of the required improvements is rejected, the approving authority may require the obligor to complete or correct such improvements and, upon completion or correction, the same procedure of notification as set forth in this section shall be followed. 
N.  Nothing herein, however, shall be construed to limit the right of the obligor to contest, by legal proceedings, any determination by the township committee of the township engineer. 
O.  The obligor shall reimburse the township for all reasonable inspection fees paid to the township engineer for the foregoing inspection of improvements; provided that the township may require of the developer a deposit for the inspection fees in an amount not to exceed, except for extraordinary circumstances, the greater of five hundred dollars ($500.00) or five percent of the cost of improvements, which cost shall be determined pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.4. For those developments for which the inspection fees are less than ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00), fees may, at the option of the developer, be paid in two installments. In any such event, the initial amount deposited by the developer shall be equal to fifty (50) percent of the inspection fees. When the balance on deposit drops to ten (10) percent of the inspection fees because the amount deposited by the developer has been reduced by the amount paid to the township engineer for inspection, the developer shall deposit the remaining fifty (50) percent of the inspection fees. For those developments for which the inspection fees are ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) or greater, fees may, at the option of the developer, be paid in four installments. The initial amount deposited by a developer shall be twenty-five (25) percent of the inspection fees. When the balance on deposit drops to ten (10) percent of the inspection fees because the amount deposited by the developer has been reduced by the amount paid to the township engineer for inspections, the developer shall make additional deposits of twenty-five (25) percent of the inspection fees. The township engineer shall not perform any inspection if sufficient funds to pay for those inspections are not on deposit. In the event that final approval is by stages or sections of development pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-38, the provisions of this section shall be applied by stage or section. In no event shall any guarantee hereunder be released or reduced if sufficient funds to pay for such inspections are not on deposit. 
P.  To the extent that any of the improvements have been dedicated to the township on the subdivision plat or site plan, the township committee shall be deemed, upon the release of any performance guarantee required pursuant to such requirements as have been hereinbefore set forth, to accept dedication for public use of streets or roads and any other improvements made thereon according to site plans and subdivision plats approved by the approving authority, provided that such improvements have been inspected and have received final approval by the township engineer. 
Q.  Standardized Form for Performance Guarantee, Maintenance Guarantee, Letter of Credit. A standardized form, and accompanying regulations, in accordance with the provisions of N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53a, -53b, N.J.A.C. 5:39-1.1 and N.J.A.C. 5:39-1.3, shall be utilized for all performance guarantees, maintenance guarantees, or letters of credit to be used pursuant to the terms, conditions and requirements of this section.

Chapter 16.19 - DEVELOPER CONTRIBUTIONS FOR OFF-TRACT IMPROVEMENTS 

16.19.010 - Purpose. 
    As a condition of subdivision or site plan approval, and in accordance with N.J.S.A. 40:55D-42, the planning board of East Greenwich Township shall require a developer/applicant to pay its pro-rata share of the cost of providing reasonable and necessary improvements to the township's water, streets/street signalization, drainage, and sewer facilities, including land and easements, that are located off-tract of the proposed subdivision or development, but which are necessitated or required as a direct result of the impact that the subdivision or development will have upon the township. All such off-tract water, streets/street signalization, drainage and sewer improvements shall be in conformance with the circulation and comprehensive utility service plans of the township's master plan. Such improvements are those that are clearly, directly and/or substantially related to the subdivision or development under review, as further determined based on the provisions, calculations and methodologies being further set forth herein. In addition, and separate and apart from the provisions of N.J.S.A. 40:55D-42, a developer shall be required to pay its fair share for off-tract open space and/or recreational land and improvements, in concert with or as set forth in, the recreational, conservation and/or facilities elements of the township's master plan, where either none of the same or only a portion of the same are provided for on-tract, as required by ordinance, or when the developer, with planning board approval, opts to pay a contribution fee in-lieu of all or a portion of such on-tract requirements. 
(Ord. 27-2003 § 1 (part)) 
16.19.020 - Cost allocation. 
A.  Full Allocation. In cases where off-tract improvements are necessitated by the proposed development, and where no property owners receive a special benefit thereby, or where neither the township nor any other governmental entity has either planned, programmed, or accepted responsibility for any portion of the cost of the improvements, the developer/applicant shall be responsible, at the developer/applicant's sole expense and as a condition of approval, to either provide for and install such improvements, upon proper review and approval by the township of all such plans related to the same, or to provide for the necessary funding so that the township can make such improvements directly. 
B.  Proportionate Allocation. Where it is determined that properties outside the development will also be benefited by the off-tract improvements, or where either the township or other governmental agency or entity has planned or programmed, or accepted respon-sibility for any portion of the cost of the improvement, the criteria set forth herein shall be utilized in calculating and determining the proportionate share of the cost of such improvements to the developer/applicant. A proportionate allocation shall not be made however, and a developer/applicant shall be responsible for assuming all costs for improvements, where there is a need to upgrade an existing facility or improvement due to it's insufficient capacity or other inadequacies to service the needs of the developer/applicant's proposed development, but the existing facility or improvement is adequate to service the needs of the present users. Where a developer is required to "front-end" an off-tract improvement (such as the extension of a sewer line to the proposed development), and future developers benefit from the same, then the original developer who made the improvement shall be entitled to a pro rata reimbursement from any subsequent developers who have directly benefited from the improvement, if said subsequent benefit accrues within ten years from the date of the original improvement. In any such event, the following procedure shall take place: 
1.  The original developer shall certify the actual costs of the off-tract improvements, based on construction invoices, which shall then be verified by the township engineer. 
2.  The township engineer shall then calculate the subsequent developer's pro rata contribution, by dividing the use of the improvement by the subsequent developer by the use of the improvement made by all developments benefiting from the improvement, based on road capacity, daily sewage flow, daily water flow, etc. 
3.  The township shall then condition the issuance of the first building permit in the subsequent developer's development, upon payment in full of the pro rata reimbursement to the original developer. Said reimbursement shall be payable to the township directly, who shall them reimburse the original developer, subject to payment of any liens, offsets or other funds due to the township by the original developer. 
C.  Alternate Methods. Nothing herein shall be construed as to prevent the planning board of East Greenwich Township and the developer/applicant from agreeing to use an alternate method to allocate costs, or to use an alternate method to make to payments for pro rata reimbursements, than that which is set forth herein, given the unique and distinguishable characteristics of each application for development, as long as such alternate method is based on fair and reasonable standards, and the reason for adopting such alternate method is clearly set forth and agreed to by both the planning board and the developer/applicant. 
(Ord. 27-2003 § 1 (part)) 
16.19.030 - Off-tract water improvements. 
A.  Water Supply. The developer/applicant's share of water distribution, supply, treatment, and storage facilities, including the installation, relocation or replacement of water, mains, hydrants, valves, and appurtenances associated therewith, shall be computed as follows: 
1.  The capacity and design of the water supply system shall be based on standards computed by the developer's engineer and approved by the planning board's and/or the township's engineer. 
2.  The planning board and/or township engineer shall provide the developer/applicant with the existing and reasonably anticipated peak hour flows as well as capacity limits for the affected water system in terms of average demand, peak demand and fire demand. 
3.  If the required system does not exist, or the existing system does not have adequate capacity to accommodate the developer/applicant's flow given existing and reasonably anticipated peak hour and fire flows, the pro rata share shall be computed to the larger of: 
a.  The partial cost of a shared improvement where none now exists: 
Total Cost of Improvement = Capacity of Improvement (Gallons Per Day-"GPD") __________Developer/ Applicant's Cost Development-Generated Design Flow to be Accommodated By the Improvement (GPD)  
or, 
b.  The total cost of an improvement designed to accommodate only the development flow, if such an alternative is technically feasible; or 
c.  The full cost to upgrade an existing facility or improvement where said facility or improvement has either insufficient capacity or is otherwise inadequate to service the needs of the developer/applicant, but is adequate to service the needs of the present users. 
(Ord. 27-2003 § 1 (part)) 
16.19.040 - Off-tract roadway-Signalization improvements. 
A.  Roadways-Signalization. The developer/applicant's proportionate share of street improvements, alignments, channelization, barriers, new or improved traffic signalization, signs, curbs, sidewalks, trees, utility improvements uncovered elsewhere, the construction or reconstruction of new or existing streets, and other associated street or traffic improvements, shall be as follows: 
1.  Traffic Study. A Traffic Impact Study ("Study") shall be provided by the developer/applicant as required in Section 16.l6.060(A). The study shall address the various traffic-generating characteristics of uses in the proposed development and the interface of traffic from uses associated from the proposed development and existing uses in the area, to assure that there will not be a degradation in the level of service in the area, and that there will not be any traffic hazards created in the area by traffic generated as a direct result of the development. 
2.  Level of Service. The developer/applicant must demonstrate that the existing public traffic arteries have adequate capacities to accommodate the traffic to be generated by the proposed project at an acceptable level of service of D or better, and that safe, convenient and adequate circulation and parking is provided for on site of the proposed development. 
3.  Traffic Volumes. The developer/applicant must provide as a part of its submitted study, existing twenty-four hour traffic counts for a minimum of three different days, excluding Sundays and holidays, summarized by hour and by direction, and peak hours trips by movement on all critical off-tract arterial roadways and intersections affected by the proposed development. Traffic volumes utilized in the study shall be taken within twelve (12) months preceding the date that the application is filed with the township's planning board, and be taken between the period of September 1 through June 15, excluding those days wherein inclement weather would make such counts not typical. If there is a seasonal peak, the study shall take the same into account and make appropriate comments. 
4.  Future Background Traffic Volume. Future traffic volumes shall be calculated by multiplying the peak hour traffic volumes utilizing the current New Jersey Department of Transportation ("NJDOT") growth factors. These factored traffic volumes will be surcharged with traffic volumes expected to be generated by impending development in the area, based on development projects presently approved by, or pending before, the township's planning board, and known projects presently approved by or pending before the planning boards of immediately adjacent municipalities which will clearly have an impact on local traffic. 
5.  Traffic Generation. Traffic expected to be generated by the proposed development shall be calculated by utilizing the latest copy of the Institute of Transportation Engineers ("ITE") text: Trip Generation. The values developed by using the trip generation method shall be verified by typical counts when requested by the township to verify results. If the township requires trip generation data because the trip generation methodology is not accurate due to local conditions or an inadequate database in the "Trip Generation" text, the traffic data counts required to verify trip generation data, shall be in the ITE format. Traffic generation shall include the amount of traffic to be generated for the project twenty-four (24) hour period and during the peak hour trip generation by the proposed project. 
6.  Future Build Traffic Volumes. Future background traffic volumes shall be surcharged by adding the traffic volumes that are to be generated by the proposed development to future background traffic volumes. 
7.  Traffic Analysis. 
a.  Capacity Analysis. Roadways and intersections shall be analyzed using a capacity analysis. The capacity analysis will utilize the latest approved highway capacity programs. Traffic shall be analyzed for the existing traffic conditions, future traffic conditions, and future build traffic conditions. Traffic analysis shall optimize traffic signals so that the existing traffic conditions show traffic conditions as they exist and with the optimization of traffic signal timing. The future background traffic conditions shall require the optimization of the traffic on the roadways. Future traffic shall be added and the traffic signal timings shall be optimized for a final product. 
b.  Accident Analysis. Accident data of critical intersections and roadways shall be analyzed. 
c.  Speed and Delay Analysis. Speed and delay analysis of critical roadways shall be provided. 
d.  Gap Analysis. Gap studies of critical intersections shall be provided. 
e.  Safety Analysis. Analysis shall be made of all entrances and exits to determine if left-turn lanes are warranted in accordance with Highway Research Record 211. In addition, deceleration and acceleration lanes shall be analyzed to determine if they are needed. 
B.  Off-Tract Contributions. The developer/applicant's traffic consultant shall provide a trip distribution that will distribute traffic to the surrounding roadway system. All intersections that have over twenty-five (25) P.M. peak hour trips shall be tabulated and listed with the amount of traffic from the proposed development and the total build traffic at that location. The developer/applicant's engineer shall show the percent of the P.M. traffic that the applicant's traffic will be, of the future build traffic at each intersection by approach. If improvements are required on one approach of an intersection only, as a result of a significant impact from the development, defined as an approach where the majority of traffic on the approach (further defined as over fifty (50) percent of the total traffic build) caused the need for the proposed improvement on that approach to maintain an adequate level of service, the developer/applicant's pro rata share of the intersection improvements shall be calculated as set forth below. 
1.  If the required improvements to accommodate the proposed development do not exist, or the existing system does not have adequate capacity to accommodate the anticipated volumes as set forth in the study, the pro rata share shall be the larger of: 
a.  The partial cost of a shared improvement where none exists: 
Total Cost of Improvement = Capacity of Improvement (Peak Hour Volume) __________Developer/ Applicant's Cost Developer Traffic to be Accommodated by the Enlargement or Improvement (Peak Hour Volume)  
or, 
b.  The total cost of an improvement designed to accommodate only the development traffic volume if such an alternative is technically possible; or 
c.  The full cost to upgrade an existing facility or improvement where said facility or improvement has either insufficient capacity or is otherwise inadequate to service the needs of the developer/applicant, but is adequate to service the needs of present users. 
(Ord. 27-2003 § 1 (part)) 
16.19.050 - Off-tract drainage improvements. 
    The applicant's proportionate share of stormwater and drainage improvements including the installation, relocation and replacement of storm drains, bridges, culverts, catch basins, manholes, rip-rap, detention or retention basins, improved drainage ditches and appurtenances thereto, and relocation or replacement of other storm drainage facilities or appurtenances associated therewith, shall be determined as follows: 
A.  The capacity and the design of the drainage to accommodate stormwater runoff shall be based on standards set forth in Chapter 16.44 of the township's land development code, computed by the developer/applicant's engineer and approved by the township planning board's and/or the township's engineer. 
B.  The capacity of the enlarged, extended or improved system required for the subdivision and areas outside of the developer/applicant's tributary to the drainage system shall be determined by the developer/applicant's engineer, subject to the approval of the board's and/or township's engineer. The plans for the improved system may be prepared by the developer/applicant's engineer or the board's or township's engineer, at the developer/applicant's expense, and the estimated cost of the enlarged system shall be calculated by the board's and/or township's engineer. 
C.  If the required improvements do not exist, or if the existing system does not have adequate capacity to accommodate reasonably anticipated volumes, the pro rata share shall by the large of: 
1.  The partial cost of the shared improvement where none now exists: 
Total Cost of Improvement = Capacity of Improvement (cfs-Peak 25-Year Storm) __________Developer/ Applicant's Cost Development-Generated Peak Runoff to be Accommodated By the Enlargement or Improvement (cfs Peak 25-Year Storm)  
or, 
2.  The total cost of an improvement designed to accommodate only the development flow, if such an alternative is technically possible; or 
3.  The full cost to upgrade an existing facility or improvement where said facility or improvement has either insufficient capacity or is otherwise inadequate to service the needs of the developer/applicant, but is adequate to service the needs of the present users. (Amended during 3-07 supplement; Ord. 27-2003 § 1 (part)) 
16.19.060 - Off-tract sewer improvements. 
A.  The capacity and design of sanitary sewer systems shall be based on "Rules and Regulations for the Preparation and Submission for Sewerage Systems," New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, as well as any and all other design and specifications standards as may be set forth by the Township of East Greenwich and/or its professionals responsible for approval and oversight of such systems. 
B.  The developer/applicant shall be responsible for the entire cost of any off-tract improvements for sanitary sewer systems, including distributions facilities, the installation, relocation or replacement of collector, trunk and interceptor sewers, and the installation, relocation or replacement of other appurtenances associated therewith, that are necessary as a direct result of the proposed development. This shall apply both to the need for any new systems, facilities, appurtenances, etc., as well as the cost to upgrade an existing facility or improvement where said facility or improvement has either insufficient capacity or is otherwise inadequate to service the ends of the developer/applicant's proposed development, but is adequate to service the needs of the present users. 
C.  In the event that a new system and/or facilities or appurtenances associated therewith is/are necessary where none now exists, but said new system, and/or facilities or appurtenances associated therewith will be shared with other users who do not now benefit from the same, the developer/applicant's partial cost of said shared improvement shall be as follows: 
Total Cost of Improvement = Capacity of Improvement (Gallons Per Day-GPD) __________Developer/ Applicant's Cost Developer/ Applicant-Generated Flow To Be Accommodated By The Improvement (GPD)  
(Ord. 27-2003 § 1 (part)) 
16.19.070 - Reserved. 
Editor's note- At the direction of the township, as a part of Supp. No. 13, § 16.19.070 was repealed in its entirety. Former § 16.19.070 pertained to off-tract recreational improvements and was derived from Ord. 27-2003 § 1 (part). 
16.19.080 - Costs included. 
    The cost of all off-tract acquisition of lands and/or improvements as contained in this chapter shall be construed to encompass all costs including, but not limited to, planning, feasibility studies, surveys, property and easement acquisition, design, equipment/facilities, and construction. Such costs shall also include all legal, accounting, surveying, engineering, and other professional costs directly associated with the improvement(s) contemplated. Such costs may still further include the cost of eminent domain proceedings, reasonable contingencies, and costs of financing during construction. All such costs shall be calculated and set forth, as a condition of approval, when preliminary major subdivision approval is granted. 
(Ord. 27-2003 § 1 (part)) 
16.19.090 - Funding of improvements. 
    Where the proposed off-tract improvement(s) are to be undertaken at a future date, the monies required for the improvement shall be paid prior to the signing of the final plans by the planning board chair, planning board secretary and township clerk, except in the case of fees paid for off-tract open space and/or recreational land and improvements, in which case said fees shall be paid on a per unit basis at such time as each certificate of occupancy ("C.O.") is issued within the affected development. Said funds shall be deposited in an interest-bearing account to the credit of the township in a separate account, until such time as the improvement(s) is/are constructed. If off-tract improvements for water, roadway, signalization, drainage, or sewer improvements, or recreational improvements or the purchase of land for open space or recreational needs, are not begun within ten (10) years from the, date of the final certificate of occupancy being issued to the developer/applicant, (or fifteen (15) years in the case of open space or recreational improvements/land acquisition), then and in any such event all monies and interest shall be returned to the developer/applicant. Where developer contributions are made for open space acquisition or the purchase of recreational land and/or improvements, such funds shall be placed in a dedicated account for such purposes, and can be used for no other purposes.

When an applicant proposes to grade over an adjoining property line, written permission/agreement from the adjoining property owner must be obtained and a waiver from the minimum requirements must be obtained. 
6.  Top of excavation or toe of slope shall be no closer than five feet to an adjoining property line. 
7.  If a retaining wall is proposed within ten (10) feet of a right-of-way or adjoining property line, construction details must be provided. In cases where the retaining wall is also higher than thirty (30) inches, calculations, prepared by a licensed professional engineer, must be submitted, certifying the stability of the structure. 
8.  For swimming pool construction, finished deck elevations shall be set above the natural grade occurring on the lot to prevent the surface runoff from flowing into the pool. 
(Ord. 8-2002) 
16.21.050 - Tree protection. 
    The grading plans shall show compliance with Section 16.18.080 of the township's code. 
(Ord. 8-2002) 
16.21.060 - Approval procedures. 
    Each person to whom this section applies must obtain approval of his/her grading plan in the following manner: 
1.  The township engineer will review and report on the grading plan within five business days of receipt of a grading plan accompanying a building permit application. The report will indicate any plan deficiencies and any required revisions. 
2.  The township engineer will oversee the grading operation during normal site inspections. The applicant is required to notify the Township Engineer forty-eight (48) hours prior to rough grading. 
3.  Following completion of all grading and drainage work, the applicant must submit two copies of an asbuilt survey, prepared by a New Jersey licensed land surveyor, with final grades and request a final inspection. If any discrepancy exists between the grading plan and actual construction, the developer will be required to perform any necessary site work to correct the deficiency. All as-built site work must be in conformity with the approved grading plans. Any deviations may be approved only by the relevant approving agency. 
4.  Following completion of all work, the township engineer shall conduct the final inspection and notify the construction official, in writing, whether the final construction is in compliance with the approved grading plan and that a certificate of occupancy may be issued. The construction officer shall issue the certificate of occupancy only if all conditions for the approved grading plan have been satisfied. 
5.  All grading work must be completed within one hundred eighty (180) calendar days from the issuance of the grading permit. The approving review board of the township may grant extension of the time limit when conditions or circumstances so warrant. If approval from a review board is not required, the construction code official and township engineer shall have discretion in granting extension of the time limit when conditions or circumstances so warrant. 
(Ord. 8-2002) 
16.21.070 - Permit and review fees. 
    The person to whom this section applies must pay the following fees for application, review and inspection of the site: 
1.  Grading plan review fees shall be as follows: 
a.  Application fee: seventy-five dollars ($75.00). 
b.  Escrow: three hundred dollars ($300.00) at time of application and seventy-five dollars ($75.00) upon submission of a revised grading plan.

Chapter 16.44 - STORM DRAINAGE 

16.44.010 - Runoff computations. 
A.  Computation of the rate of flow at any given location shall be based on the rational formula: Q = C.I.A., in which: 
Q = volume in cubic feet per second 
C = runoff factor 
I = intensity of rainfall in inches per hour 
A = watershed area in acres 
    In setting the value of the runoff coefficient "C", consideration will be given to the physical features of the drainage basin and the best available data on the future density of development of the drainage basin. In no case shall it be less than 0.25. 
B.  The intensity of the storm shall be based on the following: 
1.  As a minimum, a ten (10) year storm shall be used at low points with a relief swale, or twenty-five (25) year storm where carried in a pipe. 
2.  The Rainfall Intensity Duration Frequency Curve for Philadelphia, presented in Technical Paper No. 25, prepared by U.S. Department of Commerce Weather Bureau, shall be used. 
C.  Standard headwalls shall be installed on all pipes and additionally, trash bars shall be installed on all pipes equal to or greater than twenty-four (24) inches in diameter. 
(Prior code § 13-27.1) 
16.44.020 - Pipeline design. 
A.  Design Methods. Storm sewer pipelines shall be designed by either of the following two methods. Both shall be based on the Manning equation and shall utilize the following friction factors: 
n = 0.013 Concrete Pipe 
n = 0.021 Corrugated Metal Pipe 
    The minimum allowable pipe size is fifteen (15) inches. 
1.  Submerged Pipeline. 
A.  This method is based on the assumption that when the storm sewer system is under maximum load the hydraulic gradient will be at or above the crown of the pipe and that flow in the lines will be controlled by head differentials between structures or other locations where the system is open to the ground surface, such as inlets or outlets, manholes and stream inlets or outlets. The head of water above the crown of any pipe can range from zero feet to a point which will not cause surface flooding. 
B.  The slope of the hydraulic gradient in any section of storm sewer between opening to the surface shall be calculated on the assumption that the pipe is flowing full at a constant velocity and at the required capacity. 
C.  The elevation of the hydraulic gradient at any point in the pipe shall be no lower than the crown of the pipe and no higher than the surface of the ground. 
D.  The elevation of the hydraulic gradient at any point where the system opens to the surface, such as an inlet or manhole, shall be three feet below the surface of the ground. 
E.  At all structures, such as manholes, inlets, etc., where the pipe size does not change, the elevation of the hydraulic gradient shall be dropped two-tenths feet to allow for losses therein. Where the inlet and outlet pipe sizes are not the same, the elevation of the hydraulic gradient shall be dropped an amount based on the following formula: 
H = 0.2 feet + 0.8 (I-O) feet 
I = diameter of inlet pipe 
O = diameter of outlet pipe 
    If O is larger than I, head loss = 0.2 feet 
F.  The minimum slope of any pipe shall be such that a minimum velocity of two and one-half feet per second shall be maintained when the pipe is flowing one-quarter full. 
2.  Pipeline Flowing Full. 
a.  This method is based on the assumption that the hydraulic gradient will match the inside top of the pipe when the system is under maximum hydraulic load. 
b.  For this method, head losses through manholes, inlets, etc., shall be ignored. 
c.  The minimum slope of any pipe shall be such that a minimum velocity of two and five tenths feet per second shall be maintained when the pipe is flowing one-quarter full. 
d.  When the pipe sizes change, the inside tops of the pipes shall be matched. 
B.  Pipe Profiles. Continuous profiles for each reach of pipe shall be plotted, along with the location of the hydraulic gradient and the hydraulic information pertinent to each reach within the system. This information shall include the pipe size and type, the "n" factor, the slope of the hydraulic gradient, the slope of the pipe, the design capacity and the velocity at the design capacity. 
C.  Inlet Design. 
1.  Stormwater inlets shall be equal to New Jersey State Highway Department inlet Type "B". The maximum collecting capacities of the inlets shall be considered to be: 
a.  When installed on streets where the grade is 1.00 percent-five cubic feet per second. 
b.  When installed on streets where the grade is 2.00 percent-4.8 cubic feet per second. 
c.  When installed on streets where the grade is 3.00 percent-4.6 cubic feet per second. 
d.  When installed on streets where the grade is 4.00 percent-4.4 cubic feet per second. 
e.  When installed on streets where the grade is 5.00 percent-4.2 cubic feet per second. 
f.  When installed on streets where the grade is 6.00 percent-4.0 cubic feet per second. 
2.  Sufficient inlets shall be located and constructed so that the length of surface runoff will not contribute a runoff to the inlet exceeding the preceding designated collecting capacities. 
3.  The gutter grate of all inlets shall be set not less than two inches, nor more than four inches below the gutter grade. The surface of the paving adjacent to the inlets shall be constructed to blend into the lowered gutter grade at the inlet in such a manner that a sudden dropoff or dip at the inlet will not be created. At such locations where drainage is entirely dependent upon inlets, the collecting capacities of the inlets shall be designed for one-half the preceding considered capacities. 
4.  Where surface water is collected from two directions at one street corner, inlets shall be placed at or near the tangent points of both ends of the radius. The use of one inlet in the radius shall not be allowed. 
5.  Access manholes shall be spaced at five hundred (500) foot intervals, maximum, through rights-of-way and at sewer junctions where there are no catchbasins. 
(Prior code § 13-27.2) 
16.44.030 - Open channel design. 
    Open channel design should be based on the following hydraulic considerations: 
A.  Manning's Equation: 
n = .015-best concrete lined ditch 
n = .025-best unlined ditch 
n = .03 to .15-fair to poor natural streams and watercourses 
2.  Velocity. 
Excavation Material 
Velocity 
Fine sand and firm loam 
2.50 to 3.5 fps 
Stiff clay and hardpan 
3.75 to 6.0 fps 
Concrete lined ditch 
15 fps 
B.  Ample freeboard should be provided on all channels.

Chapter 16.45 - STORMWATER CONTROL 

16.45.010 - Scope and purpose. 
A.  Purpose. 
1.  It is determined that: 
a.  Land development projects and associated disturbance of vegetation and soil and changes in land cover, including increases in impervious cover, alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes. If inadequately or improperly managed, this stormwater runoff can deplete groundwater resources and increase flooding, stream channel erosion, and sediment transport and deposition in the Township of East Greenwich. 
b.  This stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants. 
c.  Increases of stormwater runoff, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollutants have occurred in the past as a result of land development, and contribute to the degradation of the water resources of the Township of East Greenwich. 
d.  The Township of East Greenwich's natural resources are to be protected in accordance with New Jersey's Stormwater Management Rules at N.J.A.C. 7:8-1.1 et seq. and New Jersey's surface water quality anti-degradation policies contained in the New Jersey Surface Water Quality Standards at N.J.A.C. 7:9B-1.1 et seq. Permitted uses shall maintain the ecological character and quality of the Township of East Greenwich, including good water quality and natural rates and volumes of flow. 
e.  Increased stormwater rates and volumes and the sediments and pollutants associated with stormwater runoff from future development projects within the Township of East Greenwich have the potential to adversely affect the Township of East Greenwich's streams and water resources and the streams and water resources of downstream municipalities. 
f.  Stormwater runoff, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff from development sites. 
g.  It is in the public interest to regulate the discharge of stormwater runoff from "major development" projects, as defined in Section 16.45.070 of this chapter, conducted within the Township of East Greenwich, as provided in this chapter, in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes, to maintain groundwater recharge, and to control and minimize soil erosion, stream channel erosion and nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff. 
2.  Therefore, it is the purpose of this chapter to establish minimum stormwater management requirements and controls for major development, consistent with the statewide stormwater requirements at N.J.A.C. 7:8 and the provisions of the adopted master plan and land use ordinances of the Township of East Greenwich. 
B.  Goals and Techniques. 
1.  Through this chapter, the Township of East Greenwich has established the following goals for stormwater control: 
a.  To reduce flood damage, including damage to life and property; 
b.  To minimize any increase in stormwater runoff from new development; 
c.  To reduce soil erosion from any development or construction project; 
d.  To assure the adequacy of existing and proposed culverts and bridges, and other instream structures; 
e.  To maintain groundwater recharge; 
f.  To minimize any increase in nonpoint pollution; 
g.  To maintain the integrity of stream channels for their biological functions, as well as for drainage; 
h.  To restore, protect, maintain and enhance the quality of the streams and water resources and the ecological character and quality of the Township of East Greenwich; 
i.  To minimize pollutants in stormwater runoff from new and existing development in order to restore, protect, enhance and maintain the chemical, physical and biological integrity of the surface and groundwaters of the Township of East Greenwich, to protect public health and to enhance the domestic, municipal, recreational, industrial and other uses of water; and 
j.  To protect public safety through the proper design and operation of stormwater management basins. 
2.  In order to achieve the goals for stormwater control set forth in this chapter, the Township of East Greenwich has identified the following management techniques: 
a.  Implementation of multiple stormwater management best management practices (BMPs) may be necessary to achieve the performance standards for stormwater runoff quantity and rate, groundwater recharge, erosion control, and stormwater runoff quality established through this chapter. 
b.  Compliance with the stormwater runoff quantity and rate, groundwater recharge, erosion control, and stormwater runoff quality standards established through N.J.A.C. 7:8-1.1 et seq., and this chapter, shall be accomplished to the maximum extent practicable through the use of nonstructural BMPs, before relying on structural BMPs. Nonstructural BMPs are also known as low-impact development (LID) techniques. 
c.  Nonstructural BMPs shall include both environmentally sensitive site design and source controls that prevent pollutants from being placed on the site or from being exposed to stormwater. 
d.  Source control plans shall be developed based upon physical site conditions and the origin, nature and the anticipated quantity or amount of potential pollutants. 
e.  Structural BMPs, where necessary, shall be integrated with nonstructural stormwater management strategies and proper maintenance plans. 
f.  When using structural BMPs, multiple stormwater management measures, smaller in size and distributed spatially throughout the land development site, shall be used wherever possible to achieve the performance standards for water quality, quantity and groundwater recharge established through this chapter before relying on a single, larger stormwater management measure to achieve these performance standards. 
C.  Applicability. This chapter shall apply to: 
1.  All site plans and subdivisions for major developments occurring within the Township of East Greenwich that require preliminary or final site plan or subdivision review; and 
2.  All major development projects undertaken by the Township of East Greenwich shall comply with this chapter.* 
* Note: This clause is intended to provide consistency with DEP's stormwater management requirements. 
D.  Procedures. In addition to other development review procedures set forth in the code of the Township of East Greenwich, major developments located within the Township of East Greenwich shall comply with the stormwater management requirements and specifications set forth in this chapter. New agricultural development that meets the definition of major development in Section 16.45.070 of this chapter shall be submitted to the appropriate soil conservation district for review and approval in accordance with the requirements of N.J.A.C. 5.4(b) 7:8. 
E.  Compatibility with Other Permit and Ordinance Requirements. 
1.  Development approvals issued for subdivisions and site plans pursuant to this chapter are to be considered an integral part of development approvals under the subdivision and site plan review process and do not relieve the applicant of the responsibility to secure required permits or approvals for activities regulated by any other applicable ordinance, code, rule, regulation, statute, act or other provision of law. 
2.  In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of the public health, safety, and general welfare. This chapter is not intended to interfere with, abrogate, or annul any other ordinances, rule or regulation, statute, or other provision of law except that, where any provision of this chapter imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule or regulation, or other provision of law, the more restrictive or stringent provisions or higher standards shall control. 
3.  In the event that a regional stormwater management plane(s) is prepared and formally adopted pursuant to N.J.A.C. 7:8-1.1 et seq. for any drainage area(s) or watershed(s) of which the Township of East Greenwich is a part, the stormwater provisions of such a plan(s) shall be adopted by the Township of East Greenwich within one year of the adoption of a regional stormwater management plan (RSWMP) as an amendment to an areawide water quality management plan.

16.45.030 - Methodologies for the calculation of stormwater runoff rate and volume, stormwater runoff quality, and groundwater recharge. 
A.  Method of Calculating Stormwater Runoff Rate and Volume. 
1.  In complying with the stormwater runoff quantity and rate standards in Section 16.45.040(B), the design engineer shall calculate the stormwater runoff rate and volume using the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) runoff equation, runoff curve numbers, and dimensionless unit hydrograph, as described in the "NRCS National Engineering Handbook Part 630 - Hydrology and Technical Release 55 - Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds," as amended and supplemented or the rational method for peak flow and the modified rational method for hydrograph computations, so long as the Delmarva hydrograph is employed. 
2.  In calculating stormwater runoff using the NRCS methodology, the design engineer shall separately calculate and then combine the runoff volumes from pervious and directly connected impervious surfaces within a drainage area. 
3.  Calculation of stormwater runoff from unconnected impervious surfaces shall be based, as applicable, upon the two-step method described in the current New Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual or the NRCS methodology. 
4.  In calculating stormwater runoff using the NRCS methodology, the design engineer shall use appropriate twenty-four (24) hour rainfall depths as developed for the project site by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, available online at http://hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/pfds/index.html. 
5.  When calculating stormwater runoff for pre-developed site conditions, the design engineer shall use the following criteria: 
a.  When selecting or calculating runoff curve numbers (CNs) for pre-developed project site conditions, the project site's land cover shall be assumed to be woods in good condition. However, another land cover may be used to calculate runoff coefficients if: 
i.  Such land cover has existed at the site or portion thereof without interruption for at least five years immediately prior to the time of application; and 
ii.  The design engineer can document the character and extent of such land cover through the use of photographs, affidavits, and/or other acceptable land use records. 
b.  If more than one land cover has existed on the site during the five years immediately prior to the time of application, the land cover with the lowest runoff potential shall be used for the computations. 
c.  All pre-developed land covers shall be assumed to be in good hydrologic condition and, if cultivated, shall be assumed to have conservation treatment. 
d.  In calculating pre-developed site stormwater runoff, the design engineer shall include the effects of all land features and structures, such as ponds, wetlands, depressions, hedgerows, and culverts, which affect pre-developed site stormwater runoff rates and/or volumes. 
e.  Where tailwater will affect the hydraulic performance of a stormwater management measure, the design engineer shall include such effects in the measure's design. 
B.  Method of Calculating Stormwater Runoff Quality. 
1.  In complying with the stormwater runoff quality standards in Section 16.45.040(F)(1), the design engineer shall calculate the stormwater runoff rate and volume using the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) runoff equation, runoff curve numbers, and dimensionless unit hydrograph, as described in the "NRCS National Engineering Handbook Part 630 - Hydrology and Technical Release 55 - Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds," as amended and supplemented or the rational method for peak flow and the modified rational method for hydrograph computations, so long as the Delmarva hydrograph is employed. 
2.  The design engineer shall also use the NJDEP water quality design storm, which is one and one-quarter inches of rainfall falling in a nonlinear pattern in two hours. Details of the water quality design storm are shown in Table 1. 
3.  Calculation of runoff volumes, peak rates, and hydrographs for the water quality design storm may take into account the implementation of nonstructural and structural stormwater management measures.

4.  Total Suspended Solids (TSS) Reduction Calculations. 
a.  If more than one stormwater BMP in series is necessary to achieve the required eighty (80) percent TSS reduction for a site, the applicant shall utilize the following formula to calculate TSS reduction: 
R = A + B - (A × B)/100, where: 
    R = total TSS percent load removal from application of both BMPs; 
    A = the TSS percent removal rate applicable to the first BMP; and 
    B = the TSS percent removal rate applicable to the second BMP. 
b.  If there is more than one on-site drainage area, the eighty (80) percent TSS removal rate shall apply to each drainage area, unless the runoff from the sub areas converge on site, in which case the removal rate can be demonstrated through a calculation using a weighted average. 
5.  TSS Removal Rates for Stormwater BMPs. 
a.  For purposes of TSS reduction calculations, Table 2 presents the presumed removal rates for certain BMPs designed in accordance with the New Jersey BMP Manual. The BMP manual may be obtained from the address identified in the appendix or found on the NJDEP's website at www.njstormwater.org. TSS reduction shall be calculated based on the removal rates for the BMPs in Table 2. 
b.  Alternative stormwater management measures, removal rates and methods of calculating removal rates may be used if the design engineer provides documentation demonstrating the capability of these alternative rates and methods to the Township of East Greenwich. Any alternative stormwater management measure, removal rate or method of calculating the removal rate shall be subject to approval by the Township of East Greenwich and a copy shall be provided to the following:

2.  Alternative groundwater recharge calculation methods to meet these requirements may be used upon approval by the municipal engineer. 
3.  In complying with the groundwater recharge requirements in Section 16.45.040(C)(1)(b), the design engineer shall: 
a.  Calculate stormwater runoff volumes in accordance with the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) methodology, including the NRCS runoff equation and runoff curve numbers, as described in the "NRCS National Engineering Handbook Part 630 - Hydrology and Technical Release 55 - Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds," as amended and supplemented; and 
b.  Use appropriate two-year, twenty-four (24) hour rainfall depths as developed for the project site by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, available online at http://hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/pfds/index.html. 
4.  When calculating groundwater recharge or stormwater runoff for pre-developed site conditions, the design engineer shall use the following criteria: 
a.  When selecting land covers or calculating runoff curve numbers (CNs) for pre-developed project site conditions, the project site's land cover shall be assumed to be woods. However, another land cover may be used to calculate runoff coefficients if: 
i.  Such land cover has existed at the site or portion thereof without interruption for at least five years immediately prior to the time of application; and 
ii.  The design engineer can document the character and extent of such land cover through the use of photographs, affidavits, and/or other acceptable land use records. 
b.  If more than one land cover, other than woods, has existed on the site during the five years immediately prior to the time of application, the land cover with the lowest runoff potential (including woods) shall be used for the computations. 
c.  All pre-developed land covers shall be assumed to be in good hydrologic condition and, if cultivated, shall be assumed to have conservation treatment.

4.  In addition to all other requirements of this section, each application for major development, and any other application where the Township of East Greenwich otherwise requires a landscaping plan, shall contain a landscaping or revegetation plan. 
5.  Any land area used as a nonstructural stormwater management measure to meet the performance standards in this section shall be dedicated to a government entity; shall be subjected to a conservation easement filed with the appropriate county clerk's office; or shall be subjected to an equivalent form of restriction approved by the Township of East Greenwich that ensures that that measure, or equivalent stormwater management measure is maintained in perpetuity, as detailed in Section 16.45.060 of this chapter. 
6.  Guidance for nonstructural stormwater management strategies is available in the New Jersey BMP Manual, which may be obtained from the address identified in the appendix or found on the NJDEP's website at www.njstormwater.org.

B.  Stormwater Runoff Quantity and Rate Standards. 
1.  There shall be no direct discharge of stormwater runoff from any point or nonpoint source to any surface waterbody. In addition, stormwater runoff shall not be directed in such a way as to increase the volume and/or rate of discharge into any surface water body from that which existed prior to development of the site. 
2.  The design engineer, using the assumptions and factors for stormwater runoff and groundwater recharge calculations contained in Section 16.45.030, shall either: 
a.  Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis that the post-developed stormwater runoff hydrographs from the project site for the two, ten (10), and one hundred (100) year storms do not exceed, at any point in time, the site's pre-developed runoff hydrographs for the same storms; 
b.  Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis that under post-developed site conditions: 
i.  There is no increase in pre-developed stormwater runoff rates from the project site for the two, ten (10), and one hundred (100) year storms, and 
ii.  Any increased stormwater runoff volume or change in stormwater runoff timing for the two, ten (10), and one hundred (100) year storms will not increase flood damage at or downstream of the project site. When performing this analysis for pre-developed site conditions, all off-site development levels shall reflect existing conditions. When performing this analysis for post-developed site conditions, all off-site development levels shall reflect full development in accordance with current zoning and land use ordinances; or 
c.  Demonstrate that the peak post-developed stormwater runoff rates from the project site for the two, ten (10) and one hundred (100) year storms are fifty (50), seventy-five (75) and eighty (80) percent, respectively, of the site's peak pre-developed stormwater runoff rates for the same storms. Peak outflow rates from on-site stormwater measures for these storms shall be adjusted where necessary to account for the discharge of increased stormwater runoff rates and/or volumes from project site areas not controlled by the on-site measures. These percentages do not have to be applied to those portions of the project site that are not proposed for development at the time of application, provided that such areas are: 
i.  Protected from future development by imposition of a conservation easement, deed restriction, or other acceptable legal measures; or 
ii.  Would be subject to review under these standards if they are proposed for any degree of development in the future. 
3.  In tidal flood hazard areas, a stormwater runoff quantity analysis in accordance with subsections (B)(2)(a) through (c) above shall only be applied if the increased volume of stormwater runoff could increase flood damages below the point of discharge. 
4.  The standards for stormwater runoff quantity and rate required by this section shall be met using the methods, calculations and assumptions provided in Section 16.45.030. 
C.  Groundwater Recharge Standards. 
1.  For all major developments, with the exception of those described in Section 16.45.040(C)(4), below, the design engineer, using the assumptions and factors for stormwater runoff and groundwater recharge calculations contained in Section 16.45.030, shall either: 
a.  Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis that the post-developed project site maintains one hundred (100) percent of the site's pre-developed average annual groundwater recharge volume; or 
b.  Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis that any increase in the project site's stormwater runoff volume for the two year, twenty four (24) hour storm from pre-developed to post-developed conditions is infiltrated on-site. 
2.  The design engineer shall assess the hydraulic impact on the groundwater table and design the project site and all site groundwater recharge measures so as to avoid adverse hydraulic impacts. Adverse hydraulic impacts include, but are not limited to: raising the groundwater table so as to cause surface ponding; flooding of basements and other subsurface structures and areas; preventing a stormwater infiltration basin from completely draining via infiltration within seventy-two (72) hours of a design storm event; and interference with the proper operation of subsurface sewage disposal systems and other surface and subsurface facilities in the vicinity of the groundwater recharge measure. 
3.  The standards for groundwater recharge required by this section shall be met using the methods, calculations and assumptions provided in Section 16.45.030. 
4.  Exceptions. The preceding groundwater recharge standards shall not apply to sites that create less than one acre of disturbance. 
D.  Erosion Control Standards. The minimum design and performance standards for erosion control are those established under the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq., and its implementing regulations, N.J.A.C. 2:90-1.1 through 1.4. 
E.  Stormwater Runoff Quality Standards. 
1.  There shall be no direct discharge of stormwater runoff from any point or nonpoint source to any surface waterbody. 
2.  Stormwater management measures shall be designed to reduce the total suspended solids (TSS) load in the stormwater runoff from the post-developed site by eighty (80) percent expressed as an annual average. 
3.  Stormwater management measures shall also be designed to reduce the nutrient load in the stormwater runoff from the post-developed site by the maximum extent practicable. In achieving this reduction, the design of the development site shall include nonstructural and structural stormwater management measures that optimize nutrient removal while still achieving the groundwater recharge, runoff quantity and rate, and TSS removal standards in this section. 
4.  The standards for stormwater runoff quality required by this section shall be met using the methods, calculations, assumptions and pollutant removal rates provided in Section 16.45.030. 
5.  Exceptions. 
a.  The preceding stormwater runoff quality standards shall not apply to the following major development sites: 
i.  Major development sites where less than one-quarter acre of additional impervious surface is proposed; or 
ii.  Major residential development sites that create less than one acre of disturbance. 
b.  The TSS reduction requirement in subsection (F)(2) of this section shall not apply to any stormwater runoff in a discharge regulated under a numeric effluent limitation for TSS imposed under the NJPDES rules (N.J.A.C. 7:14A) or in a discharge specifically exempt under a NJPDES permit from this requirement. 
c.  The stormwater runoff quantity and rate standards in subsection B of this section shall still be met for all major development sites.

(Ord. 7-2006 § 4) 
16.45.050 - Design, construction, and safety standards for structural stormwater management measures. 
A.  General Design and Construction Standards. 
1.  Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed to meet the standards established in this section. These standards have been developed to protect public safety, conserve natural features, create an aesthetically pleasing site and promote proper on-site stormwater management. The Township of East Greenwich may require existing basins that pose a public health or safety hazard to be retrofitted to comply with the standards in this subsection. 
2.  The following structural stormwater management measures may be utilized as part of a stormwater management system at a major land development in the Township of East Greenwich, provided that the applicant demonstrates that they are designed, constructed and maintained so as to meet the standards and requirements established by this chapter. If alternative stormwater management measures are proposed, the applicant shall demonstrate that the selected measures will achieve the standards established by this chapter. 
a.  Bioretention systems; 
b.  Constructed stormwater wetlands; 
c.  Extended detention basins; 
d.  Infiltration basins; 
e.  Vegetated filter strips; 
f.  Infiltration basins and trenches; 
g.  Wet ponds with suitable liners; 
h.  Pervious paving systems; and 
i.  Manufactured treatment devices, provided their pollutant removal rates are verified by the New Jersey Corporation for Advanced Technology and certified by the NJDEP. 
3.  Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed to take into account the existing site conditions, including environmentally critical areas, wetlands, flood-prone areas, slopes, depth to seasonal high water table, soil type, permeability and texture, and drainage area and drainage patterns. 
4.  Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed and constructed to be strong, durable, and corrosion-resistant (measures that are consistent with the relevant portions of the Residential Site Improvement Standards at N.J.A.C. 5:21-7.3, 7.4, and 7.8 shall be deemed to meet this requirement); to minimize and facilitate maintenance and repairs; and to ensure proper functioning. 
5.  For all stormwater management measures at a development site, each applicant shall submit a detailed inspection, maintenance and repair plan consistent with the requirements of Section 16.45.050 of this chapter. 
6.  To the maximum extent practicable, the design engineer shall design structural stormwater management measures on the development site in a manner that: 
a.  Limits site disturbance, maximizes stormwater management efficiencies, and maintains or improves aesthetic conditions; 
b.  Utilizes multiple stormwater management measures, smaller in size and distributed spatially throughout the land development site, instead of a single larger structural stormwater management measure; 
c.  Incorporates Pretreatment Measures. Pretreatment can extend the functional life and increase the pollutant removal capability of a structural stormwater management measure. Pretreatment measures may be designed in accordance with the New Jersey BMP Manual or other sources approved by the municipal engineer. 
7.  Stormwater management basins shall be designed in a manner that complements and mimics the existing natural landscape, including but not limited to the following design strategies: 
a.  Use of natural, non-wetland wooded depressions for stormwater runoff storage; and 
b.  Establishment of attractive landscaping in and around the basin that mimics the existing vegetation and incorporates native plants. 
8.  Stormwater management basins shall be designed with gently sloping sides. The maximum allowable basin side slope shall be three horizontal to one vertical. 
9.  Guidance on the design and construction of structural stormwater management measures may be found in the New Jersey BMP Manual. Other guidance sources may also be used upon approval by the municipal engineer. 
10.  After all construction activities and required field testing have been completed on the development site, as-built plans depicting design and as-built elevations of all stormwater management measures shall be prepared by a licensed land surveyor and submitted to the municipal engineer. Based upon the municipal engineer's review of the as-built plans, all corrections or remedial actions deemed by the municipal engineer to be necessary due to the failure to comply with the standards established by this chapter and/or any reasons of public health or safety, shall be completed by the applicant. In lieu of review by the municipal engineer, the Township of East Greenwich reserves the right to engage a professional engineer to review the as-built plans. The applicant shall pay all costs associated with such review. 
B.  Design and Construction Standards for Stormwater Infiltration BMP's. 
1.  Stormwater infiltration BMP's, such as bioretention systems with infiltration, dry wells, infiltration basins, pervious paving systems with storage beds, and sand filters with infiltration, shall be designed, constructed and maintained to completely drain the total runoff volume generated by the basin's maximum design storm within seventy-two (72) hours after a storm event. Runoff storage for greater times can render the BMP ineffective and may result in anaerobic conditions; odor and both water quality and mosquito breeding problems. 
2.  Stormwater infiltration BMPs shall be designed, constructed and maintained to provide a minimum separation of at least two feet between the elevation of the lowest point of the bottom of the infiltration BMP and the seasonal high water table. 
3.  A stormwater infiltration BMP shall be sited in suitable soils verified by field testing to have permeability rates between one and twenty (20) inches per hour. If such site soils do not exist or if the design engineer demonstrates that it is not practical for engineering, environmental or safety reasons to site the stormwater infiltration BMP(s) in such soils, then the stormwater infiltration BMP(s) may be sited in soils verified by field testing to have permeability rates in excess of twenty (20) inches per hour, provided that a bioretention system, designed, installed and maintained in accordance with the New Jersey BMP Manual, is installed to meet one of the following conditions: 
a.  The bioretention system is constructed as a separate measure designed to provide pretreatment of stormwater and to convey the pretreated stormwater into the infiltration BMP; or 
b.  The bioretention system is integrated into and made part of the infiltration BMP and, as such, does not require an underdrain system. If this option is selected, the infiltration BMP shall be designed and constructed so that the maximum water depth in the bioretention system portion of the BMP during treatment of the stormwater quality design storm is twelve (12) inches in accordance with the New Jersey BMP Manual. 
4.  The minimum design permeability rate for the soil within a BMP that relies on infiltration shall be one-half inch per hour. A factor of safety of two shall be applied to the soil's field-tested permeability rate to determine the soil's design permeability rate. For example, if the field-tested permeability rate of the soil is four inches per hour, its design permeability rate would be two inches per hour. The minimum design permeability rate for the soil within a stormwater infiltration basin shall also be sufficient to achieve the minimum seventy-two (72) hour drain time described in subsection (B)(1) above. The maximum design permeability shall be ten (10) inches per hour. 
5.  A soil's field tested permeability rate shall be determined in accordance with the following: 
a.  The pre-development field test permeability rate shall be determined according to the methodologies provided in the appendix of this chapter; 
b.  The results of the required field permeability tests shall demonstrate a minimum tested infiltration rate of one inch per hour; 
c.  After all construction activities have been completed on the site and the finished grade has been established in the infiltration BMP, post-development field permeability tests shall also be conducted according to the methodologies provided in the appendix of this chapter; 
d.  If the results of the post-development field permeability tests fail to achieve the minimum required design permeability rates in subsection (B)(5) above utilizing a factor of safety of two, the stormwater infiltration BMP shall be renovated and re-tested until such minimum required design permeability rates are achieved; and 
e.  The results of all field permeability tests shall be certified by a professional engineer and transmitted to the municipal engineer. 
6.  To help ensure maintenance of the design permeability rate over time, a six-inch layer of K5 soil shall be placed on the bottom of a stormwater infiltration BMP. This soil layer shall meet the textural and permeability specifications of a K5 soil as provided at N.J.A.C. 7:9A, Appendix A, Figure 6, and be certified to meet these specifications by a professional engineer licensed in the state of New Jersey. The depth to the seasonal high water table shall be measured from the bottom of the K5 sand layer. 
7.  The design engineer shall assess the hydraulic impact on the groundwater table and design the project site and all stormwater infiltration basins so as to avoid adverse hydraulic impacts. Adverse hydraulic impacts include, but are not limited to: raising the groundwater table so as to cause surface ponding; flooding of basements and other subsurface structures and areas; preventing a stormwater infiltration basin from completely draining via infiltration within seventy-two (72) hours of a design storm event; and interference with the proper operation of subsurface sewage disposal systems and other surface and subsurface structures in the vicinity of the stormwater infiltration basin. 
8.  The design engineer shall conduct a mounding analysis, as defined in Section 16.45.070, of all stormwater infiltration BMPs. The mounding analysis shall be conducted in accordance with the requirements in the appendix of this chapter. 
9.  Stormwater infiltration BMPs shall be constructed in accordance with the following: 
a.  To avoid sedimentation that may result in clogging and reduce the basin's permeability rate, stormwater infiltration basins shall be constructed according to the following: 
i.  Unless the conditions in subsection (B)(9)(a)(ii) below are met, a stormwater infiltration basin shall not be placed into operation until its drainage area is completely stabilized. Instead, upstream runoff shall be diverted around the basin and into separate, temporary stormwater management facilities and sediment basins. Such temporary facilities and basins shall be installed and utilized for stormwater management and sediment control until stabilization is achieved in accordance with the Standards for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control in New Jersey, which is incorporated herein by reference as amended and supplemented. 
ii.  If the design engineer determines that, for engineering, environmental or safety reasons, temporary stormwater management facilities and sediment basins cannot be constructed on the site, the stormwater infiltration basin may be placed into operation prior to the complete stabilization of its drainage area provided that the basin's bottom during this period is constructed at a depth at least two feet higher than its final design elevation. All other infiltration BMP construction requirements in this section shall be followed. When the drainage area is completely stabilized, all accumulated sediment shall be removed from the infiltration BMP, which shall then be excavated to its final design elevation in accordance with the construction requirements of this section and the performance standards in Section 16.45.040. 
b.  To avoid compaction of subgrade soils of BMP's that rely on infiltration, no heavy equipment such as backhoes, dump trucks or bulldozers shall be permitted to operate within the footprint of the BMP. All excavation required to construct a stormwater infiltration BMP shall be performed by equipment placed outside the BMP. If this is not possible, the soils within the excavated area shall be renovated and tilled after construction is completed to reverse the effects of compaction. In addition, post-development soil permeability testing shall be performed in accordance with subsection (B)(5) of this section. 
c.  Earthwork associated with stormwater infiltration BMP construction, including excavation, grading, cutting, or filling, shall not be performed when soil moisture content is above the lower plastic limit. 
C.  Safety Standards for Structural Stormwater Management Measures. 
1.  If a structural stormwater management measure has an outlet structure, escape provisions shall be incorporated in or on the structure. Escape provisions means the permanent installation of ladders, steps, rungs, or other features that provide readily accessible means of ingress and egress from the outlet structure. 
2.  A trash rack is a device intended to intercept runoff-borne trash and debris that might otherwise block the hydraulic openings in an outlet structure of a structural stormwater management measure. Trash racks shall be installed upstream of such outlet structure openings as necessary to ensure proper functioning of the structural stormwater management measure in accordance with the following: 
a.  The trash rack should be constructed primarily of bars aligned in the direction of flow with one inch spacing between the bars to the elevation of the water quality design storm. For elevations higher than the water quality design storm, the bars shall be spaced no greater than one-third the width of the hydraulic opening it is protecting or six inches, whichever is less. Transverse bars aligned perpendicular to flow should be sized and spaced as necessary for rack stability and strength. 
b.  The trash rack shall not adversely affect the hydraulic performance of either the outlet structure opening it is protecting or the overall outlet structure. 
c.  The trash rack shall have sufficient net open area under clean conditions to limit the peak design storm velocity through it to a maximum of two and one-half feet per second. 
d.  The trash rack shall be constructed and installed to be rigid, durable, and corrosion resistant, and shall be designed to withstand a perpendicular live loading of three hundred (300) pounds per square foot. 
3.  An overflow grate is a device intended to protect the opening in the top of a stormwater management measure outlet structure. If an outlet structure has an overflow grate, such grate shall meet the following requirements: 
a.  The overflow grate shall be secured to the outlet structure but removable for emergencies and maintenance; 
b.  The overflow grate spacing shall be no more than two inches across the smallest dimension; and 
c.  The overflow grate shall be constructed and installed to be rigid, durable, and corrosion resistant, and shall be designed to withstand a perpendicular live loading of three hundred (300) pounds per square foot. 
4.  The maximum side slope for an earthen dam, embankment, or berm shall not be steeper than three horizontal to one vertical. 
5.  Safety ledges shall be constructed on the slopes of all new structural stormwater management measures having a permanent pool of water deeper than two and one-half feet. Such safety ledges shall be comprised of two steps. Each step shall be four to six feet in width. One step shall be located approximately two and one-half feet below the permanent water surface, and the second step shall be located one to one and one-half feet above the permanent water surface. See subsection (C)(5)(a) below, for an illustration of safety ledges in a stormwater management basin.

G.  Requirements for Inspection, Maintenance and Repair of Stormwater BMP's that Rely on Infiltration. If a stormwater infiltration BMP is incorporated into the design of a major development, the applicant shall include the following requirements in its inspection, maintenance and repair plan: 
1.  Once per month (if needed): Mow side slopes, remove litter and debris, stabilize eroded banks, repair erosion at inflow structure(s); 
2.  After every storm exceeding one inch of rainfall: Ensure that infiltration BMPs drain completely within seventy-two (72) hours after the storm event. If stored water fails to infiltrate seventy-two (72) hours after the end of the storm, corrective measures shall be taken. Raking or tilling by light equipment can assist in maintaining infiltration capacity and break up clogged surfaces; 
3.  Four times per year (quarterly): Inspect stormwater infiltration BMPs for clogging and excessive debris and sediment accumulation within the BMP, remove sediment (if needed) when completely dry; 
4.  Two times per year: Inspect for signs of damage to structures, repair eroded areas, check for signs of petroleum contamination and remediate; 
5.  Once per year: Inspect BMPs for unwanted tree growth and remove if necessary, disc or otherwise aerate bottom of infiltration basin to a minimum depth of six inches; and 
6.  After every storm exceeding one inch of rainfall, inspect and, if necessary, remove and replace K5 sand layer and accumulated sediment, to restore original infiltration rate; 
7.  Additional guidance for the inspection, maintenance and repair of stormwater infiltration BMPs can be found in the New Jersey BMP Manual. 
H.  Maintenance Guarantee. 
I.  The applicant shall provide a maintenance guarantee in accordance with N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53 to ensure that all stormwater management measures required under the provisions of this chapter will be maintained in accordance with the specifications established herein. 
2.  Additionally, for those stormwater management measures that are to be inspected, maintained and repaired by a public agency, the Township of East Greenwich shall collect an up-front fee from the applicant in the amount the Township of East Greenwich determines is needed to provide long-term inspection, maintenance and repair of all stormwater management measures. This up-front fee shall be placed in a dedicated cash management account and expended by the Township of East Greenwich for the sole purpose of conducting inspection, maintenance and repair activities for all stormwater management measures required under the applicant's major development application approval. The calculation of the fee shall be based upon the inspection, maintenance and repair plan (plan) required to be prepared by the applicant and approved by the Township of East Greenwich. The plan shall include an estimate of the present value of the cost to inspect, maintain and repair the stormwater management measure(s) in accordance with the plan for the useful life of those measure(s). The Township of East Greenwich shall furnish the applicant their published hourly rates as prescribed by their salary ordinance for public works' and other personnel having responsibilities associated with stormwater management. Added to this fee shall be an amount mutually determined by the Township of East Greenwich and the applicant to account for the reconstruction of stormwater management measures that are reasonably anticipated to be subject to long-term failure. After an agreed number of years, depending on the type of measure(s), the measure(s) will need to be reconstructed. The amount shall be based on the future value of the measure(s) being reconstructed. Both inflation rates and bank interest rates shall be based on the ten (10) year average published in the Wall Street Journal or other approved publication. Interest accruing in the account must also be accounted for at an agreed upon interest rate, to arrive at an amount. The costs for reconstructing the measure(s) shall be taken from the engineer's probable cost estimate that is utilized to determine the amount of the required performance guarantee. It is acceptable to attach a percentage of failure to certain line items in the estimate. 
3.  Additionally, for those stormwater management measures that are to be inspected, maintained and repaired by a homeowners' association, condominium association or some other form of non-public ownership, no fee shall be collected by the Township of East Greenwich. Instead, the ownership entity shall establish and maintain a fund for the annual inspection and testing program, annual maintenance and repair program and annual contribution to a contingency fund for long-term reconstruction. 
    The initial costs agreed to for the annual inspection and testing program and annual maintenance and repair program shall be based upon actual itemized proposals offered to the applicant by prospective vendors. The annual cost expended on inspection, testing and maintenance shall be reported to the Township of East Greenwich to verify that maintenance is not being deferred and to inform the Township of East Greenwich on the magnitude of those services. 
    The contingency fund shall require sufficient funds to be committed for long-term reconstruction of the stormwater management measure(s). Major reconstruction activities will necessitate proper financial planning. After an agreed number of years, depending on the type of measure(s), the measure(s) will need to be reconstructed. The contingency fund in the financial schedule shall be based on the future value of the measure being reconstructed. Both inflation rates and bank interest rates shall be based on the ten (10) year average published in the Wall Street Journal or other approved publication. Interest accruing in the account must also be accounted for at an agreed upon interest rate, to arrive at an annual contribution amount.

3.  Methods for Assessing Soil Suitability for Infiltration Stormwater Management BMPs. The results of a subsurface investigation shall serve as the basis for the site selection and design of stormwater infiltration BMPs. The subsurface investigation shall include, but not be limited to, a series of soil test pits and soil permeability tests conducted in accordance with the following: 
a)  All soil test pits and soil permeability results shall be performed under the direct supervision of a Professional Engineer. All soil logs and permeability test data shall be accompanied by a certification by a Professional Engineer. The results and location (horizontal and vertical) of all soil test pits and soil permeability tests, both passing and failing, shall be reported to the Township of East Greenwich. 
b)  During all subsurface investigations and soil test procedures, adequate safety measures shall be taken to prohibit unauthorized access to the excavations at all times. It is the responsibility of persons performing or witnessing subsurface investigations and soil permeability tests to comply with all applicable Federal, State and local laws and regulations governing occupational safety. 
c)  A minimum of two (2) soil test pits shall be excavated within the footprint of any proposed infiltration BMP to determine the suitability and distribution of soil types present at the site. Placement of the test pits shall be within twenty (20) feet of the basin perimeter, located along the longest axis bisecting the BMP. For BMPs larger than ten thousand (10,000) square feet in area, a minimum of one (1) additional soil test pit shall be conducted within each additional area of ten thousand (10,000) square feet. The additional test pit(s) shall be placed approximately equidistant to other test pits, so as to provide adequate characterization of the subsurface material. In all cases, where soil and or groundwater properties vary significantly, additional test pits shall be excavated in order to accurately characterize the subsurface conditions below the proposed infiltration BMP. Soil test pits shall extend to a minimum depth of eight (8) feet below the lowest elevation of the basin bottom or to a depth that is at least two (2) times the maximum potential water depth in the proposed infiltration BMP, whichever is greater. 
d)  A soil test pit log shall be prepared for each soil test pit. The test pit log shall, at a minimum, provide the elevation of the existing ground surface, the depth and thickness (in inches) of each soil horizon or substratum, the dominant matrix or background and mottle colors using the Munsell system of classification for hue, value and chroma, the appropriate textural class as shown on the USDA textural triangle, the volume percentage of coarse fragments (larger than two (2) millimeters in diameter), the abundance, size, and contrast of mottles, the soil structure, soil consistence, and soil moisture condition, using standard USDA classification terminology for each of these soil properties. Soil test pit logs shall identify the presence of any soil horizon, substratum or other feature that exhibits an in-place permeability rate less than one (1) inch per hour. 
e)  Each soil test pit log shall report the depth to seasonally high water level, either perched or regional, and the static water level based upon the presence of soil mottles or other redoximorphic features, and observed seepage or saturation. Where redoxomorphic features including soil mottles resulting from soil saturation are present, they shall be interpreted to represent the depth to the seasonal high water table unless soil saturation or seepage is observed at a higher level. When the determination of the seasonally high water table shall be made in ground previously disturbed by excavation, direct observation of the static water table during the months of January through April shall be the only method permitted. 
f)  Any soil horizon or substratum which exists immediately below a perched zone of saturation shall be deemed by rule to exhibit unacceptable permeability (less than one (1) inch per hour). The perched zone of saturation may be observed directly, inferred based upon soil morphology, or confirmed by performance of a hydraulic head test as defined at N.J.A.C. 7:9A-5.9. 
g)  Stormwater infiltration BMPs shall not be installed in soils that exhibit artesian groundwater conditions. A permeability test shall be conducted in all soils that immediately underlie a perched zone of saturation. Any zone of saturation which is present below a soil horizon which exhibits an in-place permeability of less than 0.2 inches per hour shall be considered an artesian zone of saturation unless a minimum one foot thick zone of unsaturated soil, free of mottling or other redoximorphic features and possessing a chroma of four or higher, exists immediately below the unsuitable soil. 
h)  A minimum of one (1) permeability test shall be performed at each soil test pit location. The soil permeability rate shall be determined using test methodology as prescribed in N.J.A.C. 7:9A-6.2 (Tube Permeameter Test), 6.5 (Pit Bailing Test) or 6.6 (Piezometer Test). When the tube permeameter test is used, a minimum of two replicate samples shall be taken and tested. Alternative permeability test procedures may be accepted by the approving authority provided the test procedure attains saturation of surrounding soils, accounts for hydraulic head effects on infiltration rates, provides a permeability rate with units expressed in inches per hour and is accompanied by a published source reference. Examples of suitable sources include hydrogeology, geotechnical or engineering text and design manuals, proceedings of American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) symposia, or peer-review journals. Neither a Soil Permeability Class Rating Test, as described in N.J.A.C. 7:9A-6.3, nor a Percolation Test, as described in N.J.A.C. 7:9A-6.4, are acceptable tests for establishing permeability values for the purpose of complying with this ordinance. 
i)  Soil permeability tests shall be conducted on the most hydraulically restrictive horizon or substratum to be left in place below the basin as follows. Where no soil replacement is proposed, the permeability tests shall be conducted on the most hydraulically restrictive horizon or substratum within four (4) feet of the lowest elevation of the basin bottom or to a depth equal to two (2) times the maximum potential water depth within the basin, whichever is greater. Where soil replacement is proposed, the permeability tests shall be conducted within the soil immediately below the depth of proposed soil replacement or within the most hydraulically restrictive horizon or substratum to a depth equal to two (2) times the maximum potential water depth within the basin, whichever is greater. Permeability tests may be performed on the most hydraulically restrictive soil horizons or substrata at depths greater than those identified above based upon the discretion of the design or testing engineer. The tested infiltration rate should then be divided by two (2) to establish the soil's design permeability rate. Such division will provide a 100% safety factor to the tested rate. 
j)  The minimum acceptable "tested permeability rate" of any soil horizon or substratum shall be one (1) inch per hour. Soil materials that exhibit tested permeability rates slower than one (1) inch per hour shall be considered unsuitable for stormwater infiltration. The maximum reportable "tested permeability rate" of any soil horizon or substratum shall be no greater than twenty (20) inches per hour regardless of the rate attained in the test procedure. 
k)  After all construction activities have been completed on the development site and the finished grade has been established in the infiltration BMP, a minimum of one permeability test shall be conducted within the most hydraulically restrictive soil horizon or substratum below the as-built BMP to ensure the performance of the infiltration BMP is as designed. Hand tools and manual permeability test procedures shall be used for the purpose of confirming BMP performance. In addition, the infiltration BMP shall be flooded with water sufficient to demonstrate the performance of the BMP. Test results shall be certified to the municipal engineer. 
l)  A groundwater mounding analysis shall be provided for each stormwater infiltration BMP. The groundwater mounding analysis shall calculate the maximum height of the groundwater mound based upon the volume of the maximum design storm. The Professional Engineer conducting the analysis shall provide the municipal engineer with the methodology and supporting documentation for the mounding analysis used and shall certify to the Township of East Greenwich, based upon the analysis, that the groundwater mound will not cause stormwater or groundwater to breakout to the land surface or cause adverse impact to adjacent surface water bodies, wetlands or subsurface structures including but not limited to basements and septic systems. If there is more than one infiltration BMP proposed, the model shall indicate if and how the mounds will interact. The mounding analysis shall be calculated using the most restrictive soil horizon that will remain in place within the explored aquifer thickness unless alternative analyses are authorized by the municipal engineer. The mounding analysis shall be accompanied by a cross section of the infiltration BMP and surrounding topography and the mound analysis shall extend out to the point(s) at which the mound intersects with the preexisting maximum water table elevation. 
m)  The applicant shall demonstrate that stormwater infiltration BMPs meet the seventy-two (72) hour drain time requirement established in Section V.B.1 of this ordinance. 
D.  Pretreatment measures for infiltration BMPs. By reducing incoming velocities and capturing coarser sediments, pretreatment can extend the functional life and increase the pollutant removal capability of infiltration measures. Therefore, the installation of pretreatment measures is recommended for all development sites. Pretreatment measures may include, but are not limited to, the following: 
1.  Vegetative filter strips; 
2.  Bioretention systems. Used in conjunction with a bioretention system, the infiltration basin takes the place of the standard underdrain; 
3.  Sand filters; 
4.  Grassed swales; and 
5.  Detention basins. 
E.  Collection and Conveyance. 
1.  Bicycle-safe inlet grates. Site development plans that incorporate site design features that help to prevent discharge of trash and debris from drainage systems shall comply with the following standard to control passage of solid and floatable materials through storm drain inlets. For purposes of this paragraph, "solid and floatable materials" means sediment, debris, trash, and other floating, suspended, or settleable solids. 
a)  Design engineers shall use either of the following grates whenever they use a grate in pavement or another ground surface to collect stormwater from that surface into a storm drain or surface water body under that grate: 
i.  The New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) bicycle safe grate, which is described in Chapter 2.4 of the NJDOT Bicycle Compatible Roadways and Bikeways Planning and Design Guidelines (April 1996); or 
ii.  A different grate, if each individual clear space in that grate has an area of no more than seven (7) square inches, or is no greater than one half (0.5) inch across the smallest dimension. Examples of grates subject to this standard include grates in grate inlets, the grate portion (non-curb-opening portion) of combination inlets, grates on storm sewer manholes, ditch grates, trench grates, and grates of spacer bars in slotted drains. Examples of ground surfaces include surfaces of roads (including bridges), driveways, parking areas, bikeways, plazas, sidewalks, lawns, fields, open channels, and stormwater basin floors. 
b)  Whenever design engineers use a curb-opening inlet, the clear space in that curb opening (or each individual clear space, if the curb opening has two or more clear spaces) shall have an area of no more than seven (7) square inches, or be no greater than two (2) inches across the smallest dimension. 
c)  This standard does not apply: 
i.  Where the review agency determines that this standard would cause inadequate hydraulic performance that could not practicably be overcome by using additional or larger storm drain inlets that meet these standards; 
ii.  Where flows from the water quality design storm as specified in Section III are conveyed through any device (e.g., end-of-pipe netting facility, manufactured treatment device, or a catch basin hood) that is designed, at a minimum, to prevent delivery of all solid and floatable materials that could not pass through one of the following: 
(a)  A rectangular space four and five-eighths (4 and 5/8) inches long and one and one-half (1.5) inches wide (this option does not apply for outfall netting facilities); or 
(b)  A bar screen having a bar spacing of one-half (0.5) inch. 
iii.  Where flows are conveyed through a trash rack that has parallel bars with one (1) inch spacing between the bars, to the elevation of the water quality design storm as specified in Section III of this ordinance; or 
iv.  Where the NJDEP determines, pursuant to the New Jersey Register of Historic Places Rules at N.J.A.C. 7:4-7.2(c), that action to meet this standard is an undertaking that constitutes an encroachment or will damage or destroy the New Jersey Register listed historic property. 
2.  Catch basins. Catch basins are storm drain inlets with or without sumps. Catch basins may provide pretreatment for other stormwater BMPs by capturing large sediments. The sediment and pollutant removal efficiency of catch basins depends on the size of the sump and the performance of routine maintenance to retain the available sediment storage space in the sump. Where catch basins with sumps are proposed, the minimum two feet separation between the bottom of the sump and seasonally high water table shall be provided. 
3.  Open or perforated conveyance piping. Where adequate separation to the seasonal high water table exists, stormwater from the development site may be conveyed to a stormwater basin via a system of perforated. pipes. These pipes may be made of PVC or corrugated metal and are available with perforations of varying size and spacing. Perforated pipe specifications shall be certified by a Professional Engineer. A Professional Engineer shall certify that perforated conveyance piping will not act to intercept the seasonal high water table and convey groundwater to the stormwater basin. All open or perforated stormwater conveyance systems shall be installed with a minimum separation of two (2) feet from the seasonal high water table.

Chapter 16.49 - COMPREHENSIVE WATER CONSERVATION PLAN 

16.49.010 - Purpose, intent. 
    It is declared that the public health, safety and welfare require that the Township of East Greenwich maximize the beneficial use of its available natural resources and that the waste or unreasonable use or unreasonable method of use of water be prevented. The conservation of such potable water resource is to be extended with a view to the reasonable and beneficial use thereof as is necessary for sanitary, domestic and firefighting purposes in the interests of the people of the Township of East Greenwich. The purpose of the conservation measures set forth in this chapter is to prevent the need to declare a water emergency in the township. 
(Ord. 9A-2006 (part): Ord. 8-2006 (part)) 
16.49.020 - Water conservation. 
    It is unlawful for anyone in the Township of East Greenwich to make, cause, use or permit the use of water from the township for residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural, governmental or any other purpose in a manner contrary to any provision herein. 
A.  It is unlawful for any person to waste water or to use it unreasonably. Unreasonable uses of water shall include, but are not limited to, the following practices: No one shall let water leave a property by drainage onto adjacent properties or public or private roadways or streets due to excessive irrigation and/or uncorrected leaks. 
B.  The following water conservation measures shall apply, except when reclaimed water is used: 
    Outside water usage on alternate days shall be allowed for by persons or businesses having even house or box numbers on even days and those having odd house or box numbers on odd days with outside water usage being completely banned and prohibited on the thirty-first day of any month during the water emergency. Any other usage is prohibited, except as set forth below. 
1.  Lawn watering and landscape irrigation, including construction irrigation, is permitted only on the "odd-even" designated days as set forth above. Watering is permitted at any time if: 
a.  A hand-held hose equipped with a positive shut-off nozzle is used; or 
b.  A hand-held container is used; or 
c.  A drip irrigation system is used. 
    Commercial nurseries, commercial sod farms, athletic fields, and parks open for use to the general public, are exempt from these irrigation restrictions but will be required to curtail all nonessential water use. 
    Newly sodded or seeded lawns may be watered for a period of fourteen (14) days without the odd/even day restriction, with prior written approval of the water and sewer department. 
    All newly installed irrigation systems shall include an automatic rain sensor that will shut off the irrigation system during a rain event. 
2.  The washing of automobiles, trucks, trailers, boats, airplanes and other types of mobile equipment, is permitted at any time with a hand-held bucket or a hand-held hose equipped with a positive shut-off nozzle for quick rinses. Washing may be done at any time on the immediate premises of a commercial car wash or commercial service station, or by a mobile car wash or on-site car wash using high-pressure washing equipment. Further, such washings are exempted from these regulations where the health, safety and welfare of the public are contingent upon frequent vehicle cleanings, such as garbage trucks and vehicles to transport food and perishables. 
3.  The overfilling of swimming pools and spas is prohibited. Whenever possible, water from the draining of swimming pools shall not be drained directly into the street or into storm drains but shall be beneficially reused. Beneficial reuse consists of, but is not limited to, watering of gardens, trees/shrubs, and lawns where the water is allowed to seep into the ground. 
4.  Use of water from fire hydrants shall be limited to firefighting, related activities or other activities necessary to maintain the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of East Greenwich. 
5.  Water shall not be used to wash down sidewalks, driveways, parking areas, tennis courts, patios or other paved areas, except to alleviate immediate fire or sanitation hazards. High-pressure washing of such surfaces will be permitted. 
6.  Ornamental fountains and garden ponds may operate if they recirculate water. Ornamental fountains and garden ponds that do not recycle water are prohibited. 
7.  Construction operations receiving water from a construction meter or water truck shall not use water unnecessarily for any purposes other than those required by regulatory agencies.

A.  Connection to Existing System-Construction of New System. Where a public wastewater treatment plant and collection system is accessible, or where such facilities are to be constructed as a condition of approval of any application for development, the developer shall construct such wastewater treatment facilities or sanitary sewer lines and building connections in accordance with the design criteria and permit requirements of the municipal utilities authority for East Greenwich Township and those of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and in such a manner as to make adequate sewage treatment available to each lot and building within the development. 
B.  Individual Systems. Where the soil characteristics of the subject land are of such quality as to permit the use of individual subsurface sewage disposal systems as a temporary means of sewage disposal, the same may be approved in the absence of accessibility to a public wastewater treatment plant or the construction of such treatment facilities by the developer. 
(Prior code § 13-31.5) 
Chapter 16.53 - TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES 

16.53.10 - Location. 
    Any applicant for the placement, erection and location of wireless cellular telecommunications towers and/or antennas and associated ground-based equipment (i.e.: "telecommunications facility") must first contact the mayor and township committee to determine if land and/or existing facilities owned by the township are available to accommodate the proposed telecommunications facility. Telecommunications facilities must be located on or at township-owned land/facilities (i.e.: "township-owned property"), unless, upon a proper showing by the applicant, the proposed facility would not be viable on any such township-owned property due to the inability of the township-owned property to: (A) accommodate the proposed telecommunications facility's needs; or (B) provide adequate telecommunications coverage consistent with the carrier's FCC-approved license and/or franchise. In any such event, the proposed telecommunications facility shall be collocated at an already existing telecommunications facility in East Greenwich Township, unless no such pre-existing telecommunications facility is available or suited to the proposed coverage area and/or the physical needs of the proposed facility. In all such instances at set forth herein, it is the burden of the applicant to prove to the township committee that its proposed facility cannot be placed on or within township-owned property, or to the planning/zoning board that the proposed facility cannot be collocated at an already pre-existing telecommunications facility within the township. If it is determined that the proposed telecommunications facility can be located on township-owned property, then the applicant shall negotiate a lease with the township prior to applying for the township's planning/zoning board for such further relief and approvals as are necessary. 
(Ord. 20-2008, § 1) 
16.53.20 - Use. 
    Any telecommunications facility proposed to be located on township-owned property, regardless of the zone district in which said township-owned property is located, or to be co-located at an existing telecommunications facility, regardless of the zone district in which said existing telecommunications facility is located, shall be deemed to be a "conditional use", as that term is defined in NJSA 40:55D-3, and shall be subject to all applicable bulk and area standards as set forth in the specific zone district in which the proposed facility is to be located, unless a variance from said standards is sought and granted. In addition to the foregoing, any applicant for a telecommunications facility on either township-owned property, or at an existing telecommunications facility, shall be required to submit a minor site plan application to the planning board. Except as set forth herein as to township-owned property, or property on which is an existing telecommunications facility, no such facility shall be considered as a permitted use anywhere else in the township. 
(Ord. 20-2008, § 1) 
16.53.30 - Compliance requirements. 
    In addition to the foregoing, an applicant for the siting and location of a telecommunications facility within the township shall comply with the following: 
1.  All applicable design, construction, architectural, and other standards as set forth in the township's development, zoning, and/or other applicable sections of the Township Code. 
2.  A showing as to how the proposed facility specifically relates to the suitability of the proposed site. 
3.  A showing as to how the proposed facility relates to the unique and specific needs of the applicant, including, but not limited to, the FCC licensing granted to the applicant, the proposed coverage area, and why no other site within or without East Greenwich Township would be suitable for the needs of the applicant. 
4.  Whether the proposed facility will accommodate the co-location of additional, future cellular communications antennas and associated ground-based equipment at the proposed site by other telecommunications carriers. 
5.  Written evidence of a lease entered into by and between the applicant and the owner of the land on which the proposed telecommunications facility is to be located. 
6.  Evidence submitted to the reasonable satisfaction of the township's planning/zoning board, that no alternative technology can be used to meet the needs of the applicant where such technology does not require the use of towers or structures, such as a cable microcell network using multiple low-powered transmitters/receivers attached to a wireless system. The cost of using such alternative technology shall not be presumed to render the technology unsuitable. 
7.  Evidence submitted to the reasonable satisfaction of the township's planning/zoning board that the proposed telecommunications facility, or any component thereof, will not cause electromagnetic interference with any other private telecommunications facilities/equipment located within the township or any public radio or other telecommunications equipment used for a government purpose, including, but not limited to, equipment and/or communications bands used by "first responders" or other government entities, be they local, county, or state.

(Prior code § 13-33.4) 
Chapter 16.55 - PERFORMANCE STANDARDS 

16.55.010 - General intent. 
    Standards for non-residential development encompass four distinct land use categories as designated on the master plan maps. Lands designated for interstate business and industrial uses are scaled in favored of automobile travelers and will follow traditional planning design criteria. Lands designated commercial, historic and senior citizen, incorporate pedestrian-oriented and mixed-use standards to ensure that it is easy and enjoyable to walk within various areas consisting of shops and offices. To realize the character envisioned for the plan, it is essential that no single building or user dominate the others. There should be a variety of types and sizes of retail and other commercial establishments. The uses should be joined by pedestrian connections whenever possible, and parking lots should be configured and designed in such a manner that they do not visually overwhelm the landscape. 
(Ord. 2004 § 7 (part)) 
16.55.020 - Commercial guidelines and standards. 
A.  Climate Response. Building exteriors should provide shelter from the summer sun and winter winds and snow. Porticos, arcades and overhanging eaves are particularly appropriate at pedestrian pathways. Entryways should be designed to encourage solar access or alternative methods to melt snow and ice, especially on north facing entrances. The orientation of entryways should also consider localized wind conditions. Building locations should consider the safety concerns raised by shadows on parking lots, areas, streets, sidewalks, and other pedestrian areas. 
B.  Principal Orientation. The primary façade of all buildings in the commercial, historic and senior citizen zones should face a public street. The primary façade must also front onto a publicly accessible walkway that leads directly from the street to the establishment's front door. 
C.  Street Hierarchy. All streets should be sized to accommodate projected traffic flow and parking requirements, and they should be pedestrian friendly. At a minimum, all streets should conform to the New Jersey Residential Site Improvements Standards (R.S.I.S.) and the Gloucester County recommended R.O.W. standards, with the exception of Kings Highway. Kings Highway is proposed as a two-lane road with ample green space on both sides of the cartway. There will be ten (10) feet of grass with a street tree, a six-foot side-walk and another ten (10) feet of grass area with another street tree. 
D.  Street-Facing Facades. It is encouraged that street facing facades be lined with windows or other architecturally interesting and varied treatments. The primary entry(ies) of uses in commercial or historic development areas should be encouraged, wherever possible, to be visible and accessible directly from a public street. All buildings, including residences along Kings Highway, should conform to the architectural standards of the historic district. 
E.  Walkway-Facing Facades. The main entrance to all buildings that are without street-facing facades should open directly onto a publicly accessible walkway. This walkway must directly connect to an adjacent street's sidewalk. 
F.  Parking. Parking should be located on the side or the rear of the building and designed in such a manner that it provides a positive street edge and a desirable pedestrian environment. It should also be designed so that the street edge is composed of building walls, landscaping, berming, knee walls, or other edging techniques and materials. The following features are encouraged: 
1.  Landscaping. Parking areas should contain landscaping and pedestrian features that visually break up the parking lots. 
2.  Screening. The perimeter of parking areas adjacent to streets and sidewalks should be screened with a low berm, wall, fence or similar feature, that is a minimum of thirty (30) inches in height. 
3.  Lighting. Sufficient and safe lighting should be provided using cut-off luminaries. Lighting poles along pedestrian walkways should have a maximum height of sixteen (16) feet. Ornamental light fixtures should be located along Kings Highway. 
G.  Front Setbacks. Buildings may be permitted at reduced setbacks of up to twenty-five (25) percent to encourage pedestrian activity for retail and office uses with appropriate architectural design, especially as concerns entryways, materials, and massing, as a means to provide a positive pedestrian environment upon proper showing that such goals are being advanced. Shading and other safety issues should be considered in the building location. 
H.  Height. Variation in building height is encouraged. Commercial, mixed use and civic buildings should not exceed the height limitation in the specific zone. Age qualified residences should not exceed a height of thirty-five (35) feet measured to the mean roof height. Shading and other safety issues should be considered in determining building height. 
I.  Facades and Roof Form. 
1.  Articulation. No wall should have a blank, uninterrupted length exceeding thirty (30) feet, without including one of the following: a revealed pilaster; a change in texture, color or material; or a change in plane, window, lattice or equivalent element. 
2.  Base and Top Architectural Treatments. It is encouraged that all facades be organized into two sections having the following features: 
a.  A recognizable "base" consisting of (but not limited to): (1) thicker walls; (2) richly textured materials (e.g. tile or masonry treatments); (3) special materials such as ceramic tile or similar materials; (4) darker colored materials, mullion and/or panels, and/or (5) enriched landscaping. 
b.  A recognizable "top" consisting of (but not limited to): (1) cornice treatments; (2) roof overhangs with brackets; (3) stepped parapets; (4) richly textured materials (e.g. tile or masonry treatments); and/or (5) differently colored materials. 
3.  Storefronts. It is encouraged that primary facades be lined with windows or other architecturally interesting and varied treatments. 
4.  Entries. Primary pedestrian entries should be clearly expressed with architectural and site planning features. Where possible, entryways should be sheltered from the elements. 
5.  Roof Form. Mechanical equipment should be integrated into the overall mass of a building by screening it on all sides behind parapets, or by recessing equipment into hips, gables, parapets or similar features. 
6.  Service Areas. Architectural or landscaping features should be used to screen service areas from adjacent properties and streets. Screening features should be integrated into the overall design of the development. 
J.  Materials. Buildings in commercial, historic or senior citizen zones should include compatible and locally prominent building materials, used in a manner that creates quality detailing and architectural interest. 
1.  Windows. Windows should be architecturally compatible with design, materials, colors and details of the building. Facades facing a street or common open space should receive special emphasis with regard to placement and the number of windows provided. Mirror glass may be used only in limited applications. 
2.  Simulated Materials. Materials that are poorly simulated should be discouraged. Material changes should not occur at external corners, but may occur at "reverse" or interior corners, or as a "return" at least two feet from external corners. Scored plywood (such as "T-111") is not permitted. 
3.  Proper Application and Detailing. Materials should be properly applied and correctly detailed, especially at the base of buildings, along cornices, eves, parapets or ridge tops, and around entries and windows. 
4.  Durability. Materials should be demonstrated to be of high quality and durability. 
K.  Connecting Walkways. Walkways should link street sidewalks with building entries through the parking lots. They should meet the following minimum requirements: 
1.  Grading and Width. Connecting walkways should be either grade-separated from the parking lot, or delineated by a change in materials with a minimum width of five feet. 
2.  Landscaping. Connecting walkways should be landscaped. 
3.  Lighting. Connecting walkways should be equipped with lighting. Standards should be spaced a maximum of thirty (30) feet apart, and a maximum of twelve (12) feet high. Bollard style lighting is also acceptable. Lighting design should provide sufficient lighting to assure the safety of pedestrian walks and vehicular crosswalks. 
4.  Screening. Any service areas (loading docks/storage areas) adjacent to connecting walkways or residential areas, should be fully screened from view. 
L.  Landscaping, Screening and Street Furnishings. 
1.  Parking Lot Frontage. Where existing parking lots occur along streets, a landscaped area should be provided to minimize views of parked cars from the street. 
2.  Broadleaf Trees. Broadleaf trees should predominate in parking areas and public plazas to provide shade in the summer. 
3.  Screening Devices. Shrubs and conifers should be used with architectural features to screen mechanical equipment, loading areas, etc. 
4.  Screening of Loading Areas and Ground-Mounted Equipment. Loading areas, transformers, heating units and other ground-mounted equipment, should be adequately screened with walls, fences or landscaping. 
5.  Accents. Flowering annuals, perennials, shrubs and trees are encouraged to accent entrances, walkways, plazas and parks. 
6.  Fountains and Artwork. Fountains and artwork are encouraged in courtyards, parks, and plazas. 
7.  Benches, Trash Receptacles and Transit Shelters. These items should be made of durable, high quality materials that complement nearby buildings. 
8.  Streetscape Along Kings Highway. The streetscape along Kings Highway is planned to include two rows of street trees along each side of the roadway separated by a sidewalk. 
9.  Irrigation Systems-Roads. All landscaping along State, county, or municipal roads, should have an irrigation system. 
10.  Irrigation Systems-Non-Residential. All non-residential major site plans should provide irrigation for proposed 1andscaping. 
M.  Fences and Walls. 
1.  Pedestrian Access. Openings should be provided in fences, walls, or walkways connecting directly to the street, to avoid circuitous routes for pedestrians. 
2.  Materials and Detailing. Walls visible from public streets, residential areas and walkway, should be constructed of durable materials that complement nearby buildings.

16.55.030 - Residential guidelines and standards. 
A.  Orientation. Primary facades should contain the primary entry and should be street facing. All primary facades should have windows covering at least twenty-five (25) percent of the faced-area, except garages. Rear yards should be avoided along all collector roads. 
B.  Front Door. With the exception of apartments and accessory dwelling units, every home should have an entry facing a public street. Side entries may be allowed if an entry statement (i.e.: patio, arbor, fence, gate, etc.) is provided on the building facing the street. 
C.  Garages. Garages should not dominate residential streetscape. In locating garages, strategies should include: 
1.  Varying the building and garage setbacks from the street and the public right-of-way. 
2.  Minimizing the extent to which garages protrude from the main plane of the house, including recessing garages on a portion of the homes along the street behind the main plane of the house. 
3.  Varying the style of garage door and panel design. 
D.  Front Porch. Dwelling units should provide a variety of functional entry features. Where front porches are to be built, they should have a minimum depth of eight feet. 
E.  Façade Articulation. All residential buildings should be articulated with varied architectural features such as bays, balconies, decks or porches that face on an adjacent street, park or open space area. 
F.  Street Facing Fences. Fences adjacent to streets and within the front yard setback shall have a maximum height of thirty-six (36) inches. Side yard fencing behind the front setback shall have a maximum height of six feet. Landscaping should be considered on the street-facing side of all fencing, six feet in height. 
G.  Trash and Service Equipment. Trash and service equipment, including ground-mounted satellite-receiving dishes in excess of twenty-four (24) inches, should be located in the rear or side-yard areas, and such equipment shall be enclosed or screened from view through the use of landscaping or fencing. 
(Ord. 2004 § 7 (part)) 
16.55.040 - Detention basins. 
    Detention basins in residential subdivisions should be designed in such a manner that they become a visual amenity to the project. In order to accomplish this, the following shall be required: 
A.  Side slopes of basins are encouraged to be five-to-one whenever possible, and have adequate slope protection. 
B.  Depths from the bottom of any basin to the seasonal high water table ("SHWT") are encouraged to not be less than two feet. 
C.  The maximum overall depth of any basin should not exceed six feet from the top of the berm to the bottom of the basin (i.e.: invert elevation of the outfall structure). 
D.  Any developer proposing to dedicate storm water basins or other similar facilities to the township should fund the required maintenance. The township engineer or designated staff shall provide to the township committee an estimate of the maintenance costs in any such event. 
E.  If a Homeowners' Association (HOA) is formed, the developer shall fund the maintenance of the basin with a capital contribution to a trust fund held by the HOA, the interest of which will be available for the maintenance of the basin. In the event that a HOA shall cease to exist, or defaults on its maintenance obligation, the trust fund will accrue to the township, which will use the interest from such fund to maintain the basin. 
F.  All basins shall be placed on a separate conforming lot wherever possible. 
(Ord. 2004 § 7 (part)) 
16.55.050 - General standards. 
A.  Architectural elevations will be required to be submitted at the time of final site plan and/or subdivision approval. The plans will be reviewed and approved by the planning board and will be made a part of the approved set of documents. Any revisions to the same require the approval of the planning board. 
B.  Buffer Strips. 
1.  A buffer is an area of land that serves as a vegetated shield between uses that are separate and distinct from any other required setbacks. 
2.  Buffering must be provided between residential uses of different density and between residential and nonresidential uses. 
3.  Where a nonresidential use abuts a residential use, the nonresidential user shall provide a buffer consisting of a minimum width of one hundred (100) feet. 
4.  Buffers should be designed and installed to minimize noise; to provide relief from views of loading areas, trash enclosures, parking areas and the like; and to provide a horizontal and vertical separation between different land uses. 
5.  Existing vegetation, particularly hedgerows, should be incorporated into buffers whenever possible. 
6.  Existing woods within the required buffer area shall not be cleared. 
7.  All buffers should be a mixture of trees and shrubs which are predominantly evergreen, as approved by the planning board, and should provide the equivalent of two staggered rows of evergreen trees, each planted ten (10) to twelve (12) feet apart. Evergreen trees shall be at least six to eight feet in height at planting, and be balled, burlapped and sheared. Shrubs shall be a minimum of three feet tall. 
8.  Detention basins may not be included within required buffer areas. 
9.  Where multi-residential or townhouse structures adjoin a single-family area, a minimum buffer of fifty (50) feet in width (which may be reduced to twenty-five (25) feet in width upon a finding by the planning board of appropriateness and/or necessity based on the physical characteristics of the area) should be provided within the multi-residential or townhouse area, unless specified at a greater dimension by use. Where single-family residential structures are adjacent to a non-residential use or zone, a minimum buffer of fifty (50) feet in width shall be provided. 
10.  Where any residential development abuts an active farm use or cultivated field, a minimum buffer of one hundred (100) feet, or a minimum buffer of fifty (50) feet with an opaque fence that is a minimum of six feet in height, shall be provided from the property line of the residential development. The planted buffer area should be exclusive of fencing and individual property lot areas, except as permitted by the planning board based on the unique circumstances or physical characteristics of the development. 
11.  If a road separates two zone districts, a minimum buffer of twenty-five (25) feet in width should be provided within both districts, except for single-family residential development. 
12.  Landscaped buffers should be irrigated to insure the long-term viability of the planted vegetation. 
13.  A minimum one hundred (100) foot buffer must be provided adjacent to all lots on which historically significant structures are located, as identified under "Known and Potential Historic Sites in East Greenwich" in the historic preservation element of the township's master plan. 
(Ord. 2004 § 7 (part)) 
16.55.060 - Energy conservation. 
    Site plans and subdivision layouts, which use natural factors to their advantage, can reduce energy demand by approximately twenty (20) percent. These benefits accrue both to the homeowner, by reducing operating expenses, and to regional energy users, by reducing aggregate energy demand. The following techniques are recommended for all new land development: 
A.  Structures should be oriented toward the southern exposure where possible. 
B.  Window openings on northern exposures should be limited in size and number. 
C.  Windbreaks of evergreen material are recommended both on northern exposures of residential structures and on the northern property exposure. 
D.  Deciduous trees are recommended on western exposures to intercept the summer's setting sun and to allow the energy of the winter sun to pass through. 
(Ord. 2004 § 7 (part)) 
16.55.070 - Open space. 
A.  Lands that are to be dedicated to the township as open space, shall not be so accepted unless they are of a size suitable for a needed public purpose, and have adequate provisions for their protection and maintenance.

(Ord. 2004 § 7 (part)) 
16.55.080 - Vegetation management and tree preservation. 
A.  [Purpose.] The preservation of existing vegetation is imperative in controlling flooding, soil erosion, air and noise pollution; to protect the safety, welfare and health of the citizenry of East Greenwich Township. Developments should be designed to encourage the retention of existing vegetation and to the greater extent practicable, of each specimen tree, regardless of location, and the maximum number of healthy trees within a property or development. 
B.  Applicability and Standards. 
1.  With the exceptions as set forth in this chapter, no person shall cut or remove, or cause to be cut or removed, any tree with a diameter of eight (8) inches or greater upon any lands in the township unless the cutting or removal is accomplished in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. In no case shall a landmark tree be cut or removed, or caused to be cut or removed, from any location within the township. 
2.  A tree removal permit application must be submitted if there are five or more total nonspecimen trees to be cut or removed from a property that is approximately three or more acres in size, or one or more total nonspecimen trees within a critical area, or one or more total specimen trees cut or removed or to be cut or removed from a property, then a tree protection management plan must be submitted. 
3.  At the time of a preliminary major subdivision or site plan application submitted pursuant to chapter 16.04, if there are five or more total nonspecimen trees or one or more total nonspecimen trees within a critical area, or one or more total specimen trees cut or removed or to be cut or removed from a property, than [then] a tree protection management plan must be submitted. 
4.  The provisions of this chapter shall be applicable to all property owners in the township or their designees, with the following exceptions: 
a.  Individual lot owners removing fewer than five nonspecimen trees outside of critical areas. 
b.  Lot owners with an existing residential dwelling or proposed residential dwelling on an individual lot three acres or less in area, unless trees with a caliper of eight inches or greater are proposed to be removed within a critical area as defined by this chapter. 
c.  Any cultivated tree growing on property actually being used as a nursery, orchard or Christmas tree farm. 
d.  Any tree cut or removed for agricultural use of lands when operated in accordance with a farm conservation plan approved by the local soil conservation district, provided that a copy of such plan is filed with the Environmental Commission of East Greenwich Township.

6.  Plans for the harvesting of timber and or silviculture shall be in accordance with the standards and recommendations of the New Jersey State Bureau of Forestry. A copy of such plan must be filed with the Environmental Commission of East Greenwich Township at least fifteen (15) days prior to the harvesting of timber and/or silviculture. 
7.  Any person claiming that he has conducted harvesting of timber in accordance with the standards and recommendations of the New Jersey Bureau of Forestry prior to (the date that this ordinance is adopted), shall, within sixty (60) days after the final adoption of this chapter, make application to the planning board for a certificate of prior use. The applicant shall provide the planning board with a copy of an approved forestry management plan by the New Jersey State Bureau of Forestry. If deemed acceptable, the planning board shall issue a certificate of prior use reliving the applicant of an obligation to secure a tree removal permit for continued operations of said timber harvesting. Failure of the planning board to act within ninety (90) days shall be deemed to be an approval of the request for a certificate of prior use. Any person who does not file for such a certificate within sixty (60) days of June 10, 2008, shall conclusively be presumed to be bound by the terms of this chapter. 
C.  Tree Removal Permit Application.

E.  Review of Applications. 
1.  All applications for a tree removal permit or a tree protection management plan shall be immediately referred by the administrative officer to the environmental commission (and planning board or zoning board if a site plan or subdivision application is involved.) 
a.  If the application for a tree removal permit or a tree protection management plan is not part of a site plan or subdivision application, the environmental commission shall review the tree removal permit or a tree protection management plan application within 30 days of receipt of said application to the administrative officer. Failure on the part of the environmental commission to provide a recommendation to the administrative officer to either approve or deny the application within thirty (30) days of receipt of said application shall render the application approved. In the event that the environmental commission recommends denying an application, it shall specify, in writing, the reason(s) for its actions. The administrative officer shall review and consider the recommendations of the environmental commission, and the commission's recommendations shall be made a part of the record. The administrative officer shall have the authority to approve or to deny the tree removal permit or the tree protection management plan within fifteen (15) days of receiving the environmental commission's recommendation. 
b.  If the application for a tree removal permit or a tree protection management plan is part of a site plan or subdivision application, the environmental commission shall provide a recommendation of approval or denial of the tree removal permit or the tree protection management plan application to the planning board (or zoning board). Failure on the part of the environmental commission to provide a recommendation within twenty (20) days, provided that the environmental commission receives the application at least ten days in advance of its regularly scheduled meeting, shall be deemed a recommendation for approval. In the event that the environmental commission recommends denial of an application, it shall specify, in writing, the reason(s) for its action. The planning board (or zoning board) shall review and consider the recommendations of the environmental commission, and the recommendations shall be made a part of the record before the board. The planning board (or zoning board) shall have the authority to approve or to deny the tree removal permit or a tree protection management plan as part of the subdivision and/or site plan review process. 
2.  The administrative officer (or planning board or zoning board) shall review the application for a tree removal permit or a tree protection management plan and, if necessary, have the township planner, engineer, professional forester and/or some other consultant, as may be required, review the application and inspect the site. All reviews and inspections by the township planner, engineer, professional forester and/or other consultants shall be paid for by the applicant through the deposit of escrow funds. 
3.  The administrative officer (or planning board or zoning board or environmental commission) shall consider the following factors in reviewing an application for a tree removal permit or tree protection management plan and in deciding whether to either recommend approval or denial, or to approve or deny a tree removal permit (or the tree protection management plan); 
a.  Impact on the growth of remaining trees. 
b.  Impact on existing drainage patterns. 
c.  Impact on soil erosion or increased dust. 
d.  Impact on the vegetative screening between adjacent land uses. 
e.  Impact on a tree or scenic corridor given a landmark value. 
f.  Impact on woodland corridors, stream corridors, greenways and wildlife habitat. 
4.  There is hereby established a presumption that each and every tree of eight inches of diameter or greater located within the tree protection zone or any specimen tree located anywhere on the lot shall be preserved at its location on the site. Each such tree located within the tree protection zone or each specimen tree may be removed only of the administrative officer (or planning board/zoning board) finds that the applicant has set forth below: 
a.  That it is a necessity to remove trees which pose a safety hazard to pedestrian or vehicular traffic or threaten to cause disruption of public services. 
b.  That it is a necessity to remove trees which pose a safety hazard to a building. 
c.  That it is a necessity to remove diseased trees, trees infested with destructive insects liable to infect healthy trees on the subject or adjacent property or trees weakened by age, fire or other injury. 
d.  That it is a necessity to observe good forestry practices, i.e., the number of healthy trees that a given parcel of land will support when documented by a report prepared on behalf of the applicant by a professional forester or a certified landscape architect. 
e.  That it is a necessity for compliance with other codes, such as zoning and subdivision regulations, health and other environmental ordinances. 
f.  Other conditions which, in the judgment of the administrative officer (or planning board/zoning board); warrant the removal of a tree. 
5.  No building permit shall be issued until the applicant has obtained approval of its tree removal permit or tree protection management plan application. 
F.  Planting of Trees. 
1.  Replacement of trees. 
a.  Where the administrative officer or the planning board or zoning board, whichever has jurisdiction, determines that it is impossible to retain trees in the tree protection zone, or any specimen tree as defined by this chapter, due to cutting, filling or other construction activity, the applicant shall replant one inch of a new tree diameter for every four inches of existing tree diameter removed. Replacement trees should be shown on the tree removal permit application or tree management plan for review. New replacement trees should have the minimum diameter of two and one-half inches measured six inches above the ground. Replanting should be done according to the standards specified by the American Nurserymen's Association. 
b.  Where it has been determined by the administrative officer that a landmark tree has been cut or removed, the person responsible shall be fined no more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) and shall be required to replant one inch of new tree diameter for every one inch of the landmark tree diameter cut or removed. New replacement trees should have a minimum diameter of eight inches measured six inches above the ground. Replanting should be done according to the standards specified by the American Nurserymen's Association. 
2.  Criteria for the selection of new trees. When an applicant is required to replace trees as described above, the applicant should replace the trees with the same species that were removed or, with the approval of the administrative officer (or the planning board/zoning board); choose other tree species, preferably native to East Greenwich Township. In selecting replacement trees, the following positive criteria should be used. These guidelines should also be followed in choosing trees proposed to be retained or cleared. 
a.  Species longevity; 
b.  Whether native to the area; 
c.  Hardiness (wind firmness, climate requirements, characteristics of soil to hold tree); 
d.  Resistance to insect and disease, attack and to pollution; 
e.  Aesthetic values (autumn coloration, type of flowers or fruit, form characteristics); 
f.  Low maintenance and care (pruning, etc.); 
g.  High wildlife values; 
h.  Comfort to surroundings; 
i.  Freedom from disease, rot or other damage to tree; 
j.  Protection of pedestrians, vehicles and buildings; 
k.  Size at maturity; 
l.  Effect of soil retention and erosion control; and 
m.  Value as a noise buffer. 
G.  Protection of Existing Trees. Applicants should exercise due care to protect trees to be retained from damage during construction. The following procedures shall be observed in order to protect retained trees: 
1.  Protection from mechanical injury. 
a.  Prior to any grubbing or clearing, all trees to be retained within twenty-five (25) feet of a building and all other improvements should be protected from equipment damage by enclosing the driplines of the trees with sections of snow fence or boards, wired together. All exposed roots and low-hanging branches should be equally protected. Groups of trees may be protected by fencing the driplines of the entire tree mass to be retained. 
b.  Heavy equipment operators should not damage existing tree trunks and roots. Feeder roots should not be cut closer than the distance of the dripline from the tree trunks and should be cut with pruning shears or other tools which will make a clean cut. 
c.  Tree trunks and exposed roots accidentally damaged during construction should be protected from further damage. Damaged branches should be sawed off at the branch collar. No shellac or pruning paint should be used. When the portion of the tree to be removed is diseased, the pruning equipment should be dipped in alcohol or disinfectant prior to use on another tree to prevent the spread of the disease. 
d.  Deciduous trees should be given an application of liquid slow-release, low-nitrogen, all-purpose fertilizer to aid in their recovery from possible damage caused by construction operations. Such application should be made at a distance of one foot from the trunk to the dripline and should be made as soon as construction is completed and again one year after the first application has been made. 
e.  Trees should not be used for roping, cables, signs or fencing. Nails and spikes should not be driven into trees. 
f.  The area around the base of existing trees should be left open to provide access for water and nutrients. Therefore, neither impervious cover nor storage of equipment, materials, debris or fill should be allowed within the dripline of any existing tree to be retained. 
2.  Protection from grade change. 
a.  If an increase of the grade is proposed, the applicant should install either: 
1.  A system of gravel and drain tiles at the old soil level opening into a dry well built around the trunk and designed for each tree, individually fitting the contour of the land so that it drains water away from the tree trunk; or 
2.  A retaining wall between the existing grade and the higher grade. A detailed plan for each proposed retaining wall should be provided. 
b.  If a decrease of the grade is proposed, the applicant should initiate one of the following methods to protect the trees: 
1.  Terracing the grade at the dripline and out from the tree. 
2.  A retaining wall between the existing grade and the lower grade. A detailed plan for each proposed retaining wall should be provided. 
3.  Protection from excavation. When digging trenches for utility lines and other similar uses, the applicant should adhere to the following, listed in order of preference: 
a.  If possible, trenches should bypass the root area. 
b.  If it is impossible for the trenches to bypass the root area, trenches should be tunneled under the trees. 
c.  If trenches must be dug along the side of a tree, the following precautions should be observed. 
1.  Trenches should be no closer to the trunk than half the distance from the dripline. 
2.  As few roots as possible should be cut. 
3.  If roots are cut, they should be cut as cleanly as possible. 
4.  The trench should be backfilled as soon as possible, avoiding soil compaction. 
4.  Protection during construction cleanup. 
a.  All construction debris should be hauled away. No such debris should be burned or buried. 
b.  Fences and barriers around trees should be the last thing to be removed from the site, prior to the installation of additional landscaping or building occupancy. 
H.  Appeals. 
1.  An appeal from a decision of the Administrative Officer should be brought ;before the township committee, which may affirm, modify or reverse the decision. 
2.  An appeal from a decision of the planning board or zoning board should be brought before the court, which may affirm, modify or reverse the decision. 
I.  Violations and Penalties. 
1.  Violations. Any person, firm or corporation that shall violate any provision of this chapter shall be subject to some portion or all of one or more of the following: a penalty of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or imprisonment for a term not exceeding ninety (90) days or community service up to but no greater than ninety (90) days, or a combination of any of the above. 
2.  Continuing violations. If the violation is continuing in nature, each day during which it continues shall constitute an additional, separate and distinct offense. 
3.  Other remedies. No provisions of this chapter shall be construed to impair any common law or statutory course for action or legal remedy which may be otherwise provided in law or equity for any violation of this chapter.

B.  All residential development in East Greenwich consisting of nine or more residential units shall provide one affordable housing unit on-site for every eight market rate units. 
C.  For developments that result in a number of market rate residential units not evenly divisible by nine, the developer may construct the additional affordable unit on-site or alternatively, the developer may make a payment in lieu of constructing the additional affordable unit. If the developer selects the latter option, the amount of said payment shall be established by subtracting any whole multiples of nine from the total number of residential units being created, dividing any remaining number of units by eight and multiplying the resulting fraction by the higher of thirty-five thousand dollars ($35,000.00) or such amount as shall be derived from an analysis of the subsidy required to create an affordable housing unit in East Greenwich.

Subject to the developer first securing prior written authorization from the township, nonresidential developers in any nonresidential zone shall make a payment in lieu of constructing the affordable units. The amount of said payment shall be determined by establishing the number of jobs to be created in a development by using the conversion factors published by COAH as Appendix E in N.J.A.C. 5:94-1 et seq., dividing by twenty-five (25) to determine the number of affordable housing units required and multiplying the resulting figure by the higher of thirty-five thousand dollars ($35,000.00) or such amount as shall be derived from an analysis of the subsidy required to create an affordable housing unit in East Greenwich. If the developer fails to secure such written authorization, then the nonresidential developer shall construct the non age-restricted affordable unit on-site.

Editor's note- Ord. 6-2009, §§ 2a.-2h., adopted May 12, 2009, amended Ch. 16.79 in its entirety and enacted similar provisions as set out herein. The former Ch. 16.79 derived from Ord. 24-2008, § I, adopted Oct. 14, 2008. 

16.79.010 - Purpose. 
    The purpose of the B-3 Community Commercial Overlay zone is to create opportunities for planned commercial development in key locations in the Route 295 growth corridor within the township. The overlay is intended to provide the flexibility needed to accommodate a variety of uses while setting specific standards for design and ensuring that developments relate to their surroundings in a way that enhances the community. Even with a well conceived land use plan, the timing of the development of individual parcels is often beyond the township's control. While development will occur incrementally, the B-3 overlay will assist the township in setting the stage for a development program that will achieve the desired physical design standards, improve the jobs-housing balance, bring services to the community, and reduce the need for long commutes to shopping and service destinations. The consolidation of smaller parcels to create larger developable tracts is encouraged throughout the overlay zone and the redevelopment area overall. Coordinated development should provide for common access drives, shared parking, unified design theme, pedestrian walkways and greens, and coordinated stormwater management. Within the redevelopment area, applicants wishing to develop properties subject to the B-3 overlay must establish and enter into a redevelopment agreement with the township committee. 
    B-3 Community Commercial Overlay regulations apply to Route 295 Corridor Redevelopment Area B-3 overlay permitted uses. Applicants proposing B-1, B-2 and I zone permitted uses may develop without B-3 overlay regulations. B-1, B-2 and I zone regulations apply to development of permitted uses within their respective zone. Applicants developing properties within the redevelopment area not subject to the B-3 overlay may enter into a redevelopment agreement with the township committee.

Chapter 16.82 - ZONING-RIPARIAN BUFFER CONSERVATION ZONE 

16.82.010 - Legislative intent. 
    In recognition of the fact that natural features contribute to the welfare of residents, the following regulations have been enacted to provide reasonable controls governing the restoration, conservation, disturbance, and management of existing riparian buffers for all perennial and intermittent streams and all lakes and ponds in the municipality by establishing designated riparian buffer conservation zones. 
(Ord. 13-2000 § I, Art. I (part)) 
16.82.020 - Definitions. 
    For the purposes of this chapter the following definitions shall apply: 
    "Intermittent stream" means a stream with a drainage area of fifty (50) acres or greater. 
    "Perennial stream" means a stream that flows continuously throughout the year in most years. 
    "Stream" means a natural watercourse containing flowing water for at least part of the year. 
(Ord. 13-2000 § I, Art. I (part)) 
16.82.030 - Purpose. 
    In addition, the specific purposes and intent of this chapter are to: 
A.  Reduce the amount of nutrients, sediment, organic matter pesticides, and other harmful substances that reach watercourses, wetlands, subsurface, and surface water bodies by using scientifically proven processes including filtration, deposition, absorption, adsorption, plant uptake, biodegradation, denitrification and by improving infiltration, encouraging sheet flow, and stabilizing concentrated flows; 
B.  Improve and maintain the safety, reliability and adequacy of the water supply for domestic, agricultural, commercial, industrial and recreational uses along with sustaining diverse populations of aquatic flora and fauna; 
C.  Regulate the land use, siting and engineering of all development to be consistent with the intent and objectives of this chapter, accepted conservation practices, and to work within the carrying capacity of existing natural resources; 
D.  Assist in the implementation of pertinent state laws concerning erosion and sediment control practices; 
E.  Conserve the natural features important to land and water resources (e.g., headwater areas, groundwater recharge zones, floodway, floodplain, springs, streams, wetlands, woodlands, prime wildlife habitats) and other features constituting high recreational value or containing amenities that exist on developed and undeveloped land; 
F.  Work with floodplain, steep slope, and other ordinances that regulate environmentally sensitive areas to minimize hazards to life, property, and riparian features; 
G.  Conserve natural, scenic, and recreation areas within and adjacent to riparian areas for the community's benefit. 
(Ord. 13-2000 § I, Art. I (part)) 
16.82.040 - Establishment and width determination. 
A.  Definition. The "riparian buffer conservation zone" is defined as: areas surrounding municipally designated surface water bodies including creeks, lakes and intermittent watercourses that intercept surface water runoff, wastewater, subsurface flow, and/or deep groundwater flows from upland sources and function to remove or buffer the effects of associated nutrients, sediment, organic matter, pesticides, or other pollutants prior to entry into surface waters. This area may also provide wildlife habitat, control water temperature, attenuate flood flow, and provide opportunities for passive recreation. This buffer area may or may not contain trees and other native vegetation at the time of this chapter's enactment. 
B.  Establishment. 
1.  The establishment of the riparian buffer conservation zone applies to the following areas which are identified on the municipal riparian buffer map: 
a.  Lands adjacent to municipally designated streams within the municipality; 
b.  Lands adjacent to municipally designated intermittent water courses within the municipality; 
c.  Lands at the margins of municipally designated lakes. 
2.  The measurement of the riparian buffer conservation zone shall extend a minimum of seventy-five (75) feet from each defined edge of an identified watercourse or surface water body at bankfull flow or level, or shall equal the extent of the one hundred (100) year floodplain, whichever is greater. The district will consist of two distinct zones designated as: 
a.  Zone One. This zone will begin at each edge of an identified waterway (which can include wetlands and intermittent watercourses) and occupy a margin of land with a minimum width of twenty-five (25) feet measured horizontally on a line perpendicular to the edge of water at bankfull flow. 
    Where steep slopes (in excess of twenty-five (25) percent) are located within twenty-five (25) feet of a municipally designated watercourse, Zone One shall extend the entire distance of this sloped area. If the distance of this sloped area is greater than seventy-five (75) feet, there will be no requirement for the establishment of Zone Two. If the distance is less than seventy-five (75) feet, the width of Zone Two will be adjusted so that the total buffer width (Zone One and Zone Two) will be seventy-five (75) feet maximum. 
b.  Zone Two. This zone will begin at the outer edge of Zone One and occupy a minimum width of fifty (50) feet in addition to Zone One. 
    Where the one hundred (100) year floodplain extends greater than seventy-five (75) feet from the waterway, Zone One shall remain a minimum of twenty-five (25) feet wide, and Zone Two shall extend from the outer edge of Zone One to the outer edge of the one hundred (100) year floodplain.

Chapter 16.85 - RENEWABLE ENERGY FACILITIES 

16.85.010 - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this section is to encourage the use of renewable energy facilities to produce electricity within the township and to reduce dependence on nonrenewable fuels in a manner consistent with the township's land use and environmental goals and objectives. The primary purpose of an accessory small wind or solar energy system is to provide power to the principal use of the property whereon said system is to be located, as an accessory use. The primary purpose of an accessory small wind or small solar energy system shall not be for the generation of power for sale, although this provision shall not be interpreted to prohibit the sale of excess power back to the utility grid from time to time when the energy needs of the principal use have been met. The primary purpose of a commercial solar energy facility, which is a permitted principal use or permitted conditional use in specified zoning districts, is to produce energy from renewable sources for sale directly to a particular customer or by distribution through the energy distribution infrastructure (the grid). 
(Ord. No. 34-2010, § XIV, 12-28-2010) 
16.85.020 - General requirements for renewable energy facilities. 
A.  Solar energy facilities may be ground-mounted and/or mounted to principal and accessory structures and buildings. 
B.  All roof-mounted solar energy systems are considered an accessory use. 
C.  Solar panels do not count in the calculation of maximum lot coverage or maximum impervious cover, unless the area under the system (excluding the footings) consists of an impervious material, such as pavement. Nevertheless, the design of the systems and the accessory structures and other improvements (driveways, etc.) shall comply with all township stormwater, grading, and soil disturbance regulations. 
D.  Ground-mounted solar facilities covering a gross area greater than one thousand (1,000) square feet shall provide soil stabilization in the form of meadow grasses or agricultural area for shade crops or grazing farm animals. 
E.  To the extent practical, solar panels and wind turbines must be sited to minimize the need to remove trees or other natural features from setback areas unless acceptable replacement buffering is provided. Trees within fifty (50) feet of property lines must be maintained as a buffer. For principal uses, trees proposed for removal in order to maximize the productivity and efficiency of the solar energy system or for grading must be identified on the site plan. Trees may not be removed from wetlands or required wetland buffer areas unless a tree replacement plan or buffer averaging plan is approved by the NJDEP. 
F.  Site disturbance including but not limited to, grading, soil removal, excavation, and soil compaction shall be minimized to the extent practical. Roadways within the site should likewise be constructed to minimize the extent of soil compaction. 
G.  All electrical and control equipment shall be labeled and secured to prevent unauthorized access. 
H.  The renewable energy system shall not be used for displaying advertisements for any product or service, except for the reasonable identification of the manufacturer or operator of the system. 
I.  Abandonment. 
1.  A small wind energy system or solar energy system that is out of service for a continuous twelve (12) month period will be deemed to have been abandoned. 
2.  The zoning officer may issue a notice of abandonment to the owner. The notice shall be sent via regular and certified mail, return receipt requested, to the owner of record. 
3.  The land owner shall have thirty (30) days to respond. If information is provided demonstrating that the system has not been abandoned, then the zoning officer shall withdraw the notice. 
4.  Any abandoned system shall be removed at the owner's sole expense within six months after the owner receives the notice of abandonment from the municipality. If the system is not removed within six months of receipt of notice from the township notifying the owner of such abandonment, the township may remove the system as set forth below. 
5.  When an owner of a wind or solar energy system has been notified to remove same and has not done so six months after receiving said notice, then the township may remove such system and place a lien upon the property for the cost of the removal. If removed by the owner, a demolition permit shall be obtained and the facility shall be removed. Upon removal, the site shall be cleaned, restored and revegetated to blend with the existing surrounding vegetation at the time of abandonment. 
J.  Applicants are encouraged to enter into solar easements with neighboring property owners in order to ensure continuing access to sunlight for a solar or photovoltaic system. 
K.  The installation shall conform to the National Electrical Code as adopted by the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs (DCA). 
L.  The installation of a wind or solar energy system is subject to all Atlantic City Electric Company's (or its successor) requirements for interconnection. 
M.  The height limitations provided in Chapter 90 for specific zoning districts shall not apply to wind and solar energy systems. Wind and solar energy systems shall conform to the height restrictions provided in this section. 
(Ord. No. 34-2010, § XIV, 12-28-2010) 
16.85.030 - Accessory renewable energy facilities (small wind and solar energy facilities). 
A.  The primary purpose of a small wind or solar energy system is to provide power to the principal use of the property whereon said system is located, as an accessory use. The primary purpose of a small wind or small solar energy system under this section shall not be for the generation of power for sale, although this provision shall not be interpreted to prohibit the sale of excess power back to the utility grid from time to time from a wind or solar energy system primarily designed to meet the energy needs of the principal use. For the purposes of this ordinance, the sale of excess power shall be limited so that in no event an energy system is generating more energy for sale each month than the equivalent of what is otherwise necessary to power the principle use(s) on the property. 
B.  Small wind and solar energy systems shall only be permitted as an accessory use on the same lot or tract of land as the principle use. All energy systems require approval from the zoning officer and construction office prior to installation. Applications for a renewable energy system shall include information demonstrating compliance with the provisions of this ordinance. In the event that the zoning officer or construction officer finds that the provisions of this ordinance will not be satisfied, an applicant may apply to the land use board for a variance in accordance with the provisions of Municipal Land Use Law (N.J.S.A, 40:55D-70). 
C.  Renewable Energy Facilities (small wind and solar energy systems) on Farms. Small wind and solar energy systems are permitted on preserved and unpreserved farms in any zoning district in accordance with P.L. 2009 Chapter 213 (approved on January 16, 2010), which permits solar and wind generation facilities, structures, and equipment on the commercial farm or within the exception area on a preserved farm, for the purpose of generating power or heat. Prior to installing or constructing renewable energy facilities the owner of a farm must apply to East Greenwich Township for a zoning permit and must apply to the New Jersey Department of Agriculture as required by Section 5 of P.L. 2009 C.213. 
1.  For preserved farms the following standards apply: 
a.  The wind and solar energy systems may not interfere significantly with the use of the land for agricultural or horticultural production.

c.  The wind and solar energy systems must be used to power or heat the farm, and to reduce energy costs on the farm. 
d.  The energy generation capacity must be limited to the previous calendar year's energy demand plus ten (10) percent or at the option of the land owner may be limited to occupy no more than one (1) percent of the area of the entire farm (including the preserved and unpreserved areas). This does not include roof-mounted equipment that was already in place at the time of the adoption of this ordinance. 
e.  Energy produced may only be sold through net metering to ensure that the energy produced is primarily used on-site. 
f.  The land owner must seek and obtain approval of the state agriculture development committee before constructing, installing or operating the wind or solar energy generation facilities, structures, equipment. The land owner must provide East Greenwich Township with a copy of the state agriculture development committee (SADC) approval. 
g.  The solar and wind energy generation systems must comply with the setbacks required in subsections D and E below as applicable. 
2.  For unpreserved commercial farms the following standards apply:

16.85.040 - Commercial solar energy facilities. 
A.  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide flexibility within the specified zoning districts to permit commercial solar energy systems as a principal use on properties meeting the criteria set forth below. "Solar or photovoltaic energy facility or structure" has been defined in the New Jersey Municipal Land Use Law as an inherently beneficial use and the township concurs that the provision of electricity generated at a renewable energy facility will benefit the community by promoting the public health, safety and general welfare; as long as the facility will be in harmony with the township's overall land use plans and will not negatively impact upon the township's other goals and objectives. Where commercial solar energy facilities are a permitted principal use, the requirements are bulk requirements, and where commercial solar energy facilities are a permitted conditional use, the requirements are conditions. For renewable energy facilities as an accessory use, see Section 16.85.030. 
B.  Commercial Redevelopment and Conservation of Environmentally Sensitive Areas. Commercial solar energy facilities are not permitted within the B-3 community commercial overlay area. The purposes of the B-3 community commercial overlay is to promote specific types of development at key locations. 
C.  Minimum Lot size Requirements for Commercial Solar Energy Facilities. These standards are bulk requirements for permitted uses and conditions for conditional uses. 
1.  Industrial (I) Zone: Ten (10) contiguous acres. 
2.  Rural Residential Zone (RR): Forty (40) contiguous acres. 
D.  Agriculture Retention. 
1.  Commercial Solar Energy Facilities as a Principal Use Are Not an Agricultural Use. Solar energy systems are permitted in conjunction with preserved and commercial farms in accordance with Section 16.85.020. 
2.  Agriculture Retention. It is the township's intention to support the retention of the productive agricultural land base. Commercial solar facilities are not permitted on preserved farms (accessory solar facilities are permitted on preserved farms in accordance with Section 16.85.020). Within the rural residential RR zoning district, commercial solar energy facilities are permitted only when one of the following conditions are met: 
a.  The property is the subject of a valid vested major subdivision approval at the time the commercial solar site plan application is approved by the land use board; or 
b.  Less than fifty (50) percent of the lot consists of prime agricultural soils and less than seventy (70) percent of the lot consists of a combination of prime and state-wide important soils. To the extent possible, it is the township's intent to maintain this valuable farmland as an unfragmented agricultural production area. 
3.  Buffers. If the property is adjacent to a permanently preserved farm it shall buffer the solar facility from view with an opaque landscaped screen consisting of a double row of evergreen trees, a minimum of eight feet high at the time of planting. 
E.  Requirements for Commercial Solar Energy facilities. 
1.  Commercial solar energy systems shall require a minor site plan approval if the gross area of ground-mounted systems, including the aggregate area of disturbance for multiple systems, consists of five thousand (5,000) square feet or less, and major site plan approval if the proposal consists of five thousand (5,000) square feet or more of disturbance. The site plan must show the location of any proposed or existing substation, inverter, transformer, or overhead transmission lines. 
2.  The solar energy system equipment may be located outside as necessary for the function of the system, and is not limited by the requirements of the underlying zoning districts limiting outdoor storage. 
3.  Agricultural buffers must be maintained where required in accordance with Section 16.28. However, for equipment and nonbuilding structures the agricultural buffer and the setbacks need not be aggregated. Rather the greater of the setbacks applies. For example if the agricultural buffer required is fifty (50) feet and the setback is fifty (50) feet, the required setback is fifty (50) feet (not one hundred (100) feet). 
4.  Setbacks. These standards are bulk requirements for permitted uses and conditions for conditional uses. 
a.  Building structures, inverters, and equipment cabinets must meet the following bulk and set back requirements: 
i.  Front yard setback: One hundred (100) feet. 
ii.  Rear yard and side yard setback to residential zone: One hundred (100) feet. 
iii.  Rear yard and side yard setback to nonresidential zone: Fifty (50) feet. 
iv.  Maximum building height: Twenty-five (25) feet. 
b.  Ground arrays must be setback a minimum of fifty (50) feet from all property lines (or the agricultural buffer distance, whichever is greater). 
5.  The maximum permitted height for ground arrays is thirteen (13) feet. 
6.  Office and storage buildings and equipment cabinets are permitted as accessory to a commercial solar energy operation in accordance with the setbacks in subsection D.1. above. 
7.  Substations shall be set back a minimum of one hundred (100) feet from all property lines and must be buffered with evergreen trees. 
8.  Ground-mounted systems shall be screened from view with an opaque visual screen containing a combination of plantings, a fence and/or earthen berm, which must be approved at the time of site plan approval. 
a.  Evergreen trees shall be a minimum of six feet at the time of planting and deciduous trees shall be a minimum of three-inch caliper. 
b.  The screened buffer area shall be a minimum of thirty (30) feet in width to adjacent residential properties and twenty (20) feet in width between nonresidential properties and along public roads. 
c.  In addition to the perimeter screening standards, substations shall be screened with a double row of evergreen plantings with a minimum height of eight feet. 
d.  Existing vegetation including existing hedgerows or windbreaks shall be retained to the extent practical to provide or partially provide the required opaque visual screen. 
9.  The applicant must submit a narrative with the site plan application explaining: 
a.  The intended consumers of the electricity produced. 
b.  The anticipated number of employees at the site and the anticipated vehicle traffic. 
c.  Description of how the energy generated by the facility will be transmitted to the larger electrical distribution system.

Footnotes: 
--- (3) --- 
Cross reference- Flood damage prevention, Ch. 8.50. 

16.86.010 - Purpose. 
    The purpose of these regulations is to permit only that development of flood-prone areas which: 
A.  Is appropriate in light of the probability of flood damage and the need to preclude flood losses; 
B.  Represents an acceptable social and economic use of the land relative to the hazards involved; 
C.  Does not increase danger to life or property anywhere adjacent to or in the floodplain area. 
    It is intended that areas adjacent to rivers and streams be retained from structures and other obstructions to water flow during periodic uses in the water level. This district is intended to protect floodplains so that floodwaters may have a natural course to follow, that the water level may rise and cover larger land surfaces for the purposes greater water protection and recharging of the underground water supply. It is further intended that existing wildlife habitats and ecosystems are preserved or enhanced and these lands remain the townships natural corridors. 
(Prior code § 14-16.1) 
16.86.020 - Definitions. 
    As used in this chapter: 
    "Channel" means a natural depression of perceptible extent, with a definite bed and banks to confine and conduct flowing water either continuously or periodically. 
    "Design flood (floodway or flood hazard area)" means the relative size or magnitude of a flood, expressed as a design discharge in cubic feet per second, which is developed from hydrologic criteria; represents a major flood of reasonable expectancy; reflects both flood experience and flood potential; and is the basis of the delineation of the floodway and the flood hazard area and of the water surface elevations thereof. 
    "Design flood profile (floodway or flood hazard area)" means the elevations of the water surface of the floodway design flood and the flood hazard area design flood. 
    "Flood fringe area" means that portion of the flood hazard area not designated as the floodway. 
    "Flood hazard area" means the floodway and additional portions of the floodplain that are subject to flood flow at lesser depths and lower velocities than the floodway and that are inundated by the flood hazard area design flood. 
    "Floodplain" means the relatively flat terrain adjoining a water channel which has been or may be hereafter covered by floodwater of the channel. 
    "Floodway" means the channel and portions of the adjacent floodplain that carry the greater part of flood flow at greater depths and velocities than do the other parts of the floodplain; that constitute the minimum area required for the passage of flood flows without aggravating flood conditions upstream and downstream; and that are necessary to preserve the natural regimen of the stream for the reasonable passage of the floodway design flood. 
(Prior code § 14-16.2) 
16.86.030 - Map of floodway and flood hazard area.

C.  In cases of doubt, uncertainty or dispute as to the exact limits of the floodplain, the floodwater or flood hazard area in a proposed development, the township engineer shall, upon the application and with the consent of the landowner, determine the precise location of a flood plain, floodway or flood hazard area limit by close inspection, field survey or other appropriate method, and cause the same to be marked on the ground notifying the landowner, the building inspector and the approving authority of the results thereof. The cost of such engineering shall be borne by the applicant. 
(Prior code § 14-16.4) 
16.86.050 - Overlay concept and density. 
A.  The floodplain district shall be deemed an overlay on any zoning district now or hereafter applicable to any lot. 
B.  Should the floodplain district be declared inapplicable to any tract, the zoning applicable to such lot shall be deemed to be the zone in which it is located without consideration of this chapter. In appropriate cases, the centerline of the stream shall be in the district boundary line. 
C.  Lands in the floodplain shall not be used to calculate the allowable number of units in a project. Such area may be included in open space calculations.
