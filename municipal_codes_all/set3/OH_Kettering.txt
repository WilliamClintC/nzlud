CHARTER OF
THE CITY OF KETTERING, OHIO



We, the people of the Municipality of Kettering, Ohio, in order to secure the benefits of local self-government under the Constitution of Ohio, do adopt this Charter for the government of the Municipality of Kettering.

ARTICLE I. NAME AND BOUNDARIES

SECTION 1-1. The present Municipality, known as the City of Kettering, Ohio, shall continue to be a body politic and corporate under the name of the City of Kettering, with the same boundaries, with powers and authority to change its boundaries and annex other territory contiguous thereto in the manner authorized by the general laws of Ohio. No territory shall be detached from the Municipality, nor shall the Municipality be annexed to any other municipality without the consent of Council.

ARTICLE II. POWERS

SECTION 2-1. GENERAL POWERS. This charter shall be construed and interpreted as expressing the intent of the citizens of the City of Kettering to govern themselves to the fullest extent authorized by the Constitution of the State of Ohio.

The City shall have all the powers of local self-government and benefits of municipal home rule as granted by the Constitution of the State of Ohio. In addition, the City shall have all powers that now or hereafter may be granted to municipalities by statutes of the State of Ohio.

Through this Charter the citizens expressly declare that all such powers of local self- government (and all power granted by state statutes, to the maximum extent possible) shall now and hereafter be exercised in the manner prescribed in this Charter or, if not prescribed herein, in such manner as shall be provided by ordinance or resolution of the City, even though different from the manner of exercise provided by state statutes. (Ord. 3720-96; passed 8/27/96.)

ARTICLE III. COUNCIL

SECTION 3-1. POWERS. The legislative power of the Municipality shall be vested in a Council of seven (7) electors of the Municipality, one of whose members shall be the Mayor.

SECTION 3-2. MEMBERS AND TERMS. Each member of Council, including the Mayor, shall be elected for a four (4) year term of office.  Of the seven (7) members of Council, four
(4)	shall be elected from districts, one from each of the four (4) districts referred to in Section
 


11-2 of this Charter. The remaining three (3) members, including the Mayor, shall be elected from the City-at-large.

Members-at-large, including the Mayor, were elected at the general municipal election in November of 1993 and shall be elected every fourth year thereafter. District members were elected at the general municipal election in November of 1995 and shall be elected every fourth year thereafter.

The term of office of each member of Council, including the Mayor, shall begin on the first day of January next following his or her election. (Ord. 3720-96; passed 8/27/96.)

SECTION 3-3. QUALIFICATIONS. Each member of Council shall have been a qualified elector of the city for at least one year immediately prior to filing a petition of candidacy or immediately prior to appointment. One who ceases to be such an elector shall immediately forfeit his or her office. (Ord. 3720-96; passed 8/27/96.)

SECTION 3-4. REMOVAL AND VACANCIES. The Council shall be the judge of the election and qualifications of its own members.  In case of persistent failure to abide by the rules of council or absence without justifiable excuse for three (3) consecutive meetings, the seat  of  such  member  may  be  declared  vacant  by  resolution  of  Council,  five  members concurring.

Council shall declare vacant the seat of any of its members who shall cease to be qualified as a member of Council. Council members shall at all times be qualified electors of the City. No member of Council shall hold any other elected public office, hold any other City office or City employment. The following shall not be considered holding another City office or holding City employment: membership of a board, commission, committee or similar group by appointment of City Council; holding the office of Mayor or Vice-Mayor of the City. Holding the office of notary public, being a member of the Armed Forces of Ohio or the United States, or having the status of trustee or director without pay of a public institution shall not disqualify a member of Council. No member of Council shall hold the position of chief or lead executive officer of any political subdivision of Ohio, or be employed by another State of Ohio political subdivision in a position that is mandated by the State, appointed by the governing body of that other political subdivision and requires performing duties prescribed by State law.

Upon Council declaring the seat of any of its members to be vacant, said vacancy shall continue until a successor is chosen pursuant to an election as herein provided. If a vacancy occurs, the election of a successor shall take place at the next election occurring within the city taking place more than one hundred twenty (120) days after the vacancy occurred, provided that Council may not provide for the holding of a special election solely for the purpose of filling such vacancy. Upon the certification of the election results by the Board of Election, the elected successor shall take office immediately and shall serve for the balance of the unexpired term. (Ord. 4273-16; passed 7/26/16.)

If a vacancy occurs in the office of the Mayor, the election of a successor shall take place at the next primary or general election occurring ninety (90) or more days after the vacancy occurred. The successor Mayor shall take office immediately and shall serve for the balance of the unexpired term.

If, however, that term balance would be less than twelve (12) months, no such election shall be held and the former Vice-Mayor shall continue to hold office as the replacement Mayor for the remainder of the term.

If a Vice-Mayor assumes the title and office of Mayor, a successor Vice-Mayor shall be chosen by majority vote of the Council at its next regular meeting. The successor Vice-Mayor shall serve for the balance of the remaining term. (Ord. 3720-96; passed 8/27/96.)

Special meetings may be called by the Mayor or any three members of Council on twelve hours notice served on each member personally or left at his usual place of residence. The purpose of a special meeting shall be stated in the notice. Other matters may be discussed, but no decision may be made nor legislation passed on such matters. (Ord. 3720-96; passed 8/27/96.)

Prior to the consideration of or vote upon any proposed ordinance or resolution, Council shall provide all residents or taxpayers of the City a reasonable and equal opportunity to speak on any proposed ordinance or resolution during the course of and as part of each public meeting at which such proposed ordinance or resolution will be considered or voted upon.

Council shall ensure that the record of proceedings of its meetings include a fair and accurate summary of the comments made by any person during the course of any public meeting. (Ord. 4273-16; passed 7/26/16.)

(a)	No person shall be elected to the office of district Council member, at-large Council member, Mayor, or a combination of the three offices, for more than two (2) consecutive terms of four (4) years each; provided that the term served in filling a vacancy or unexpired term shall not be considered as part of the two (2) consecutive terms of four (4) years each.

(b)	Following the election to two (2) consecutive terms as district Council member, at- large Council member, Mayor, or a combination of the three offices, such person may not be elected to or appointed to the position of district Council member, at-large Council member, or Mayor for a period of one (1) four year term of the Council.

(c)	This Charter amendment shall become effective from the time of its approval by the electors. In determining whether someone who currently serves may be elected in future elections, the terms of service to which one was elected prior to the enactment of this Section 3-10 shall not be considered.
 


(d)	In the event that any provision of this Section is found to be unconstitutional or impermissibly in conflict with state or federal law, only such provision found to be unconstitutional or impermissible will be stricken, and the remainder of this Section will remain in full force and effect.

(e)	For clarification, election to each office (district Council member, at-large Council member, or Mayor) constitutes an "election" under sub-Section (a), above, even if such person only serves a partial term in such position. Thus, for example, if a person fails to serve a whole term in one position (e.g., district Council member) before election to a second position (e.g., Mayor), such person shall be term-limited {as provided in sub-Sections (a) and (b), above} after serving six years or fewer in elective office.

CHAPTER  103
Official Standards

EDITOR'S NOTE:  The State of Ohio operates on Eastern Daylight Savings Time from 2:00 a. m.  of the last Sunday in April until 2:00 a. m.  of the
last Sunday in October.	Congress on March 22,  1966, passed the Uniform Time Act requiring uniform observance throughout the nation of Daylight Savings Time starting in 1967,  except that a state legislature  could exempt the entire state from Daylight Savings Time or divide a state into not more than two parts,  each with a different time standard.	The Ohio legislature through inaction has elected to observe  Eastern Daylight Savings Time throughout the State of Ohio.

An executive session called for one topic may be expanded to include additional topics listed below, as long as the minutes subsequently list
all the topics involved.

The following matters may be discussed at executive sessions, with the only restriction being that no ordinances or resolutions may be enacted nor any motions passed in such sessions, and instead all ordinances, resolutions and motions must be voted upon in those portions of meetings which are open to the public.

(1)	"PERSONNEL MATTERS" for all matters referred to in paragraph
(1)	of division (G) ofRevised Code 121.22, the state Sunshine Law.

(2)	"PROPERTY MATTERS" to consider the acquisition of property for public purposes or the disposal of property, whether at competitive bidding or otherwise, on conditions generally the same as those described in paragraph (2) of division (G) of Revised Code 121.22, specifically, if premature disclosure of information would give a competitive or bargaining advantage to a person or entity whose interest is or may be adverse to what Council deems to be the general public interest.

(3)	"CONFERENCE WITH ATTORNEY" for matters referred to in paragraph (3) of division (g) of Revised Code 121.22 and also for conferences with attorneys representing the City which are confidential communications and advice under the attorney-client privilege described in division (a) of 2317.02 of the Revised Code of Ohio.





121-6
 


(4)	"LABOR NEGOTIATIONS"  for matters referred to in paragraph  (4) of division (G) of Revised Code 121.22.

(5)	"MATTERS REQUIRED TO BE KEPT CONFIDENTIAL BY
FEDERAL OR STATE LAW" for any matter referred to in paragraph
(5)	of division (G) of Revised Code 121.22.

(6)	"SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS" for matters referred to in paragraph (6) of division (G) of Revised Code 121.22.

(7)	"QUASI-JUDICIAL  DELIBERATIONS"  for deliberations  leading to a decision by Council on appeals from decisions of boards, commissions and other public bodies of the City.  Also for similar deliberations by those same boards, commissions and other public bodies in connection with public hearings they will be holding or have held.  In both instances, the final decision (i.e. the final vote) must be taken at an open public meeting.

(8)	"ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT" for discussions of economic development aspects of public or private real estate, including but not limited to the possibility of businesses or jobs locating or remaining in or departing from the City and matters affecting or affected by that economic development, on the same type of conditions which must exist to make property matters a valid topic for executive sessions, i.e., if premature disclosure of information would give a competitive or bargaining advantage to a person or entity whose interest is or may be adverse to what the Council deems to be the general public interest.

(9)	"NEGOTIATIONS WITH ORGANIZATIONS OR INDIVIDUALS"
for negotiations with public or private organizations or with individuals, and discussions regarding those negotiations, on the same type of conditions which must exist to make property matters a valid topic for executive sessions, i.e., if premature disclosure of information would give a competitive or bargaining advantage to a person or entity whose interest is or may be adverse to what the Council deems to be the general public interest.

(10)	"PROCEDURAL  MATTERS" such as, but not limited to, committee assignments and decisions as to when and where meetings will be held and various topics discussed.

(I)	Minutes of Meetings. Minutes of meetings shall be prepared and approved within a reasonable time and, thereafter, shall be public records. They need not be verbatim but, instead, may be summary in fonn, listing only agenda topics discussed, other matters of importance, and actions which involved votes of members. No minutes shall be taken of



121-7
 



executive sessions, but a brief statement setting forth the general subjects of discussions (as those executive session subjects are identified by capital letter titles in this section) shall be inserted into the minute book.

SECTION 121.07	ATTENDANCE OF MEMBERS; TELECONFERENCES;  NO PROXY VOTING.

(a)	It shall be the duty of all members of Council to be present and remain during all regular sessions of Council except when ill, in case of illness or death in their respective families, when extraordinary business interests demand immediate attention, when absent from the City, or when the absence is excused by Council.

(b)	Members who are not at the designated location of a meeting shall be deemed to be present (and therefore be counted toward a quorum and may vote) if they participate in that meeting by means of telecommunication equipment which:

(1)	enables all members participating to hear each other and to hear all other persons who are present (and who are recognized by the Mayor to speak at the meeting); and

(2)	enables all other persons attending at the designated location of the meeting to hear and speak to those members of Council participating by means of telecommunication equipment.

(c)	No proxy voting shall be permitted.

SECTION 121.08      DUTY TO VOTE; ABSTENTIONS.

(a)	Every member present shall vote when the question is put, unless the member abstains.  If there is a public hearing or any discussion among members of Council regarding a subject on which a member intends to abstain from voting, that member should declare the intent to abstain and should remove himself or herself from the discussion.  Any member who abstains from voting may make a brief statement of the reason for doing so.

(b)	A member who abstains shall be counted for the purpose of determining a quorum, but no vote shall be recorded for that member on the issue from which the member abstained.

(c)	This rule as to the effect of abstentions shall not apply, however, with regard  to organizational matters such as selection of a Clerk of Council or of a Mayor or Vice­ Mayor.  Abstentions on such organizational questions could prevent the Council from going forward to consider its business, and so, on such matters one who abstains shall be deemed to have voted with the majority of those who do vote.





121-8
 


SECTION 121.09	MANNER OF VOTING.

Many public and plivate organizations prefer to avoid roll call votes because they take much more time than is necessary.  There is no requirement in the Charter or in Robert's Rules of Order that votes be taken by the roll call method.

Accordingly, roll call voting is permitted but is not necessary.  The Mayor may call for a roll call vote, alternatively, may simply ask that those in favor say Aye or Nay (or use some similar language).  Jn the alternative or in addition, the Mayor may ask each Council Member to raise his or her hand to indicate a vote in favor and against.  A roll call vote shall be taken ifrequested by any member of Council.

SECTION 121.10	CONDUCT OF AUDIENCE AT PUBLIC MEETINGS.

The following procedure should be followed by members of the audience who wish to speak at any public meeting or public healing and who are granted the opportunity to do so:

(a)	Please wait to be recognized by the Mayor before speaking.

(b)	Upon being recognized, please lise.

(c)	If there is a podium or other location at which persons addressing the Council are to speak, the person who has been recognized should leave his or her seat and proceed to that speaking location.

(d)	Before speaking, a member of the audience should identify himself or herself by name and address and should disclose if that address is within the City ofKetteling.

(e)	Customarily, proponents will be recognized first, followed by persons who oppose the matter or issue, with a subsequent opportunity for rebuttal.

(f)	Except when leave is granted by the Mayor, there is a time limit of five minutes for each speaker in the audience.  This does not apply to the person or organization who or which has filed the application, valiance request or other matter being heard by the Council.

(g)	Please avoid repeating points made by earlier speakers.  The Mayor has the light to terminate comments that are redundant.

(h)	Comments from persons in the audience should be addressed to the Mayor, not to proponents or opponents of the issue, not to City staff, and not to other members of the audience.
 



(i)	A public meeting or a public hearing is an oppo1iunity for Council to receive input from citizens of the community.  It is not the place for a debate between persons in the audience and the applicant, City staff or members of Council.  Debating tactics such as demanding answers to questions framed in favor of the speaker are frowned upon and may be prohibited.  Since the meetings are for input, not an instant dialogue or debate, questions to which Council chooses to respond may well be answered at a subsequent meeting.

(j)		Customarily, everyone will be given an opportunity to speak before any other person is allowed to speak twice.  This does not apply to the applicant's or proponent's right to rebuttal.

 
(k)







SECTION 121.11
 
The Council reserves the right to put an end to that po1iion of any meeting or hearing in which comments from the audience are allowed, so as to leave adequate time for Council to proceed with its other business.



CHARITABLE DONATION GUIDELINES
 

(a)	Unless a charitable donation is specifically authorized by adoption of a separate resolution in which donation amounts, purposes and specific donee names are identified and approved, this Council sets the amount of One Thousand Dollars and No Cents ($1,000.00) as the total maximum, cumulative amount the City shall expend in any single calendar year for donations by this municipal government to charitable organizations.

(b)	All donations by this municipal government to charitable organizations, including fees and costs for attendance by members of Council at dinners and other functions sponsored by charitable organizations, shall be considered as part of the maximum expenditure set forth in Subsection (a) above, and furthe1more shall be considered a donation for the betterment and enrichment of this municipal government's public pmposes.

139.01	INVESTMENT  AND DEPOSIT POLICY'

Effective cash management is recognized as essential to good fiscal  management. This is particularly true as mounting costs and expanding programs have placed ever increasing pressures on local government r.evenues. Investment  returns on funds not immediately required can help to reduce this pressure. Effective cash management of these funds requires an investment and depository policy be well-founded and uncompromisingly applied. Bank management practices represent an important part of the overall treasury management function.



139.1	.1	OBJECTIVES AND GUIDELINES

The following investment objectives will be applied in the management of city funds.

A.	The primary objective of the City of Kettering's investment activities is the preservation of capital  and the protection of investment principal.

B.	In investing public funds, the City will strive to maximize the return on the portfolio but will avoid assuming unreasonable  investment risks.

C.	The City's investment portfolio  will  remain  sufficiently  liquid  to enable   the City to meet operating requirements which might be reasonably  anticipated.
 
139	CITY OF KETTERING ADMINISTRATIVE CODE	139



D.	The City will diversify its investments to avoid incurring unreasonable and avoidable risks regarding specific security types or. individual financial institutions.

E.	Investments shall be made with the exercise of that degree of judgment and care, under circumstances then prevailing, which persons of prudence, discretion and intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs, not for speculation but for investment, considering the probable safety of their capital as well as the probable income to be derived.

F.	Banks vary in the services they provide,  their  service  fees,  interest rates on interim investments  and the minimum compensating balances required for demand-deposit accounts. The City's objective is to obtain good banking  services  while  minimizing  the cost  of banking  services to the City.



139.01.2	CENTRAL DEPOSITORY

If all deposits are concentrated in one central depository, the City is in a better position to require a broader range of services. When deposits are divided among several banks. the City's ability to acquire adequate services would be limited, and the effectiveness of the City's overall cash management program reduced. Therefore, all City deposits will be concentrated in one central depository and the request for proposals will indicate the City's intent to contract with one central depository.



139.01 .3	DELIVERY VS. PAYMENT

All trades where applicable will be executed by delivery vs. payment (DVP) to ensure that securities are deposited in an eligible financial institution prior to the release of funds. Securities will be held by a third-party custodian as evidenced by safekeeping receipts.



139.1	.4	MATURITY

To the extent possible, the City will attempt to match its investments with anticipated cash flow requirements. Unless matched to a specific cash flow requirement, the City will not directly invest in securities maturing more than five (5) years from the date of purchase.



-.




139-2
 

139.01 .s	INVESTMENT  DIVERSITY

No more than 20% of the City's investment portfolio will  be placed  with any particular issuer of commercial paper, corporate bonds, bankers acceptance or money market mutual fund.



139.01 .6	AUTHORIZED  FINANCIAL  INSTITUTIONS  AND DEALERS

Securities shall be purchased only through financial  institutions located  within  the fifty
(50)	United  States  or  through  "primary  securities  dealers"  as designated   by  the  Federal  Reserve bank.    A  list  of these  authorized  institutions  and  dealers  will  be  maintained   by  the  Director  of   · Finance.

The Director of Finance:

(A)	May make additions to the authorized list when the investment and deposit policy requirements are met,

(B)	Shall make deletions from the list (I) if and as directed by ordinance of City Council, (2) upon failure of the financial institution to meet the foregoing investment and deposit policy requirements or (3) upon request of the financial institution or dealer; and

(C)	May make deletions from the list based on the following criteria or circumstances:

l.		Perceived  financial  difficulties  of the  financial  institution  or dealer;

2.	Consistent lack of competitiveness by the financial ins'titution or dealer;

3.	Lack of experience or familiarity of the account representative in providing service to large institutional accounts; or

4.	When deemed in the best interest of the City.


 
139.01.7
 
INSTRUMENTS   AUTHORIZED
 

A.	As used in this section, "derivative" means a financial instrument, contract. or obligation whose value or return is based upon or linked to another asset, index, or both, separate from the financial instrument, contract, or obligation itself.

an issue of the United States treasury or is created  from an obligation of a federal



139-3.
 



agency or instrumentality or is created from both is considered a derivative instrument. An eligible investment described in Section 135.14 or 135.35 of the Ohio Revised Code with a variable interest rate payment, based upon a single interest payment or single index comprised of other investments provided for in Division (B)(l) or (2) of Section 135.14 of the Ohio Revised Code, is not a derivative, provided that such variable rate investment has a maximum maturity of two years.

B.	The Director of Finance may only invest, on behalf of and in the name of the City, in those instruments listed below at a price not exceeding the instrument's fair market value; the Director of Finance shall not invest in any derivative(s) of said instruments.

139.1.9	COMPETITIVE  BIDDING

The purpose of competitive bidding is to strengthen the investment program in terms of level and consistency of perfonnance.

The right is reserved to reject the bid yielding the highest return of interest on any investments if inconsistent with the City investment strategy, i.e., maturity, risk, liquidity, etc.

. Price and rate quotations on all trades may be obtained from sources within and outside the City. In the case of the sale of securities or the purchase of securities where all other factors are considered by the Director of Finance to be equal, placement will be made in favor of the banking institution situated within the City if two bids or more are the same.

As stated in this policy, the City will competitively bid  and invest part or all of its surplus or excess funds outside the designated central depository bank. However, this practice will not limit the central depository bank from competitively bidding on the City's investment business as would any other financial institution.

B.	So long as required by official statements of the Governmental Accounting Standards Board ("GASB Statement 54" and subsequent), if a City of Kettering fund is to be classified as a special revenue fund, the proceeds of specific revenue sources must be restricted or committed to expenditure for specified purposes.

in the Director's professional opinion, to be the desire or direction of Council.

3.	The Director may reject any application which was not filed within the prescribed time period or which indicates that the applicant does not possess the minimum qualifications established for the position; is otherwise unfit to perform the duties of the position; has willfully made any false statement or omission of any material fact; has practiced or attempted to practice any deception or fraud in the application; has been previously dismissed from City service for good cause or whose performance rating was below standard at the time of resignation, or is otherwise not suited to fill the position.

149.5.	ENTRANCE AND  PROMOTIONAL  EXAMINATION  PROCEDURES

A.	General Provisions

3.	The Director may designate one or more staff members to assume responsibility for examination development, scoring, or other selection and evaluation duties as necessary.

8.	Tvpes of Examinations

Merit and fitness shall be ascertained, as far as practicable, by competitive examination. Examinations shall be designed to test, on a fair and equal basis, the relative qualifications of applicants to discharge the duties of the position which they seek to fill. Examinations for entry-level positions or any promotional positions (including Police and Fire) are not required to be in writing. Examinations may consist of, but are not limited to, any one or more of the following types:

1.	Written Examination: Designed to determine the familiarity of candidates with the knowledge required for the position sought, the range of their general information and to ascertain special aptitudes, when required.

2.	Performance Examination: Includes such tests of performance as would determine the ability of candidates to perform the work involved.

3.	Oral Examination: A personal interview designed to determine the ability of the candidates to perform the duties of the position to be filled, i.e., the ability to deal with others, to supervise, or other qualifications.

4.	Experience and Competency Ratings: A structured format permitting the evaluation and rating of previous experience, education or training in particular areas determined to be relevant and useful to executing the duties and responsibilities of the position to be filled. Experience ratings may be used to rank
 


order candidates on eligible lists or for non-competitive classified positions where it is impractical to ascertain the merit and fitness of applicants through traditional examinations.

C.	Examination  Administration

1.	The Director shall assign the appropriate number of examination monitors necessary for each examination process. One of the monitors shall act as the exam administrator, who shall have the responsibility for assessing and enforcing entrance requirements to the examination, restrictions, and removal  of exam participants should such actions be appropriate.

2.	The Director shall be responsible for deiermining time limitations, if any, for any examination or any part of any examination or mechanisms.

D.	Examination Review and Inquiries

1.	Candidates who have participated in an examination may, at the discretion of the Director, have an opportunity to review their own examination results. The Director may make the scored answer sheet available for the candidate's review, but is not required to do so. Candidates must conduct their examination(s) review during the thirty (30) days subsequent to notification that they are available for review. However, the Director may specify a shorter review period or change review procedures for specific examination processes if the Director so determines. The Director may determine that it is inappropriate for any particular exam or exam phase to be reviewed by candidates.

2.	When a selection process involves several exam phases, the Director shall determine whether exam reviews will occur after each phase or at the completion of the entire examination process. Exam reviews may only occur when all of the examinations for that particular phase have been scored, or when candidates are formally notified otherwise that the exam review period will commence.

3.	The Director may eliminate from the examination process or from an eligible list a candidate who duplicates any examination questions by any means.

4.	Candidates who discover an error or have a question about the scoring of an exam must submit questions and comments in writing to the Director. Inquiries will be accepted for a period of thirty (30) days from the date the examination results were mailed, unless otherwise stipulated by the Director. Any change to an eligible list which results from this review process shall be made in accordance to the Rules (see Section 600.E. Corrections to an Eligible List).

5.	Examination papers of an applicant who failed to qualify must be retained no less than one year after notification of examination  results were mailed, provided no appeal of any kind is pending, and need not be retained after that.
 


E.	Special Provisions for  Examinations

The Director may, at his discretion, make special arrangements for the examination and assessment of persons who are physically or mentally disabled, or who deserve special accommodations. Applicants who believe they should be eligible for special provisions and accommodations in testing situations must make a written request, including justification for the accommodation, to the Director, sufficiently in advance of the scheduled examination in order that such accommodations may be considered.

F.	Scoring of  Examinations

The Director shall determine the appropriate value and weight for each segment or phase of an examination, the means of evaluating examination results and determining the passing level. Examinations may be scored according to point values or evaluated on a pass/fail basis. Minimum passing points may be established for the entire examination process or for some or all of the segments or phases of the examination process. The Director may, or may not, eliminate a candidate who fails to maintain a minimum qualifying score in one part of the examination from participation in subsequent phases of the testing process. The Director may adjust the minimum passing or qualifying score when an assessment of the examination results indicates such action is appropriate and in the best interest of the City of Kettering.

A candidate's final score shall be based upon all tests, evaluations, segments and phases of the overall examination and selection process. Once all formal examination elements have been scored, the appropriate additional credits shall be added to the examination results. In some cases, the final score will represent a combination of examination grades and additional credits received. Additional credits are as follows:

1.	Performance and Seniority Credits: Candidates for promotional positions are eligible  to  receive  additional  credits  for  performance  and  seniority.  See  Section
500.H for the rules governing performance and seniority credits.

2.	Administrative Review Credit: When an Administrative Review is included in a Civil Service promotional process, up to 20 additional points will  be added to the candidate's passing score. See Section 500.1.

Candidates for entry-level competitive examinations will receive no additional credit by virtue of their status as a veteran of the armed services.

G.	Promotional Processes

Classified positions above the  entry level may be filled by competitive, or non-competitive promotions. Promotional opportunities are open only to regular  full-time  employees  who have successfully completed the designated probationary period for their current position, unless otherwise specified, and who meet the additional requirements specified in the Civil Service Rules and by the Director.                               ·                                                 ·

1.	Open Competitive Promotion: When there is an insufficient number of employees eligible for promotion who possess that experience, training or other qualifications as required by the next higher level class, and the best interest of the
 


City service would not be served by the lack of qualified applicants, then the selection process may be declared open to participants outside of the classification series and/or the City organization, except as required in the Ohio Revised Code with respect to promotion in the Police and Fire Services. The Director shall determine when an open competitive promotional process shall be conducted and establish criteria for eligibility to compete. All applicants shall be required to meet these criteria.

2.	Closed Competitive Promotion: When there is a sufficient number of qualified employees for advancement to a promotional position, the selection process may be declared closed, i.e., only existing employees within the designated position classification(s) may compete in the promotional process. The Director shall determine when a closed competitive promotional process shall be conducted, and which class(es) are eligible and establish criteria for eligibility to compete. All applicants shall be required to meet these criteria.



3.	Non-Competitive Promotion: Opportunity for a non-competitive promotion exists when:
a.	The number of employees who are eligible and qualified for advancement
is no more than the number of vacancies in that classification, plus two; or
b.	The table of organization does not limit the number of employees who can be promoted from one classification to the next classifications, but the number to be promoted is determined by the managing Department Director, the Director or the City Manager based on performance or other criteria they have established; or
c.	The Director determines in his judgment that it is impractical, or otherwise inappropriate, to use written or other traditional Civil  Service  testing mechanisms to establish an eligibility list.

Such promotional advancement may then be made without formal or traditional examinations if the Director determines that the eligible employee(s) possess the experience, training or other qualifications required for advancement to the next higher class.

All competitive (open or closed) promotional processes will be announced using an Examination Announcement, the content of which shall be at the discretion of the Director. Formal notice of a promotional examination or process shall be posted at an interval as determined by the Director prior to the examination.

H.	Performance and Seniority Credit

Competitive promotional examinations shall include points or credits for performance and seniority.                                                                                                                           ·

1.	Performance Credits
a.	The  credit  points  for  performance  ratings will  be  based on  the  overall
Performance Evaluation rating only.
b.	The overall ratings received on all performance evaluations within the last two years preceding the date the first part of the promotional examination is
 


administered to the first candidate competing in the process shall be averaged to calculate an employee's performance credit for promotional purposes. If there has been no performance evaluation within the last two years, the employee shall receive credit for standard performance. Point values for overall rating categories are as follows: (except as provided in sub-paragraph c below)
Outstanding	1O points
Above Standard	8 points
Standard	6 points
Below standard	2 points Unsatisfactory  O points
c.	When credit points are to be used as part of a promotional process for the positions of Police Sergeant and Police Lieutenant, all performance evaluations within the last three years preceding the date the first part of the promotional examination is administl:lred to the first candidate competing in the process, shall be averaged to calculate an employee's performance credit. If there has been no performance evaluation within the last three years, the employee shall receive credit for standard performance. Credit for each overall rating shall be as follows:
Outstanding	1O points
Above Standard	8 points
Standard	6 points
Below Standard	O  points Unsatisfactory    O  points
d.	The Performance Evaluation points will be added together according to the
above amounts and divided by the number of evaluations. The resulting average will be the number of credit points to be added to the candidate's passing test score. This method of calculation results in a maximum of 1O performance credit points being added to passing examination scores.
e.	Only candidates who have successfully completed their probationary period will be eligible to receive these credits, unless otherwise authorized by the
Director.

2.	Seniority Credit
a.	All calculations for seniority points for promotions shall be computed from
the employee's anniversary date of appointment  to the entry-level  position in that series.
b.	Where an employee has been reinstated to a position with the City, the total uninterrupted period of service from the date of reinstatement to that series shall  determine the computation of seniority points. Reinstated Police Officers who  participate in a Sergeant or Lieutenant promotional examination will have their  total period of service  as a sworn  Kettering
Police Officer determine the computation of seniority points.
c.	The date the Civil Service examination is administered to the first candidate
competing in the process shall be  the cut-off date for seniority point calculations, and all seniority points awarded must be earned through actual service with the City of Kettering preceding that date.
d.	Seniority points shall only be awarded to promotional exam participants who receive a passing score on the Civil Service examination.




LAW-9017 (Revision 273)
 


e.	The following formula has been established for the calculation of seniority points which are to be added to the final passing score of civil service promotional  examinations:

 
Full Years of Service Year(s) 1 thru 4
Years 5 thru 14
 
Points
1 pt./year
.6 pt./year
 
Maximum
4.0 pts.
6.0 pts.
10.0 pts.
 

This method of calculation  results in a maximum of  1O seniority  points being added to passing examination scores.
f.	Where there is at least a half year of service remaining after full years have been credited under paragraph e, half credit (either 0.5 or 0.3 pts.) will be awarded for a full-half year of service. No smaller portion than one-half years shall be used to award seniority credit.
g.		Only candidates who have successfully completed their probationary period will be eligible to receive these credits, unless otherwise stipulated by the Director.

I.	Administrative Review Credit

When an Administrative  review is included in a promotional procedure, the Director may authorize the addition of up to 20 points to the passing score of employees competing in a
Civil  Service  promotional  process.  This  covers  positions  in  all  current  and  future
departments including, but not limited to, promotions to Police Sergeant, Police Lieutenant
and Fire Captain.

1.	The Director may, or may not, authorize the inclusion of an Administrative Review process as part of a Civil Service promotional procedure.

2.	The points in an Administrative Review are assigned by the Department Director in whose department the promotion is occurring, subject to review by the Director.

3.	Administrative Review points may only be awarded to promotional examination participants who receive a passing score on the Civil Service examination.

J.	Notification of Examination Results

The Director shall determine the means and schedule by which candidates are notified of examination results and eligibility list ranking.

149.6.	CERTIFICATION OF ELIGIBLE LISTS AND CANDIDATES

A.	Generation of Eligible List

1.	Based on the results of civil service examination procedures, the Director shall prepare eligible lists containing the names of candidates who may be considered for the specified position. An eligible list must be certified (signed and dated) by the Director in order to become active.




LAW·9017 (Revision 273)	m
 


2.	Candidates names shall be placed on the eligible list in rank order, by final rating; the candidate receiving the highest passing rating at the top of the list and subsequent candidates with passing ratings listed in descending order. For the purpose of establishing an eligible list, when applicants receive identical passing and qualifying ratings, names shall be placed in alphabetical order, based on last name. In the event of two or more applicants receiving identical ratings on a promotional examination, seniority shall determine the order in which their names shall be placed on the eligible list.

For the  purpose of certifying applicant's names from an eligible  list, whenever identical ratings are received, the tie will not be broken. All persons receiving identical passing and qualifying ratings shall be certified, in accordance with these rules.

B.	Certification of Candidates for Entry and Promotional Positions

1.	When a vacancy occurs within the classified service and an eligible list exists for that position, the Department Director shall request that the Director certify candidates from the existing list.

2.	The certification of candidates' names shall be as follows:
a.	The top three (3) candidates for a promotion, including Police and Fire, and the top ten (10) candidates for initial entry on the eligible list, who are interested in being considered for the existing vacancy, shall be certified to the requesting Department Director;
b.	If a tie exists in one of the top three or ten standings remaining on the eligible list, more than three or ten names may be certified in order to include those candidates who receive equal ratings. For example, if four candidates receive the same rating on an eligible list for promotion, then those four names will be certified. If the person having the highest rating is ranked #1 on the eligible list, the person with the second highest rating is ranked #2 on the eligible list, and the person ranked #3 and the following two people receive the same rating on the eligible list, then all five names will be certified for consideration.
c.	Once candidates have been certified, the Department Director is obligated to interview each candidate unless the candidate is eliminated by the Director, withdraws from consideration, or fails to appear for the interview;
d.	The inability of a candidate to report for an interview within a reasonable period  of  time  shall  be  just  cause  for  omitting  that  candidate  from
immediate certification;
e.	The Director, at his discretion, shall be responsible for determining when the name of an eligible candidate shall be removed from the eligible list.

3.	In instances where more than one entry-level vacancy is to be filled within the same classification, the Director shall certify the names of nine candidates more than the number of existing vacancies. For promotions, the Director will certify the names of two candidates more than the number of existing vacancies. If tie ratings exist, the procedure in Section 600, B·2 above will be utilized.





n	LAW-9017 (Revision 273)
 


4.	When a candidate withdraws from the  process, the Department Director shall notify the Director. Additional candidates shall be certified from the eligible list to provide the required number of eligible candidates for consideration. Written confirmation of withdrawal and the reasons shall be provided by the candidate whenever possible.

5.	A candidate may temporarily withdraw from consideration for an immediate vacancy but remain on the eligible list to be considered for future vacancies or may request that his or her name be removed from the eligible list.

6.	The Director, at his discretion, shall determine procedures and criteria for removal of candidates from an eligibility list.

C.	Removal from Eligible List

1.	The name of  any person appearing on an eligible  list may be removed  by the Director under the following conditions:
a.	The eligible person requests in writing that his or her name be removed.
b.	The eligible person cannot be located by postal authorities or other means of ordinary communication within a reasonable time as determined by the
Director.
c.	The name of an eligible person has been certified three (3) times and the
candidate  has declined to be interviewed  or  has not been selected for
appointment.
d.	For any cause, either specified or not specified in these Rules, for which
the Director determines that a candidate does not possess qualifications or other characteristics which the Director determines important for the position being filled. This includes, but is not limited to, honesty, character, ethical behavior and reputation.

D.	Duration of Eligible Lists

1.	Under normal circumstances, an eligible list shall remain in effect for a period of one (1) year from the date of original certification. At the discretion of the Director, an eligible list may be extended or renewed for a period of six (6) months. A second six (6) month extension or renewal may also be authorized by the Director. The extensions or renewals may be made at any time prior to the certification of a new list.

2.	An eligible list may be allowed to expire at any one of the critical time periods (i.e., after the first year of active status, after the first six-month extension, or after the second six-month extension).

3.	The normal maximum life of an eligible list is two (2) years from the original date of certification. Under certain circumstances, the Director may determine that a particular eligible list should be extended beyond the normal two-year period. An eligible list may be extended when, in the process of being utilized to fill a Civil Service vacancy, it reaches its final expiration date. Once the vacancy has been filled, the list will automatically become expired and a new list will be created for
future vacancies as the need arises.



LAW-9017 (Revision 273)	0
 



E.	Corrections to an Eligible List

1.	The Director may make changes to an eligible list when such changes are required and in the best interest of the City. The normal conditions which would mandate a change to an existing certified eligible list are:
a.	A clerical error or miscalculation during the scoring process, Which results in a candidate appearing on the list who is ineligible, or which results in an inappropriate ranking of candidates.
b.	The omission of a candidate who was eligible to appear on the list.

2.	When such an error has been discovered, the eligible list will be corrected to reflect the accurate information. Such a correction may be unilaterally enacted by the Director. If such a correction occurs, there shall be no need to re-establish or recreate a new eligible list, and the certification date shall not change.

3.	Any appointment made prior to the discovery and subsequent correction of any error  on an eligible list shall not be invalidated. Any referral in progress shall be continued to its conclusion, unless otherwise determined by the Director.

4.	Should significant errors or inaccuracies exist in a certified eligible list, the Director may, at his discretion, determine that such list should be vacated.

F.	Abolishment of an Eligible List

1.	When fewer than the number of names which can be certified for positions to be filled remain on an eligible list, the Director shall determine whether the remaining eligibles shall be certified or whether the list shall be vacated.

2.	When all the names on an eligible list have been certified, removed, employed, etc., the eligible list shall be considered exhausted.

3.	The Director may vacate an existing eligible list, should he determine that such an action is in the best interests of the City.

G.	Use of Alternate Eligible Lists

1.	When a vacancy occurs in the classified service and there is no eligible list in effect for that position, an alternate eligible list already in existence may be used. The Director shall determine which, if any, of the existing eligible lists is appropriate for the position(s) in question.	·

2.	The procedure for certification of names from an alternate list shall be the same as all other certifications.

149.7.	LATERAL ENTRY

A.	General Provisions

1.	The process of Lateral Entry is established as a method for hiring Police Patrol Officers and Firefighters who have already been trained by other jurisdictions (or this jurisdiction).

2.	This form of initial appointment meets the criteria of a non-competitive selection process into the classified Civil Service for Police Patrol Officers, Firefighters and Paramedics, since it is recognized that trained Patrol Officers, trained Firefighters and trained Paramedics possess unique and exceptional qualifications and experience for which it  is impracticable to ascertain the merit and fitness of applicants	through competitive examinations. Qualifications which are impracticable to test for  include, but are not limited to, past performance and behavior and demonstrated success as a Police Officer, Firefighter or Paramedic.

3.	The Director shall establish, at his discretion, the criteria required for a candidate to qualify for consideration and selection under a Lateral Entry process.

4.	The Director may apply the Lateral Entry process to other classified positions where he deems it to be in the best interest of the City of Kettering.

5.	The Director may also authorize the selection of Police Patrol Officers through a non-competitive selection process should it be determined that it is in the City's best interest to  require a four-year baccalaureate degree for  entry-level Police Patrol Officers, with or without prior Police Officer experience.

6.	Positions filled through these procedures are therefore exempt from competitive examination.

7.	New employees selected through these procedures shall obtain and retain all other rights attributed to the classified service, following successful completion of the probationary period.

149.8.	TEMPORARYnNTERIM PROMOTIONS

A.	General Provisions

1.	When a vacancy  occurs in a promotional-level position in the classified service because of separation or authorized leave of absence of an employee, the appointing authority may request that the Director certify, for temporary/interim appointment to the vacant position, the names of the three persons standing highest on an appropriate promotional eligible list.

2.	Such appointment shall continue only for the period of absence of the original employee.

3.	A temporary/interim promotion shall not grant to the promoted employee any permanent right to the higher position classification.



LAW-9017 (Revision 273)	q
 


4.	At the completion of the temporary/interim promotion, the employee shall return to the position held prior to the temporary/interim promotion, and the name of the employee promoted shall be returned to its former position on  the  appropriate eligible list, if that same list is still active.

5.	An employee may refuse temporary/interim promotion, and such refusal shall not affect the employee's standing on the eligible list or current employment status.

6.	In the absence of an eligible promotional list, the temporarily vacant position may be filled, on an interim basis, by an employee in the next lower classification based on the recommendation of the Department Director and the approval of the Director.

149.09. APPOINTMENT/EMPLOYMENT STATUS OF CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES

A.	Appointment  Categories

An original appointment to any position commences with the required probationary period.

2.	Provisional Appointment: An employee may be provisionally appointed to a vacant or newly created classified position for which no Civil Service eligible list exists. Employees appointed provisionally are not classified employees and do not obtain such status automatically or after any given length of service in the provisional status. Under normal  circumstances,  provisional  appointments  should not exceed six (6) months in duration.  When  a  provisional  employee  has performed well and the six month period is exhausted, the employee may submit a request to obtain full-time, classified status.  Such requests should be submitted to the Director in writing. The decision of the Director to authorize or deny full-time classified status shall be appealable to the Commission.

3.	Temporary or Interim Appointment: A temporary or interim appointment may be made to fill a classified position vacated due to separation or leave of absence of the incumbent employee. Such an appointment shall not grant to the temporary appointee any permanent rights to the position.

4.	Emergency Appointment: An emergency, as the term is used in this Section, means any unforeseen condition which is likely to cause loss of life or damage to property, the stoppage of services, or serious inconvenience to the public. Upon receipt of a request from a Department Director citing such emergency condi­ tion(s), the appointing authority may authorize one or more temporary emergency appointments, for the duration of the emergency. Such emergency appointments shall be limited to the duration of the emergency as determined by the City Manager. The position classifications in which Emergency Appointees are placed may be existing or newly created classified position classifications.

5.	Promotional Appointment: Whenever practicable and in the best interest of the City, as determined by the Director, vacancies in positions above the entry level


r	LAW-9017    (Revision   273)

B.	Probationary Period

The probationary period is the final stage of a selection process. A classified employee must satisfactorily complete a probationary period for continued employment. Satisfactory completion of the probationary period must be documented by a formal evaluation rating of satisfactory or above.

1.	Initial Appointment: Each newly appointed classified employee shall be required to serve a probationary period of 12 months. The Director may extend an employee's probationary period for a reasonable amount of time (up to 12 additional months) ii it is determined that an extended period of observation and evaluation is appropriate. Any  extension of the probationary period beyond an additional 12 months must be approved by the Commission. A probationary employee may be dismissed for any reason at any time during the original or extended probationary period.

2.	Promotions: An employee who has served an initial probationary period is subject to an additional six (6) month probationary period upon promotion. The Director may extend the probationary period for a reasonable amount of time (up to 6 months). Any extension of the probationary period beyond an additional six (6) months must be approved by the Commission. An unsatisfactory probationary employee may be:
a.	Reinstated to the  position in which  he or she was  serving  prior  to the
promotion, provided that an appropriate vacancy exists, or
b.	Placed upon the appropriate eligible list for his or her former position ii an appropriate vacancy does not exist, or
c.	Assigned to a similar position in another job class, or
d.	Removed from employment with the City.

The Director must authorize such action and shall inform the appointing authority and Commission of the decision.

C.	Change In Employment Status

1.	Transfer: The appointing authority may transfer an employee from one position to another  within the same or similar classifications. A transfer shall not be used to promote,  demote, increase, or decrease the salary of a classified employee. No person shall be transferred to a position for which he or she does not possess the required minimum   qualifications. The Director shall determine whether the employee possesses the  necessary qualifications for transfer  to the position in question.

An employee who would like to request a transfer must submit a written request to the Director.

Reinstatements must be authorized by the appointing authority and may be handled by the employee being:
a.	reinstated to an appropriate eligible list, should a list for that position exist;
b.	placed on an appropriate eligible list of one, should no eligible list for the position exist;
c.	reinstated  to  the  position  from  which  they  separated  or  to  a  similar class/position should a vacancy within that appropriate classification exist;
d.	reinstated	to	the	next	available	vacancy	within	the	appropriate position/classification, should no immediate vacancy exist.

The Director shall consider pertormance evaluations, length of previous seivice, the circumstances governing separation from classified seivice, and the recommendations of  the immediate supeivisor and the appointing authority in making a determination for reinstatement.

When a reinstated employee's name is placed on an existing eligible list, that individual's eligibility for reemployment shall expire two years from the date on which that individual's name was placed on the appropriate list(s). An employee whose name is reinstated to an eligible list is subject to all rules governing such lists. An employee who is approved for reinstatement to an appropriate vacant position is subject to the normal pre-appointment processing for that position as well as all normal employment restrictions and conditions governing the classified seivice. The Director may require that a reinstated employee seive a new probationary period commencing with the date of reinstatement.

The name of an employee who resigns from City seivice shall be removed from any active promotional list, and it shall not be returned to a promotional list by the act of reinstatement to a position  or entry eligible list. Such employee must compete for a rank on any subsequent promotional lists, without regard to the fact that any position or ranking had been obtained on a promotional list prior  to resignation. (Exception: on a promotional list, a returning veteran's civil seivice status will be restored in compliance with Ohio Revised Code 5903.03.) Seivice or seniority calculations for eligibility to compete in a promotional process will  be calculated from the date of reinstatement. Prior seivice, regardless of whether it is in the same position or not, shall not apply for the purposes of promotion, layoff, etc., except for Police Sergeant and Lieutenant promotional exams where total years of seivice as a Kettering Police Officer will be used for computations, and Fire Captain promotional exams where total years of seivice as a full-time Kettering Firefighter will be used for computations.

3.	Reclassification: A position reclassification may occur when a specific position or group of positions has undergone a significant change in the kind, difficulty, or degree of responsibility entailed in the work pertormed within that position. Such a reclassification may result in the assignment of that position to a higher, lower or similar  classification  based  on  the  type  of  changes  and  duties  which  have
 


occurred. The Director shall assess reclassifications in order to determine whether or not the new position belongs in the classified service. The Commission shall confirm the placement of positions within the classified service. Changes in compensation due to a reclassification are beyond the jurisdiction of the Commission, and shall be at the discretion of the appointing authority and City Council.

4.	Demotion (Reduction): The appointing authority may demote an employee whose ability to pertorm required duties has fallen below acceptable standards or for disciplinary purposes. Demotions for disciplinary purposes shall only be made for cause, based on an assessment of merit and fitness. However, a voluntary written statement from an employee agreeing to a demotion shall be considered sufficient basis for such action in the absence of evidence to the contrary. Written notice of the demotion shall be given to the employee at any time prior to the effective date of the demotion; a copy of the demotion shall be filed with the Director. A classified employee may appeal  a non-voluntary reduction in pay and/or position to the Commission. (See Section 1300: Appeals to the Civil Service Commission).

An employee who feels unable to pertorm adequately in his or her current position may voluntarily request a reduction or demotion in position classification from the appropriate Department Director.

5.	Layoffs: See Section 1100: Reduction in Force.

6.	Suspension,  Removal.  Discharge:  See  Section  1000:  Suspension.  Removal.
Discharge.

149.10. SUSPENSION, REMOVAL, DISCHARGE

A.	Merit and Fitness

Once an employee has successfully completed the probationary period, the employee shall obtain regular full-time classified status. Employment in the classified service shall be contingent upon continuous demonstration of merit and fitness. That is, the employee must demonstrate appropriate behavior and satisfactory pertormance of working responsibilities and duties as required for the position held. An employee who fails to pertorm satisfactorily, or who exhibits inappropriate, undesirable, or illegal behavior is subject to disciplinary action.

B.	Suspension

The appointing authority may suspend without pay an employee for disciplinary reasons, or for other just cause, based on the standards of merit and fitness. The appointing authority will provide written notice of the suspension and the reasons for the suspension shall be given to the employee by the Department Director or other designee. A copy of the suspension action and the reasons for such suspension which were provided to the employee shall be filed with the Director for the Commission.

Suspensions which are for a period of less than or equal to five (5) working days are not subject to appeal before the Commission. If a suspension exceeds five (5) working days, a
 


regular classified employee has the right to submit an appeal to the Commission for a hearing on its merits unless specifically otherwise provided by a collective bargaining agreement. (See Section 1300: Appeals to the Civil Service Commission).

C.	Removal or Discharge

A classified employee may be discharged by the appointing authority for activities which are prohibited by established orders, rules, regulations, policies or procedures or for activities or behaviors which fail to meet the standards of merit and fitness or otherwise constitute poor job performance or poor behavior. Any of the following activities are just cause for dismissal (removal or discharge) from City service: incompetency; inefficiency; dishonesty; drunkenness; immoral or inappropriate conduct; insubordination; discourteous treatment of the public or of coworkers; neglect of duties; violation of the rules of the Commission or of the appointing authority; failure of good behavior; misfeasance, malfeasance or nonfeasance in office. These are examples of just cause for dismissal; in no instance are they to be considered all inclusive.

The appointing authority shall provide written notice to the employee of the removal, setting forth the specific charges and/or reasons for the discharge and stating an effective date. Notice of dismissal shall be personally delivered to the employee or the employee's address by a designated City employee, or it shall be mailed by certified or registered letter to the employee's last known address. A copy of the complete notice provided to the employee shall be filed with the Director for the Commission at the time it is provided to the employee.

A permanent classified employee has the right to appeal a discharge or removal action to the Commission, in accordance with the provisions of these Rules, except to the extent validly modified by a collective bargaining agreement. (See Section 1300: Appeals to the Civil Service Commission\.

149.11.  REDUCTION IN FORCE

A.	Reduction in Personnel

The City Manager, as the appointing authority, shall determine when and for what reasons it is necessary to  reduce the number  of employees, which departments and position classifications will be affected and the actual number of employees to be reduced (laid-off) in each position classification. Although not limited to the following, a reduction in force or layoff is generally due to a lack of funds, a lack of work or the need to abolish (permanently delete from the organization) a position(s) due to a lack of continued need for such position(s). The means for notification of employees of layoffs shall be at the discretion of the City Manager.

B.	General Rules Regarding Layoff

A reduction in the number of employees within a position classification shall generally be governed in accordance with this section.






v	LAW-9017 (Revision 273)
 


All layoffs from any position shall be based upon combined seniority and performance credit; however, where special skills are needed, these will prevail. The combined credit is the result of multiplying performance credit by seniority credit.

1.	Seniority Credit: For the purposes of layoff, seniority credits shall only be given with regard to any position, for service in that position or in another position with skills that include the position under consideration. Only appointment to a full-time permanent position shall be considered. One (1) seniority credit shall be awarded for each full quarter year of service. No partial credits are awarded. If an employee is terminated and later reappointed, only service from the date of reappointment shall be used.

2.	Performance  Credit: All performance  evaluations  within  the last two (2) years preceding the date of layoff shall be averaged to calculate performance credit. If there has been no performance evaluation within the last two years, the employee shall  receive  credit  for  standard  performance.  Percentage  values  have  been assigned to the Overall Rating section of the performance evaluation form:
Outstanding	150%
Above Standard	125%
Standard	100%
Below Standard	75%
Unsatisfactory	50%

3.	Displacement Rights (Bumping): An employee displaced from a job shall in turn displace (bump) the employees in the same department or division in an equal or lower paying job, whose combined credits are lower. An employee will bump into the highest pay range available under these rules and will bump the individual in that range whose combined credit is lowest. Neither temporary nor provisional employees have any seniority, and provisional employees shall be retained in an overstaffed position only when required by specially needed skills. Employees who are on probation in an overstaffed classification will be retained there only when required by specially needed skills. Within any classification (with those exceptions) probationary employees have precedence over provisional employees, who in turn have precedence over temporary employees. Except for positions which have been identified as unskilled, the employee bumping into the job must have previously held the job successfully or a job with skills that include it.

For the purposes of layoff, Street Service I, II and Ill shall be treated as one classification; Parks Service I, II and Ill shall be treated as one classification; and Buildings Service I and II shall be treated as one classification; and all other classification series which are subject to non-competitive promotion shall be treated as one classification. Examples of such non-competitive series are:
•	Buildings Service I and II
•	Parks Service I, II and Ill
•	Streets Service I, II and Ill
•	Firefighter I, II and Ill
•	Clerk Typist  I and 11
•	Secretary I and II
•	Traffic Engineering Technician I and II
•	Traffic Control I and II



LAW-9017 (Revision 273)	w
 


The Director may identify other non-competitive series. If the City permits supervisors or other unclassified employees to bump back into a classified position previously held, their seniority credits and performance credits shall be calculated as provided by these Rules. Classified Civil Service employees whose jobs are permanently abolished may exercise bumping rights as provided by these Rules.

C.	Retention of Seniority

Seniority shall be broken, and right to employment shall cease, in the following cases:
1.	Discharge;
2.	Resignation;
3.	Retirement;
4.	Absence due to layoff for a period of two years (unpaid balance will not count toward advancement in pay grade promotion);
5.	Failure to return to work upon recall within the period provided by these Rules;
6.	Expiration of any authorized leave.

D.	Recall

Employees shall be recalled from layoff using the same principles as in the case of layoff.
1.	An employee must either return to work within 5 days of delivery of the notice of recall to the last address provided to the City or within that time notify the City of intent to return within an additional 7 days, and the employee must then do so.
2.	The City may temporarily fill the position at its discretion during that time.
3.	Notice of  recall shall be by certified or registered mail to the  last address  the employee gave the Human Resource Department.
4.	Employees may turn down a recall to a lower paid classification and remain on the recall list.
5.	The City shall not hire new employees into bargaining unit jobs as long as there
are employees on recall lists who are eligible by this section, to be reinstated to the position, qualified to fill the position and who will accept the position.

E.	Collective Bargaining Agreements

Layoff and recall procedures contained in collective bargaining agreements shall supersede these procedures for employees specifically covered by the agreement, to the extent provided in the agreement.

149.12. Prohibited Practices

A.	Appointment, Promotions, and Conduct of Examinations

No person or combination of persons shall defeat, obstruct or defraud the administration of a Civil Service examination in any manner. No person shall falsify information or results of an examination. No person shall request or receive any sum of money as a condition of application, examination, appointment or promotion. Violation of these Rules is cause for immediate removal.






x	LAW·9017 (Revision 273)
 


B.	Equal Employment Opportunity

Individual merit and fitness shall be the determinant in employment decisions within the City's classified service. All employment or promotional decisions will therefore be made without regard to political or religious affiliation, race, sex, creed, color, national origin or physical or mental disability, unless there is a lawful and bona fide requirement to do so.

149.13.	APPEALS TO THE CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION

A.	Actions Subject to Appeal

An employee who is in the classified service, and who has satisfactorily completed the designated or extended probationary period, may appeal certain employment actions to the Commission for reconsideration. The following employment actions may, under certain circumstances, be appealed:
1.	Demotions;
2.	Suspensions of more than five (5) working days;
3.	Layoffs;
4.	Reclassification for disciplinary reasons;
5.	Terminations.

Decisions of the Commission in such matters shall be final.

B.	Filing of Appeals

When a classified employee wishes to file an appeal with the Commission, such appeal must be presented in writing, and submitted to the Director within ten calendar days of the date that notification of the contested employment action was received by the employee. The Commission shall make every effort to conduct the appeal hearing for the employee without excessive delay.

C.	Conduct of Appeal Hearings

The Commission shall declare the hearing to be either public or private, with consideration to the wishes of the employee,  the City, and applicable public information and privacy laws. The Commission shall have the power to subpoena and require the attendance of witnesses required for the proper conduct of the hearing, the authority to require that applicable documents be produced by witnesses and relevant parties for review by the Commission, and the authority to administer oaths during the conduct of hearings. The Commission is under no obligation to follow strict legal rules of evidence or procedure, and has the latitude to determine the manner and conduct of each hearing.

After  the  hearing  and  consideration  of  the  evidence,  the  Commission  shall  render  a decision  affirming,  disaffirming  or  modifying  the  judgment  and  action  taken  by  the appointing authority. The Commission may further order the restoration of the employee to a position with or without the loss of pay for the period of time which has elapsed between the filing of charges and the  rendering of  a decision.  The Commission may take  any alternative action that may be appropriate to the specific circumstances of the case before their  consideration,  but  in  no  case  may  it  recommend  or  authorize  the  payment  of




LAW-9017 (Revision 273)	y
 


monetary damages or award beyond the real amount of compensation involved in the particular case.

The findings and decision of the Commission shall be certified to the appointing authority and to the appellant (employee) and/or  the  appellant's  representative.  Either  the appointing authority or employee may appeal the decision of the Commission to the Court of Common Pleas, in accordance with Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.

Should the appellant or appellant's representative fail to appear before the Commission or a designated hearing officer at the scheduled hearing time, such failure shall be considered grounds for dismissal of the hearing. No further action by the Commission shall be necessary.

D.	Hearing Officer

The Commission may appoint a hearing otticer, who may preside, take testimony, and receive evidence at the hearing on behalf of the Commission. The hearing otticer may request the issuance of subpoenas for specific witnesses.and/or request the Commission to require the submission of relevant documents for the proper conduct of the hearing. Hearings shall be conducted with a court reporter present who shall record all testimony, mark all exhibits and administer oaths to witnesses. A transcript of the hearing shall be prepared and presented to the Commission which shall then make its decision based upon the evidence and testimony presented in the transcript. The Commission may have the hearing recorded on audio tape or audio-visual tape, in which case the hearing otticer will mark exhibits and administer oaths.

The Commission may, but is not required to, request a recommendation from the hearing officer regarding the disposition of the particular case involved. The hearing officer, at the request of the Commission, is entitled to attend the Commission's deliberations following the hearing. The Kettering Commission may provide for compensation for the hearing otticer.

E.	Right to Counsel

The employee-appellant shall be entitled to personally appear before the Commission or hearing officer, produce evidence, and have the right to counsel. The appointing authority or a designee may also appear personally before the  Commission or hearing otticer, produce evidence and retain the right to be represented by counsel. The Commission may, at its discretion, have its own counsel present at all hearings and deliberations.

F.	Collective Bargaining Agreements

Appeal procedures contained in collective bargaining agreements shall supersede these procedures for employees covered by those agreements, to the extent provided in the agreements.

149.14.	INTERGOVERNMENTAL COOPERATION

A.	General  Provisions

City Manager as Contract Officer-ADM.  133.01



SECTION 152.01	LEGISLATION REQUIRED FOR $25,000.00 OR MORE

A.	The City Manager may make contracts on behalf of the City involving an expenditure of less than $25,000.00 (for which funds have been appropriated) without a separate resolution or ordinance of approval, but for contracts over that amount such legislative approval shall be necessary, except as provided below in this Section 152.01.

B.	Where the matter involved is purchasing supplies, materials, utility services, or other items of a routine repetitive nature (for which funds have been appropriated), the City Manager is authorized to enter into a contract without a separate resolution or ordinance of approval, even if the price is $25,000.00 or more.

C.	Where an emergency exists involving health, safety or other aspects of
city government, the City Manager may make contracts for expenditures of $25,000.00 or
more (for which funds have been appropriated) without a separate resolution or ordinance of approval; and in such a situation, the City Manager shall make a report to Council as soon as reasonably possible regarding the circumstances.



SECTION 152.02	FORMAL SEALED BIDDING

A.	The duties imposed by this section are in addition to and not in place of the requirements of Section 152.01.

B.	Formal sealed bids shall be used as part of the procedure of detennining the lowest and best contract for construction of improvements, for purchases of tangible


152-1
 


supplies and materials, and for purchases of services (other than those of the learned professions, i.e. those requiring graduate degrees) reasonably anticipated by the City to cost $25,000.00 or more, except as otherwise provided in subsequent paragraphs of this section. The type of advertisement or other solicitation for such bids, the length of time such advertisement or solicitation shall be continued, and all other details regarding the bidding procedure and subsequent award of contracts shall be as prescribed by the City Manager in written purchasing regulations which the Manager is hereby empowered to issue and to amend from time to time.

C.	If after such advertisement or other solicitation no bids are received, or if all bids are rejected, the City Manager shall have the option to seek new sealed bids or to make the purchase through the competitive bargaining procedures referred to in Section
152.03 below, without legislative authorization in addition to this chapter.

D.	Where an emergency exists involving health, safety, or other aspects of city government, the City Manager may not only enter into a contract for $25,000.00 or more without a separate resolution or ordinance (to the extent the funds have been appropriated and as authorized in 152.01 C above) but may also do so without following either the sealed bidding procedure referred to above in paragraph B or the competitive bargaining procedures described in Section 152.03 and without legislative authorization in addition to this chapter.  In such a situation, the City Manager shall make a report to the Council as soon as reasonably possible regarding the circumstances.

E.	If special circumstances make it advisable that the City deal with a sole source supplier, the City Manager may enter into contracts with that sole source without legislative authorization in addition to this chapter and without following either the sealed bidding procedure referred to in this section or the competitive bargaining procedures referred to in Section 152.03 below.  Change orders for additional work on public improvements may be treated as sole source supplier situations up to a total amount, for all such change orders on any particular contract, not to exceed 25% of the amount of the original contract.  For purchases of work or materials over that 25% amount, the requirements of this chapter as to sealed bids or competitive bargaining shall apply
(unless dispensed with by some other paragraph of this Section 152.02).

F.	Where proximity of the supplier is a determinative factor, the City Manager shall have the option to make the purchase without legislative authorization in addition to this chapter and without following either the sealed bidding procedure referred to in this section or the competitive bargaining procedures referred to in Section
152.03 below.

G.	As another exception to sealed bids and to competitive bargaining requirements, the City Manager is authorized to make purchases through the cooperative purchasing programs described in Section 152.04 below.


152-2
 




H.	Since in many instances the City can obtain lower prices and/or better goods and more favorable conditions through competitive bargaining than through sealed bids, the Council may by resolution substitute competitive bargaining for sealed bids whenever it sees fit to do so.

I.	At any time and for whatever other reason it deems appropriate, the Council may by resolution dispense with sealed bids (and with the competitive bargaining procedures described in Section 152.03) as to any particular contract or purchase.

J.	Where the matter involved is purchasing supplies, materials, utility services or other items of a routine and repetitive nature, the City customarily can obtain lower prices and/or better goods and more favorable conditions through competitive bargaining than through sealed bids.  Accordingly, such purchases may be made through the competitive bargaining procedure described in Section 152.04 instead of the sealed bid method of purchasing.



SECTION 152.03	COMPETITIVE BARGAINING

Competitive bargaining shall be used as part of the procedure of determining the lowest and best contract for construction of improvements estimated to cost less than
$25,000 and for purchases of supplies, materials and services for less than $25,000,
subject to the exceptions for emergency, sole source, proximity and cooperative purchasing described in Section 152.02 above.  The type of solicitation for informal competitive quotes and other details of such competitive bargaining procedures shall be as prescribed in written purchasing regulations issued and amended by the City Manager from time to time.



SECTION 152.04	COOPERATIVE PURCHASING PROGRAMS

A.	As a competitive approach to purchasing which is an alternative to both the sealed bid and competitive bargaining procedures described above in this chapter, the City Manager shall also have authority to purchase tangible supplies and materials through cooperative purchasing programs without legislative authorization in addition to this chapter.

B.	Such cooperative purchasing programs include but are not limited to the Local Government Purchasing Program sometimes referred to as SWOP4G, a separate program through the Office of State Purchasing (part of the Ohio Department of




152-3
 


Administrative Services) pursuant to Revised Code 125.04, and a program arranged by the Ohio Department of Transportation.

C.	As part of any such cooperative purchasing program, the City Manager may agree that the City shall be bound by all contract terms and conditions prescribed by that program, including but not limited to, payment of a reasonable fee by the City to cover the administrative costs incurred by the program officials as a result of purchases
by the City of Kettering.  The City Manager may agree under this procedure that the City will pay the vendor directly for items received by the City.



SECTION 152.05	CONSTRUCTION   CONTRACTS

As a charter city, the City of Kettering shall not be obligated to follow the statutory procedures regarding construction contracts, public improvements or professional design contracts including but not limited to Ohio Revised Code Sections 9.312, 9.313, 9.32, 9.33 through 9.332, 153.12-14, 153.50-52, 153.54, 153.56, 153.57,
153.571) and other applicable sections within R.C. 153. Instead, in addition to fulfilling
the requirements of this Chapter 152 as to contracts and purchases, the City Manager is authorized to use such further procedures for construction contracts, public improvements and design contracts as he deems to be in the best interests of this City. (Cross
Reference: see 152.02 E regarding change orders on construction contracts.)



SECTION 152.06	BLANKET PURCHASE ORDERS

A.	A blanket purchase order is not based upon, and does not constitute, a contract obligating the City to purchase certain materials or services. Instead, such a blanket order merely allows or permits a series of routine and repetitive purchases of supplies, materials, utility service or other items from a named supplier up to the dollar figure stated in that order, but does not obligate the City to make any amount of purchases whatsoever.  Such a purchase order, when issued and approved as required by
this section, constitutes authority for City departments to make occasional purchases from that supplier without need for additional authorization from the City Council, City Manager or the Department of Finance.

B.	Before any blanket purchase order is issued, it must be requested on a written document signed by the appropriate department director.

C.	A blanket purchase order may be approved under this section for purchases totaling less than $25,000.00, as long as the funds have been lawfully appropriated for that purpose and are in the treasury or in the process of collection to the credit of the appropriate fund, free from previous and then outstanding obligations or


152-4
 



certifications.  The Finance Director shall sign a certification to that effect upon each blanket purchase order, and each such purchase order also shall be signed by the Purchasing Manager.

D.	A blanket purchase order may be issued for purchases totaling $25,000.00 or more but only on the basis of a separate resolution or ordinance of approval passed by the City Council, to the extent such approval is otherwise required by Chapter 152 dealing with purchases and contracts.  For such blanket order so authorized by the City Council, the funds must also have been lawfully appropriated for that purpose and are in the treasury or in the process of collection to the credit of the appropriate fund, free from previous and then outstanding obligations or certifications.  The Finance Director shall sign a certification to that effect upon each blanket purchase order, and each such purchase order also shall be signed by the Purchasing Manager.

E.	Because blanket purchase orders are not used to set prices but instead merely establish the terms of purchase applicable as small amounts of the supplies, materials, services, etc. are purchased from time to time during the year at then-existing prices, the use of competitive bargaining procedures is not a prerequisite to issuance of such blanket orders.

F.	The amount of time for which a blanket purchase order is to remain in effect shall be stated in that order and may not exceed twelve months nor the end of the fiscal year, whichever occurs sooner.

G.	While the blanket purchase order is in effect, every separate purchase under it must be authorized in writing by the appropriate department head.  Through this section of the codified ordinances, each such department head shall be deemed to hold delegated authority from the City Manager to bind the City to implementations of blanket purchase orders.



SECTION 152.07	KETTERING LOCAL PREFERENCE

A.	When using Formal Sealed Bidding or Competitive Bargaining to procure commodities and equipment costing $200,000 or less, the City may exercise a preference for local business as provided herein.

B.	For the purposes of this Section 152.07, the following terms, phrases, words, and their derivations shall have the meanings as set forth herein. When not inconsistent with the context, words in the present tense include the future tense, words in the plural number include the singular number, and words in the singular number include the plural number. The words "shall" and "will" are mandatory and "may" is permissive.  Words not defined shall be given their common and ordinary meaning.  References hereafter to
 


"Sections" are, unless otherwise specified, references to Sections in this Chapter  152. Defined terms remain defined tenns whether or not capitalized.

I.	"Local business" means an individual or business entity that has continuously maintained a pennanent office or other pennanent facility (e.g., a manufacturing facility, warehouse, retail store, or other business purpose site) within the corporate limits of the City for the past two successive years preceding the making of a bid and has filed a return and paid a payroll or earnings tax to the City in the most recent quarter.

2.	"Qualified local business" means a local business that has submitted a bid confonning to the specifications and who is not otherwise disqualified. Any of these factors will disqualify a local business from eligibility for the local preference: i. being on the debarred contractor list; ii. nonpayment of any tax, fee, lien, service charge, or other assessment; iii. failure to comply \\ th the City's income tax code; iv. failure to faithfully perfonn or satisfactorily complete any previous contract with the City;

3.	"Local preference" means that in detennining the low bid for commodities and equipment costing $200,000 or less, the City may allow a qualified local business to match the lowest and best bid received from a non­ local business, ifthe qualified local business' bid was within five percent (5%) of the lowest and best bid received from a non-local business.

4.	"Bid" means the price and other required infonnation, if any, quoted to the City by a local or non-local business in response to an invitation to bid, a request for proposal, a request for qualifications, or other means of solicitation used by the City to purchase commodities and equipment.

5.	"Non-local business" means an individual or business entity that does not meet the definition of local business.

C.	In all invitations to bid, requests for proposal, requests for quotation, and other solicitations for purchase of commodities and equipment, the City shall indicate if local preference, as outlined in this section, is applicable in the evaluation and award of bids received.

D.	In bids where the local preference is applicable, fonns shall be included in the bid documents for local businesses to certify their qualifications as a local business, and shall authorize the City's Tax Division to release necessary infonnation to verify their qualifications.
 




E.	When purchasing commodities and equipment costing $200,000 or less, the City may provide a qualified local business with the opportunity to match the lowest and best bid received from a non-local or non-qualifying business. Ifthe lowest and best bid received is from a non-local or non-qualifying business, the qualifying local business that has submitted a bid to the City that conforms to the bid specifications and is within five percent (5%) of the lowest bid submitted by the non-local or non-qualifying business will be given the opportunity to match the lowest and best bid. Ifthat qualifying local business declines to match the lowest and best bid, then the award will be made to the bidder submitting the lowest and best bid.

F.	Ties between a qualifying local business and one or more non-local or non-qualifying businesses shall be broken in favor of the qualifying local business. Ties
between two or more qualifying local businesses shall be broken by selecting the first bid received. Iftwo or more Bids were received at the same time, then the tie will be broken through a coin toss method administered by the City Manager or the City Manager's designee until the winner remains.

G.	The provisions of this section shall not be construed to create any private rights, claims, or causes of action on behalf of any person or entity, including, but not limited to, bidders, proposers, and suppliers. Bids from local businesses must comply in all respects with the applicable specifications. Nothing in this section shall waive or nullify evaluation of delivery, quality, or any other requirements and specifications.

H.	The provisions of this section shall not apply to any City contract which is funded in whole or in part with contributions, grants, or loans from any agency of the State of Ohio, the Counties of Montgomery or Greene, or the United States Government, nor shall a local preference apply where it would be otherwise unlawful to utilize a local preference. Further, the provisions of this section shall not apply to emergency procurements, sole source procurements, procurements made through cooperative purchasing programs, or procurements where proximity of the supplier is a determinative factor.

I.	The City Manager or City Manager's designee may promulgate rules and regulations for the purpose of administering this section.

J.	No person shall provide false information regarding local business or qualified local business status. Doing so shall result in the bidder being prohibited from bidding on another City contract for two years from the date of submission of the bid containing false information.

Separation pay, termination pay, reduction-in-force pay, and other compensation earned or received as a result

(b)	The compensation is paid for personal services performed by the individual in the City on twelve or fewer days during the calendar year.  A day is a full day or any fractional part of a day.

(d)	The individual is not a professional entertainer or professional athlete; the promoter of a professional entertainment or sports event, or an employee of such a promoter, all as may be reasonably defined by the City.

Beginning with the thirteenth (13) day, whether consecutive or nonconsecutive, the individual shall pay taxes on income, qualifying wages, commissions, and other compensation earned in the City, including, but not limited to, income, qualifying wages, commissions, and other compensation earned during the first twelve (12) days, whether consecutive or nonconsecutive.

5.	On income, qualifying wages, commissions and other compensation attributable to the  sale, rental and/or management  of  real  property  located  within  the boundaries of this City.

Ordinary and necessary  business expenses incurred in the production of such income may be deducted in arriving at net income taxable to the City.

B.	Allocation of Net Profits

1.	Net profits from a business or profession conducted both within and without the boundaries of the City shall be considered as having a taxable situs in the City for the purpose of income taxation in the same proportion as the average ratio of the factors in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this subsection:

(a)	The average original cost of the real property and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in
 


the City during the taxable period to the average original cost of all the real property and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated. As used in this paragraph, real property shall include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight (8);

(b)	Gross receipts of the business or profession from sales made and services performed during the taxable period in the City to gross receipts of the business or profession during the same period from sales and services, wherever made or performed.

(c)	Qualifying wages, commissions, and other compensation paid or accrued during the taxable period to persons employed in the business or profes- sion for services performed in the City to qualifying wages, commissions, and other compensation paid or accrued during the same period to persons employed in the business or profession, wherever their services are performed, excluding compensation that is not taxable by the City under Ohio Revised Code section 718.011. As used in this paragraph, persons employed shall not be construed to mean any subcontractor or independent contractor.

(d)	A factor in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this subsection is excluded only when it does not exist anywhere, that is, when the denominator is zero (0).

(e)	In the event that the foregoing apportionment formula does not produce an equitable result, another basis (including the use of the books and records method) may, under uniform regulations, be substituted so as to produce such result.

2.	As used in Paragraph B1 (b) of this section, "sales made in the City" means:

(a)	Any sale of tangible personal property which is delivered within this City regardless of where title passes if shipped or delivered from a stock of goods within the City.

(b)	Any sale of tangible personal property which is delivered within the City regardless of where title passes even though transported from a point outside the City if the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the City and the sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
 


(c)	Any sale of tangible personal property which is shipped from a place within the City to purchasers outside this City regardless of where title passes if the taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.

(d)	Any sale of real estate which is located within the boundaries of this City.

3.	The allocation of net profits as provided in this section (191.03 B) does not apply to public utility companies when the public utility is subject to tax under Ohio Revised Code Sections 5727.24 or 5727.30. However the income of an electric company or a combined company, and the income of a telephone company, is taxable, subject to limitations of Ohio Revised Code Chapter 5745.

C.	NET OPERATING LOSS

1.	The portion of a net operating loss sustained in any taxable year commencing after December 31, 1987 and before January 1, 2001, allocable to the City, may be applied against the portion of the net profit of succeeding tax years, allocable to the City, until exhausted, but in no event for more than the five taxable years immediately following the year in which the loss occurred. No portion of a net operating loss shall be carried back against net profits of any prior year.

The portion of a net operating loss sustained in any taxable year commencing after December 31, 2000, allocable to the City, may be applied against the portion of the net profit of succeeding tax years, allocable to the City, until exhausted, but in no event for more than the three (3) taxable years immediately following the year in which the loss occurred. No portion of a net operating loss shall be carried back against net profits of any prior year.

2.	Beginning with net operating losses incurred for the tax years commencing after December 31, 1987, the portion of a net operating loss sustained shall be allocated to the City in the same manner as provided herein for allocating net profits to the City.

3.	The net operating loss of a taxpayer that loses its identity, by any means such as merger or consolidation, shall not be allowed as a carry-forward loss deduction to the surviving or new taxpayer.

4.	If an individual is engaged in two (2) or more taxable business activities to be included in the same return, the net loss of one (1) unincorporated business activity may be used to offset the profits of another (except any portion of a loss
 


or profit separately reportable for municipal tax purposes to another taxing entity) for purposes of arriving at overall net profits or net operating loss. Net operating losses from the operation of a business or profession are not deductible from employee earnings, but may be carried forward as set forth herein.

D.	CONSOLIDATED RETURNS

1.	A consolidated return may be filed by a group of corporations who are affiliated through stock ownership if that affiliated group filed for the same tax period a consolidated return for federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 1501 of the Internal Revenue Code. A consolidated return must include all companies that are so affiliated.

Individuals who are permanently retired or permanently disabled and who do not have any Kettering taxable income may complete a one-time exemption form declaring their exemption from filing a Kettering income tax return. Such an exemption will remain in force until such time as that individual once again becomes employed or earns income. At that point, this exemption will end and a Kettering income tax return shall be filed.

B.	A husband and wife may file either separate returns or a joint return for City purposes, even though one of the spouses has neither taxable income nor deductions included on the City return regardless of whether their federal and state returns were filed separately or jointly. If a joint City return is made, the tax shall be computed on the aggregate taxable income and the liability with respect to the tax shall be joint and several.
 




C.	The return shall be filed with the Tax Manager on a form or forms furnished by or obtainable upon request from the Tax Manager; or on a generic form as defined in this Tax Code.

D.	The return shall set forth:

	1.	The aggregate amounts of income, qualifying wages, commissions and other compensation earned and/or paid, and gross income from any business, profession or other activity, less allowable expenses incurred in the acquisition of such gross income earned during the preceding year and subject to said tax; and
	
2.	
The amount of the tax imposed by this Tax Code on such income, qualifying
		wages, commissions and other compensation earned and/or paid, and gross
		income from any business, profession or other activity; and
	
3.	
Such other pertinent statements, information returns, copies of federal or state tax returns and/or schedules, or other information as the Tax Manager may require, including a statement that the figures used in the return are the figures used for federal income tax adjusted to set forth only such income as is taxable under the provisions of this Tax Code. Information the Tax Manager may require shall include, but not be limited to, copies of all W-2 Forms, 1099 Miscellaneous Income Forms, page one of Form 1040, page one And two of Form 1120, 1120s (Including (K-1), 2106, 1065, Schedule C (including cost of goods manufactured and/or sold), Schedule E, Schedule F and any other applicable federal schedules.

E.	
1.	
Any taxpayer that has requested an extension for filing a federal income tax
	return may request an extension for the filing of a City of Kettering Income
	Tax Return by filing a copy of the taxpayer’s federal extension request with
	the Kettering Tax Division. Any taxpayer not required to file a federal income
	tax return may request an extension for filing a City of Kettering Income Tax
	Return in writing. The request for extension must be filed on or before the
	original due date for the annual return. If the request is granted, the due date
	for filing a return is extended for six (6) months from the original due date of
	such return. For taxable years subsequent to 2005 the extended due date for
	individuals,  and  for  businesses  not  filing the  extension  through  the  Ohio
	Business Gateway, shall be the last day of the month following the month to
	which the due date of the federal income tax return has been extended.  For
	businesses  filing  the  extension  through  the  Ohio  Business  Gateway,  the
	extended due date shall be the last day of the month to which the due date of
	the federal income tax return has been extended.
 


	2.	The Tax Manager may deny a taxpayer’s request for extension if the taxpayer:

(a)	fails to timely file the request; or

(b)	fails to file a copy of the federal extension request, (if applicable); or

(c)	owes the City any delinquent income tax, penalty, interest or other
		charge for the late payment or nonpayment of income tax; or
		
(d)	has  failed  to  file  any required  income  tax  return,  report,  or  other
		related document for a prior tax period.
	
3.	
The granting of an extension for filing a City of Kettering Income Tax Return
		does not extend the due date as provided in this section for payment of the tax;
		hence, penalty and interest may apply to any unpaid tax during the period of
		extension at the rate set out by Section 191.10.  No penalty shall be assessed
		in those cases in which the Return is filed and the final tax paid within the
		extension period provided all other filing and payment requirements of the
		Tax Code have been met.  Any extension by the Tax Manager shall be granted
		upon the condition that declaration filing and payment requirements have been
		fulfilled; however, if, upon further examination it then becomes evident that
		declaration filing and payment requirements have not been fulfilled, penalty
		and interest may be assessed in full and in the same manner as though no
		extension had been granted.

F.	
1.	
The taxpayer making a return shall, at the time of the filing thereof, pay to the Tax Manager the amount of taxes shown as due. However, credit shall be allowed for:

(a)	Any portion of the tax so due which shall have been deducted at the source pursuant to the provisions of Section 191.06; and

(b)	Any portion of said tax which shall have been paid by the taxpayer pursuant to the provisions of Section 191.07; and

(c)	Credit to the extent allowed by Section 191.14 for tax paid to another municipality.

2.	Subject to the limitations contained in 191.11 of this Tax Code, any taxpayer who has overpaid the amount of tax to which the City of Kettering is entitled under the provisions of this Tax Code may have such overpayment applied against any subsequent liability hereunder or, at the taxpayer’s election indicated on the return, such overpayment (or part thereof) shall be refunded, provided that no additional taxes or refunds of less than Five Dollars ($5.00) shall be collected or refunded.
 




G.	AMENDED RETURNS

1.	Where necessary, an amended return shall be filed in order to report additional income and pay any additional tax due, or claim a refund of tax overpaid, subject to the requirements and/or limitations contained in Section 191.11. The tax manager shall provide by regulation the format in which such amended return shall be filed. A taxpayer may not change the method of accounting (i.e., cash or accrual) or apportionment of net profits after the due date for filing the original return.

2.	Within three (3) months from the final determination of any federal tax liability affecting the taxpayer's City tax liability, such taxpayer shall make and file an amended City return showing income subject to the City tax based upon such final determination of federal tax liability and pay any additional tax shown due thereon or make claim for refund or any overpayment.

H.	Information returns, schedules and statements required to support tax returns which are incomplete without such information shall be filed within the time limits set forth for the filing of the tax returns and the failure to file such information returns, schedules and statements shall be a violation of this Tax Code. Provided, however, that the taxpayer shall have ten (10) days after notification by the Tax Manager, or the Tax Manager’s authorized representative, to file the items required by this paragraph.

I.	Any business, profession, association or corporation reporting a net loss is subject to the filing requirements of this ordinance.

J.	The officers, members, managers, employees, and trustees of such employer having control or supervision or charged with the responsibility of filing the return and making the payment shall be personally liable for failure to file the return or pay the tax, penalties, or interest due as required herein. The dissolution, bankruptcy or reorganization of any such employer does not discharge the liability of officers, members, managers, employees, and trustees for a prior failure of such employer to file the return or pay taxes, penalties, or interest due.



SECTION 191.06	COLLECTION OF TAX AT SOURCE

A.	1.         Each employer within or doing business within the City shall deduct at the time  any income, qualifying wage, commission, or other compensation is paid, allocated, or set aside, the tax of one and three-quarters percent (1 ¾%) and, effective January 1, 2007, shall deduct the tax of two and one-quarter percent  (2.25%) of the  income,  qualifying  wage,  commission,  or  other compensation due by the said employer to said employee who is subject to
 


the provisions of this Tax Code. Each employer shall, on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of each month, make a return and pay to the Tax Manager the tax withheld during the preceding calendar month. However, the Tax Manager shall have the authority to approve the filing of returns and payment of the tax withheld on a quarterly basis. In such case, the employer shall, on
or before the last day of each month following the calendar quarters ending March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31, make a return and pay to the Tax Manager the tax withheld during the preceding calendar quarter. Such approval for quarterly filings and payments may be withdrawn by the Tax Manager when it is in the best interest of the City to do so. The Tax Manager shall provide by regulation the manner in which such approval is to be granted or withdrawn.

2.	The employer shall be liable for the payment of the tax required to be deducted and withheld, whether or not such tax has in fact been withheld.

3.	Every employer subject to Subsection 191.06 (A)(1) who was required to withhold more than One Hundred Seventy Five Dollars ($175.00) in tax during the previous calendar year shall make the required payment(s) by electronic funds transfer. During the period of time prior to the first date upon which it is mandatory for every employer subject to Subsection 191.06(A)(1) to make payments by electronic funds transfer, the Finance Director and the Tax Manager may mutually establish a program in which employers subject to Subsection 191.06(A)(1) may elect to voluntarily make payment(s) by electronic funds transfer. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as relieving an employer from complying with Subsection 191.06(A)(1). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Tax Manager, subject to approval by the Board of Adjudication, may grant a temporary exemption to an employer from the requirement to make payment by electronic funds transfer, where, upon written application by an employer for such a temporary exemption, the Tax Manager finds that making payment by electronic funds transfer will impose a substantial hardship upon the employer. Pursuant to Subsection 191.08(B), the Tax Manager shall prepare regulations specifying the criteria to be used when determining if a substantial hardship exists. All temporary exemptions shall expire on June 30; if a temporary exemption was initially granted in January, February, March, April, May, or June, then the temporary exemption shall expire on June 30 of the year following the year in which the temporary exemption was initially granted. No temporary exemption shall last longer than eighteen (18) consecutive months.

B.	The employer in collecting the tax, shall be deemed to hold the same, until payment is made by such employer to the City, as a trustee for the benefit of the City and any such tax collected by such employer from the employer’s employees shall, until the same is paid to the City, be deemed a trust fund in the hands of such employer.
 




C.	No person shall be required to withhold the tax on the wages or other compensation paid domestic servants employed by the person exclusively in or about such person's residence, even though such residence is in this City, but such employee shall be subject to all of the requirements of the Tax Code.

D.	On or before February 28 of each year, each employer or other payer shall file a withholding tax reconciliation (Form KW-3) showing the total City tax withheld from all employees and the total City tax remitted to the City for the previous calendar year, along with a breakdown of the withholding tax remitted to the City by period. For each employee from whom City tax was withheld, the reconciliation shall also include the employee’s name, address, social security number, the total amount of salaries, wages, commissions, and other compensation paid, allocated, or set aside during the previous calendar year, and the total amount of City tax withheld. If the total tax withheld from any employee included tax withheld and remitted to another municipality, the amount of same and the name of the municipality to which the tax was remitted shall be separately shown for each employee on the reconciliation. Employers filing 250 or more Internal Revenue Service Form W-2’s with the Social Security Administration for any calendar year shall file that same year’s City withholding tax reconciliation electronically.

E.	Any person who is required to withhold tax from income, qualifying wages, commissions, and other compensation shall pay all such tax to the City in accordance with the provisions of this section. In the event taxes withheld from the income, qualifying wages, commissions, and other compensation of employees are not paid to the City in accordance with the provisions of this section, all officers, members, managers, employees, and trustees having control or supervision of or charged with the responsibility of withholding the tax and making payment are jointly and severally personally liable for the tax not returned or paid to the City as well as any related interest and penalties, and are also criminally liable under the provisions of Section 191.12. The dissolution, termination, or bankruptcy of a corporation, limited liability company, or business trust does not discharge an officer’s, member’s, manager’s, employee’s, or trustee’s liability for a failure of the corporation, limited liability company, or business trust to file returns or pay said taxes.

F.	In addition to the wage reporting requirements of this section, any person required by the Internal Revenue Service to report on Form 1099-Misc. payments to individuals not treated as employees for services performed shall also report such payments to the City when the services were performed in Kettering. The information may be submitted on a listing, and shall include the name, address and social security number (or federal identification number), and the amount of the payments made. Federal form(s) 1099 may be submitted in lieu of such listing. The information shall be filed annually on or before February 28.
 


G.	1.	The payment of withheld taxes by electronic funds transfer does not affect an employer’s obligation to file returns as required under this Section 191.06. The format and information required for all returns shall be prescribed by the Tax Manager.
	
2.	
The Tax Manager shall adopt regulations governing the payment of withheld taxes by electronic funds transfer. The regulations shall govern acceptable modes of electronic funds transfer, the content and format of electronic funds transfer, the coordination of payment by electronic funds transfer and the filing of associated tax reports and returns, and any other matter that facilitates payment by electronic funds transfer. Upon the written request of a taxpayer, the Tax Manager shall implement means of acknowledging receipt of payments made by electronic funds transfer and the Tax Manager may adopt regulations governing acknowledgments.
	
3.	
Bank costs or fees charged or assessed to or incurred by the City due to an employer having insufficient funds shall be collected from the employer, plus an administrative fee in the amount of ten percent (10%) of the bank costs or fees.

H.	
1.	
Any person who shall employ or contract for the services of any professional entertainer(s) or professional athlete(s), including all associated persons, to be performed in the City or any person who, acting as a promoter, booking agent or employer, engages the services of or arranges the appearance of any professional entertainer(s) or professional athlete(s), including all associated persons, in the City and who makes payment arising from said appearance in the City shall be deemed to be an employer and shall, for purposes of the collection of the income tax, be required to withhold, report, and remit as required under this Section 191.06 income tax at the applicable rate on one- half of the gross amount paid to the professional entertainer(s) or professional athlete(s), including all associated persons, for services performed in the City.
	
2.	
Any person who rents facilities located in the City that are made available to any professional entertainer(s) or professional athlete(s), including all associated persons, for use in performing services in the City and who makes any payment arising from said use of facilities shall be deemed to be an employer and shall, for purposes of the collection of the income tax, be required to withhold, report, and remit as required under this Section 191.06 income tax at the applicable rate on one-half of the gross amount paid to the professional entertainer(s) or professional athlete(s), including all associated persons, for services performed in the City.
	
3.	
It is hereby found and determined that the amount required to be withheld under this section will be substantially similar to that amount which would have been
 


paid as a tax under this Tax Code had returns been filed on net profits from the activity and on compensation for services performed in the City. However, nothing shall prohibit a professional entertainer or professional athlete, including all associated persons, from whom tax was withheld under this section from filing an annual return showing actual income and expenses and a withholding return reporting actual compensation for services performed in the City.

SECTION 191.07	DECLARATION OF ESTIMATED TAX

A.	Every person who anticipates the receipt of any income, qualifying wages, commissions, or other compensation which is not subject in whole or in part to Section 191.06, or who engages in any business, profession, enterprise or activity subject to the tax imposed by Section 191.03, shall file a declaration setting forth such person's estimated taxable income together with any estimated tax due thereon, if any. However, if a person's income is wholly from income, qualifying wages, commissions, or other compensation from which the tax will be withheld and remitted to the City in accordance with Section 191.06, such person need not file a declaration.





























due date of the 4th quarterly estimated tax payment. At such time a payment shall be made which, together with prior payments, ensures the taxpayer has met the requirement to pay at least ninety percent (90%) of the current year liability. The difference between ninety percent (90%) of the taxpayer’s liability as shown on the annual return and the amount of estimated tax actually paid on or
 



before the due date of the 4th quarterly estimated tax payment shall be subject to interest and penalties provided for in section 191.10 of this Tax Code. No interest and penalties will be assessed in either of the following circumstances:

(a)	The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the City but was not domiciled in the City on the first day of January of the current calendar year.

(b)	The taxpayer has remitted, pursuant to 191.07 B and 191.07 D of this Tax Code, an amount equal to at least one hundred percent (100%) of the taxpayer’s tax liability for the preceding year as shown on the return filed by the taxpayer for the preceding year, provided that the return for the preceding year reflected a twelve-month period.

D.	1.	For taxpayers who are individuals, the declaration of net estimated tax to be paid the City shall be accompanied by a payment of at least one-fourth (1/4) of the net estimated annual tax, and at least a similar amount shall be paid on or before the last day of the seventh, tenth and thirteenth months after the beginning of the taxable year. However, in case an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid balance shown due thereon shall be paid in equal installments on or before the remaining payment dates.
	
2.	
For taxpayers that are not individuals, the declaration of net estimated tax to be
		paid the City shall be accompanied by a payment of at least one-fourth (1/4) of
		the net estimated annual tax, and at least a similar amount shall be paid on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the sixth, ninth and twelfth months after the
		beginning of the taxable year.   However, in case an amended declaration has
		been  filed,  the  unpaid  balance  shown  due  thereon  shall  be  paid  in  equal
		installments on or before the remaining payment dates.
	
3.	
The  mere  submission  of  a  declaration  estimating  a  tax  liability  shall  not
		constitute filing unless accompanied by the required payment.
	
4.	
The last quarterly payment of estimated tax need not be made if the taxpayer
		files the taxpayer’s final return and pays the balance of the tax due thereon
		within forty-five (45) days following the end of the taxpayer’s taxable year.

E.	On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month of the calendar or fiscal year following that for which such declaration or amended declaration was filed, an annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due the City of Kettering shall be paid therewith in accordance with the provisions of Section 191.05.

SECTION 191.08	DUTIES AND POWERS OF THE TAX MANAGER

A.	1.	It shall be the duty of the Tax Manager to receive the tax imposed by this Tax Code in the manner prescribed herein from the taxpayers; to keep an accurate
 


record thereof; and to report daily to the Director of Finance all monies so received.

2.	It shall be the duty of the Tax Manager to enforce payment of all taxes owing to the City, to keep accurate records for a minimum of six (6) years showing the amount due from each taxpayer required to file a declaration and/or make any return, including taxes withheld, and to show the dates and amounts of payments thereof.

B.	The Tax Manager is hereby charged with the enforcement of the provisions of this Tax Code, and is hereby empowered (subject to the approval of a majority of the Board of Adjudication, as provided in Section 191.13) to issue and enforce rules and regulations relating to any matter or thing pertaining to the administration and enforcement of the provisions of the Tax Code, including provisions for the re-examination and correction of returns and payments. Taxpayers shall comply with the requirements of this tax code and any rules and regulations.

C.	Subject to the consent of a majority of the Board of Adjudication, the Tax Manager shall have the power to compromise any liability imposed by this Tax Code.

D.	In any case where a taxpayer has failed to file a return or has filed a return which does not show the proper amount of tax due, the Tax Manager may determine the amount of tax appearing to be due the City from the taxpayer and may send to such taxpayer a written statement showing the amount of tax so determined, together with interest and penalties thereon, if any.

E.	When an application for deferred payment of tax due is filed by a taxpayer, the Tax Manager may authorize partial payments of unpaid taxes when, in the Tax Manager’s judgment, the taxpayer is unable, due to hardship conditions, to pay the full amount of the tax when due, and when, in the Tax Manager’s judgment, such deferred payments are the best means of accomplishing the intent of this Tax Code. Provided, however, that the Tax Manager shall not authorize an extension of time for the payment of said taxes due for more than thirty-six (36) months beyond the date of the filing of the application. Failure to make any deferred payment when due shall cause the total unpaid amount, including penalty and interest, to become immediately due and payable and the provisions of sections 191.11 and 191.12 shall apply.

SECTION 191.09	INVESTIGATIVE POWERS OF THE TAX MANAGER – PENALTY FOR DIVULGING CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION

A.	The Tax Manager, or any authorized employee, is hereby authorized to examine the books, papers, records and copies of federal, state, and local income tax returns of any employer or of any taxpayer or person subject to, or whom the Tax Manager believes is
 


subject to the provisions of this Tax Code, for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made, or, if no return was made, to ascertain the tax due under this Tax Code. Every such employer, supposed employer, taxpayer or supposed taxpayer, is hereby directed and required to furnish within ten (10) days following a written request by the Tax Manager, or the Tax Manager’s duly authorized agent or employee, the means, facilities and opportunity for making such examinations and investigations as are hereby authorized.

B.	The Tax Manager is hereby authorized to order any person presumed to have knowledge of the facts to appear before the Tax Manager and may examine such person, under oath, concerning any income which was or should have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect such income, and for this purpose may compel the production of books, papers, records and copies of federal, state, and local income tax returns and the attendance of all persons before the Tax Manager, whether as parties or witnesses, whenever the Tax Manager believes such persons have knowledge of such income or information pertinent to such inquiry.

C.	The refusal to produce books, papers, records and copies of federal, state, and local income tax returns, or the refusal to submit to such examination by any employer or person subject or presumed to be subject to the tax or by any officer, agent or employee of a person subject to the tax or required to withhold tax or the failure of any person to comply with the provisions of this section or with an order or subpoena of the Tax Manager authorized by the Tax Code shall be deemed a violation, punishable as provided in Section 191.12.

D.	1.  Any information gained as the result of any returns, investigations, hearings or verifications, required or authorized by the Tax Code shall be confidential, and no  disclosure shall be made except to municipal, state  or  federal  taxing agencies, except when ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction or except in connection with the performance of that person's official duties or the official business of the City as authorized by Ohio Revised Code Chapter 718 or the City Charter or City  ordinance. The Tax Manager may furnish copies of returns filed under this tax code to the internal revenue service, to the state tax commissioner, and to other municipal tax managers and tax administrators.

2.	Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Tax Manager may release to the Finance Department, in order that the comprehensive annual financial report may be prepared, statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect to particular taxpayers. For purposes of this section, statistics shall mean (i) the ranking, in order of the total amount withheld (without revealing the actual amount withheld) and remitted to the city, of the top ten (10) income tax withholders by year; and (ii) aggregate income tax paid or withheld by tax payer type.
 


E.	Any person divulging such information in violation of this Tax Code, shall, upon conviction thereof, be deemed guilty of a first degree misdemeanor, which is punishable by a maximum fine of one thousand dollars ($1,000) and/or a maximum jail term of one hundred eighty (180) days. Each disclosure shall constitute a separate offense. In addition to the above penalty, any employee of the City who violates the provisions of this section relative to the disclosure of confidential information shall be guilty of an offense punishable by immediate dismissal.

F.	Every taxpayer shall retain all records necessary to compute the taxpayer’s tax liability for a period of SIX (6) years from the date the taxpayer’s return is filed, or the withholding taxes are paid.

SECTION 191.10	INTEREST AND PENALTIES

A.	1.         All  taxes  imposed,  including  estimated  taxes,  and  all  monies  withheld  or required to be withheld by employers under the provisions of this Tax Code and remaining unpaid five (5) days after they become due shall bear interest at the same rate which Section 718.12 of the Revised Code of Ohio requires be paid by municipalities on their income tax refunds, i.e., the federal short-term rate as defined in Section 5703.47 of that Revised Code, plus three percent (3%) per year. That interest rate shall be effective through December 31, 2015.

2.	Effective January 1, 2016, all taxes imposed, including estimated taxes, and all monies withheld or required to be withheld by employers under the provisions of this Tax Code and remaining unpaid after they become due shall bear interest at the federal short-term rate as defined in Ohio Revised Code Section 718.27, plus five percent (5%) per year.

B.	In addition to interest as provided in Paragraph A hereof, penalties are hereby imposed as follows based on the tax remaining unpaid five (5) days after it becomes due:

1.	For failure to pay taxes due, other than taxes withheld, one and one-half percent (1½%) per month or fraction of a month thereof, or ten percent (10%), whichever is greater.

2.	For failure to remit taxes withheld from employees; three percent (3%) per month or fraction of a month thereof, or ten percent (10%), whichever is greater.

3.	Where the taxpayer has failed to file a declaration on which the taxpayer has estimated and paid a tax equal to or greater than the tax paid for the previous year, or has failed to file a declaration on which the taxpayer has estimated and paid tax equal to or greater than ninety percent (90%) of the actual tax for the year, or if the taxpayer's total quarterly estimate payments do not equal the taxpayer's tax liability for the preceding year, or if the taxpayer has failed to file
 


a final return and pay the total tax on or before the end of the month following the end of the taxpayer’s taxable year, the penalty shall be ten percent (10%) of the difference between ninety percent (90%) of the actual tax for the year and the amount paid through withholding or declaration. An exception will be made if the taxpayer is an individual who resides in the City but was not domiciled in the City on the first day of January of the taxable year.

4.	Except in the case of fraud, the penalty shall not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the unpaid tax.

5.	For failure to file a complete tax return by the date due, including due dates extended as set forth in Section 191.05(E), there shall be due a penalty of twenty-five ($25.00) in addition to all other penalties and interest, even if no tax is due.

C.	EXCEPTIONS. A penalty shall not be assessed on an additional tax assessment made by the Tax Manager when a return has been filed in good faith and the tax paid thereon within the time prescribed by the Tax Manager. Further, in the absence of fraud, neither penalty nor interest shall be assessed on any additional tax assessment resulting from a federal audit, providing an amended return is filed and the additional tax is paid within three (3) months after final determination of the federal tax liability.

D.	Upon recommendation of the Tax Manager, the Board of Adjudication may abate penalty or interest, or both.

E.	In no case shall penalty and interest charges be levied when the total of such penalty and interest amounts to less than FIVE Dollars ($5.00).

F.	Any person required to withhold the tax who knowingly fails to withhold such tax, or pay over such tax or knowingly attempts in any manner to evade or defeat such tax or the payment thereof, shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be liable to a penalty equal to the total amount of the tax evaded, or not withheld, or not paid over. No other penalty under this Section shall be applied to any offense to which this penalty is applied.

G.	A penalty in the amount of ten percent (10%) or fifty dollars ($50), whichever is greater, of the sum required to be remitted by electronic funds transfer shall be assessed against any person or employer who fails to comply with Subsection 191.06(A)(3) or the regulations adopted pursuant to Subsection 191.06(G)(2). This penalty shall also be assessed for failure to adhere to the approved addenda format (or file layout) for electronic transfers.

H.	Any person or employer failing to file any annual withholding tax reconciliation, including employee W-2 information, not submitted on or before February 28 of each
 


year shall be subject to a penalty of fifty dollars ($50.00). Any person or employer failing to file electronically, pursuant to Subsection 191.06(D), any annual withholding tax reconciliation, including, but not limited to, employee W-2 information, shall be subject to a penalty of fifty dollars ($50.00).

SECTION 191.11	COLLECTION OF UNPAID TAXES AND REFUND OF OVERPAYMENTS

A.	All taxes, penalties, and interest imposed by this Tax Code may be collected by civil suit or other proceeding as other debts of like amount are recoverable, together with any court costs, collection expenses, and reasonable attorney’s fees incurred in collection. Such collection shall not preclude any criminal prosecution. Except in the case of fraud, omission of twenty-five percent (25%) of income subject to this tax, or failure to file a return, an additional assessment shall not be made after three (3) years from the time the tax was due or the return was filed, whichever is later. However, in the case of fraud, omission of 25% or more of income subject to this tax, or failure to file a return, all additional assessments shall be made and all prosecutions to recover municipal income taxes and penalties and interest thereon shall be brought within six
(6) years after the tax was due or the return was filed, whichever is later. In those cases in which the U.S. Commissioner of Internal Revenue and the taxpayer have executed a waiver of the federal statute of limitation, the period within which an additional assessment may be made by the Tax Manager shall be one (1) year from the time of final determination of the federal tax liability.

B.	Taxes erroneously paid shall not be refunded unless a claim for refund is made within three (3) years after such payment was made, or the return was filed, or within three (3) months after final determination of the federal tax liability, whichever is later. However, refunds of tax withheld from nonqualified deferred compensation plans (ndcp) will only be made in accordance with Ohio Revised Code Section 718.021. For nonresident individuals with Kettering tax withheld, the date the return was filed shall be the date that the Employer’s Annual Withholding Reconciliation was filed in accordance with Section 191.06(D) of this Chapter.

C.	Income tax paid to the City of Kettering which should have been paid to another municipality, may be refunded subject to the three-year limitation on refunds. Income tax that should have been paid to the City of Kettering, but was paid to another municipality, shall be subject to recovery by the City of Kettering. The City of Kettering will allow a non-refundable credit for any amount owed the City of Kettering that is in excess of the amount to be refunded by the other municipality, as long as the tax rate of the other municipality is the same or higher than the City of Kettering tax rate. If the City of Kettering tax rate is higher, the tax representing the net difference of the rates shall be paid to the City of Kettering and is also subject to collection by the City of Kettering.
 


D.	Additional amounts of less than five Dollars ($5.00) shall not be refunded or assessed unless such assessment results from income which the taxpayer has failed to report.

E.	Any valid claim for a refund of overpaid taxes shall, except as hereinafter provided, earn interest at the rate fixed by Ohio Revised Code Section 5703.47. Such interest shall be computed from the date of the overpayment until the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or ninety days after the complete return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall be allowed on the refunded overpayment. For purposes of computing the payment of interest on overpayments, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be treated as having been paid before the date on which the tax return for that year was due without regard to any extension of time for filing that return.

F.	Every taxpayer shall retain all records necessary to compute the taxpayer’s tax liability for a period of six (6) years from the date the taxpayer’s return is filed or the withholding taxes are paid.

G.	The determination of tax liability of non-residents working in and out of the corporate limits is to be computed by the formula of the total number of days worked in the city divided by the total number of days worked (excluding vacation, holiday and sick days) during the year and the resulting percentage applied to the total annual income from wages. The tax manager may require employer certification of the basis for refund of taxes.

H.	Payments on delinquent amounts shall be applied in the following manner:

1.	To  unpaid  penalty  and  interest  assessments  in  the  order  in  which  such assessments became due.
2.	To the taxes owed for any previous year in the order in which such taxes became due.

3.	To the taxpayer’s current estimated tax liability.

E.	The failure of any employer or taxpayer or person to receive or procure a return, declaration or other required form shall not excuse any employer or taxpayer or person from making any information return, return or declaration, from filing such forms, or from paying the tax.

F.	The Law Director or the Law Director’s designee shall have the power to compromise any criminal or civil matter arising under this Tax Code.

192.81	CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO ANOTHER MUNICIPAL CORPORATION

(A)	Where a Resident is subject to a municipal income tax in another Municipal Corporation, the Resident shall not pay a total municipal income tax on the same income greater than the tax imposed at the highest rate to which the Resident is subject.

(B)	(1)	For every Resident who receives income for work done or services performed or rendered outside of Kettering, if credible evidence demonstrates that a municipal income tax is due and has been paid to and not refunded by another Municipal Corporation on the same income taxable under this Chapter, a non-refundable credit shall be allowed against the tax imposed by this Chapter of the amount paid by the Resident or on the Resident’s behalf to such other Municipal Corporation. Such credit shall not exceed the tax assessed by this Chapter on such income earned in such other Municipal Corporation where such tax is paid.

(2)	Credit on income from any source other than Qualifying Wages shall be calculated as follows:  the sum of all Profits earned in and taxed by a given Municipal Corporation (as a percentage of the sum of all Profits, attributable to taxing and non-taxing jurisdictions) shall be used to determine each Municipal Corporation’s contribution to total income (from any sources other than Qualifying Wages), prior to calculation of the Resident’s credit(s) for taxes paid to other Municipal Corporations on the income (from other than Qualifying Wages). The rate to be used for calculation of this credit shall be the lesser of the appropriate rate at which such income was taxed by such other Municipal Corporation or 2.25%. The calculation expressed as a formula is:

 
1.	 		Sum of all Profits (from other than Qualifying Wages) earned in a Municipal Corporation	Sum of all Profits (from other than Qualifying Wages) earned in all taxing and non-taxing		=
jurisdictions
 
Municipal Contribution
%

(2)	(a) Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) of this section, “qualifying loss” means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation, the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan over the total amount of Income the Taxpayer has recognized for federal income tax purposes for all Taxable Years on a cumulative basis as compensation with respect to the Taxpayer’s receipt of money and property attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.

(b)	If, for one or more Taxable Years, the Taxpayer has not paid to one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of compensation, the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, then the “qualifying loss” is the product of the amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a fraction, the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which the Taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations, and the denominator of which is the total amount of compensation, the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.

(c)	With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the Taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the Taxable Year in which the Taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that nonqualified deferred compensation plan;

(3)	“Qualifying tax rate” means the applicable tax rate for the Taxable Year for which the Taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation, the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different tax rates applied for  different Taxable Years, then the “qualifying tax  rate” is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
 


(B)	(1)     Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a refundable credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a municipal corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a Taxpayer during the Taxable Year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the qualifying loss and the qualifying tax rate.

(2)	A Taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from each municipal corporation to which the Taxpayer paid municipal income tax with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more Taxable Years.

(3)	If a Taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the credit that a Taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation’s proportionate share of the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the Taxpayer to all municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.

(4)	In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this section exceed the cumulative income tax that a Taxpayer has paid to a municipal corporation for all Taxable Years with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.

(C)	(1)	For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan shall be considered to have been paid by the Taxpayer with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.

(2)    Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise credited for the benefit of the Taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the municipal corporation by the Taxpayer.

(D)	The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent the Taxpayer’s qualifying loss is attributable to:

(1)	The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or

(2)	The employee’s failure or inability to satisfy all of the employer’s terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred compensation.

192.83	CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR ZONE

192.84	CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND

(A)	Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds as provided in Section
192.096 of this Chapter.

(B)	Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as provided in section 192.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax or withholding paid to the other municipal corporation against the income tax the Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality’s tax rate is higher, the tax representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the period of nonpayment.

(C)	No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section 192.096 of this Chapter.

(D)	Nothing in this section requires the Municipality to allow credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation if  the Municipality has  reduced credit for  tax paid to another municipal corporation. Section 192.081 of this Chapter regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail.

(2)	If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, the Tax Administrator may require Taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including Taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual returns.

(3)	With respect to Taxpayers  to whom Section 192.092 of  this  Chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this division conflicts with any provision in Section 192.092 of this Chapter, the provision in Section 192.092 of  this Chapter prevails.

(H)	(1)       For Taxable Years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, the Municipality shall not require a Taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount due is ten dollars or less.

(I)	(1)   If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to be filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or before a prescribed date under this Chapter is delivered after that period or that date to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment. "The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the Postal Service.

(2) If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds transfer, the payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the timestamp assigned by the first electronic system  receiving that payment. For  purposes of this section, “date of the timestamp” means the date that the Taxpayer has designated for the delivery of payment, which may or may not be the same date as the date the payment was initiated by the Taxpayer.

Authorization by the Taxpayer of another Person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from contacting the Taxpayer regarding such matters.

(L)	The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a generic form of
 


any income tax return, report, or document required by the Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax Administrator, and provided that the Taxpayer or Tax Return Preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter and of the Municipality’s Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns, reports, or documents.

(2)	A Person may notify the Tax Administrator that the Person does not expect to be a Taxpayer with respect to the Municipality for a Taxable Year if both of the following conditions apply:

(a)	The Person was required to file a tax return with the Municipality for the immediately preceding Taxable Year because the Person performed services at a worksite location within the Municipality, and the Person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this Chapter; and

(b)	The Person no longer provides services in the Municipality, and does not expect to be subject to the Municipality’s income tax for the Taxable Year.

The Person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly explains the Person’s circumstances, including the location of the previous worksite location and the last date on which the Person performed services or made any sales within the Municipality. The affidavit also shall include the following statement: “The affiant has no plans to perform any services within the City of Kettering, Ohio, make any sales in the City of Kettering, Ohio, or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the City of Kettering, Ohio during the Taxable Year. If the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by the City of Kettering, Ohio for the Taxable Year, the affiant agrees to be considered a Taxpayer and to properly register as a Taxpayer with the City of Kettering, Ohio, if such a registration is required by the City of Kettering, Ohio’s resolutions, ordinances, or rules.” The Person shall sign the affidavit under penalty of perjury.

(3)	If a Person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2) of this section, the Tax Administrator shall not require the Person to file any tax return for the Taxable Year unless the Tax Administrator possesses information that conflicts
 


with the affidavit or if the circumstances described in the affidavit change, or the Taxpayer has engaged in activity which results in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the Taxable Year. It shall be the responsibility of the Taxpayer to comply with the provisions of this Chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit has been filed with the Tax Administrator for the Taxable Year. Nothing in division (N) of this section prohibits the Tax Administrator from performing an Audit of the Person.

(2)   The Tax Administrator shall have sole discretion to determine whether or not penalty, interest, charges or applicable fees will be assessed through the duration of any compromise or payment-over-time agreement.

(F)	The Tax Administrator may require that the Taxpayer provide detailed financial documentation and information, in order to determine whether or not a payment-over- time agreement will be authorized. The Taxpayer’s failure to provide the necessary and required information by the Tax Administrator shall preclude consideration of a payment- over-time agreement.

192.133	AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE

(A)	The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of any employer, Taxpayer, or other Person that is subject to, or that the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter.  Upon written request by the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or
 


employee thereof, every employer, Taxpayer, or other Person subject to this section is required to furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the request.

(B)	The records and other documents of any Taxpayer, employer, or other Person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six years following the end of the Taxable Year to which the records or documents relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax Administrator may require any Person, by notice served on that Person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines necessary to show whether or not that Person is liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax  levied by the Municipality or for the withholding of such tax.

(C)	The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such Person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns in such Person's possession or control. The Person may be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a Person who is not an attorney.

(D)	No Person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers, records, or federal and state income tax returns under this section shall fail to comply.

192.134	AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; REQUIRING IDENTIFYING INFORMATION

(A)	The Tax Administrator may require any Person filing a tax document with the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which may include the Person's social security number, federal employer identification number, or other identification number requested by the Tax Administrator. A Person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax document requiring the identifying information.

(B)	(1)       If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying information within thirty days of   making  the  request,  nothing  in  this  Chapter  prohibits  the  Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the Person to whom the request was
 


directed pursuant to section 192.10 of this Chapter, in addition to any applicable penalty described in section 192.99 of this Chapter.

(2)	If a Person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with respect to that information as required under division (A) of this section within thirty days after filing the next tax document requiring such identifying information, nothing in this Chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to section 192.10 of this Chapter.

(3)	The penalties provided for under divisions (B)(1) and (2) of this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to any applicable criminal penalties described in section 192.99 of this Chapter for a violation of
192.15 of this Chapter and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by law.

192.14	CONFIDENTIALITY

(A)	Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations, hearings, or verifications required or authorized by ORC 718 or by the charter or ordinance of the Municipality is confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance of that person's official duties or the official business of the Municipality as authorized by ORC 718 or the charter or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax Administrator of the Municipality or a designee thereof  may furnish copies  of returns filed or  otherwise received under this Chapter and other related tax information to the Internal Revenue Service, the State Tax Commissioner, and Tax Administrators of other municipal corporations.

(B)	This section does not prohibit the Municipality from publishing or disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect to particular Taxpayers.


192.15	FRAUD

No Person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or document authorized or required by ordinance or state law to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure, counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend, or knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or document is based with intent to defraud the Municipality or the Tax Administrator.
 


192.16	OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR

(A)	An "opinion of the Tax Administrator" means an opinion issued under this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.

(B)	A Taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax Administrator shall be an "opinion of the Tax Administrator" and shall bind the Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (C), (G), and (H) of this section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:

(1)	The Taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts;

(2)	The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this Chapter; and

(3)	The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax Administrator and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."

(C)	An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall protect the Taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be subject to taxation for any Taxable Years that may be specified in the opinion, or until the earliest of the following dates:

(1)	The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax Administrator sent to the Taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested. The effective date of the revocation shall be the Taxpayer's date of receipt or one year after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;

(2)	The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the Municipality’s income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;

(3)	The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the Municipality’s income tax ordinance;
 




(4)	If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or regulations;

(5)	The effective date of  any change in the Taxpayer's material facts or circumstances; or

(6)	The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified in the opinion.

(D)	(1) A Taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.

(2) If the Taxpayer knowingly has  misrepresented  the  pertinent  facts  or omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to obtain a more favorable opinion, the Taxpayer may be in violation of section 192.15 of this Chapter.

(E)	If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section, the opinion shall include a statement that:

(1)	The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to change for any of the reasons stated in division (C) of this section;

(2)	It is the duty of the Taxpayer to be aware of such changes.

(F)	A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request received under this section.

(G)	This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.

(H)	An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only with respect to the Taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.

(I)	A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a Taxpayer who has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has removed all information that identifies  the Taxpayer and any other parties involved in the activity or transaction.
 


(J)	An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a refusal to offer an opinion under subsection (F) may not be appealed.

192.17	ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY

(A)	(1) The Tax Administrator shall serve an Assessment either  by personal service,  by  certified  mail,  or  by  a  delivery  service  authorized  under  section
5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code.

(2)	The Tax Administrator may deliver the Assessment through alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be authorized by the Person subject to the Assessment.

(3)	Once service of the Assessment has been made by the Tax Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the Person to whom the Assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that Assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an Assessment of the Tax Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Ohio Revised Code is prima facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the Assessment is served.

(B)	(1) A Person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service as set forth in this division. A Person disputing the presumption of delivery and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the address to which the Assessment was sent was not an address with which the Person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator originally mailed the Assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this section, a Person is associated with an address at the time the Tax Administrator originally mailed the Assessment if, at that time, the Person was residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or if, before that time, the Person had conducted business at the address and, when the Assessment was mailed, the Person's agent or the Person's affiliate was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a Person's affiliate is any other Person that, at the time the Assessment was mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as determined by voting rights, of the addressee's business.

(2) If a Person elects to appeal an Assessment on the basis described in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that Assessment is subject to collection and is not otherwise appealable, the Person must do so within sixty days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, with the Person. Nothing in this division prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a compromise with the Person if the Person does not actually file such an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review.

192.18	LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF
 


TAX REVIEW

(A)	(1)	The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio Revised Code Chapter 718.

(2)	The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members. The three members of the Local Board of Tax Review may be domiciled in the Municipality, but the appointing authority may consider membership from individuals who are not domiciled within the Municipality. Two members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the Municipality, and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with the Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years immediately preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the top administrative official of the Municipality. This member may be an employee of the Municipality, but may not be the director of finance or equivalent officer, or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.

(3)	The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of the administrative official.

(4)	Members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by the legislative authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Section 718.11(A)(4) of the Ohio Revised Code.

(5)	A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign immediately by operation of law.

(6)	A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created. Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.

(7)	If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member’s place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily unable to serve.

(8)	No  member  of  the  Local  Board  of  Tax   Review   shall   receive
 


compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the board.

(B)	Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an Assessment, the Tax Administrator shall notify the Taxpayer in writing at the same time of the Taxpayer's right to appeal the Assessment, the manner in which the Taxpayer may appeal the Assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed, and to whom the appeal should be directed.

(C)	Any Person who has been issued an Assessment may appeal the Assessment to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the Assessment should be deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the Taxpayer receives the Assessment.

(D)	The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an Assessment under division (C) of this section, unless the Taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or waives a hearing. If the Taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the Taxpayer may appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law, certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case, the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.

(E)	The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's Assessment or any part of that Assessment. The board shall issue a final determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board’s final hearing on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final determination. The Taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.

(F)	The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs, and shall keep a record of its transactions. Such records are not public records available for inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code. Hearings requested by a Taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section are not meetings of a public body subject to section 121.22 of the Ohio Revised Code. For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing.

(G)	SUBPOENAS

(1)	Upon written request of any party or by action of the Local Board of Tax Review through a member, the secretary, or its attorney, subpoenas may be issued to compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of books, accounts, papers, records, documents, and testimony. If any party desires the issuance of subpoenas in order to compel the attendance of witnesses or the
 


production of documents at a scheduled hearing, the request shall be filed with the Local Board of Tax Review at least thirty days prior to such scheduled date.

(2)	Upon request, the Local Board of Tax Review shall make available blank subpoena forms to the requesting party so that the party may complete the form. The requesting party shall send one completed form to the board, along with a self-addressed stamped envelope. If the Local Board of Tax Review issues the subpoena, the subpoena shall be delivered to the requesting party, who shall effect its service.

(3)	Subpoenas shall be served by the party or other individual over the age of eighteen years, personally or by certified mail, return receipt requested.

(4)	The party or other person serving the subpoena shall file a copy of the subpoena, properly endorsed as to service with the board, at or prior to the time of the hearing for which the subpoena was issued.

(5)	Witnesses shall receive their subpoenas at least twenty-one days prior to the hearing at which they are to appear.

(6)	All subpoenas issued by the Local Board of Tax Appeals are deemed continuing, should the hearing or deposition for which they have been issued proceed for multiple days or be continued to a later date. The party issuing a subpoena shall notify any subpoenaed witness(es) of any continuance of the board proceedings at which they were scheduled to appear.


192.19	ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS

(A)	(1)     (a)      Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and penalties and interest  on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the later of:

(i)	Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed, whichever is later; or

(ii)	One year after the conclusion of  the qualifying deferral period, if any.

(b) The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer, agent of the employer, Other Payer, or Taxpayer consent in writing to the extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time limit described in division (C) of this section.

(2)	As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a period of time
 


beginning and ending as follows:

(a)	Beginning on the date a Person who is aggrieved by an Assessment files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in Section 192.18 of this Chapter. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the Local Board of Tax Review with which the  aggrieved Person filed the request did not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the Assessment or any part of that Assessment; and

(b)	Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part, or that reversal is available or taken.

(B)	Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to file a return, or the omission of twenty-five per cent or more of income required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after the commission of the offense.

(C)	A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought within the time limitation provided in Section 192.096 of this Chapter.

(D)	(1)     Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the petitioner may pay all or a portion of the Assessment that is the subject of the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.

(2) If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the Assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created under Section 192.18 of this Chapter, of the Ohio Board of  Tax Appeals, or any court to  which the decision of the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals has been appealed, so that the amount due from the party assessed under the corrected Assessment is less than the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as provided by Section 192.096 of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division 192.096(D).

(E)	No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
 




(1)	The period during which a Taxpayer has a right to appeal the imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;

(2)	The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.


192.20	ADOPTION OF RULES

(A)	Pursuant to Section 718.30 of the Ohio Revised Code and this Chapter, the Municipality grants authority to the Tax Administrator to adopt rules to administer the income tax imposed by this Chapter.

(B)	All rules adopted under this section shall be published and posted on  the internet.

In such case where the Tax Administrator requires a Person to complete a registration form, the form shall be due by the date indicated on the correspondence received from the Tax Administrator.

192.97	COLLECTION AFTER TERMINATION OF CHAPTER

taking of breath or urine specimens. A physician, a registered nurse or a qualified technician or chemist may refuse to withdraw blood for the purpose of determining the alcohol content of the blood if, in his or her opinion, the physical welfare of the person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood,

ten-hundredths of one gram by weight of alcohol per 210 liters of his or her breath, or less than fourteen-hundredths of one gram by weight of alcohol per 100 milliliters of his or her urine, such fact may be considered  with  other  competent  evidence  in  determining  the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
Upon the request of the person who has tested, the results of such test shall be made
available  to him  or  her,  his  or  her  attorney or  his  or  her  agent,  immediately  upon  the

registered nurse or other qualified person of his own choosing administer  a chemical  test
or tests in addition to any administered at the direction of a police officer, and shall be so advised. The failure or inability to obtain an additional test by a person shall not preclude
the admission of evidence, relating to the test or tests taken at the direction of a police officer.

For those Providers with a valid gas or electric franchise, the provisions of a Certificate of Registration shall be deemed as regulatory in nature and shall not be interpreted to limit the right to occupy the Rights of Way which may have been granted by such franchise.  The rights to occupy the Right of Way itself may not be subdivided or subleased; provided, however, that two or more Providers may collocate Facilities in the same area of the Rights of Way so long as each such Provider complies
with the provisions of this Chapter.  Collocating Providers may file a joint application for
a Construction Permit.  A Certificate of Registration does not excuse a Provider from obtaining appropriate access or pole attachment agreements before collocating its Facilities on Facilities of others, including the City's Facilities.  A Certificate of Registration does not prevent a Provider from leasing space in or on the Provider's System, so long as the sharing of Facilities does not cause a violation of Law, including the provisions of this Chapter.  A Certificate of Registration does not excuse a Provider from complying with any provisions of this Chapter and other applicable Law.

RIGTS OF WAY ADMINISTRATION	f

2.	The City shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of new or additional Facilities within the Rights of Way ifthe Right of Way is Full. Inmaking such decisions, the City shall strive to the extent possible to accommodate all existing and potential users of the Rights of Way, but shall be guided primarily by considerations of the public health, safety, and welfare, the condition of the Rights of Way, the time of year with respect to essential Utilities, the protection of existing Facilities in the Rights of Way, future City and County plans for public improvements, development projects which have been
determined to be in the public interest, and the non-discriminatory and competitively neutral treatment of providers.

The 'right-of-way' means not only the paved portion of a street which is designed and ordinarily used for vehicular travel by the public but also all unpaved portions of the right-of-way.

Except as otherwise provided by ordinance, the City Manager shall have control of the issuance, supervision and inspection of revocable right-of-way privileges. The decision of the City Manager to issue or deny such a privilege must  be reasonable and must be based upon assisting the best interests of the city, together with protection of the public peace, safety and welfare.

The City Manager is authorized to prepare and enforce reasonable rules and regulations to carry
·	out the provisions of this section.

909.2	APPLICANTS LIMITED TO ABUTTING OWNERS

Only those persons who are owners of a lot or parcel of real estate abutting a portion of street right-of-way may make application for a revocable right-of-way privilege for that part of the right-of-way.  A successful applicant is referred to in this chapter as a Permittee.

909.3	NO FENCES, SIGNS OR OTHER UNAUTHORIZED  USE

No person,  firm or corporation  shall establish or maintain a fence, sign or any other unauthorized private use on or of any part of the right-of-way for a public street, alley or way except through a revocable privilege issued in accordance with this chapter.
 


909.4	REVOCATION  OR MODIFICATION

When the best interests of the city or protection of the public  health, safety or welfare shall require or make appropriate the revocation or modification of a revocable right-of-way privilege, the City Manager shall take such action necessary for the public interest.

Every revocable street privilege may be subject to revocation or modification upon 30 days written notice served upon the Permittee personally or mailed to the owner of record.

Whenever a revocable street privilege is terminated, the Permittee shall remove all private construction from the street area, make all required street and  sidewalk  restoration  in accordance with City specifications.  In the event there is failure to remove and restore within

FLOODWAY
A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that· have been reserved in order to pass the base flood discharge. A floodway is typically determined throngh a hydraulic and hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated height.  In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any point within the community.

The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.

FREEBOARD
A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for the purposes of floodplain management.

LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT  (LOMA)
A revision based on technical data showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood hazard area.  A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard area.

LETTER OF MAP REVISION  (LOMR)
A revision based on technical data that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features.  One common type ofLOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.

CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION  (CLOMR)
A formal review and comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria.  A CLOMR does not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.

LOWEST FLOOR
The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) of a structure.  This definition excludes an "enclosure below the lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures below the lowest floor.
 



MANUFACTURED HOME
A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle".  For the purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.

MANUFACTURED HOME PARK
A manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure, vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the park.  A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are dedicated to the local government authority.

NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM (NF!P)
The NFIP is a Federal program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance protection against losses from flooding.  This insurance is designed to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection against flood loss.

	VARIANCE STANDARDS

	In considering variance applications, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall consider the evidence presented, the purposes and standards of this Chapter, and the following factors:

A.	The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others.

B.	The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage.

C.	The susceptibility of the proposed development and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.

D.	The importance to the community of the services provided by the proposed facility.

E.	The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.

F.	The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable.

G.	The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development.

H.	The relationship  of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management  program  for that area.

I.	The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles.

J.	The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site.
 



K.		The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges.

	Variances shall only be issued when all of the following criteria are met:

A.	A showing of good and sufficient cause in light of the factors listed in Subsection   1104.501.4.1.

B.	A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the prope1ty. Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements  of this Chapter does not constitute an exceptional hardship.   The exceptional hardship callllot be self-created or caused.

C.	A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations; additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances, fraud on or victimization  of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.

D.	A determination that the strncture or other development is protected by methods to minimize flood damages.

E.	A dete1mination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.

Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of this Chapter, the Board
of Zoning Appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this Chapter.

II 04.501.4.3	Other Conditions for Variances

A.	Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.

B.	Generally, variances may be issued for new constrnction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and smTOunded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing items in Subsection
1104.501.6 have been fully considered and determined to all fully
support granting the requested  variance.   As the lot size increases
 



beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.

C.	Any applicant to whom a variance is granted should be given written notice that the structure will be pem1itted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.

	Procedure at Hearings

	All testimony shall be given under oath.

	A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.

SECTION 1111.19	INSTALLATION OF UTILITIES.

(a)	Definitions.  For the purpose of this section, unless it is plainly evident from the context that a different meeting is intended:

(1)	"High-voltage line" means any electrical conductor used to transmit electrical energy having a nominally rated voltage greater than 480 volts and all appurtenances and services.

(2)	"Minimum distance" means a horizontal component distance of eight feet from the occupiable structure plus a vertical component distance of eight feet above the highest point of an occupiable structure. However, for each foot increase in a particular component distance beyond eight feet, the remaining component distance may be decreased a like amount until a like amount of the other component distance reaches zero; a horizontal component distance of eight feet plus a vertical component distance of eight feet.

(3)	"Utility company" means any organization, person, firm, corporation or cooperative furnishing electric services to the City and its inhabitants.

(4)	"Utility distribution facilities" means all high-voltage  line equipment and appurtenances above or below ground in streets, alleys, utility easements, rights of way and properties and ways of the City, used in supplying electrical  energy.

(5)	"Occupiable structure" means any inhabitable residential structure or addition thereto.

(6)	"Utility easements" means those parcels, strips, areas or other portions of land available for installations, maintenance, repair or operation of utility distribution facilities.

(7)	"Extra charge or rate" means any charge for underground facilities greater than regularly charged by a utility company for the installation of aboveground utilities for similar service.
 



(b)	Location of Utility Distribution Facilities.  Any other provision of the Codified Ordinances or the Unified Building Code relating to subdivision or construction to the contrary notwithstanding,  within the area of any new residential plat and new residential subdivision all newly installed utility distribution facilities, shall be placed and maintained underground within utility easements or public ways.  However, this section shall not apply to the following situations:

(1)	Equipment appurtenant to utility distribution facilities, such as surface mounted transformers, pedestal mounted terminal boxes and meter cabinets, switching enclosures and substations.

(2)	Poles and lines supporting only street and traffic lights, electric trolley wires or "Police-Fire call boxes", traffic or cantilever poles and traffic signal interconnects.
(3)	In cases of emergency where electrical or communication underground  lines
are temporarily disconnected or damaged, but not to exceed a period of ninety days duration, except that renewal for one additional ninety-day period may
be given for good cause by the Division of Building Inspection.

(4)	During periods of construction or reconstruction of buildings when open ditches or unusual topographical, soil or other physical conditions make underground  installation of such utility distribution facilities unreasonable or impractical.

(5)	To service "model homes" or buildings under construction or temporary structures with 110-220 volt service only.  For good cause shown the Division of Building Inspection may allow up to twelve months of such service.

(6)	Poles, overhead wires and associated overhead structures used for the transmission of electrical energy at voltages of 22,000 volts or more.  However, such wires shall not be located closer than the minimum distance from an existing occupiable structure nor shall any occupiable structure be constructed closer than the minimum distance from such wires or overhead structures or except in those instances where a side yard of less than eight feet
has been permitted, in which case the width of the permitted side yard shall be considered as the minimum horizontal  component distance permitted.

(7)	Additions or extensions of high-voltage lines to existing permitted aboveground utility distribution facilities provided such additional facilities conform to the minimum safe distance requirements of this section.

(c)	Easements.   The owner, subdivider or consumer shall furnish the necessary easements to accommodate all the utility distribution facilities required to be placed underground;  shall also establish the final grade before the utility company is required to
 


install the utility distribution facilities; and shall provide the trench and backfill the same for the service line extending from the utility distribution facilities to the occupiable structure.

(d)	Approval of Plat.  No plat shall be approved by the Planning Commission unless such plat complies with this section.  However, if aboveground  utility distribution facilities have already been constructed as of the date of the adoption of this section, based upon a previously approved preliminary plat, and no part of such utility distribution facility is located closer than the minimum distance from any proposed occupiable structure, the final plat may be approved with an exception for such installed above-ground utility distribution facilities only, except in those instances where a side yard of less than eight feet has been permitted, in which case the width of the permitted side yard shall be considered as the minimum  horizontal  component distance permitted.

(e)	Installation Charges.  No utility company may make or assess against a subdivider, owner or consumer an extra charge or rate for, or resulting from, the installation of the underground  utility distribution facilities required by this section, except that in the years  1972 and 1973 an extra charge of a maximum of seventy-five ($75.00) per lot may be made.  If, as a result of a change of a utility company policy, a utility company grants to any owner, subdivider or consumer located within a seventy-five mile radius of the City a lesser extra charge or rate for, or resulting from a specific type of installation of underground facilities required by this section than the extra charge or rate authorized by this section, the lesser rate for such specific type of installation shall then become the maximum rate chargeable hereunder during  1972 and  1973.  This limitation or prohibition  shall not apply to any just  and reasonable extra charge or rate which has been specifically and clearly approved by the J:>ublic Utilities Commission of Ohio under any applicable provisions of the Ohio Revised  Code.

(f)	Authority to Grant Variance. The Planning Commission of the City may
grant a variance from the requirements of this section where underground construction would not be practicable due to the nature of the soil or rock formations in the area or other unusual condition which cannot reasonably be corrected, or when a hardship, as referred to in Section l 107.06(a) as to an existing occupiable structure is or may be created.

(g)	Submission of Plans. Prior to the approval of a final plat by the Planning Commission for new additions or subdivisions within the City, the utility company, or the owner or subdivider duly authorized by the utility company, shall submit to the City Engineer plans showing the location of easements and rights of way for all underground utility distribution facilities.  The utility company shall also furnish to the City Engineer drawings showing the location and depth of such underground utility distribution facilities within street rights of way and real property of the City.

(h)	Construction Standards. All utility distribution facilities shall be installed and maintained in accordance with the provisions of the National Electrical Safety Code, issued by the U.S. Department of Commerce, National Bureau of Standards, March, 1948, or the
 



order of the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio and/or the Industrial Commission of Ohio and good utility practice, provided that such provisions are not inconsistent with the requirements and provisions of this section.  Additionally, the construction standards set forth below shall supplement or supersede the provisions set forth in such Code or order and shall be controlling in the event of a conflict therewith.

The subdivider shall provide space of a character, extent and location deemed suitable by the Commission to the needs created by this subdivision for recreational or other public uses and such space shall be provided by the subdivider, if concurred in by the Commission by one of the following methods:

(a)	By providing an area within the subdivision for use for recreational purposes, which recreational area so provided shall have an area equal to a minimum of 260 square feet for each lot platted in the subdivision, and which area shall be developed and maintained by the subdivider or by the lot owners in the subdivision under a legal arrangement adequate to secure such end; or

(b)	By conveying by warranty deed to the City an amount of land within the subdivision equal to a minimum of 260 square feet for each lot platted in the subdivision which land or the proceeds thereof shall be held by the City to be used for the acquisition or improvement of land for one or more park or recreational areas in the area of the subdivision; or

(c)	By contributing to the City such a sum of money as shall be equivalent to the reasonable market value of the area comprising 260 square feet for each lot platted in the subdivision, which reasonable market value shall be computed by the City Appraiser on the basis of full and fair market value of the land. If the owner is not satisfied with such appraisal, he may appeal such determination in which case an appraisal board consisting of one appraiser selected by the City at its own expense, one selected by the property owner at
 


his expense and a third selected by the two other appraisers at City expense, shall determine the value.

SECTION 1113.05	RIGID PAVEMENT.

The following specifications shall be complied with when a street is constructed with Portland cement concrete:

(a)	Thickness. The uniform thickness of plain Portland cement concrete pavement shall be six inches for residential and collector streets, and nine inches for arterial streets (I00 feet right of way) and thoroughfares (120 feet right of way).

(b)	Subgrade. The subgrade shall be constructed to the .required elevation below the finished street surface and shall be rolled until it is compacted to at least ninety-five percent of the material's maximum density based on optimum water content of the soil (AASHO Designation T-180-57 Method "C"), as determined by an independent testing laboratory, if determined necessary by the City Engineer. The minimum number of tests shall be at least one for each day's placement or 500 linear feet of pavement, whichever length is shorter. The location of these tests is to be determined by the Engineer.  The developer shall furnish the Engineer with proof of proper compaction before placing any concrete. All such tests required shall be paid for by the developer. Additional tests may be required if subsequent circumstances occur rendering the above required tests inconclusive.

(c)	Material.  Prior to use of any Portland cement concrete within a subdivision, the developer shall supply the City with a mix design prepared by an independent testing laboratory according to A.C.I. Standard 613 that will meet all of the requirements set forth in Section
1113.06 and 1113.07. This mix design will remain in effect until a new source of material is sued, at which time a new mix design shall be submitted.

(d)	Construction.  The specifications set forth in Section 1113.08 shall be complied with in the construction of a Portland cement concrete pavement.  (Ord. 1942-69. Passed 4-8-69.)



SECTION lll3.06	CONCRETE DESIGN.

(a)	Concrete shall develop at seven and twenty-eight days. The average compressive strength is indicated in the following table.
 




	Average Strength (12si}	Minimum Strength (12si}
7-day test	2,900	2,400
28-day test	3,900	3,400

(b)	The amount of cement shall not be less than six sacks per cubic yard of concrete.  In proportioning  materials for concrete, one sack of cement weighing ninety-four pounds shall be considered as one cubic foot.

(c)	Fine and coarse aggregate shall be measured separately and fine aggregate shall not be less than thirty percent nor more than forty-five percent of the volume of the aggregate.

(d)	The amount of water shall be only sufficient to obtain a workable mix. The water-cement ratio (gallons/sack) shall not be more than six to one, but in no case shall the slump of concrete exceed four inches when tested according to ASTM Method C-143.

(e).	The percentage of entrained air shall be between five and eight percent, by volume, when tested according to ASTM C-231. An air entraining agent may be added at the site if the first load of concrete proves to be deficient. However, the second load and succeeding loads shall be rejected and the air content corrected by the concrete producer.

(f)	The developer and supplier shall permit access to the work and materials for all required tests and inspections.  Yield tests will be made by the Engineer for the purpose of determi.ning the cement content per cubic yard of concrete if determined necessary.  Ifat any time such cement content is found to be less than that specified above, the batch weights of fine and coarse aggregate shall be reduced proportionally until the cement per cubic yard of concrete is not less than specified.

Test cylinders will be made from concrete incorporated  in the work and test cores will be cut from the completed work when required by the Engineer.  Cylinders falling below the average compressive strengths shown in the table in Subsection (a) hereof will be sufficient reason for increasing the cement content without additional cost to the City.  Cylinders
falling below the minimum compressive strength shown in the table in .Subsection (a) hereof
will be sufficient reason for rejection of the work involved.

The measurement of the volume of entrained air in the freshly mixed Portland cement concrete will be determined by the Engineer. Failure of the percentage of entrained air to fall within the specified limits will be sufficient reason for rejecting the material. (Ord. 1942-69. Passed 4-8-69.)
 


SECTION 1113.07	MATERIALS.

(a)	Portland cement shall meet the requirements of ASTM Designation C-l 50 for plain cement or C-l 75 for air-entraining cement.  Type I or IA cement shall be used.  The letter "A" designates air-entraining Portland cement.  If high early strength concrete is required, Type III or IIIA shall be used.

(b)	Fine and coarse aggregates shall meet the requirements of Section 703.02 of the State of Ohio Department of Highways Construction and Material Specifications, the January  l 971 edition, except that the use of slag shall not be permitted.  The gradation of coarse aggregate shall meet the requirements of Section 703.0l  for size No. 57 Aggregate.

(c)	Water used in mixing concrete shall be clean and free from deleterious amounts of acids, alkalis or organic materials.

(d)	Air-entraining admixtures used with plain cement or with air-entraining  cement shall meet the requirements of Section 705.10 of the State of Ohio Department of Highways Construction and Material Specifications, the January  l, 197l edition, and shall be specifically prepared  for air-entrainment  only.

(e)	The above materials shall be the only ingredients in the concrete. (Ord.  1942-69.  Passed 4-8-69.)

SECTION 1113.08	CONSTRUCTION

(a)	Job-mixed concrete shall not be used unless permission is obtained from the City Engineer.  Ready-mixed  concrete shall be mixed and delivered in accordance with the requirements  set forth in "Standard  Specifications for Ready-Mixed  Concrete" (ASTM Designation C-94) except that concrete shall be delivered to the work site and discharged from the mixer or agitator within one hour after all ingredients are in the mixer or agitator. Delivery tickets shall be time stamped when all ingredients are in the mixer or agitator.

(b)	Forms shall conform to the shape, lines and dimensions of the members as called for on the plans, shall be substantial and sufficiently tight to prevent leakage of mortar, and properly braced or tied together so as to maintain position and shape.  The use of bent or damaged side forms varying more than one-eighth of an inch in ten feet of length from the true plane of the top and one-fourth of an inch in ten feet on the vertical face shall not be permitted.

(c)	Concrete shall be deposited as nearly as practicable in its final position to avoid segregation due to rehandling or flowing. Concrete shall not fall free more than five feet. The concreting shall be carried on at such a rate that the concrete is at all times plastic
 



and flows readily.  No concrete that has partially hardened or been contaminated by foreign material shall be deposited on the work, nor shall retempered concrete be used.  When concreting is once started it shall be carried on as a continuous operation until the placing of a section is completed.  The top surface shall conform to the specified cross-section and profile as shown on the plans.  No water or cement shall be added to the surface of the pavement at any time during construction.

(d)	Joints shall be constructed where shown on the construction drawings or where required by the Engineer and shall conform to the details set forth on the standard drawings.

(e)	Following compacting, the concrete shall be finished and floated in a manner approved by the Engineer.  After floating has been completed and while the concrete is still plastic, it shall be tested for trueness with ten foot straightedges.  After final curing, the concrete pavement  will be tested for smoothness with an approved surface testing machine and all such surface variations of more than one-fourth of an inch in a ten-foot length of pavement for a fifty-foot right of way and more than three-sixteenths of an inch in a ten-foot length of pavement for rights of way of60 through  120 feet, inclusive, shall be ground off to within the specified tolerances.   Sections of pavements containing depressions which cannot be corrected by grinding shall be replaced by the contractor to the satisfaction of the Engineer.

Before the concrete has taken its initial set, the edges of the pavement along each side of each slab and on each side of transverse expansion joints shall be worked with an
approved tool and rounded to a radius of one-quarter inch.  Any tool marks left by the edging shall be eliminated by texturing the surface.  The final surface shall be a broomed finish.

(f)	The following provision shall be made for the proper curing of all concrete. Immediately after the final finishing and after the free water has disappeared, all exposed surfaces of the concrete shall be sealed by spraying thereon, as a fine mist, a uniform application of the curing material in such a manner as to provide a continuous, uniform, water-impermeable film without marring the surface of the concrete. A minimum of one gallon of material shall be used for each 200 square feet of surface treated. Curing material
shall be white in color and in accordance with ASTM Designation C-156.  The material  shall
be of such a nature or so treated that it will be distinctly visible for at least four hours after application. Concrete to be placed after October 31 of any year, which will be opened to
traffic during the following winter shall be cured by the use of polyethylene sheeting placed as soon after the finishing operations as possible without marring the surface of the concrete. The entire surface of the top and sides of the newly placed concrete shall be covered and maintained covered for seven days after it has been placed and shall be cured as specified above.

(g)	Adequate equipment shall be provided for heating the concrete materials and protecting the concrete during freezing or near freezing weather.  No concrete shall be placed
 


when the temperature of the surrounding air is below thirty-two degrees Fahrenheit, unless permission is obtained from the City Engineer.  All concrete materials and all reinforcement forms, fillers and ground with which the concrete is to come in contact shall be completely free from frost.  Whenever the temperature of the surrounding air is below forty degrees Fahrenheit, all concrete placed in the forms shall have a temperature of between fifty and seventy degrees Fahrenheit, and adequate means shall be provided for maintaining a temperature of not less than fifty degrees Fahrenheit for a minimum of three days, except that when high early strength concrete is used, the temperature shall be maintained at not less
than fifty degrees Fahrenheit for two days or for as much more time as is necessary to insure proper curing of the concrete.

The above requirements  for curing are minimum requirements only.  Any concrete showing injury or damage due to inadequate curing shall be repaired or replaced by the developer prior to acceptance.  No dependence shall be placed on salt or other chemicals for
·	the prevention of freezing. (Ord. 1942-69. Passed 4-8-69.)



SECTION _1113.09	FLEXIBLE  PAVEMENT.

The specifications as set forth in Sections 1113.I 0 through 1113.17 shall be complied with when a street is constructed with an asphalt concrete surface over a waterbound macadam (modified) base, No. 304 aggregate base, bituminous aggregate base or lime-fly  ash stabilized base, as the same are set forth in the State of Ohio Department of Highways Construction and Material Specifications, the January 1971 edition. (Ord. 1942-69. Passed
4-8-69.)



SECTION 1113.10	FLEXIBLE PAVEMENT SUBGRADE.

The subgrade shall be constructed to the required elevation below the finished street surface and compacted according to the requirements of Section 1113.05(b). (Ord. 1942-69. Passed 4-8-69.)



SECTION 1113.11	WATERBOUND MACADAM (MODIFIED) BASE.

*Not included in the total thickness of the base.

(b)	Material. The base shall be composed of crushed limestone or crushed gravel and screenings meeting the following requirements of the Construction and Material	· Specifications of the Ohio Department of Highways, the January 1971 edition:

Sections 703.01 and 703.04 for No. 2 Aggregate
Sections 304.02 and 703.04 for No. 304 Aggregate
Section 703 .I0 for Screenings.

(c)	Construction.

(1)	Forms. Except where the base course is placed between curbs, edge support shall be provided by means of a minimum eighteen inch width of soil, placed to a height that will consolidate to the height of the lift being compacted.  The edge of the soil shall be supported by forms until the base material is spread.

(2)	Spreading Materials. A one-inch course of screenings shall be spread on the prepared and accepted subgrade. This layer of screenings constitutes a dry inverted choke and shall not be rolled.

The No. 2 size aggregate shall be uniformly spread on the inverted choke and when placed shall have a uniform distribution as to size. When used, side forms shall be removed and the voids filled prior to compacting the material.

When rollers alone are used for keying and filling, the maximum compacted thickness of any one lift shall be five inches.  When approved vibratory compactors are used in conjunction with rollers, the maximum compacted thickness of any one lift shall be ten inches.

The No. 304 aggregate shall be placed on the completed waterbound No. 2 size aggregate according to the requirements of Section
!113.!2(c).
 



(3)	Compaction.  The No. 2 size aggregate shall be keyed, filled and compacted as follows:  rollers weighing at least eight to ten tons or rollers and approved vibratory compactors shall be used for the keying and filling operation.  The rolling of unfilled aggregate shall be only sufficient to obtain maximum keying, i.e. the aggregate does not creep or wave ahead of the roller, but the total rolling time shall be  equivalent to eight hours for each  1,000 square yards of each lift. Keying shall not be started until the coarse aggregate has been spread for the full width of the pavement.  Rolling shall begin at the edges of
the lift and, where curbs are not a part of the new construction, the roller shall cover the full eighteen inches of the earth backing and extend over the loose aggregate.  After the edges have been so rolled, the rolling shall progress gradually toward the center line.

After the aggregate has been thoroughly keyed, dry screenings shall be applied evenly and gradually on the surface of the coarse aggregate. The filling shall be accompanied  by using rollers, graders, spreaders or other approved methods, and shall be continued, placing and sweeping screenings by hand where necessary, until no more screenings will go in dry and there is an excess on the surface of the lift just sufficient to cover the pattern of the coarse aggregate.

The No. 304 aggregate shall be compacted according to the requirements of Section l l 13.12(c).

(4)		Waterbinding.   After the voids ofa section of the No. 2 size aggregate lift have been filled with screenings, the section shall be waterbound  as soon as possible.  This water shall be applied with suitable sprinkler trucks or pressure distributors of such capacity that once the waterbinding of a section is started the water shall be adequate and the operation shall be continuous until complete.   Sprinkling of the lift
shall be accompanied by rolling and brooming.   More screenings shall be added if necessary.  This rolling and brooming shall be continued until a grout of the screenings and water has been formed sufficient to
. form a wave in front of the rolls of the roller.  When the first lift has
· been completed, no free water shall be permitted on its surface before the second lift, when required, is constructed upon it. The contractor is responsible for insuring that no waterbinding takes place when the atmospheric temperature is at or below freezing.

(d)	Protection.  The first course shall be maintained  in its finished condition until the second course is constructed upon it.  Normal traffic will be permitted upon the completed No. 304 aggregate base course provided that the surface is restored to its original finished condition  before the asphalt concrete intermediate course is applied.  Restoration to
 


proper grade shall be accomplished by the removal of all dirt, debris and loose stone and, when necessary, by the addition of No. 304 aggregate, well watered and rolled into place. (Ord.  1942-69.  Passed 4-8-69.)

Whenever a new source of material is used or the aggregate characteristics change appreciably, new test results shall be submitted.

(c)	Construction.

(I)	Placing.  The No. 304 aggregate shall be placed according to the requirements  of Section 304.03 of the State of Ohio Department of Highways  Construction and Materials Specifications, the January  l, 1971 edition.

(2)		Compaction. The No. 304 aggregate shall be compacted to ninety­ eight percent of its maximum density based on optimum water content of the material (AASHO T-180 Method "C"). The surface of each layer shall be maintained during the compaction operations in such a manner that a uniform texture is produced and the aggregates firmly keyed. Water shall be uniformly applied over the base materials  during compaction in the amounts necessary to maintain the moisture at or near optimum. The No. 304 aggregate shall be primed as soon as
possible after compaction has been completed  and material has dried out.  All tests required for the construction of the No. 304 aggregate course shall be paid for by the developer.
 


(d)	Protection.  The first course shall be maintained in its finished condition until the second course is constructed upon it.  Nonna! traffic will be pennitted upon the completed No. 304 aggregate base course provided that the surface is restored to its original finished condition before the asphalt concrete intennediate course is applied.

The proportioning of the ingredients in the mix shall be controlled within the following  tolerances:

 
Lime Fly ash Aggregate
 
±	0.15%
±	1.00%
±	1.50%
 
by weight by weight by weight
 

The actual proportions of lime; fly ash, water and aggregate shall be determined by an independent testing laboratory at no cost to the City. Whenever any one of the ingredients differs from that used in the original mix design, a new design shall be established by the testing laboratory. However, when tests indicate that the requirements specified in this section and in subsection (d)(3) hereof are not being met, the proportions may be altered and additional mix designs obtained.

·	The proportions of the mixture shall be such that when tested  in the laboratory as specified herein, the unconfined  compressive strength, in seven days, will be a minimum of 750 pounds per square inch.  The mixture, obtained from the plant, shall be adjusted to optimum moisture content by the laboratory, placed in a mold and compacted  in accordance with the appropriate sections of AASHO T-99 Method "C".  The prepared  four-inch diameter cylinder shall then be placed in a sealed container to preserve the moisture content, placed  in an oven and cured seven days at a temperature of 140 degrees Fahrenheit.   At the end of  seven days, the cylinders shall be removed from the containers, capped and broken.

The mixture obtained in the field shall be placed in the mold, compacted and tested as specified above, except that the moisture content shall not be altered from its existing field condition.

(2)	Spreading. The stabilized material shall be spread uniformly on the prepared subgrade for the full width of pavement being constructed. When used, side forms shall be removed and the voids filled prior to compacting the material.  The maximum compacted thickness of any one lift shall be six inches. Whe.n additional material is to be placed on a completed lift, the top one inch of the compacted lift shall be scarified.  When the weather is hot and dry, as determined by the City Engineer, the subgrade shall be moistened prior to spreading the material. No stabilized material shall be placed or treated during wet
 


or unsuitable weather or when the atmospheric or ground temperature is below forty degrees Fahrenheit.

(3)	Compaction.  The material shall be compacted starting at the edge of the course and progressing toward the center line.  Where curbs are not a part of the construction, the roller shall cover the entire earth backing and extend over the loose base material.  The material shall be compacted until the density is not less than ninety-five percent of the material's density based on optimum moisture content (AASHO T-180 Method "C"), as determined by an independent testing laboratory at no cost to the City.  Density tests and test cylinders made from material obtained in the field shall be made as directed by the City Engineer,
but at least one set of tests will be required for every 1,000 square yards of base laid.

If for any reason construction operations are delayed or suspended, the uncompacted material shall be removed and disposed of, if determined necessary by the City Engineer.

(4)	Finishing.  After the material has been compacted, the surface shall be shaped to the lines, grades and cross sections specified.  During the shaping operation, the surface shall be lightly scarified to eliminate any imprints left by shaping or compaction equipment.  The surface shall then be compacted to the specified density.

During the finishing operation, the moisture content of the surface material shall be maintained at not less than that specified.  The surface compaction and finishing operation shall produce a smooth, dense surface, free of compaction planes, cracks, ridges or loose material.  The finishing operation shall be continuous and shall be completed during normal construction hours.

Construction joints shall be placed at the end of each day's work
and/or when directed by the City Engineer.  The.joint shall be made by
trimming the end of the compacted base to a straight line, normal to the center line of the pavement, and with a vertical edge in the compacted portion of the material.  When additional material is placed against this edge, it shall be scarified and the new material blended in.

The completed stabilized base shall be covered within twenty-four hours with bituminous material meeting the requirements of Section
1113.16 and applied at the rate of one-tenth to fifteen-hundredths of a gallon per square yard.
 



(e)	Protection. No traffic will be permitted on the base course until the intermediate asphalt concrete course has been placed on the base material.  Prior to placing the asphalt concrete, the base shall be cleaned and repaired and additional bituminous material applied, as directed by the City Engineer. (Ord. 1942-69. Passed 4-8-69.)



SECTION 1113.15	PRIME COAT.

(b)	Material.  The asphalt concrete material shall meet the requirements of Item 403 for the intermediate course, and Item 404 for the surface course, of the Construction and Material Specifications of the Ohio Department of Highways, the January I, 1971 edition. Prior to the use of any asphalt concrete within a subdivision the developer or subdivider shall require the asphalt concrete producer to supply the City with a mix design.  This mix design
 



will remain in effect until a new source of material is used, at which time a new mix design shall be submitted.

(c)	Construction.  The asphalt concrete courses shall be constructed in accordance with the requirements of Item 403 of the Construction and Material Specifications of the
Ohio Department of Highways, the January  l, 1971 edition, for the intermediate course and
Item 404 for the surface course, except that the surface course need not be placed within ten days, as specified in Section 404.11.  The requirements of Sections 403.16, 404.16 and
401.16 will not be applicable.

The developer or subdivider may proceed at this or its own option with the construction of waterbound macadam (modified) base, 304 aggregate base, bituminous aggregate base, or lime-fly ash stabilized base and the intermediate and surface courses of asphalt concrete, in the same season that underground utilities have been constructed.  When the surface and intermediate courses are not placed at the same time, a tack coat shall be placed on the intermediate course prior to placing the surface course.  Further, during the ensuing weather period, the developer or subdivider shall fill any and all holes and settlements which are detrimental to traffic safety and shall maintain the street in a safe,
accessible   anner.  Defective areas in the intermediate course shall be removed, repaired and
inspected before placing the surface course.

Asphalt concrete shall not be placed when the prepared surface is wet, when the air temperature is below forty degrees Fahrenheit at the job site, when weather conditions otherwise prevent proper handling or when frost is evident in the base.  (Ord. 1942-69. Passed  4-8-69.)



.S	ECTION 1113.18	SURFACE  TOLERANCE.

The completed surface course of the flexible pavement will be tested for smoothness with an approved surface testing machine and all such surface variations of more than one­ quarter inch in a ten-foot length of pavement shall be ground off to within the specified tolerances.   Sections of pavements containing depressions which cannot be corrected by grinding shall be replaced by the contractor to the satisfaction of the City Engineer.  (Ord. 1942-69.  Passed 4-8-69.)	·



SECTION 1113.19	EQUIPMENT.

All equipment which is proposed to be used in constructing the pavements shall be of sufficient size and in such mechanical condition as to meet requirements of the work and to produce a satisfactory quality of work.  All equipment shall be subject to the approval of the City Engineer and, when found unsatisfactory, shall be replaced or improved.  (Ord. 1942-69. Passed  4-8-69.)
 





SECTION 1113.20	CURBS AND GUTTERS.

Curbs and gutters shall be required in all subdivisions.  Whenever all lots in a subdivision have a width of 100 or more feet at the building line, or when a public sanitary or storm sewer system is not available nor planned for the district, the Planning Commission  may waive the requirements of this section, provided that sidewalks are not also required.
Use of curbs and gutters shall be as follows: Type A	Integral Roll Curb
Concrete streets in residential areas with rights of way of fifty
feet and sixty feet

Types A and C shall be placed integrally with Portland cement concrete pavements.  Types
B, BA and D shall be placed on at least three inches of gravel, when determined necessary by the City Engineer.  Concrete for all types of curbs and combined curbs and gutters shall meet the requirements set forth in this chapter. All curbs shall be backfilled prior to the movement of any vehicle over the roadway area, or within thirty days from the da\e of the initial  concrete placement, whichever is sooner.

A minimum of two drain tiles shall be installed on each lot and shall be placed so as to conform with the side yard requirements of that particular zoning district.  Should additional drain tile outlets be required after the curb is in place, a permit shall be obtained in accordance with the requirements of Chapter 901 of these Codified Ordinances.   (Ord.  1942- 69.  Passed 4-8-69.)
 



SECTION 1113.21          SIDEWALKS.

(a)	Requirements.  Sidewalks shall have a width of four feet in all residential areas.  On thoroughfares, arterials or residential streets serving as collectors of traffic from minor streets, five feet wide sidewalks shall be required.  Where sidewalks intersect at street intersections, the area between them and the curb shall be filled in as additional sidewalk when required by the City Engineer.  At least three inches of gravel shall be filled in as additional sidewalk when required by the City Engineer.  At least three inches of gravel shall be placed under all sidewalks when determined necessary by the City Engineer.  Concrete for sidewalks shall meet the requirements set forth in this chapter.

in all subdivisions where curb and gutters are required. They shall be a minimum of six inches thick and the concrete shall meet the requirements set forth in this chapter. (Ord. 1942-69.  Passed 4-8-69.)



SECTION 1113.23        WATER MAINS.

Where a public water supply is within a reasonable distance as determined by the Planning Commission, the subdivider or developer shall construct a system of water mains and connect with such public water supply and provide a connection for each lot with laterals extended to the lot line.  All water mains shall have at least forty-eight inches of cover.  all water mains shall be sectionalized and looped.  No dead-end lines will be permitted.  No water line shall be less than six inches in diameter in single-family residential areas nor less than eight inches in diameter in multi-family, business and industrial areas.  Larger water mains may be required for manufacturing districts, depending on the type of industry.

Fire hydrants shall be placed not over 500 feet from principal structures in a Residential Estates (R-E) District with their location to be approved by the Fire Chief. Hydrants shall be placed not over 500 feet apart, measured on the main, in Single-Family (R­
I and R-2) Residential Districts.  In Multi-Family Residential (R-3 and R-4), Commercial
(B-1-A, B-1, B-2, B-3) and Industrial (M) Districts, fire hydrants shall not be over 300 feet
 



apart, measured on the main, and not more than 400 feet from any opening in any building. Further, when dedicated streets exist, water mains should be located in the required street right of way.   When water mains are located on private property, the location of hydrants must be approved by both the Fire Chief and the City Engineer and fire trucks must be provided with safe and unconstrained  access to all fire hydrants.

All fire hydrants shall have two 2-1/2 inch hose nozzles and one 4 inch steamer nozzle.  All hydrant outlet nozzles shall be set at eighteen inches to twenty-one inches above finished grade in all cases.

All main line valves shall be placed not over 800 feet apart in single-family residential areas and not over 500 feet apart in multi-family residential, business and industrial areas.

SECTION 1113.24	SANITARY SEWERS.

If a subdivision can be reasonably served by the extension of an existing public sanitary sewer, as determined by the Planning Commission, the subdivider or developer shall provide a system of sanitary sewer mains and shall provide lateral connections for each lot to the lot line.

Where a public sanitary sewer is not reasonably accessible, the subdivider or developer may, with the approval of the Dayton-Montgomery County Combined Health District, provide for septic tanks or other mechanical means of sewage disposal for each lot or group of lots. The design of sanitary sewers shall meet the requirements of the County Sanitary Engineer.  (Ord. 1942-69. Passed 4-8-69.)



SECTION 1113.25	STORM SEWERS.

Storm sewers shall be designed to flow full and shall be adequate for a storm of that intensity which can be expected two times in ten years.  The run-off from platted areas shall in no case be considered less than thirty-five percent and in case of large paved areas (e.g. shopping centers, industrial areas) not less than seventy percent.  Storm sewers shall be connected on crown and, when the velocity exceeds twenty feet per second, the invert shall be paved with vitrified tile or other abrasion resistant material.  Storm sewers may be  concrete pipe or galvanized corrugated pipe of adequate load carrying capacity as determined by the City Engineer.  Manning's roughness coefficients (N) to be used in determining the capacity of storm sewers shall be as follows:
 


Concrete Pipe N-0.013

Corrugated Pipe (in inches)
2-213 x 112	Corrugations   N-0.024 3 x l	Corrugations   N-0.027
6 x 2	Corrugations N-0.032

When new designs or materials are proposed, the characteristics shall be determined by the Engineer.  All storm sewers shall be constructed to the line and grade as approved on the plans.  Catch basins shall be so placed that the line of travel from the sidewalks can be made without crossing gutter flow.

The subdivider shall be responsible for adequate and safe disposal of all surface waters in the subdivision.  Where the physical conditions and locations of the land to be developed are of such a character that a storm sewer is required in a size larger than sixty inches inside diameter (using a coefficient of roughness ofN-0.013) to provide adequate drainage facilities for the plat and for areas beyond the limits of the plat which drain through it, the City may participate in the installation costs of the sewers in excess of the cost of sixty inch sewers or may, on petition by the subdivider, establish a drainage district to be financed by assessment as provided by law.  Where it is deemed impossible or impracticable by Council for the City to participate in these excess costs or for a drainage district to be established, open channels will be permitted, provided health hazards will not result and proper safety measures are taken by the developer.  (Ord. 1942-69.  Passed 4-8-69.)



SECTION 1113.26	OPEN CHANNELS.

New, existing or relocated channels shall be developed and improved according to the following requirements and the pertinent standard drawings of Section 1113.04.

(a)	Design.

(I)	General.  Storm intensity, frequency and run-off shall be the same as set forth in Section 1113.25.

Manning's formula for flow in open channels shall be used for detennining the channel capacity.   An "N" factor of 0.030 shall be used for grass-lined channels and an "N" factor of 0.021 for concrete­ lined channels.  Abrupt changes in channel cross-sections or direction shall not be permitted.

(2)	Side Slopes.  The side slope for grass-lined channels shall be two feet horizontal to one foot vertical.  Where development permits, consideration may be given to three feet horizontal to one foot vertical
 


slopes.  Where the entire channel is lined with concrete, the maximum side slope may be one to one.  Where aesthetics are concerned and flow characteristics can be maintained, a structural channel may be used.  When the velocity of flow in the channel exceeds three feet per second, all curves shall be lined with concrete.  When the velocity is less than ten feet per second, the existing soil conditions shall govern the type of slope protection.   When the velocity exceeds ten feet per second, the entire channel shall be lined with concrete.

(3)	Channel Bottoms.  Where the velocity of flow in the channel exceeds three feet per second, the bottom of the channel through curved areas shall be lined with concrete.  When the velocity exceeds ten feet per second, the entire channel bottom shall be lined with concrete.   When the slopes are protected with concrete, the bottoms shall also be protected  with concrete.

(4)	Miscellaneous Protection.  Precast or placed concrete will be required on the slopes and bottom of the channel where two or more channels intersect, adjacent to bridges and culverts, and at the outlets of storm sewers.

(b)	Construction.

(l)		Sodded and Seeded Areas. All sloping bank surfaces and bottoms where rip-rap is not required shall be sodded and all areas on top of slopes within the designated channel easement shall be seeded or sodded. All areas shall have a healthy growth of grass prior to acceptance by the City for future maintenance.

(2)	Bank Compaction. All channel banks which are constructed by filling of material shall be compacted in accordance with the requirements of Section 11!3.03(c) for a width of approximately fifteen feet parallel with the channel to provide for stability of the channel bank.

(3)	Concrete Areas.

A.	Slopes. Placed concrete shall be a minimum of four inches thick and be reinforced with wire mesh. Precast concrete blocks shall be rectangular or square, capable of interlocking with adjoining block, be a minimum of three inches thick, have adequate reinforcement and have a minimum surface area of four square feet. The slope protection shall extend from the bottom subgrade to the height of the design flow.
 




B.	Bottom. Placed concrete shall be a minlinum of four inches thick. Precast concrete shall meet the requirements of subparagraph A hereof.

C.	Miscellaneous. Expansion material shall be placed around structures as directed by the City Engineer. Contraction joints shall be placed as directed by the
City Engineer.  Cut-off walls shall be placed at the ends of all areas protected with precast or placed concrete.

D.	Concrete. All concrete for channel protection shall meet the requirements set forth in this chapter and contain six percent to eight percent entrained air.

(c)	Utilities. Where practicable, all utilities shall be prohibited in open channel bottom and slopes. Ifit becomes necessary to install utilities in an open channel bottom, such utilities shall be adequately protected and deep enough to permit future maintenance of the channel.

(d)	Existing Channels. An existing channel, when determined by the Engineer to be of sufficient size, may remain in its original condition. When an open channel falls between an existing development and a new development, that portion within the new development shall receive the same treatment insofar as it is possible as that in the existing development.  When an open channel falls between undeveloped land and a new development, that portion within the new development shall be treated as a new channel.  (Ord. 1942-69. Passed 4-8-69.)



SECTION 1113.27	SURVEY  MONUMENTS

(a)	Surveyor. A complete survey shall be made by a registered surveyor.

(b)	Exterior Boundary Traverse. The traverse of the exterior boundaries of the tract and of each book, when computed from field measurements of the ground, shall close within a limit of error of one foot to 10,000 feet of the perimeter before balancing the survey.

(c)	Permanent  Reference Monuments.   Permanent reference monuments  shall be located and set with at least four permanent markers in each plat containing over ten lots.
 


Monumentation shall be in accordance with Chapter 4733-37 of the Administrative Code of the State of Ohio filed pursuant to Chapter 119 of the Ohio Revised Code. (Ord. 3008-82. Passed 5-11-82.)



SECTION 1113.28	PERFORMANCE BOND.

(a)	No public improvements shall be constructed prior to final plat approval by the Planning Commission.  In lieu of the completion of the required public improvements within the ninety (90) day period, the Subdivider or agent thereof has the option of entering into an agreement with the City in which the Subdivider shall promise to complete the construction of the required public improvements pursuant to City standards, City imposed timing and other requirements.  The full and timely completion of the required public improvements shall be secured by the Subdivider or agent thereof by providing to and posting with the City a performance bond, cash bond, or letter of credit in an amount at least equal to the full cost of construction of all of the required public improvements.

(b)	Upon completion of the required public improvements and approval by the City Engineer that the required public improvements are constructed to the Engineer's satisfaction, then upon the Subdivider's request, the amount of the security posted with the City, whether it be a performance bond, cash bond or letter of credit, may be reduced to an amount equal to ten percent (10%) of the original full cost of construction of all of the required public improvements or the amount of$5,000.00, whichever is greater.  This security in the reduced amount shall be considered a maintenance bond for the twelve (12) month period beginning with the date of approval by the City Engineer that the required public improvements are constructed to the Engineer's satisfaction.  This maintenance security is to guarantee that the required public improvements do not require repair or maintenance in excess of normal wear and tear during the twelve month period.  All performance bonds, cash bonds and letters of credit provided to and posted with the City pursuant to the provisions of this Section 1113.28 shall conform to the requirements for
sufficiencyandformidentifiedinSection 1109.17.	(f v. No  335.  Ord.  <;o;is- o..s,
p e>-SJ' uL .?· :23 ·OS)

SECTION 1113.29	INSTALLMENT AGREEMENT.

When a certified check is deposited or performance bond is executed pursuant to Section 1113.28, the City shall have the authority to enter into a written agreement or to accept a release-type performance bond, either of which itemizes the several phases of construction in sequence including an amount equal to the cost of each such phase. However, the penal amount or deposit may be reduced by ninety percent of each such amount upon completion, inspection and approval of the particular phase of such work.  If the subdivider agreement is extended by the Planning Commission for an additional twelve
months at the termination of the one-year agreement, the penal amount or deposit during this second period may be reduced by seventy-five percent of each such amount upon
 



completion, inspection and approval of the particular phase of such work.  Further, the City Engineer shall have the authority to effect the partial releases and shall notify the surety or the Finance Director of the amount to be released.  However, the percentage of the deposit or performance bond retained by the City shall not be released until all construction and improvements covered by the deposit or bond are completed, inspected and accepted for maintenance by the City.  (Ord. 2336-71.  Passed  11-9-71.)



SECTION 1113.30	STREET NAME SIGNS.

The subdivider shall, upon filing the final subdivision, pay a material cost and installation fee for name signs, said fee as listed in the fee schedule established by the
Planing Director shall include all cost of materials, installation and labor.  (Ord. No. 2910-80. Passed 9-9-80.)



SECTION 1113.31	INSPECTIONS.

It shall be the responsibility of the subdividers to notify the City Engineer at least four hours in advance of the time that all is in readiness for the following periodic inspections which must be made.

(a)	When all sewers, public and private utilities, laterals and catch basins are installed and before trenches for the same are backfilled;

(b)	After the forms for curbs and gutters are set, where combined curbs and gutters are required, and gravel base is in place and before any concrete is placed;

(c)	After the forms for drive approaches or sidewalks are set and gravel base is in place and before any concrete is placed;

(d)	After subgrade is shaped and rolled and before the compaction test is made when Portland  cement concrete is used;

(e)	After the forms are in place and immediately before any pavement or channel concrete is placed;

(f)	Immediately before any flexible base materials are placed in base courses;

(g)	Immediately before any prime coat or tack coat is applied;

(h)	Immediately before any asphalt concrete is laid.
 



After written notice from the developer or land holder requesting final inspection, such inspection shall be completed within a fifteen-day period by the Engineering Division. Following this final inspection, the developer or land holder has thirty days to correct the deficiencies listed on the final inspection list. Ifthese deficiencies are not completed within this required period, then any additional items which require correction will be included in a subsequent final inspection.

No work shall be accepted or bonds released unless these inspections have been made and the work found to be satisfactory.  (Ord. 1942-69. Passed 4-8-69.)

charged against the real estate upon which the structure is located and shall be a lien upon such real estate.

	Re-Inspection Fees. Any person who neglects, fails, or refuses to correct a violation within the stated compliance deadline provided under Section 1322.07.2 may be assessed a re-inspection fee for each inspection that is needed to confirm compliance after the compliance date.

	Recovery of Cost and Fees. Upon completion of a re-inspection, completion of emergency repairs, or abatement of violations by the City, the Chief Code Official shall cause to be sent, by certified, pre-posted mail, a fee and cost statement to owner of the property or premises and a copy of the same shall be posted in a conspicuous location on or about the property, structure, building, or premises affected.

If the statement that was attempted to be served by certified, pre-posted mail is returned within fourteen (14) days after the date of mailing showing that it was not delivered, or is not returned within fourteen (14) days of the date of mailing, then a second statement shall be sent via regular US mail, postage pre-paid. If payment of the statement is not made within thirty (30) days of the date of service of the first statement or the date of mailing of the second statement, then the matter constitutes a nuisance and the Chief Code Official is authorized to take the necessary action to cause the amount of the statement to be collected through any available legal process, including under ORC 715.261 and certification to the Montgomery or Greene County Auditor for collection the same as other taxes and assessments are collected.

	Personal Accountability for Organizational Conduct.

1.	In the name of the organization or in its behalf, the officer, agent, or employee engages in conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct, or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which the officer, agent, or employee has direct responsibility;

2.	The officer, agent, or employee has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
 


	When an officer, agent, or employee is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, the officer, agent, or employee is subject to the same penalty as if the officer, agent, or employee had acted in their own behalf.

SECTION 1328.07 ABATEMENT BY DEMOLITION

Upon failure of the owner to abate the nuisance within the time period outlined in the notice to abate, or such additional time period as may be granted by the Chief Code Official and review and concurrence by the Chief Code Official, the Chief Building Official, and the Planning and Development Director, the City shall be authorized, at any time thereafter, to enter upon such premises to abate the nuisance by demolition and removal of the nuisance structure.

If such a surplus does not remain to be turned over, the report shall so state.
 


SECTION 1328.08 ILLEGAL OCCUPANCY OF A PUBLIC NUISANCE

	No owner, or other person, shall occupy or let or permit to be occupied or let by another for occupancy any structure that has been declared by the Chief Code Official to be a public nuisance without first applying for and obtaining the written consent of the Chief Code Official. Consent shall be given when all violations of all applicable housing, building, and other health and safety codes of the City of Kettering and the State of Ohio have been corrected, when any injunctions obtained against use or occupancy have been dissolved, and when all parties have complied with all applicable requirements of Section 1328.03.5.

	In the event of a violation of Section 1328.08.1 by the owner, the cost of the relocation of tenants by the City shall be included as a cost of abating or lessening the severity of the public nuisance, and shall be recovered in the manner provided in Section 1328.05.2.

	Unauthorized Entry Upon Nuisance Premises.

	No owner or other person shall enter or be present in or on any building or premises that has been posted with a notice identifying the said building or premises to be a public nuisance without first obtaining authorization in writing from the Chief Code Official and having such written authorization on his/her person at the time.

	It shall be an affirmative defense to a violation of this section that the person was the owner, or was authorized by the owner, to be present on the said premises, and that one of the persons present had the required written authorization on his/her person at the time.

	The officers, agents, and employees of the city, state, or federal government or any political subdivision or of any public utility shall be exempt from the requirements of this section while in the course of their employment.

	Written authorization, as provided in this section, shall be issued by the Chief Code Official to any person who provides documentation which, on its face, indicates that such person is either an owner of the premises or is authorized by the owner to be present, or to any person who makes application and pays for any permit to do work on the premises.

	Written authorization, as provided in this section, shall not be issued in connection with any property which has been declared a public nuisance, unless all parties have complied with all applicable requirements of Section 1328.03.5.
 


	The issuance of an authorization provided herein shall not be construed to create a privilege, as that term is used in ORC Sections 2911.21 or 133.05, nor shall this section be deemed to have any effect whatsoever on the interpretations or application of those sections.

	Culpability.

	A violation of Sections 1328.03.3, 1328.03.4, and 1328.03.5 shall be construed to be a strict liability offense.

	A violation of Section 1328.08 shall be construed to be a strict liability offense as to all owners or persons responsible for the nuisance. Negligence, as defined in ORC 130.08, shall be the standard of culpability as to all other persons who violate Section 1328.08.

	Reputation. In any case in which it necessary to prove that a property is a public nuisance as defined in Section 1328.01, evidence as to the reputation of such place shall be admissible on the question of whether the property is or is not a public nuisance, and every owner and every person responsible for the premises shall be presumed to have knowledge of the reputation of the place.

SECTION 1328.09 NON-COMPLIANT BOARDED STRUCTURES

	Notice to Elect. The owner of a structure known to have been boarded for fourteen (14) days or more, whether boarded by the City or by the owner, shall receive from the Chief Code Official a notice to elect whether to rehabilitate, sell, or demolish the structure in order to bring the structure into compliance with current code. Service of notice to elect shall be as set forth in Section 1328.04. The owner shall have the right to appeal such notice to elect, pursuant to Section 1322.11. Within thirty (30) days of the issuance date of the aforesaid notice to elect, the owner of the structure shall submit to the Chief Code Official, in writing, their plan to meet the notice to elect order and a timetable for completing the proposed work. The Chief Code Official shall within five (5) working days examine the proposal and make a determination as to the reasonableness of the owner’s response.

1.	If the Chief Code Official determines the response is reasonable, and provided there is a timely start and adequate progress, a timetable of as long as one hundred and eighty (180) days after approval of the response may be allowed and further City enforcement shall be withheld as long as the property remains secure and the timetable is maintained. Extensions to the timetable may be approved for just cause;

2.	If the Chief Code Official determines the proposed timetable in the notice to elect is unreasonable, or that the proposal will not bring the property into compliance with the law, the Chief Code Official shall disapprove the proposal, state a written reason(s) therefor to the owner, and continue enforcement action as prescribed to
 


require the repair or demolition of the structure;

3.	If the owner submits a proposal to sell, the owner must demonstrate to the City that there will be full disclosure of the nuisance abatement issue as required in Section
1328.03.4. The owner must also work with the City to ensure that the new owner enters into a compliance agreement with the City, which shall outline a time frame for completion of the work and shall become effective twenty-four (24) hours after closing on transfer of the property.

	Finding Upon Failure to Comply. It is hereby found that structures whose owners have not responded to a notice to elect within thirty (30) days of issuance of such notice are public nuisances. This finding reflects the blighting influence of such structure(s) due to their accelerated decay and the tendency to become a harborage for rodents and vermin, as well as, an attractive nuisance for vandals. Thus, the City shall have the right to pursue abatement options which shall include demolition pursuant to Section 1328.07.

SECTION 1328.10 TALL GRASS/WEEDS

	Nuisance Determination. Whenever there is reasonable basis to believe that a public nuisance, as defined in Section 1328.01, exists, the Chief Code Official, or their designee, shall inspect or cause the inspection of the property or premises upon which the public nuisance is believed to exist. All findings and recommendations with respect to the existence of the public nuisance shall be documented photographically and in writing and such documentation shall be filed with the Chief Code Official.

	Notice to Abate. When the Chief Code Official determines a nuisance exists under Section 1328.01.1.12, involving grass and/or weeds, the Chief Code Official, or their designee, shall send or deliver written notice to abate such public nuisance to the owner and/or occupant by regular, U.S., first-class mail, postage prepaid, plus posting such notice in a conspicuous place in or about the premises or property.

Notice shall be in the form as prescribed in Section 1322.07.2.

	Removal of Tall Grass and Weeds.  The owner, tenant, or user of the property, or other responsible person to whom a notice to abate has been served, shall, within five (5) days of the date of service of such notice, cut and remove such vegetation causing the nuisance.

	Abatement. Failure to abate the public nuisance within the time frame provided for in the notice to abate shall cause the City to abate the nuisance at the expense of the owner pursuant to Section 1328.05.

	Any monies arising from the disposal of a Junk Motor Vehicle in excess of the expenses resulting from the removal of the vehicle shall be credited to the general fund of the City of Kettering. The City assumes no liability for towing costs not covered by the sale of such vehicle.

	Collector's Vehicles.  No person shall be prevented from storing or keeping, or restricted in the method of storing or keeping, any collector's vehicle on private property with the permission of the person having the right to the possession of the property, except that a person having such permission shall be required to conceal, by means of an enclosed building, garage, or other suitable enclosure, any unlicensed collector's vehicle.

 1701	STORM WATER RUNOFF CODE	1701



	Cut and Fill Slopes

Cut and fill slopes shall be designed, constructed and stabilized in a manner which will minimize erosion.  Consideration shall be given to the length and steepness of the slope, the soil type, upslope drainage area, groundwater conditions and other applicable factors. If after final grading excessive erosion takes place, additional slope stabilizing measures shall be taken until erosion is stopped. The following guidelines shall be followed:

A.	Roughened soil surfaces shall be used in lieu of smooth surfaces on slopes.

B.	Diversions shall be constructed at the top oflong steep slopes which have significant drainage areas above the slope. Diversions or terraces may also be used to reduce slope length.

C.	Concentrated storm water shall not be allowed to flow down cut or fill slopes unless contained within an adequate channel, flume, or slope drain structure.

D.	Wherever a slope face crosses a water seepage plane which endangers the stability of the slope, adequate drainage or other protection shall be provided.

	Protection of Adjacent Properties/Public Right-Of-Ways

Properties, public right-of-ways, and streets adjacent to a Development Area or land­ disturbance shall be protected from sediment deposition.  This shall be accomplished by preserving a well-vegetated buffer at the perimeter of the site, by installing perimeter controls such as sediment barriers, filters, dikes, sediment basins, or by a combination of such measures.

	Structural Controls

A.	Stru9tural controls shall be used to control erosion and trap sediment on a development area remaining disturbed for more than 14 days.  Such structures may include, but are not limited to, silt fences, storm drain inlet protection, sediment basins and diversions or channels that direct runoff to a sediment basin.  All structural controls shall be capable of ponding runoff in order to be considered functional.

B.		Structural controls shall be constructed as a first step in grading and be made functional before upslope land-disturbing activities take place. Earthen structures such as dams, dikes, and diversions shall be seeded and mulched as soon as the installation is complete. Sediment control stru tures shall be functional throughout the course ofland-disturbance and until the site is stabilized with permanent vegetation.
 




C.	Sheet flow runoff from the development area shall be intercepted by silt fences or diversions.  Silt fences shall be placed on a level contour and shall be capable of temporarily ponding runoff. The relationship between the maximum drainage area to silt fence for a particular slope range is shown in Table 3 below.

TIP
Accessory Uses must be secondary
to the Principal Use of
the lot. In order to be considered
secondary, the accessory
use must be smaller than the
Principal Use in terms of area.
Accessory Uses cannot exceed
80% of the area of the Principal
Use.
Example
A home is 1,500 sq ft in area.
The homeowner wishes to add
a detached pool house. The
maximum area of the pool
house is determined by the following
calculation:
1,500 sq ft X 80% = 1,200 sq ft.

of the Front Yard and Street Side Yard setbacks.
In some cases, where the angle formed by intersecting Front Yard and Street Side Yard setback
lines is significantly greater than or less than 90 degrees, strict adherence with the above may
cause extraordinary challenges in building design and conventional construction. Thus, if the
angle formed by the intersecting Front Yard and Street Side Yard setback lines is significantly
greater than or less than 90 degrees, the Zoning Administrator may approve of an alternate building
location provided that the following conditions are met:
A. The building shall occupy at least one of the lot frontages present upon the lot and such façade
located along the length of this frontage must comply fully; and
B. The location of the building significantly accomplishes the goals of Section1141.01.1, Purpose
and Intent.

CHAPTER 1143 SITE & ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS
1143.01 GENERAL
Standards are provided to ensure that lots have adequate access to rights-of-way, light and fresh
air, protection from potential safety hazards, loud noises, glaring lights, and other environmental
disturbances.
1143.02 RELATIONSHIP TO ADOPTED PLANS & POLICIES
Sites shall conform to the Zoning Code, the Comprehensive Plan, or any other plans as adopted
by City Council.
1143.03 STRUCTURES ON LOTS
1143.03.1 B uildings to be on a Lot
Every building shall be located on a lot.
1143.03.2 L andominiums
Landominiums shall be subject to the following standards:
A. The maximum number of dwelling units in a landominium shall be equal to the number of
lots or dwelling units that would be allowed if the entire development were to be subdivided
and developed as standard lots as specified within Table 35.1 - Minimum Dimensions, Section
1135.01.1.
B. Setbacks and bufferyards shall be measured from the outermost boundaries of the development
rather than upon each individual landominium lot.
1143.04 CORNER LOTS
1143.04.1 F ront Yards for Corner Lots
For corner lots, the yard having the shortest street frontage is considered the front yard. The Zoning
Administrator may waive this requirement and determine the front yard to be along an alternate
street frontage provided the alternate front yard configuration is consistent with the prevailing pattern
of front yards along the same street, or the alternate front yard configuration is consistent with
the orientation of the Principal Facade or the front entry of an existing building on the lot.

CHAPTER 1143 PAGE 2
CHAPTER 1143 SITE & ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS
1143.05 ACCESS & DRIVEWAYS
1143.05.1 P urpose & Intent
These driveway standards deal primarily with the frequency of driveways and the amount of interference
to through traffic on the street from vehicles using these driveways. The overall objective
of these standards is to minimize the number of driveways and these standards shall be interpreted
to that end whenever possible.
Driveways located in proximity to a major intersection have an especially adverse influence on
intersection movements due to left-turn maneuvers, both in and out of the driveways. The farther
from an intersection a driveway can be located, the less it will adversely affect the safe operation
of the intersection. In addition, the location of driveways, and intersecting residential streets must
be considered when locating a proposed driveway.
1143.05.2 Applicability
This section applies to all Driveways. A lot that is a part of an approved plat, which does not
otherwise limit access, that was approved by the City of Kettering and filed for record as of the effective
date of this Section, and that does not have sufficient frontage to meet the access spacing
requirements in this Section, is allowed one Access Drive or Driveway approach.
1143.05.3 Access - Non-Residential, Multi-Unit, or Mixed Use Developments
Non-residential, Multi-Unit Residential, or mixed use development lots are permitted vehicular
access from a thoroughfare, arterial, or collector street provided that the total number of access
drives do not exceed one for every 200’ of street frontage upon such street.
1143.05.4 D rivewa ys
Driveways and other hardscape surfaces shall not comprise more than the percentage of the front
yard area specified in Table 43.1 - Driveway Width & Coverage Restrictions, Section 1143.05.5
for the Zoning Districts designated of the same table. Driveways shall not exceed the width established
as a percentage of lot frontage specified in Table 43.1. Parking may be provided in
the rear yard, and access may be provided through alleys where the front yard is insufficient to
accommodate a driveway.
For residential properties with front yards less than 50’ in depth, Driveways shall be non-circuitous
and shall align with their respective garage, carport, parking court, or parking space.
TIP
Driveways and Access Drives
are not necessarily the same.
“Driveway” is a term that is
generic and covers all types of
drives.
“Access Drives” is more specific
and refers only to driveways
that serve non-residential uses
and also multi-unit dwellings.

1143.05.6 Cross Access
All lots that elect to provide a cross access connection between adjoining parking lots to allow for
the flow of traffic from one parking lot to another without re-entering the public right-of-way must
provide an access drive that is at least 22’ feet in width and shall not slope greater than 15%.
The applicant may grant a common access easement across the lot or a recorded deed covenant
providing common access across the lot with the abutting lot or lots.
Additionally, all lots that elect to provide such cross access shall be entitled to a 20% reduction
in the number of required bufferyard plantings along the property line(s) that the cross access
traverses, and a waiver of the dead end parking standards found within Section 1145.05.1.D.
1143.05.7 L ocation of Drivewa ys
Driveways and Access Drives shall be located subject to the following conditions:
A. Driveways shall not conflict with vehicle turning movements.
B. Driveways shall align with opposing driveway approaches, if any are present. Locations
where there is a raised median separating said approaches shall be exempt from this provision.
C. Driveways shall align with the existing median opening, if any is present.
D. Driveways shall be separated in accordance with the standards listed in Table 43.2 - Driveway
Separation Standards, Section 1143.05.8.
E. Access drives shall maintain a minimum 5’ setback from any property line.
F. If the site is served by an alley or rear access drive, an access for motor vehicles must be
provided from such alley or rear access drive.

1143.05.10 D rivewa y Throat or Vehicle Storage Length
For purposes of this Section, “throat length” means the length extending from the entry into the site
to the first left turn conflict or intersection with an aisle. “Vehicle storage length” means the length
of a driveway, access drive or aisle, service lane, bay, or other passageway for motor vehicles
that is designed to minimize queuing onto surrounding streets. Throat length shall be designed
in accordance with the anticipated storage length for entering and exiting vehicles to prevent
vehicles from backing into the flow of traffic on the public street or causing unsafe conflicts with
on-site circulation. Throat length and vehicle storage length shall conform to Table 43.3 - Minimum
Driveway Throat Lengths, Section 1143.05.11 unless approved by the Zoning Administrator. These
measures apply to the principal access drives of the property and not to driveways where access
is restricted to one driving lane or to loading or service entries.
When utilized, Slip Streets shall count toward meeting the minimum throat length requirements.

2. Illuminance: All lighting installations shall be designed to achieve no greater than the minimal
illuminance levels for the activities provided by the most recent edition of the IESNA
Lighting Handbook.
3. Light Trespass: The installation shall also limit light trespass (off the parcel containing the
sports facility) to the maximum extent possible consistent with the illumination constraints
of the design. For Class III and IV levels, a design goal of 5 lux (0.5 fc) at any location on
any non-residential property, and 1 lux (0.1 fc) at any location on any residential property,
as measurable from any orientation of the measuring device, shall be sought. For Class
I and II levels, a design goal of 7.5 lux (0.75 fc) at any location on any non-residential
property, and 1.5 lux (0.15 fc) at any location on any residential property, as measurable
from any orientation of the measuring device, shall be sought.
4. Certification: Every such lighting system design and installation shall be certified by a
registered engineer as conforming to all applicable restrictions of this Code.
5. Other Lighting: All lighting not directly associated with the special use listed within this
Section shall conform to the lighting standards described in this Code, including but not
limited to the shielding requirements of Section 1143.07.9 and the requirements of Section
1143.07.11. The measurement area for the determination of compliance with Section

CHAPTER 1145 PARKING & LOADING
1145.01 PURPOSE & INTENT
This section sets minimum standards for off-street requirements for new construction and expansion
of or changes to existing uses. The intent of these parking and loading regulations is to:
A. Encourage a balance between the need for parking and the desire for a compact, pedestrian
friendly pattern of development;
B. Ensure that uses have a minimum level of off-street parking to avoid congestion on surrounding
streets while avoiding excessive parking, discouraging pedestrian access, driving up the
cost of development, and inviting excessive levels of traffic congestion, which creates increases
in flooding and non-point source pollution;
C. Maintain and enhance a safe and efficient transportation system that is consistent with environmental
goals and clean air;
D. Allow flexibility in addressing parking, loading, and access issues;
E. Utilize on-street and slip street parking in some locations in order to provide a buffer between
pedestrians and vehicular traffic.
1145.02 GENERAL
A. Every use shall be provided with adequate parking and loading to accommodate the vehicles
and bicycles of residents, employees, visitors or customers of a use.
B. Every use that requires the receipt or distribution of materials or merchandise by delivery
vehicles, shall be provided with Loading Spaces or berths as required in this Section.
C. The Zoning Administrator shall determine the minimum number of parking spaces required for
uses of the Civic or Industrial Use Groups, and for uses not found within a specific Use Group.
The Zoning Administrator shall determine the minimum number of parking and loading spaces
required based upon the following factors:
1. Type of use or uses;
2. Number of employees;
3. Designed occupancy load and maximum occupancy;
4. Square footage of building and uses;
5. Parking spaces proposed on site;
6. Parking spaces provided elsewhere;
7. Hours of operation.
CHAPTER 1145 PAGE 1
CHAPTER 1145 PARKING & LOADING
CITY OF KETTERING ZONING CODE
CHAPTER 1145 PAGE 2
D. All parking lots and driveways shall be maintained according to the approved Site Plan on file
with the Zoning Administrator. Parking and loading shall only take place within the designated
spaces shown upon said Site Plan. All interior portions of the lot must be appropriately striped
for circulation and for designation of all parking and loading spaces, in accordance with the
approved site plan on file with the Zoning Administrator. If no approved Site Plan is on file then
the existing Site shall serve as the approved plan, unless such Site is nonconforming with this
Chapter in which case a new Site Plan shall be submitted for approval and construction.
E. All vehicles shall be parked on an approved hard surface as described in Section 1145.14,
Materials, except for emergency vehicles as defined in Section 1159.02, Definitions.
F. No vehicle shall be allowed to remain on a driveway within the public right of way, except for
emergency vehicles as defined in Section 1159.02, Definitions.
G. All vehicles parked or stored on private property other than in completely enclosed buildings
shall be in operable condition and be validly licensed and registered. For purposes of this
Section a vehicle shall be deemed inoperable when any of the following conditions exist:
1. One or more tires or wheels are missing;
2. One or more tires are flat;
3. One or more windows are broken or missing; or
4. Parts necessary for the operation of the vehicle are missing, or the vehicle is not capable
of being driven under it’s own power from the location in question.
H. No vehicle repair work or service of any kind, except emergency repairs, shall be permitted in
or in association with any parking lot or driveway, except that off-street parking spaces accessory
to a residential use may be used for minor repairs of vehicles owned by the occupant(s)
of such residental use.
I. No vehicle shall be stored or parked in any parking lot or driveway for the purpose of warehousing
or distributing goods, except for temporary sales pursuant to the regulations found in
Section 1139.04.11, Temporary Uses.
1145.03 REQUIRED SPACES
1145.03.1 M inimum Parking Spaces Required
A. Table 45.1 - Parking Ratios, Section 1145.03.2 establishes the minimum number of parking
spaces required for the use groups or specific uses indicated.
B. The minimum number of required parking spaces shall be calculated by adding the total number
of minimum spaces required by each separate use group or specific use as determined by
Table 45.1 - Parking Ratios, Section 1145.03.2, and dividing the total by the appropriate factor
from Table 45.2 - Sharing Factor Matrix, Section 1145.03.3. When three or more uses share
parking, the lowest factor shall be used so that an adequate amount of parking is assured.
TIP
Shared parking solutions
are encouraged. Required
minimums can be reduced
significantly by a sharing factor
determined by Table 45.2 -
Sharing Factor Matrix, Section
1145.03.3.
CHAPTER 1145 PARKING & LOADING
CITY OF KETTERING ZONING CODE CHAPTER 1145 PARKING & LOADING
CHAPTER 1145 PAGE 3
C. When determination of the number of parking spaces required by this Section results in a
requirement of a fractional space, any fraction shall be counted as 1 parking space.
D. Up to a 15% reduction from the minimum required number of spaces may be approved by
the Zoning Administrator. Requests greater than 15% require justification in the form of a
parking study commissioned and paid for by the applicant and requires Planning Commission
approval. See also Section 1145.11, Parking Studies.
E. Required parking spaces shall be accounted for with one, or a combination of, the parking
type(s) established in Section 1145.03.4, Parking Types.
F. Residential driveways may be utilized as parking spaces to fulfill the number of minimum
spaces required for single and two unit residential uses.
G. Parking lot layout dimensions, as well as other relevant standards to general parking lot design
may be found within Table 45.5 - Required Parking Lot Dimensions, Section 1145.15.4

1147.01 PURPOSE & INTENT
These landscaping, street tree, screening, and buffer requirements are designed to:
A. Protect the health, safety, and general welfare of the public;
B. Enhance property values;
C. Improve the appearance of the community through preservation of natural resources, trees,
and native plants;
D. Maintain the ecological balance of the area; and
E. These minimum requirements will:
1. Safeguard and enhance property values;
2. Protect public and private investment;
3. Encourage preservation of existing trees and other significant vegetation;
4. Encourage proper selection, installation, and maintenance of plant materials that result in
the conservation of natural resources, including water;
5. Reduce the negative environmental effects of development while protecting and enhancing
the value of developed properties and the surrounding area;
6. Reduce soil erosion and increase infiltration in permeable land areas essential to stormwater
management and aquifer recharge;
7. Mitigate air, dust, noise, heat, chemical pollution, glare, and other adverse environmental
effects of development;
8. Reduce the “heat-island” effect of impervious surfaces, such as parking lots, by cooling
and shading the surface area, and breaking up large expanses of pavement;
9. Establish a landscape theme, including street trees and streetscape designs, to be used
throughout the City of Kettering to promote the overall character and identity of the community;
10. Address the design of entryways into the City of Kettering to express the community’s
values;
11. Preserve existing native vegetation as an integral part of the wildlife habitats, and incorporate
native plants and ecosystems into landscape design;
12. Promote innovative and cost-conscious approaches to the design, installation, and maintenance
of landscaping while encouraging xeriscape planting techniques and water and
energy conservation;

meet the requirements for a Type A Bufferyard unless the abutting vacant parcel is zoned
RE(a), RE(b), R-1, or R-2 in which case the vacant parcel shall be treated as if it were
developed for a single unit residential use and the parcel to be developed shall provide the
bufferyard that Table 47.2 - Bufferyard Descriptions & Requirements, Section 1147.03.5
requires next to a single unit residential use. If the adjoining vacant property is zoned R-3
or R-4, then the vacant parcel shall be treated as if it were developed for multi-unit uses.
B. Excess Bufferyards
1. If a property has bufferyards in excess of what is required, a property owner may do the
following:
a. The existing use may reduce its excess buffer by transferring part or all of the excess
buffer to the adjoining landowner to serve as its buffer or by entering into an
agreement with the adjoining landowner for use as same. Such agreement must be
approved by the City of Kettering prior to its execution to ensure that it meets the
requirements of the Code. This agreement shall be recorded as a restrictive covenant
enforceable by the City of Kettering.

1. When a land use is proposed adjoining vacant land, and the owner of that vacant land
CITY OF KETTERING ZONING CODE
CHAPTER 1147 PAGE 8
enters into a contractual relationship with the owner of the land that is to be developed
first, a reduced buffer may be provided by that first use, provided that:
a. The contract contains a statement by the owner of the vacant land of an intent to
develop at no greater than a specified use intensity class;
b. An agreement by that vacant landowner to assume all responsibility for additional buffer,
if needed by the subsequent development of a different use than had been agreed
upon;
c. Such agreement must be approved by the City of Kettering prior to its execution to
ensure that it meets the requirements of the Code. This agreement shall be recorded
as a restrictive covenant enforceable by the City of Kettering.
D. Ownership of Bufferyards
1. Bufferyards may remain in the ownership of the original developer (and assigns) of a land
use, or they may be subjected to deed restrictions and subsequently be freely conveyed,
or they may be transferred to any consenting grantees, such as adjoining landowners, a
park or forest preserve district, the City of Kettering, or an open space or conservation
group, provided that any such conveyance guarantees the protection of the bufferyards
for the purposes of this ordinance by means of restrictive covenants enforceable by the
City of Kettering.
1147.03.9 Substitution of Bufferyard Standards
The Zoning Administrator may permit a waiver of Section 1147.03, Bufferyards subject to the following
conditions:
A. An applicant can show that the standard will cause a practical difficulty in accordance with the
standards found within Section 1153.13.6.A; and
B. That an alternative bufferyard be provided that will provide a comparable level of protection
imposed by the original standard or condition.

CHAPTER 1147 PAGE 9
Where no existing or proposed overhead utility lines exist, street trees shall be Canopy Trees.
If existing or proposed overhead utility lines exist along the right-of-way that are greater than
35’ in height, then the trees shall be Group A Trees. If existing or proposed overhead utility
lines exist along the right-of-way that are lower than 35’ in height, then the trees shall be Group
B Trees.
B. Location
The street trees shall be planted according to the following standards and in the following
order of priority:
1. First, within a minimum 5’ wide landscaped planting strip located upon the subject property.
If setbacks or existing structures prevent planting in this manner then proceed to the
next priority;
2. Second, within the tree lawn a minimum of 4’ from the back of the curb. If no such tree
lawn exists then proceed to the next priority;
3. Third, within a tree grate or raised planter a minimum of 4’ from the back of the curb.
C. Spacing
1. Canopy trees shall be planted at a minimum ratio of one for every 50’.
2. Group A trees shall be planted at a minimum ratio of one for every 40’.
3. Group B trees shall be planted at a minimum ratio of one for every 30’.
4. The spacing requirements are measured as an average of the street frontage along the particular
street. In no instance shall the distance between street trees exceed 100’ on center.
Street trees shall be planted in an even, linear spacing. If shifts to the linear spacing not exceeding
15’ are required due to the location of existing infrastructure, development, or required
sight distance, these shifts may be approved by the Zoning Administrator.
D. Type
The species shall be drought and salt tolerant and shall provide shade and shelter as determined
by the Zoning Administrator. A list of acceptable trees is on file with the Zoning Administrator.
See also Section 1147.06, Parking Lot Landscaping
1147.04.3 E xisting Trees

CITY OF KETTERING ZONING CODE
CHAPTER 1149 ARCHITECTURE
1149.01 GENERAL
1149 .01.1 P urpose & Intent
The purpose of this Section is to regulate the architectural design of all development within the
City of Kettering. Massive, franchise-style, generic, or cookie-cutter developments that do not
contribute to, nor integrate with, the community in a positive manner can be detrimental to the
community’s image and sense of place and can contribute to the loss of community identity. The
goal of this Section is to create and maintain a strong community image by providing for architectural
design standards that will enhance the visual appearance and function of development within
the City of Kettering.
All buildings and structures must be designed to maintain and enhance the attractiveness of the
public streetscape and the existing architectural design of the community. Buildings and structures
shall have architectural features and patterns that reflect human scale and proportion and recognize
neighborhood character. Facades must be designed to provide visual interest through the
use of detail and scale that is consistent with the surrounding community’s identity and character.
1149.01.2 Applicability
For purposes of this Chapter no Structure, including any additions, shall be erected, converted,
enlarged, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered within the The City of Kettering except in
conformance with these standards.
1149.01.3 P roper Use of Design, Elements & Features
All elevation drawings shall be designed with proper proportion, scale, consistent application of
details and architectural elements, such as doors, windows, trim, columns, roof details and materials,
and with a discernible and consistent architectural style.
1149.01.4 Alternative Compliance
The Planning Commission may approve of a design plan that varies from the standards set forth in
this Chapter in order to accommodate unique site features or to provide a more innovative design,
provided that the alternative plan generally and satisfactorily fulfills the purpose and intent of this
Chapter, or complies to the maximum extent practicable considering either the configuration of
the development that existed prior to the effective date of this Code, or the unique constraints
imposed by the Site.
Requests for Alternative Compliance are subject to Planning Commission approval, shall require a
public hearing, and shall require notification by mail and publication in accordance with the procedures
for mail and publication notification prescribed in Section 1153.04, Notification.

CITY OF KETTERING ZONING CODE
1149.01.5 C onsistency of Style
The secondary facades of each building or structure shall be consistent with the principal facade
subject to the following conditions:
A. The Secondary Facades of each building or structure shall be consistent with the Principal
Facade in terms of architectural style, detailing and trim, exterior finish, and colors used. For
example, if the dominant exterior finish of the Principal Facade is brick with beige and white
trim, the Secondary Facades of the building or structure shall include a similar brick finish,
beige paint, and white trim.
B. Within multi-tenant strip centers, the Facades of individual tenant spaces may take on an
individual style, but must relate to their adjacent neighbors and the character of the overall
development.
C. Within multi-building developments, such as institutional campuses, buildings need not be
identical, but rather shall complement each other and shall be designed with a similar palette
of materials, colors, and architectural features.
D. Residential structures consisting of 3 units or less shall be exempt from these Consistency of
Style standards.

1149.01.6 R ooftop Screening
All mechanical, electronic, and communication equipment mounted upon a roof shall be properly
screened and shall be subject to the following conditions:
A. All such equipment shall be screened to an opacity of 100% through the use of the following:
1. All such equipment placed atop flat roof structures shall be screened by means of a parapet
wall extending along the perimeter of the outside walls or by means of a raised parapet
wall enclosing the items to be screened. Such parapet walls shall be a minimum of 12” in
height or equal in height to the items or area to be screened, whichever is greater. Non
perimeter parapet walls shall be finished consistent with the requirements for a Secondary
Facade and shall provide a continuous three dimensional Cap along its entire length.
2. Rooftop mounted mechanical equipment placed atop peaked roof structures shall be concealed
using a continuous masonry parapet wall of at least 12” in height or equal in height
to the items or area to be screened, whichever is greater. Said parapet shall be finished
consistent with the requirements for a Secondary Facade and shall provide a continuous
three dimensional Cap along its entire length.
B. Residential structures consisting of 3 units or less shall be exempt from these Rooftop Screening
standards.
1149.01.7 E lements Prohibited
The following elements shall not be utilized on any Principal or Secondary Facade:
A. Fluorescent colors, camouflage;
B. Neon, fluorescing, LED, or other similar unshielded light emitters applied so as to accent the
architectural features of a building or structure;
C. Embossed EIFS fashioned to appear as brick or stone utilized on any ground floor elevation.
Such materials may only be utilized at 8’ above grade or above the ground floor elevation,
whichever is higher;
D. Using the Hue, Saturation, and Brightness representation model for color, a principal exterior
paint or treatment color that:
1. For any given Hue with a Saturation greater than 50%, the Brightness is greater than 50%;
2. For any given Hue with a Saturation greater than 30% but less than or equal to 50%, the
Brightness is greater than 80%.
The use of black as the principal exterior color upon commercial structures, and also any
uncoated natural material (ex. dark red brick, wood siding, black slate) shall be exempt from
this requirement.
This shall serve to keep exterior colors from becoming visually obnoxious and aesthetically
unappealing, thus having a negative impact upon adjacent properties.
Tip
Hue, along with saturation and
brightness make up the three
distinct attributes of color. The
terms “red” and “blue” are primarily
describing hue.
Saturation refers to a color’s
richness. A good way to imagine
this is to think of saturation
as pure color pigment added to
a can of gray paint. The more
pigment added, the richer or
more intense the color.
Brightness deals with a color’s
ability to reflect light. We percieve
this as the amount of
white or black present in a color.
An example: Pink would be a
very bright color, red less so,
and maroon even less. Maroon
would have a very low brightness
value.

1149.03.7 Exterior Finishes
A. Purpose & Intent
The City finds it necessary to regulate the exterior finish and appearance of all primary and accessory
buildings and structures that are erected in the City in order to insure the consistency in quality,
compatibility, and character of buildings within comparable districts. The regulation of exterior
materials and building construction assures consistent provision of both a high level of structural
durability relative to impacts from natural and man-made forces over time and a safe environment
for those occupants, equipment, and goods within the structure. The provision of a quality exterior
finish compliments the building construction by reducing maintenance needs, providing a surface
more resistant to damage, assisting in maintaining structure and property value over a longer
period, contributing substantially to the compatibility and character of its neighborhood. A quality
exterior finish also provides for improved health, safety, and welfare of occupants and enclosed
goods or equipment by providing increased protection through durability, strength, security, damage
resistance, and stability.
B. Applicability
The permitted exterior finish materials for each Development Pattern District shall be as shown
in Table 49.2 - Permitted Exterior Finish Materials by Development Pattern District, Section
1149.03.7.C Additional requirements for individual finish materials are listed following the table.
Expression Line
This figure depicts an Expression Line that runs the entire length of the Principal Facade and separates the ground floor elevation from the half story above. The Expression
Line is composed of two lighter colored soldier courses separated by several running courses of brick veneer. This configuration produces a three line effect.
The Expression Line is visually contrasting in color and orientation of the materials used and is in compliance with the Expression Line requirements.

1151.06 MEASUREMENT STANDARDS
1151.06.1 M easurement Standards
A. The area of a sign shall be measured as follows:
1. The area of the surface, or surfaces of any opaque or translucent panels used or intended
for displaying a message;
2. For a sign comprised of individual letters, figures, or elements on a wall or similar surface,
or an irregularly shaped freestanding sign, the area of a sign shall encompass a regular, or
a combination of not more than 6 rectangles that form, or approximate, the perimeter of all
the elements in the display. When separate elements are organized to form a single sign
but the elements are separated by open space, the area shall be calculated by determining
the geometric form or combination of forms that comprise all the display area including
the space between elements; and
3. The area of the surface of any opaque panel used or intended for displaying a permanent
message that is affixed to windows or doors.
B. The supporting structure or bracing of a sign shall not be counted as a part of sign area, unless
such structure or bracing is made a part of the sign’s message by including a symbol, logo, or
other three–dimensional figure, in which case a combination of regular geometric shapes that
can encompass the area of said symbol or figure shall be included as part of the total sign area
calculations.
C. Where a sign has two display faces that measure 24” or less back to back, only the area of
one face of the sign shall be considered for purposes of measuring total sign area.
D. Where a sign has two or more sign faces that are either more than 24” back to back, or that
form another geometric shape, such as a globe, pyramid, cube, or cylinder, the area of all
portions of the sign face that can be viewed by the public shall be considered for purposes of
measuring sign area.
CITY OF KETTERING ZONING CODE
E. The height of a sign shall be measured as follows:
1. The height of a freestanding sign shall be determined by measuring the vertical distance
between the top part of a sign or its structure, whichever is highest, to the elevation of the
ground directly beneath the sign.
In cases where signs are to be located on man–made berms, hills, or other similar ground
formations, with sides steeper than one foot of rise to four feet of horizontal run, the Zoning
Administrator shall utilize the elevation of the street curb nearest to the location of the
sign for determining sign height. In the case of a private or public street without curbing
the edge of pavement nearest to the sign location shall be utilized to determine sign
height.
2. Any material whose major function is providing structural support for a sign shall be considered
part of the sign for purposes of determining sign height.

CITY OF KETTERING ZONING CODE
CHAPTER 1153 PROCEDURES & ENFORCEMENT
1153.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT
The purpose of this chapter is to consolidate the procedures for filing and processing applications
for zoning approval. The format is designed to allow users to efficiently determine the various steps
involved in obtaining zoning approval — from the initiation and filing of an application, the administrative
completeness review, the review for compliance with substantive standards, on through to
the public hearing process, if needed.
The provisions of this chapter are designed to implement the requirements of the Zoning Code.
This Chapter also specifies the requirements for amendments, variances, appeals, and interpretations
of this Zoning Code.
1153.02 ZONING APPROVALS
1153.02.1 G eneral Descriptions
There are five types of zoning approvals. The five types of zoning approvals are listed along with
a general description of each type in the following table:
A. Use Approvals
B. Development Approvals
C. Temporary Approvals
D. Conditional Use Approvals
Use approvals are the most basic of zoning approvals. A
use approval is necessary to verify if a proposed use is
permitted. Use approval is necessary in order to secure a
Zoning Certificate.
This type of approval allows for the construction or alteration
of structures or for the disturbance of land. Development
approval is necessary in order to secure a Zoning Permit.
This type of approval allows for the temporary use of a
property or structure.
Temporary approval is necessary in order to secure a Temporary
Zoning Permit.
Conditional Use approvals allow for the use of property
once a certain set of conditions have been met. These
uses span a large range of uses with similarly ranging
impacts that must be carefully measured and calibrated
through the use of design and contextually sensitive site
planning. Conditional approvals require a public hearing.

CHAPTER 1153 PROCEDURES AND ENFORCEMENT
1153.02.2 Approvals Required
A. No development, development activity, or use of property is permitted unless all zoning approvals
applicable to the proposed development are issued in accordance with this chapter.
Zoning approvals are required for all development, unless otherwise excepted, to ensure compliance
with the various adopted codes, standards, and laws, and to ensure consistency with
the comprehensive plan and policies of the City.
B. Zoning approval is required prior to the issuance of any zoning permit or certificate.
1153.02.3 Table 53.1 - Zoning Approvals - Summary Table
The following table offers a summary of the requirements for obtaining zoning approvals. The various
types of zoning approvals are listed with their corresponding approval process, public hearing
requirements, zoning permit and certificate requirements, and the responsible decision maker.
Additional requirements and processes are found within this Chapter.
1153.02.4 G eneral Procedure for Applications
The specific procedures followed in reviewing various applications for zoning approval differ. Reference
shall be made to the appropriate section in this chapter which addresses the procedures
and requirements of a particular application. Generally, the procedures for all applications have
five common elements:
1) Submittal of a complete application, including required fee payments and appropriate information
and studies;
2) Review of the submittal by appropriate staff, agencies, and boards;

actions authorized and the time period for exercising rights;
4) If necessary, amending or appealing the decision; and
5) Recording the decision.
1153.02.5 D escription of Procedural Elements For Approvals
This section describes procedural elements common to all applications. Also found within this
section are descriptions for processing certain types of applications. Each section relating to
procedure provides the following information:
A. Preapplication Procedures: This describes the procedure for discussions with appropriate
staff as to requirements for application submittal and compliance with the Zoning Code.
B. Application: This describes how the application for approval is filed.
C. Completeness Review: This describes the process for determining whether sufficient information
has been submitted in order to process an application, which includes the required
fee payment and appropriate information. A determination that an application is complete or
incomplete does not constitute a determination as to whether the application complies with the
standards for approval of the application.
D. Decision: This describes the procedures for review of the submittal by appropriate staff, agencies,
and boards, and for reaching a determination as to whether the application for development
approval is approved, denied, or approved with conditions.
E. Approval Criteria: This lists the criteria for approval of the particular application. These criteria
supplement and do not displace any other criteria required by this chapter for approval of the
application.
F. Subsequent Applications: This provides time periods for processing of renewal applications.
G. Scope of Approval: This indicates the rights that an applicant obtains from approval or conditional
approval of an application, what actions the development approval authorizes, and the
time period for exercising rights under the order or development approval.
1153.03 ZONING PERMITS & CERTIFICATES REQUIRED

property; that it can be constructed and operated in a manner that is compatible with the surrounding
land uses and overall character of the community; and that the public interest, health, safety,
and general welfare will be promoted.
No inherent right exists to receive a Conditional Use Approval. Mere compliance with the general
applicable requirements however may not be sufficient, and additional measures and conditions
may be necessary to mitigate the impact of the proposed development.

preapplication meeting is to discuss, in general, the procedures and substantive requirements for
the application.
1153.08.4 Application

5. The effect of the proposed amendment on the economic viability of existing developed
and vacant land within the City.
The Planning Commission shall not recommend the adoption of a proposed amendment unless
it finds that the adoption of such an amendment is in the public interest and not solely for
the interest of the applicant.
C. The Planning Commission may recommend that the application be granted as requested, or
it may recommend a modification of the amendment requested, or it may recommend that the
request be denied. These recommendations shall then be forwarded to City Council.
1153.12.7 R ole of City Council
After receipt of the final report of the planning commission, the City Council may approve, deny,
amend, or modify the zoning or pattern map or zoning text amendment. The City Council may
refer any such amendments or modifications to the Planning Commission for further review.
If the proposed amendment is inconsistent with the comprehensive plan, or any other approved
plan, an application for an amendment to the comprehensive plan, or approved plan shall be
submitted by the applicant. Amendments to the Official Zoning Map or the Official Development
Pattern Map and the comprehensive plan, or any other approved plan may be considered concurrently.
1153.12.8 Approval Criteria
In its review of an application for an amendment, the City Council shall consider the report and
recommendation of the Planning Commission and the criteria set forth in Sections 1153.12.9,
Consistency through 1153.12.15, Other Factors of this Chapter. No single factor is controlling;
instead, each must be weighed in relation to the other standards.
1153.12.9 C onsistency
The rezoning or reclassification shall be consistent with the adopted comprehensive plan and any
other approved plan.

CHAPTER 1153 PROCEDURES AND ENFORCEMENT
1153.12.10 Adverse Impacts on Neighboring Lands
The City Council shall consider the nature and degree of an adverse impact upon neighboring
lands. Lots shall not be rezoned in a way that is substantially inconsistent with the uses of the surrounding
area, whether more or less restrictive. Further, the City of Kettering finds and determines
that vast acreages of single-use zoning produces uniformity with adverse consequences, such as
traffic congestion, air pollution, and social alienation. Accordingly, rezonings may promote mixed
uses subject to a high degree of design control.
1153.12.11 Suitability as Presently Zoned
The City Council shall consider the suitability or unsuitability of the tract for its use as presently
zoned. This factor, like the others, must often be weighed in relation to the other standards, and
instances can exist in which the use for which land is zoned may be rezoned upon proof of a
real public need, substantially changed conditions in the neighborhood, or to effectuate important
goals, objectives, policies, and strategies of the comprehensive plan, specification, or Zoning
Code.
1153.12.12 H ealth, Safety, and Welfare
The amendatory ordinance must bear a substantial relationship to the public health, safety, morals,
or general welfare, or protect and preserve historical and cultural places and areas. The
amendatory ordinance may be justified, however, if a substantial public need or purpose exists,
and this is so even if the private owner of the tract will also benefit.
1153.12.13 P ublic Policy
Certain public policies in favor of the rezoning may be considered. Examples include a need for affordable
housing, economic development, mixed-use development, or sustainable environmental
features, which are consistent with neighborhood, area, or specific plans.
1153.12.14 Size of Tract
The City Council shall consider the size, shape, and characteristics of the tract in relation to the
affected neighboring lands. Amendatory ordinances shall not rezone a single lot when there have
been no intervening changes or other saving characteristics. Proof that a small tract is unsuitable
for use as zoned, or that there have been substantial changes in the immediate area, may justify
an amendatory ordinance.
1153.12.15 O ther Factors
The City Council may consider any other factors that it deems relevant to a rezoning application.

CHAPTER 1153 PROCEDURES & ENFORCEMENT
1153.12.16 Subsequent Applications
Applicability: The provisions of Sections 1153.12.17 and 1153.12.18, subsection do not apply to
any application for a rezoning that is initiated by the City of Kettering.
1153.12.17 Withdrawa l After Planning Commission Hearing
No rezoning application shall be received or filed with the Planning Commission if, during the
previous 6 months, an application was received or filed and withdrawn after a full, fair, complete,
and final hearing occurred on the rezoning before the Planning Commission. However, if the applicant
certifies with a sworn affidavit that the evidence is new, relevant, and substantial, and could
not have been secured at the time set for the original hearing, the Planning Commission may hear
and consider the application.
1153.12.18 D enial and Reapplication
No application for rezoning shall be received or filed with the Planning Commission within one year
after the City Council has denied an application for rezoning of the same property.
1153.12.19 Amendments
Any subsequent rezoning requires a new application and shall be processed as such.
1153.12.20 Scope of Approval
An amendment to the Zoning Code or a rezoning does not authorize the development of land. An
amendment authorizes the applicant to apply for development approval consisting of a development
approval, in the case of uses permitted as of right; a conditional use approval, in the case
of uses designated as conditional uses within the applicable zoning district; or to proceed with
subdivision plat approval. An amendment does not supersede any requirement or subdivision plat
approval by the Zoning Code.
1153.12.21 Interim Status
When the amendment involves changes to the existing zoning district boundaries, the form of the
amending ordinance shall contain a narrative description of the land to be reclassified or reference
to an accompanying plat of such land showing the new zoning classifications and indicating their
boundaries. The Zoning Administrator shall refer to the attested ordinance as a record of the current
zoning status until such time as the zoning map can be changed.
1153.12.22 C orrection of Typographical Errors and Mechanical Defects in Zoning Text
The correction of typographical errors in the zoning text shall not be deemed to constitute amendments
that require completion of the procedure set forth above in this Section 1153.12, Zoning
Map and Text Amendments.
Tip
An amendment that isn’t consistent
with the comprehensive
plan must be accompanied by
a complementary proposal to
amend the comprehensive plan
to make it consistent.

1153.13 VARIANCES
1153.13.1 Authority
The Board of Zoning Appeals shall review each request for a variance to determine if such request
complies with the purpose and intent of this Zoning Code and the applicant can demonstrate that
the strict application and literal enforcement of this Code will result in practical difficulty.
1153.13.2 Application
The applicant shall file a complete application with the Clerk of Council. An application is available
from the planning department.
1153.13.3 C ompleteness Review
The Clerk of Council shall conduct a completeness review as set forth in Section 1153.10, Completeness
Review.
1153.13.4 D ecision
When the Clerk of Council has certified that the application is complete, it shall be deemed received
and shall be referred to the Board of Zoning Appeals for its review and decision. The Board
of Zoning Appeals, after public notice in accordance with this Chapter, shall hold at least one public
hearing on the application.
1153.13.5 Approval
Following the public hearing, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall approve the variance request,
deny the variance request, recommend that the applicant modify and resubmit the request, or
approve the request with conditions.
1153.13.6 Approval Criteria
The Board shall review the application and the evidence presented and shall make written findings
of fact for each of the following factors in this Section. If a preponderance of the findings demonstrate
that a practical difficulty exists, then the Board may grant a variance to the Zoning Code.
However, variances shall not be granted that would permit the establishment of any use that is not
otherwise permitted in the district in which the real property is located.
A. The following factors shall be considered and weighed by the Board in determining practical
difficulty:
1. Whether special conditions and circumstances exist that are peculiar to the land or structure
involved and that are not applicable generally to other lands or structures in the same
Zoning District; examples of such special conditions or circumstances are: exceptional
irregularity, narrowness, shallowness of the lot, steepness of the lot, or adjacency to non-
TIP
The crux of any request for
a variance is the existence
of physical features that are
unique to a particular parcel or
lot that preclude an owner from
using their property in a manner
similar to other properties in the
same zoning district.
The idea is that the lot existed
with specific physical conditions
prior to the imposition of the
zoning requirements. The provisions
of the zoning code may
be appropriate for most lots
within the district but limit the
development of the affected lot
to the point of practical difficulty.
These physical conditions are
present in such a location or in
such quantity that the property
cannot be developed in compliance
with district standards.
The property owner is entitled to
reasonable use of their property.
The City is entitled to protection
of valued features such as,
required yards and open space,
and to development that complies
with local ordinances. The
variance may be the means to
balance these potentially conflicting
entitlements.
However, many variance requests
are not the result of such
purposes. Often, the property
owner wishes to achieve a particular
design and is unable to
do so because of some physical
aspect of the property. Alternate
designs are possible
but do not meet the property
owner’s preferences or may not
yield the best economic return.
It is inappropriate to grant such
variances.

conforming and inharmonious uses, structures, or conditions;
2. Whether the property in question will yield a reasonable return or whether there can be
any beneficial use of the property without the variance;
3. Whether the variance is substantial or is the minimum necessary to make possible the
reasonable use of the land or structures;
4. Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be substantially transformed
or whether adjoining properties would suffer substantial detriment as a result of the variance;
5. Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of governmental services such
as water, sewer, trash pickup;
6. Whether the property owner purchased the property with knowledge of the zoning restrictions;
7. Whether special conditions or circumstances exist as a result of actions of the owner;
8. Whether the property owner’s predicament feasibly can be obviated through some method
other than a variance;
9. Whether the spirit and intent behind the zoning requirement would be observed and substantial
justice done by granting a variance; and
10. Whether the granting of the variance requested will confer on the applicant any special
privilege that is denied by this regulation to other lands, structures, or buildings in the
same district.
1153.13.7 Conditions and Limitations
The Board of Zoning Appeals may further prescribe any conditions, stipulations, safeguards, and
limitations on the duration of the variance so authorized as the Board determines and prescribes.
Any permit issued by the Zoning Administrator as a result of a variance approval shall list such
conditions, stipulations, safeguards, and duration limit.
The Board may not extend the scope or extend the duration of a variance previously issued upon
its order. Any additional action so desired may be effected only upon application to the Zoning Administrator
for approval of a new variance in accordance with the provisions of this Zoning Code.
1153.13.8 Subsequent Applications
The Board of Zoning Appeals shall not be required to hear and act upon any application for a
variance that has been the subject of an application within the previous twelve 12 month period,
unless the application has been modified at the request of the Board of Appeals, or unless there
has been a substantial change in area conditions.

CHAPTER 1153 PROCEDURES AND ENFORCEMENT
1153.13.9 Scope of Approval
Once approval for a variance is granted by the Board, the applicant shall commence the installation,
construction, or alteration of the structure or item that is the subject of the application within
6 months of the approval date, and the applicant shall complete the installation, construction, or
alteration of the structure or item that is the subject of the application within 12 months of the approval
date.
Failure on the part of the applicant to complete the installation, alteration, or construction within
the allotted time shall terminate all rights under such approval. However, the Board may, for good
cause shown, extend from time to time the time limit but in no case more than a date 18 months
from the date of the original issuance of the variance, unless construction is actively underway
and substantial progress is evident. If any action is taken that is contrary to the terms of the variance
or contrary to conditions accompanying the variance, or if the conditions stipulated are not
properly maintained, the Board may revoke such variance. A variance granted pursuant to this
chapter shall “run with the land” and be valid for successors in interest unless otherwise specified
by the Board.

CHAPTER 1155 NONCONFORMITIES
1155.01 PURPOSE & INTENT
Within the City of Kettering there exist uses, sites, structures, lots, and signs that were lawfully
established before this Code was adopted or amended, that now do not conform to the requirements
of this Code. These situations are collectively referred to as nonconformities. The purpose

CHAPTER 1155 PAGE 2
CHAPTER 1155 NONCONFORMITIES
it remains otherwise lawful. For purposes of this Zoning Code, rental payments, lease payments,
tax payments, the payment of utilities or phone service, or the temporary use of a structure or
parcel shall not be considered as a continued use.
1155.02.4 Conditions
No nonconformity shall be enlarged, expanded, extended, modified, or altered unless such action
is in full compliance with all requirements of this Zoning Code. However, nothing in this section
shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoration to a safe condition of a structure in accordance
with an order of a public official who is charged with protecting the public safety and who
could declare such structure to require repair or restoration in accordance with applicable codes
or regulations regulating the safe condition of structures in the City of Kettering.
1155.02.5 Relocation
No nonconformity shall be moved in all or part for any distance, to any other location on the same
or on any other lot unless the entire structure and use shall then conform to the regulations of the
district in which it is located after being moved.
1155.02.6 Accessories
No use or structure that is accessory to a nonconforming principal use or structure shall continue
after such nonconforming principal use or structure ceases or terminates under the provisions of
this Zoning Code unless it shall conform to all regulations of this Zoning Code.
1155.02.7 Burden of Proof
In all proceedings, the person who claims the benefit of a nonconformity shall have the burden to
prove that they were lawfully existing on the effective date of this Zoning Code.
1155.02.8 Vested Rights
When a building permit or zoning permit was issued prior to the effective date of this Zoning Code
or any amendment that would make the use or improvement authorized by such permit nonconforming,
such use or improvement may be completed fully. However, once completed, such use
or improvement shall be considered nonconforming.
1155.03 NONCONFORMING USES
1155.03.1 Applicability
This section applies to the continuation, enlargement, or extension of a nonconforming use.
CITY OF KETTERING ZONING CODE
CHAPTER 1155 PAGE 3
CHAPTER 1155 NONCONFORMITIES
1155.03.2 C ontinuance
A nonconforming use may be continued unless it terminates as defined in Section 1155.03.5, Termination.
The right to continue the nonconforming use continues even though there is a change
of ownership or change of occupant or change of management where there is no change in the
operation of the nonconformity.
1155.03.3 E nlargement
A conforming structure in which a nonconforming use is operated shall not be enlarged or extended
except as required by law or ordinance. Such use may be extended throughout the structure,
provided that no structural alterations or additions to the structure take place except for those
made in conformance with the Zoning Code.
1155.03.4 C onditions
The right of nonconforming uses to continue is subject to such regulations as to the maintenance
of the premises and conditions of operation as may, in the judgment of the Board of Zoning Appeals,
be reasonably required to promote the public health, safety, and welfare of the neighborhood
in which the nonconformity exists through improvement of property values, avoidance of
blighting influences, reduction of traffic, lowering of noise, improvement of the maintenance to the
site or structure, or enhancement of services necessary by the occupants of nearby properties.
1155.03.5 T ermination
A nonconforming use shall terminate if it is abandoned for a period of 6 months or more or in the
event that any building or structure that is devoted in all or part to a nonconforming use is destroyed
by any means to an extent more than 50% of the county’s appraised value for the subject
property prior to the time of damage of such structure, exclusive of foundations. In the event the
nonconforming use is terminated by means of destruction of the structure as described in this
Section, the owner may either demolish the remainder of the structure and clear the lot or remodel
the structure for a use that does conform to the Zoning Code.
