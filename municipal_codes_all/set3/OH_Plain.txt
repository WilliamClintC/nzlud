Setting development back maintains the ability of riparian areas to control flooding, limit stream bank erosion, protect habitat, purify ground water, and reduce water pollution.                 
Riparian setbacks protect structures and reduce property damage and threats to watershed residents while contributing to the scenic beauty and semi-rural character of Plain Township. 
A. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS

SECTION 709  R-7 PLANNED MIXED-USE DEVELOPMENT   DISTRICT (PMUD) 
SECTION 709.1 PURPOSE 
This district is established to provide for progressive and innovative planning development. The Planned Mixed-Use Development District (PMUD) is designed to accommodate a mixture of low and medium density multi-family residential, large and small scale retail business, office, institutional, and civic uses. Residential and business/office uses may be mixed in the same building or structure. The use of larger tracts of land is encouraged but not required so long as the PMUD plan promotes the public welfare, health and safety as well as a greater opportunity of living and workplace environments, by permitting a variety of building types and a flexibility of their placement on the land.  This is a special district requiring the submission of a development plan at the time of the zoning amendment application, and development in accordance with such plan. 
 
The R-7 PMUD and its regulations are established in order to achieve the following purposes: 
A. To provide a flexible zoning management tool that responds to sites with unique physical, service, and functional constraints. 

B. To provide a flexible zoning management tool that meets the needs of integrated developments that may mix multi-family residential, large and small scale retail, office, institutional, civic, and open space uses in creative projects. 

C. A more efficient use of the land by permitting a variety of housing and business types 

D. To prevent or halt the deterioration of property and blighting conditions. 

E. Encourage the coordinated development of properties that might otherwise be developed individually, in a manner that may be a detriment to the surrounding neighborhoods and the community. 

F. An overall increase of density in conformance with a development plan that is compatible with surrounding land uses, transportation and community facilities. 

G. Encouragement of the preservation of natural topography and geologic features, scenic areas, trees and other vegetation, thereby creating a lesser amount of disruption to natural drainage patterns. 

H. Encouragement of a more walkable, pedestrian friendly atmosphere

A copy shall be forwarded to the property owner and filed in the office of the Zoning Director. 

I. Completion of Construction when Zoning Certificate issued prior to change of regulations - Nothing in this Resolution shall prohibit the completion of construction and use of a nonconforming building, structure or land for which a zoning certificate has been issued before the effective date of a change in the Zoning Resolution.  However, construction shall be commenced within ninety (90) days after the issuance of such certificate, and shall be carried on diligently and without interruption for a continuous period in excess of thirty (30) days, and the entire construction or use of the property shall be in operation within one (1) year after the issuance of said zoning certificate.

The cost of such report shall be at the expense of the applicant. 

B. Data Required with Application i. Form supplied by Board of Zoning Appeals completed by applicant. 




C. Review by the Board of Zoning Appeals - The Board of Zoning Appeals shall review the proposed development as presented on the submitted plans and specifications in terms of the standards established in this Resolution.

Any new application for a Conditional Zoning Certificate shall be accompanied by the filing fee. 

G. Termination - The Conditional Zoning Certificate shall become void at the expiration of one (1) year after date of issuance unless the structure, alteration, or land use has begun.

NONCONFORMING USES 
 
SECTION 1001  PURPOSE 
The purpose of this section is to provide for the continuation of the use of buildings, structures, and land that does not conform to the existing zoning regulations as now in effect or by virtue of a subsequent amendment, but which were in operation prior to adoption of this Resolution or amendment thereto.  The provisions of this chapter shall also apply to a building, structure, or land use hereafter made nonconforming as a result of amendments made to this Zoning Resolution or Zoning Map.  Nonconforming status is considered to be incompatible with permitted uses in the zoning district in which it exists and with the adopted Plain Township Comprehensive Mini-Master Plan; therefore such nonconforming status shall be continued only in conformance with these regulations.  A nonconforming lot, use, building or structure does not include nonconformity established pursuant to a variance approved by the township Board of Zoning Appeals. 
 
SECTION 1001.1  REGULATIONS 
In accordance with law, any nonconforming building, structure, or land use existing at the effective date of this Resolution, or which became nonconforming by virtue of a subsequent amendment to regulations or change in zoning district classification, may be continued although such use does not conform with the provisions of this Resolution.  However, any change, alteration or expansion of such nonconforming use shall require determination and approval of the Board of Zoning Appeals in accordance with the following provisions:

In addition, the applicant must demonstrate via written evidence from a qualified, licensed, professional engineer that, in terms of location and construction, there are no existing towers, tower-based WCFs, buildings, structures, elevated tanks, or similar uses able to provide the platform for the antenna within a one-half-mile radius or one-mile radius for tower-based WCFs taller than 50 feet of the chosen location, unless the applicant can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Zoning Department that a different distance is more reasonable. Co-location is not possible if: a. Capacity diagrams and technical reports demonstrate that co-location on an existing tower-based WCF is not technically possible in order to serve the desired need; 

b. Planned equipment would exceed the structural capacity of existing towers within the Township, considering existing and planned use of those towers, and existing towers cannot be reinforced to accommodate planned or equivalent equipment at a reasonable cost; 

c. Planned equipment will cause radio frequency (RF) interference with other existing or planned equipment for that tower, and the interference cannot be prevented at a reasonable cost; 

d. Existing or approved towers do not have the space on which planned equipment can be placed so it can function effectively and at least in parity with other similar equipment in place or planned. 

e. Other reasons can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Plain Township Board of Zoning Appeals that make it impractical to place the equipment planned by the applicant on existing and approved towers. 

f. All applications for the placement of non-tower-based WCFs shall not require land development plan approval and only require zoning and building permits pursuant to the application and approval procedures for such. 





2. Site Plan: A scaled site plan clearly indicating the location, type, and height of the   proposed WCF, adjacent land uses and zoning, comprehensive plan designation of the site and surrounding properties, adjacent roadways, proposed means of access, setbacks from property lines, landscaping, elevation drawings of the proposed tower and antenna array and any other structures, topography, parking, and any other information deemed necessary to assess compliance with this chapter. 


 
a. A description of the type of service offered and the consumer receiving equipment. 


 
b. Identification of the provider and backhaul provider, if different. 


 
c. The setback distance between the proposed tower and the nearest residentially zoned property. 


 
d. The separation distance from other towers within a one (1) miles radius, shall be shown on an updated site plan or map in relationship to the proposed tower. The applicant shall also identify the type of construction of the existing tower(s) and the owner/operator of the existing tower(s), if applicable. 


 
e. Each applicant for an antenna and/or tower shall provide to Plain Township an inventory of the applicant’s existing towers, antennas, or sites approved for towers or antennas, that are within one mile of the proposed tower site including specific information about the location, height, and design of each tower.
