ADOPTING ORDINANCE NO. 79-53
AN ORDINANCE TO APPROVE, ADOPT AND ENACT THE CODIFIED ORDINANCES; TO REPEAL
ORDINANCES IN CONFLICT THEREWITH; TO PUBLISH THE ENACTMENT OF NEW MATTER, AND
DECLARING AN EMERGENCY.
WHEREAS,    the present general and permanent ordinances of the City of
Sharonville, are inadequately arranged and classified and are insufficient in
form and substance for the complete preservation of the public peace, property,
health, safety and welfare of the City and for the proper conduct of its
affairs; and
WHEREAS,    Council has heretofore entered into a contract with the Walter H.
Drane Company to prepare and publish a new codification; and
WHEREAS,    the codification of such ordinances, together with the new matter
to be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed are before
Council;
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF SHARONVILLE,
HAMILTON COUNTY, OHIO:
Section I.   That the ordinances of the City of Sharonville, Ohio, of a general
and permanent nature, as revised, codified, rearranged and consolidated into
component codes, titles, chapters and sections are hereby approved, adopted and
enacted as the Codified Ordinances of Sharonville, Ohio, 1979.
      One book-form copy of the Codified Ordinances shall be certified as
correct by the Mayor and the Clerk of Council, attached to this ordinance as a
part hereof, and filed with the permanent ordinance records of the City of
Sharonville, Ohio.
Section II.   That the provisions of this Ordinance, including all provisions
of the Codified  Ordinances, shall be in full force and effect from and
immediately after passage of this Ordinance and its approval by the Mayor. All
ordinances and resolutions or parts thereof, which are inconsistent with any
provision of the Codified Ordinances, are hereby repealed as of the effective
date of this Ordinance, except as follows:
   (a)    The enactment of the Codified Ordinances shall not be construed to
affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative provision
prior to the effective date of such enactment, or an action or proceeding for
the enforcement of such right or liability. Such enactment shall not be
construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in
violation of any such legislative provision, nor to affect an indictment or
prosecution therefor. For such purposes, any such legislative provision shall
continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the purpose of revision
and recodification.
(b)    The repeal provided above shall not affect:
      (1)    The grant or creation of a franchise, license, right, easement or
privilege.
      (2)    The purchase, sale, lease or transfer of property.
      (3)    The appropriation or expenditure of money or promise or guarantee
of payment.
      (4)    The assumption of any contract or obligation.
      (5)    The issuance and delivery of any bonds, obligations or other
instruments of indebtedness.
      (6)    The levy or imposition of taxes, assessments or charges.
      (7)    The establishment, naming, vacating or grade level of any street
or public way.
      (8)    The dedication of property or plat approval.
      (9)    The annexation or detachment of territory.
      (10)    Any legislation enacted subsequent to January 1, 1979.
Section III.   That the Clerk of Council, pursuant to Ohio R.C. 731.23, shall
cause to be  published in a manner required by law a summary of the new matter
contained in the Codified Ordinances. All sections of the Codified Ordinances
without a previous ordinance or resolution history at the end thereof indicate
that the section contains new matter ordained by this Adopting Ordinance.
Section IV.   This Ordinance is declared to be an emergency measure immediately
necessary for the preservation of the public health, safety, and welfare, and
for the additional reason that there exists an imperative necessity for the
earliest publication and distribution of the Codified Ordinances to the
officials and citizens of the City, so as to facilitate administration, daily
operation and avoid practical and legal entanglements; wherefore, this
Ordinance shall be in full force and effect immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor.

EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially
are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

and phrases that have acquired a technical or particular meaning, whether by
legislative definition or otherwise, shall be construed accordingly. (ORC 1.42)
   (b)   Singular and Plural; Gender; Tense. As used in the Codified

         B.    "Year" means twelve consecutive months. (ORC 1.44)
      (2)   If a number of months is to be computed by counting the months from

month as the day of the month from which the computation is begun, unless there
are not that many days in the concluding month, in which case the period ends
on the last day of that month. (ORC 1.45)
      (3)    The time within which an act is required by law to be done shall
be computed by excluding the first and including the last day, except that when
the last day falls on Sunday or a legal holiday, then the act may be done on
the next succeeding day which is not a Sunday or a legal holiday. When a public
office, in which an act required by law is to be performed, is closed to the
public for the entire day which constitutes the last day for doing such act or
before its usual closing time on such day, then such act may be performed on
the next succeeding day which is not a Sunday or a legal holiday. If any legal
holiday falls on Sunday, the next succeeding day is a legal holiday. (ORC 1.14)
      (4)    When legislation is to take effect or become operative from and

reasonable time or reasonable notice to be given, such reasonable time or
notice shall mean such time only as may be necessary for the prompt performance
of such duty or compliance with such notice.

as well be done by an agent as by the principal, such requirement shall be
construed to include all such acts when done by an authorized agent.
   (e)    Joint Authority. All words purporting to give joint authority to

be otherwise expressly declared in the law giving the authority or inconsistent
with State statute or Charter provisions.
   (f)    Exceptions. The rules of construction shall not apply to any law
which shall contain any express provision excluding such construction, or when
the subject matter or context of such law may be repugnant thereto.
   101.04  REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)    The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein. (ORC
1.57)
   (b)    An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance. (ORC 1.54)
   (c)    The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not,
except as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)    Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)    Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)    Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;
      (4)    Affect any investigation, proceeding or remedy in respect of any
such privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment; and
the investigation, proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or
enforced, and the penalty, forfeiture or punishment imposed, as if the
ordinance had not been repealed or amended.
   (d)   If the penalty, forfeiture or punishment for any offense is reduced by
a re- enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture or
punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed according to the ordinance
as amended. (ORC 1.58)
   101.05  CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (a)    A reference to any portion of the Codified Ordinances applies to all
re- enactments or amendments thereof. (ORC 1.55)
   (b)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
the last numbers or letters are included. (ORC 1.56)
   (c)    Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)
   101.06  CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)    If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern. (ORC 1.46)
   (b)    If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevails. (ORC 1.51)
   (c)    (1)    If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
       (2)    If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
   101.07  DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)    In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)    Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)    The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)    A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)    A result feasible of execution is intended. (ORC 1.47)
   (b)    An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective. (ORC 1.48)
   (c)    If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)    The object sought to be attained;
      (2)    The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)    The legislative history;
      (4)    The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)    The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)    The administrative construction of the ordinance. (ORC 1.49)
   101.08  SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable. (ORC l.50)
   101.09  MEETINGS OPEN TO PUBLIC.
   It is hereby declared to be the policy of the City of Sharonville that all
meetings of the City Council, the Planning Commission and the Board of Zoning
Appeals shall comply with Ohio's open meeting law as follows:
   (a)    All regular and special meetings shall be open to the public and
notice of special meetings shall be given to required newspapers at least
twenty-four hours prior to the meeting. Committees, other than a committee of
the whole, shall be exempt from the operation of this provision unless the
committee contains a majority of the members of the Council, Planning
Commission or Board of Zoning Appeals, as the case may be. The Council Law
Committee, as long as it does not contain more than three members, is exempt
from this provision.
   (b)    Executive sessions may be held only after a majority of the members
of the Council, Commission or Board vote to adjourn to executive session with
the motion thereon stating the specific exempt purpose for the executive
session.
   (c)    The purposes of executive sessions shall be limited to the following:
the purchase or sale of public property; the appointment, employment,
dismissal, discipline, promotion, demotion or compensation of a public employee
or official, or the investigation of charges or complaints against a public
official or employee, unless the specific employee requests a public meeting;
conferences with an attorney relative to disputes which involve or may involve
litigation; discussions regarding public employees, their compensation and
other conditions of employment; matters required by State or Federal law to be
kept confidential; matters which must be kept confidential in order to avoid
the commission of illegal acts or the avoidance of prosecution for illegal
acts.
   (d)    Minutes shall be kept for all executive sessions which shall contain
the record of the vote to hold the executive session and which describes which
of the exempt purposes was invoked. (Ord. 88-73. Passed 12-27-88.)
   101.99  GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00). A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.
CHAPTER 103
Official Standards
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The State of Ohio operates on Eastern Daylight Savings Time
from 2:00 a.m. of the last Sunday in April until 2:00 a.m. of the last Sunday
in October. Congress on March 22, 1966, passed the Uniform Time Act requiring
uniform observance throughout the nation of Daylight Savings Time starting in
1967, except that a state legislature could exempt the entire state from
Daylight Savings Time or divide a state into not more than two parts, each with
a different time standard. The Ohio legislature through inaction has elected to

TITLE SEVEN - Judicial
            Chap.
161.   Mayor's Court
CHAPTER 161
Mayor's Court
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The Mayor has jurisdiction to hear and determine any
prosecution for the violation of a Municipal ordinance, and has jurisdiction in
all criminal causes involving moving traffic violations occurring on State
highways located within the corporate limits, subject to the right of the
defendant to trial by jury and before an impartial magistrate.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Municipal ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00). Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and
Criminal Rule 23(A) provide that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him and shall be transferred to a court of record in the County if the
defendant:
   (a)    Does not waive his right to trial by jury in a serious offense case
for which the penalty established by law includes confinement for more than six
months, or
   (b)    Demands a jury trial in a petty offense case in which the penalty
prescribed is a fine greater than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) and/or
imprisonment for not more than six months. "Such demand must be in writing and
filed with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the date set for
trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice of the date
set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to demand a jury trial as provided
in this subdivision is a complete waiver of the right thereto."
   In Ward v. Village of Monroeville, Ohio, 93 S. Ct. 80 (1972), the United
States Supreme Court held that where the mayor before whom the defendant as
compelled to stand trial was responsible for municipal finances and the mayor's
court provided a substantial portion of municipal revenues, defendant was
denied a trial before a disinterested and impartial magistrate as guaranteed by
the due process clause of the United States Constitution.
   The Supreme Court of Ohio has adopted the "Ohio Traffic Rules" which
prescribe the procedure to be followed in the Mayor's Court in traffic cases.
Rule 9(A) thereof states the jury demand shall be made pursuant to Criminal
Rule 23 referred to above. Rule 9(B) sets forth the conditions under which the
Mayor may hear a traffic case incorporating therein the holding in Ward v.
Village of Monroeville as further interpreted in State, ex rel. Brockman v.
Procter, 35 Ohio St. 2d 79 (1973): "Where, in a mayor's court, a defendant is
entitled to a jury trial and a jury demand is made pursuant to Criminal Rule
23, the Mayor shall transfer the case pursuant to subdivision (C). If a jury
demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and (or?) the defendant waives
his right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the case if (l) his
compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions, or (2) he is not the chief executive and administrative officer of
the municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition of the
municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor including
mayors whose compensation as a judge is directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions and mayors who as chief executive and administrative officer of the
municipality are responsible for the financial condition of the municipality."
   The procedure for transferring a case to a court of record is set forth in
Rule 9(C): "Where a transfer is required, the mayor's court shall make a
written order directing the defendant to appear at the transferee court,
continuing the same bail, if any, and making appearance before the transferee
court a condition of bail, if any. Upon transfer, the mayor's court shall
transmit to the clerk of the transferee court the ticket and all other papers
in the case, and any bail taken in the case. Upon receipt of such papers the
clerk of the transferee court shall set the case for trial and shall notify the
defendant by ordinary mail of his trial date."
   Rule 13 provides that a court shall establish a traffic violation bureau and
specifies certain restrictions as to the designated offenses and schedule of
fines to be accepted as waiver payment in lieu of court appearance.

   161.01  ELECTRONICALLY MONITORED HOUSE ARREST.
   (a)    Any or all of the terms of imprisonment authorized under the
ordinances of the City may be served by means of electronically monitored house
arrest, in the sole discretion of the Mayor. In such case, the Mayor shall
determine the number of days of actual imprisonment, the number of days of
electronically monitored house arrest, and whether any of the days of actual
imprisonment shall be suspended on the condition of successful completion of
the incarceration by electronically monitored house arrest. The sum of the days
of actual imprisonment plus the days of electronically monitored house arrest
shall not exceed the stated maximum number of days of imprisonment for that
particular offense.
   (b)    No individual may serve a term of imprisonment by electronically
monitored house arrest unless he or she first executes an appropriate agreement
made available to all such defendants, whereby the defendant agrees to pay the
cost of the system (or, in the sole discretion of the Mayor, such portion of
the cost as he or she can afford to pay) and agrees to abide by all of the
rules and regulations of the electronically monitored house arrest procedure.
The agreement shall provide that no credit for suspended days of actual
incarceration shall be granted unless the defendant successfully completes all
of the days of the electronically monitored house arrest. (Ord. 90-75. Passed
10-30-90.)
   (c)    No person, knowing that he or she is under the restrictions of
electronically monitored house arrest, shall purposely break or attempt to
break such detention, or purposely violate any of the requirements of the
detention. Whoever violates this section is guilty of Contempt of Court, and
shall be punished under the authority of the Mayor's Court of the City of
Sharonville to enforce its orders and punish for contempts. (Ord. 91-7. Passed
2-26-91.)

employee, and amounts paid or accrued to or for life insurance for an owner or

            1.   The tax imposed on resident associations, unincorporated
businesses, pass-through entities, professions or other unincorporated entities
owned by two or more persons is upon the entities rather than the individual
members or owners thereof, but the tax imposed on an unincorporated resident
entity owned by one person is upon the individual owner.

through entities, professions or other unincorporated entities owned by two or
more persons, all of whom are residents of the City, may disregard the business
apportionment percentage formula provided for in this chapter and pay the tax
on their entire net profits thereof if no apportionment by the entity to
another taxing municipality exists. In such case, the tax paid by the entity
shall constitute all tax due from the owners or members of the entity for their

provisions of this subsection shall not apply to any corporation which is

subsection a person shall not be considered to have engaged in a business
activity within the State of Ohio during any taxable year merely by reason of
sales in the State of Ohio, or the solicitation of orders for sales within the
State of Ohio, of tangible personal property on behalf of such person by one or
more independent contractors, or by reason of the maintenance of an office

commission agent, broker, or other independent contractor who is engaged in
selling, or soliciting orders for sales of tangible personal property for more
than one principal and who holds himself out as such in the regular course of
his business activities. For the purpose of this subsection, the term
"representative" does not include an independent contractor.
         B.   Resident’s Distributive Share of Profits of a Resident
Unincorporated Business Entity, Not Attributable to the City.  On the portion

unincorporated entity shall pay the tax on the entire net profits of his
resident unincorporated business entity. If allocation to another municipality
exists, the taxpayer may qualify for credit for tax paid to another locality

apportionment percentage formula provided for in Section
171.03(b), and not taxed against the entity. 
      (4)   A.   Nonresident Unincorporated Business.  On the portion
attributable to the City of the net profits earned by all nonresident
associations, unincorporated businesses, pass-through entities, professions or
other unincorporated entities, derived from sales made, work done, services
performed or rendered or business or other activities conducted in the City,

through entity, profession or other unincorporated entity has an office or
place of business in the City.

businesses, pass-through entities, professions or other unincorporated entities
owned by two or more persons is upon the entities rather than the individual
members or owners thereof.

profits attributable to the City under the business apportionment percentage
formula provided for in this chapter, regardless of where the owner or owners
of such nonresident unincorporated business entities reside.
            3.   Nonresident associations, unincorporated businesses, pass-
through entities, professions or other unincorporated entities owned by two or
more persons, all of whom are residents of the City, may disregard the business
apportionment percentage formula provided for in this chapter and pay the tax

another taxing municipality exists. In such case, the tax paid by the entity
shall constitute all tax due from the owners or members of the entity for their
distributive share of the net profits from the entity; however, an additional
return shall be required from any such owner or member having taxable income
other than the distributive share of the net profits from the entity. 
         B.   Resident’s Distributive Share of Profits of a Nonresident

a nonresident unincorporated entity, the tax is imposed on such individual's

Code 5727.38 to 5727.41, inclusive, to pay an excise tax in any taxable year as
defined by this chapter, may exclude that part of their gross receipts upon
which the excise tax is paid. In such case, expenses incurred in the production
of such gross receipts shall not be deducted in computing net profits subject
to the tax imposed by this chapter.
      (6)   Amplification.  In amplification of the definition contained in
Section
171.02 herein, but not in limitation thereof, the following additional
information respecting net business profits is furnished.
         A.   Net Profits.
            1.   “Net profit” for a taxpayer other than an individual means
adjusted federal taxable income and “net profit” for a taxpayer who is an
individual means the individual’s profit, other than amounts described in
Section
171.03(e), required to be reported on schedule C, schedule E, or schedule F.
            2.   “Adjusted federal taxable income” means a C corporation’s
federal taxable income before net operating losses and special deductions as
determined under the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as defined in Section
171.02 herein.
         B.   Gross Receipts.
            1.   Gross receipts shall include but not be limited to income in
the form of commissions, fees, directors’ fees, subpay, profit sharing from
nonqualified plans, rentals from real and tangible personal property, and other
compensation for work or services performed or rendered as well as income from
sales of stock in trade.
            2.   Gross receipts shall include ordinary income from Form 4797. 
         C.   Expenses.

partners, members, or other owners of an unincorporated business or enterprise.
            2.   If not claimed as part of the cost of goods sold or elsewhere
in the return filed, there may be claimed and allowed a reasonable deduction
for depreciation, depletion, obsolescence, losses resulting from theft or
casualty, not compensated for by insurance or otherwise of property used in the
trade or business, but the amount may not exceed that recognized for the
purpose of the federal income tax. Provided, however, that loss on the sale,
exchange or other disposition of depreciable property or real estate, used in
the taxpayer's business, shall not be allowed as a deductible expense.
            3.   Current amortization of emergency facilities under the
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, if recognized as such for federal
income tax purposes, may be included as an expense deduction hereunder.
            4.   Where depreciable property is voluntarily destroyed, only the
cost of such demolition and the undepreciated balance thereof will be allowed
as an expense in the year of such demolition, to the extent allowable for
federal income tax purposes.
            5.   Bad debts in a reasonable amount may be allowed in the year
ascertained worthless and charged off, or at the discretion of the Tax
Administrator (if the reserve method is used), a reasonable addition to the
reserve may be claimed, but in no event shall the amount exceed the amount
allowable for federal income tax purposes.
            6.   Only taxes directly connected with the business may be claimed
as a deduction. If for any reason the income from property is not subject to
the tax, then taxes on and other expenses of said property are not deductible.
In any event, the following taxes are not deductible from income: (1) the tax
under this chapter; (2) federal or other taxes based upon income; (3) gift,
estate or inheritance taxes; (4) taxes for local benefit or improvements to
property which tend to appreciate the value thereof; and (5) self-employment
taxes for unincorporated businesses or other entities, including credit for
employment taxes as allowed for federal tax purposes.
            7.   If the taxpayer reports income that is non-taxable under this
chapter and such amounts are deducted in order to reconcile the municipal
return with the taxpayer’s federal return, expenses attributable to this non-
taxable income shall not be allowed as a deduction from the remaining taxable
income.  The expenses attributable to such non-taxable income shall be:
               a.   Five percent (5%) of the non-taxable income.  Non- taxable
income given capital gain treatment on the federal return, from which
attributable expenses were already deducted, is not subject to the foregoing.

basis and who pays his business expense from his commissions or other

said expenses are incurred in earning commissions or other compensations
subject to the tax imposed by this chapter.  Business expenses allowed shall be
those expenses allowed to be claimed on the federal Form 2106 and upon the
request of the Tax Administrator, verifiable with supporting schedules and/or
receipts.  Failure to produce the supporting schedules and/or receipts upon

are not taxable to the employees if the employees have no vested right in the

compensation plans shall not be allowed as a deduction against income for
unincorporated entities or the like as allowed for federal purposes.

Only moving expenses incurred, as part of income included in gross earnings,
will be allowed.
            15.   In general, all business expense recognized and to the extent
allowed as such for the purpose of determining federal income tax will be

this chapter. However, contributions are not considered as an ordinary and
necessary expense of doing business and are disallowed as an expense.
      (7)   Rentals From Real Property.
         A.   The rental of real estate is ordinarily a business activity, and
the income from such rentals are taxable, provided, however, where the
taxpayer's entire rental activity produces gross rentals of less than two
hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per month, it will be prima facie evidence that
such rental activities are not a business activity. If gross rentals equal or
exceed two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per month, the entire net income
from rentals is taxable.  In determining the amount of gross monthly rental of
any real property, periods during which, by reason of vacancy or any other
cause, rentals are not received shall not be taken into consideration by the
taxpayer. 
         B.   Rentals received by a taxpayer engaged in the business of buying
and selling real estate shall be considered as part of business income.
         C.   Real property, as the term is used in the Rules and Regulations
of this chapter, shall include commercial property, residential property, farm
property, and any and all types of real estate.
         D.   In determining the taxable income from rentals, the deductible
expenses shall be of the same nature, extent and amount as are allowed by the
Internal Revenue Service for federal income tax purposes.
         E.   Residents of the City are subject to taxation upon the net income
from rentals (to the extent above specified), regardless of the location of the
real property owned.  However, if any such property is located outside the
City, and is subject to another municipal income tax, credit shall be claimed
in accordance with Section
171.14. 
         F.   Nonresidents of the City are subject to such taxation only if the
real property is situated within the City.
         G.   To be considered non-taxable as ground rents, the property must
be under perpetual leasehold by the terms of which the lessor performs no
services of any type, including the payment of taxes on the property. 
         H.   Businesses owning or managing real estate are taxed only on that
portion of income derived from property located in the City. 
      (8)   Royalties.  Income in the form of royalties is taxable if
taxpayer's activities produced the publication or other product, the sale of
which produces the royalties.

reported on Internal Revenue Service Form W-2G, Form 5754 and/or any other form
required by the Internal Revenue Service that reports winnings from gambling.

the City Boundaries.  This section does not apply to taxpayers that are subject
to and required to file reports under Chapter 5745, of the Ohio Revised Code. 
Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c) of this section, net profit from
a business or profession conducted both within and without the boundaries of a
municipal corporation shall be considered as having a taxable situs in such
municipal corporation for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same
proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)   Business Apportionment Percentage Formula.  Multiply the entire net
profits of the business by a business apportionment percentage formula to be
determined by:
         A.   STEP 1.  Ascertain the percentage which the average original cost
of the real and tangible personal property, including leasehold improvements,
owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession and situated within
the City during the taxable period is to the average original cost of all of
the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
            1.   As used in the preceding subsection, real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight
(8).  The percentage of taxpayer's real and tangible personal property within
the City is determined by dividing the average original cost of such property
within the City (without deduction of any encumbrances) by the average original
cost of all such property within and without the City.
            2.   Gross rents means the actual sum of money or other
consideration payable, directly or indirectly, by the taxpayer for the use or
possession of property and includes:
               a.   Any amount payable for the use or possession of real and
tangible personal property or any part thereof, whether designated as a fixed
sum of money or as a percentage of sales profits or otherwise;
               b.   Any amount payable as additional rent or in lieu of rent
such as interest, taxes, insurance, repairs, or other amounts required to be
paid by the terms of a lease or other arrangement.
            3.   A residence may not be considered an office unless a portion
thereof is used exclusively for business purposes and is reached by a separate
entrance in an exterior wall which does not serve as the entrance to the
balance of the building.
         B.   STEP 2.  Ascertain the percentage which the total wages,
salaries, including sick and vacation pay, bonuses, commissions, incentive
payments, settlements, stock options, grievance pay, severance pay, any pay as
part of an employee buyout or wage continuation plan and other forms of
compensation paid during the taxable period to persons employed in the business
or profession for services performed in the City is to the total wages,
salaries, including sick and vacation pay, bonuses, commissions, incentive
payments, settlements, stock 6options, grievance pay, severance pay, any pay as
part of an employee buyout or wage continuation plan and other forms of
compensation paid during the same period to persons employed in the business or
profession, wherever their services are performed, excluding compensation that
is not taxable by the municipal corporation under Section 718.011 of the Ohio
Revised Code.
            1.   Salaries, wages, including sick and vacation pay, bonuses,
commissions, incentive payments, settlements, stock options, grievance pay,
severance pay, any pay as part of an employee buyout or wage continuation plan
and other forms of compensation subject to the City income tax paid owners or
credited to the account of owners or partners during the period covered by the
return are considered wages for the purpose of this computation.
            2.   Salaries, wages, including sick and vacation pay, bonuses,
commissions, incentive payments, settlements, stock options, grievance pay,
severance pay, any pay as part of an employee buyout or wage continuation plan
and other forms of compensation subject to the City income tax shall be
computed on the cash or accrual basis in accordance with the method of
accounting used in the computation of the entire net income of the taxpayer.
            3.   In the case of an employee who performs services both within
and without the City the amount treated as compensation for services performed
within the City shall be deemed to be:
               a.   In the case of an employee whose compensation depends
directly on the volume of business secured by him, such as a salesman on a
commission basis, the amount received by him for the business attributable to
his efforts within the City.
               b.   In the case of an employee whose compensation depends on
other results achieved, the proportion of the total compensation received which
the value of his services, within the City bears to the value of all his
services; and
               c.   In the case of an employee compensated on a time basis, the
proportion of the total amount received by him which his working time within
the City is of his total working time.
               d.   Provided, however, all employees regularly connected with
or working out of a place of business maintained by the taxpayer in the City
who perform 75% or more of their services within the City be considered
employees within the City.
            4.   Nonresident professional persons shall use the factor of days
spent withinthe Cityto total working days. All employees regularly connected
with or working out of a place of business maintained by the taxpayeroutside
the City who perform 25% or less of their services within the City shall be
considered employees outside the City. (The provisions of this subsection are
not applicable in determining the tax liability of a nonresident who works in
and outside the City.)
         C.   STEP 3. Ascertain the percentage which the gross receipts of the
business or profession from sales made and services performed during the
taxable period in the City is to gross receipts of the business or profession
during the same period from sales and services, wherever made or performed.
            1.   The following sales shall be considered City sales:
               a.   All sales made through retail stores located within the
City to purchasers within or without the City except such of said sales to
purchasers outside the City that are directly attributable to regular
solicitations made outside the City personally by taxpayer's employees.
               b.   All sales of tangible personal property delivered to
purchasers within the City regardless of where title passes if shipped or
delivered from a stock of goods at an office, store, warehouse, factory, or
place of storage located within the City.
               c.   All sales of tangible personal property delivered to
purchasers within the City regardless of where title passes even though
transported from a point outside the City if the Taxpayer is regularly engaged
through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the
City and the sales directly or indirectly result from such solicitation or
promotion.
               d.   All sales of tangible personal property shipped from an
office, store, warehouse, factory or place of storage within the City to
purchasers outside the City if the taxpayer is not, through its own employees
regularly engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales at the place of
delivery.
               e.   Charges for work done or services performed incident to a
sale, whether or not included in the price of the property shall be considered
gross receipts from such sale.
               f.   In the application of the foregoing subsections a carrier
shall be considered the agent of the seller, regardless of the FOB point or
other conditions of the sale, and the place at which orders are accepted or
contracts legally consummated shall be immaterial.  Solicitation of customers
outside the City by mail or phone from an office, or place of business within
the City shall not be considered a solicitation of sales outside the City.
               g.   Nonresident professional persons shall use the factor of
the City billings over total billings.
         D.   STEP 4. Adding together the percentages determined in accordance
with Section
171.03 (a), (b) and (c), herein or such of the aforesaid percentages as are
applicable to the particular taxpayer, and dividing the total so obtained by
the number of percentages used in deriving such total.  The result so obtained
is the business apportionment percentage. 
            1.   A factor is applicable even though it may be apportioned
entirely in or outside the City.  A factor is excluded only when it does not
exist anywhere.
            2.   Provided, however, that in the event a just and equitable
result cannot be obtained under the business apportionment percentage formula
provided for herein, the Tax Administrator, upon application of the taxpayer,
shall have the authority to substitute other factors or methods calculated to
effect a fair and proper apportionment. 
         E.   STEP 5.  The business apportionment percentage determined in Step
4 above shall be applied to the entire taxable net profits of the taxpayer
wherever derived to determine the net profits apportioned to the City.
      (2)   Substitute Method.
         A.   In the event a just and equitable result cannot be obtained under
the business apportionment percentage formula, the Tax Administrator, upon
application of the taxpayer, shall have the authority to substitute other
factors in the business apportionment percentage formula or prescribe other
methods of apportioning net income calculated to effect a fair and proper
apportionment.
         B.   Application to the Tax Administrator to substitute other factors
in the business apportionment percentage formula or to use a different method
to apportion net profits must be made in writing before the end of the tax year
and shall state the specific grounds on which the substitution of factors or
use of a different method is requested and the relief sought to be obtained. A
copy thereof shall be served at the time of filing upon the taxpayer or Tax
Administrator as the case may be. No specific form need be followed in making
such application. Once a taxpayer has filed under a substitute method, he must
continue to so file until given permission to change by the Tax Administrator.
         C.   The decision of the Tax Administrator on subsections (2)A. and
(2)B., hereof may be appealed by the taxpayer to the Board of Review, which
shall have the power to affirm, reverse or modify such decision of the Tax
Administrator. 
      (3)   Professional And Personal Service.  In the case of professional
people and others furnishing personal services, if their only place of business
is within the City all their net profits shall prima facie be attributable to
the City.
   (c)   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (d) hereof, net profit from
rental activity not constituting a business or profession shall be subject to
tax only by the municipal corporation in which the property generating the net
profit is located.
   (d)   This section does not apply to individuals who are residents of the
Municipality and, except as otherwise provided in Section 718.01 of the Ohio
Revised Code, the Municipality may impose a tax on all income earned by
residents of the Municipality to the extent allowed by the United States
Constitution. 
   (e)   Net Operating Loss (NOL).
      (1)   A.   The portion of a net operating loss sustained in any taxable
year, apportioned to the City, may be applied against the portion of the profit
of succeeding taxable years apportioned to the City, until exhausted, but in no
event for more than the three (3) taxable years immediately following the year
in which the loss occurred.  No portion of a net operating loss shall be
carried back against net profits of any prior year.
         B.   A short fiscal year (a fiscal year of less than twelve (12)
months) brought about by a change in accounting period, a new taxpayer
selecting a short fiscal year, or a taxpayer operating in the City for less
than his full accounting period, shall be considered as a full taxable fiscal
year for purposes of loss carry-forward.
      (2)   A.   The portion of a net operating loss sustained shall be
apportioned to the City in the same manner as provided herein for apportioning
net profits to the City.  The portion of a net operating loss to be carried
forward shall be determined in the year the net operating loss is sustained, on
the basis of the apportionment factors applicable to that year.
         B.   The same method of accounting and apportionment must be used in
the year to which an operating loss is carried as was used in the year in which
the operating loss was sustained.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator shall provide by Rules and Regulations the
manner in which such net operating loss carry-forward shall be determined.
      (4)   With respect to a return combining taxable income from two or more
sources, the following rules shall be applied:
         A.   The net operating loss sustained by a business or profession is
not deductible from employee earnings, but may be carried forward as provided
in subsection (e)(1) hereof.
         B.   If a taxpayer is engaged in two or more taxable business
activities to be included in the same return, the net loss of one
unincorporated business activity (except any portion of a loss reportable for
municipal income tax purposes to another taxing municipality) may be used to
offset the profits of another for purposes of arriving at overall net profits.
      (5)   The loss from an unincorporated business subject to income tax from
a taxing municipality or J.E.D.D. shall be applied as follows:
         A.   The loss must first be applied to the taxing municipality in
full.  To the extent that the tax rate for the City exceeds the tax rate of
such taxing municipality, a portion will be currently deductible against other
unincorporated entities in the current year or be available to be carried
forward.
         B.   The portion of loss allowable is calculated by taking the
difference in tax rates expressed as a percentage and multiplying it by the
current year loss.  For example, if a business is located in a taxing
municipality with a tax rate of 1% with a loss of $10,000 the loss allowable
against City business income is $3,300 (ie. 1.5% - 1% = .5%.  .005 divided by
.015 = .333.  $10,000 x .333 = $3,330).  The remaining loss is only allowable
against the other taxing municipality.
      (6)   In any return in which a net operating loss deduction is claimed, a
schedule should be attached showing:
         A.   Year in which net operating loss was sustained.
         B.   Method of accounting and apportionment, used to determine portion
of net operating loss apportioned to the City.
         C.   Amount of net operating loss used as a deduction in prior years.
         D.   Amount of net operating loss claimed as a deduction in current
year.
      (7)   The net operating loss of a taxpayer, which loses its identity
through merger, consolidation, etc., shall not be allowed as a carry-forward
loss deduction to the surviving or new taxpayer.
   (f)   Consolidated Returns.
      (1)   A consolidated return may be filed by a group of corporations who
are affiliated through stock ownership if that affiliated group filed for the
same tax period a consolidated return for federal income tax purposes pursuant
to Section 1501 of the Internal Revenue Code.  A consolidated return must
include all companies that are so affiliated. 
      (2)   Once a consolidated return has been filed for any taxable year,
consolidated returns shall continue to be filed in subsequent years unless:
         A.   Permission in writing is granted by the Tax Administrator to file
separate returns.
         B.   A new corporation other than a corporation created or organized
by a member of the group has become a member of the group during the taxable
year.
         C.   A corporation member of the group is sold or exchanged.
Liquidating a corporation or merging one of the corporations of the group into
another will not qualify the group for filing separate returns.
   (g)   Exceptions.  The following shall not be considered taxable:
      (1)   Military pay or allowances of members of the armed forces of the
United States and of members of their reserve components, including the Ohio
National Guard.
      (2)   Income of any religious, fraternal, charitable, scientific,
literary, or educational institutions enumerated in Section 718.01 of the Ohio
Revised Code to the extent that such income is derived from tax exempt real
estate, tax exempt tangible or intangible property or tax exempt activities.
         A.   Any association or organization falling in the category listed in
the preceding paragraph is required to file declarations and final returns and
remit the taxes levied under this chapter on all net profits from activities,
the income from which is not specifically exempt from taxation in Section
718.01 of the Ohio Revised Code.
         B.   Where such non-profit association or organization conducts
income- producing business both within and without the corporate limits, it
shall calculate its profits apportioned to the City under the method or methods
provided above.
      (3)   Income from intangibles by way of dividends, interest and the like,
if such income is subject to taxation under the intangible personal property
laws of the State of Ohio, are specifically exempt from municipal taxation
under said law.
      (4)   Compensation paid under Section 3501.28 or 3501.36 of the Ohio
Revised Code to a person serving as a precinct official, to the extent that
such compensation does not exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000) annually.  Such
compensation in excess of one thousand dollars ($1,000) may be subject to
taxation.  The payer of such compensation is not required to withhold City tax
from that compensation. 
      (5)   Compensation paid to an employee of a transit authority, regional
transit authority, or regional transit commission created under Chapter 306 of
the Ohio Revised Code for operating a transit bus or other motor vehicle for
the authority or commission in or through the City, unless the bus or vehicle
is operated on a regularly scheduled route, the operator is subject to such a
tax by reason of residence or domicile in the City, or the headquarters of the
authority or commission is located within the City. 
      (6)   The income of a public utility when that public utility is subject
to the tax levied under Section 5727.24 or 5727.30 of the Ohio Revised Code,
except a municipal corporation may tax the following, subject to Chapter 5745
of the Ohio Revised Code:
         A.   The income of an electric company or combined company;
         B.   The income of a telephone company.

“electric company”, and “telephone company” have the same meanings as in
Section 5727.01 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (7)   The rental value of a home furnished to a minister of the gospel as
part of his compensation, or the rental allowance paid to a minister of the
gospel as part of his compensation, to the extent used by him to rent or
provide a home pursuant to Section 107 of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (8)   Compensation earned by occasional entrants as defined in Section
171.03(a)(2)C.
      (9)   An S corporation shareholder’s distributive share of net profits of
the S corporation, other than any part of the distributive share of net profits
that represents wages as defined in Section 3121(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code or net earnings from self-employment as defined in Section 1402(a) of the
Internal Revenue code, to the extent such distributive share would not be
allocated or apportioned to this state under division (B)(1) and (2) of Section
5733.05 of the Ohio Revised Code if the S corporation were a corporation
subject to the taxes imposed under Chapter 5733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (10)   Employee compensation that is not “qualifying wages” as defined in

forms of compensation would be assumed to be taxable.
         (Ord. 2003-96E.  Passed 12-23-03; Ord. 2015-40.  Passed 11-24-15.)
   171.04  EFFECTIVE PERIOD.
   The tax imposed by this chapter shall be levied, collected and paid with
respect to the qualifying wages, including sick and vacation pay, bonuses,
commissions, incentive payments, settlements, stock options, grievance pay,
severance pay, any pay as part of an employee buyout or wage continuation plan
and other compensation paid by an employer or employers, with respect to
gambling winnings and with respect to the net profits of businesses,
professions or other activities subject to the tax, earned on or after May 1,
1968. 
(Ord. 2003-96E.  Passed 12-23-03.)
   171.05  RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (a)   Dates and Requirements for Filing.
      (1)   On or before April 15th  of each year, every person subject to the
provisions of Section
171.03 of this chapter, except as hereinafter provided, and every resident,
shall make and file with the Tax Administrator, a return on a form prescribed
by and obtainable upon request from the Tax Administrator, or on an acceptable
generic form whether or not a tax be due.   
      (2)   When the return is made for a fiscal year or other period different
from the calendar year, the return shall be filed on or before the fifteenth
(15th) day of the fourth (4th) month following the end of such fiscal year or
period. 
      (3)   The Tax Administrator is hereby authorized to provide by regulation
that the return of an employer or employers showing the amount of City tax
deducted by such employer or employers from the qualifying wages, including
sick and vacation pay, bonuses, commissions, incentive payments, settlements,
stock options, grievance pay, severance pay, any pay as part of an employee
buyout or wage continuation plan, other compensation, and other taxable income
of an employee, and paid by him or them to the Tax Administrator may be
accepted as the return required of any employee whose sole income, subject to
tax under this chapter, is such qualifying wages, including sick and vacation
pay, commissions, incentive payments, settlements, stock options, grievance
pay, severance pay, any pay as part of an employee buyout or wage continuation
plan or other compensation. 
      (4)   The return shall be accompanied by payment of any taxes due
thereon.
      (5)   An employee who is paid on a qualifying wage, commission or other
compensation basis and who pays his business expense from his qualifying wage,
commission or other compensation, without reimbursement from his employer, may
deduct from his qualifying wage, commission or other compensation, business
expenses allowed by the Internal Revenue Service for federal income tax
purposes but only to the extent said expenses are incurred in earning
commissions or other compensations subject to the tax imposed by this chapter. 
The employee must file a return in order to claim such deductions even though
all or parts of such qualifying wage, commission or other compensation are
subject to withholding.  Business expenses allowed shall be those expenses
allowed to be claimed on the federal Form 2106 and upon the request of the Tax
Administrator, verifiable with supporting schedules and/or receipts.  Failure
to produce the supporting schedules and/or receipts upon request of the Tax
Administrator shall result in disallowance of the expenses in question.  No
expenses claimed on federal Form Schedule A, Itemized Deductions shall be
allowed.
      (6)   Moving expenses included in gross earnings shall be an allowance as
a deductible expense.  No deduction will be allowed if the taxpayer does not
provide the federal Form 3903 for his moving deductions.  Only moving expenses
incurred, as part of income included in gross earnings, will be allowed.
      (7)   Except as provided for herein, the tax is on the association,
unincorporated business, pass-through entity, profession or other
unincorporated entity as an entity whether resident or nonresident and a return
is required disclosing the net profits apportioned to the City and the tax paid
thereon.  However, any resident partner or resident member is required to make
a return and pay the tax in accordance with this chapter and Rules and
Regulations.
      (8)   Any taxpayer who received taxable income not subject to withholding
under this chapter must file a return.
      (9)   Any taxpayer having income, wages, or other compensation for which
a return must be filed, and also having net profits from a business is required
to file only one return.
      (10)   Executors, administrators and trustees are required to file
returns on the trusts, are liable for the payment of any taxes due by a
deceased from an estate of such deceased and are required to give the name and
address of the beneficiaries, even though the latter individually pays the tax.
   (b)   Joint Returns. 
      (1)   A husband and wife may file either separate returns or a joint
return for City purposes, even though one of the spouses has neither taxable
income nor deductions included on the City return regardless of whether their
federal and state returns were filed separately or jointly.  If a joint City
return is made, the tax shall be computed on the aggregate taxable income and
the liability with respect to the tax shall be joint and several.
      (2)   A husband and wife may file a joint return either when engaged in
the same or separate businesses, but may not deduct business losses of either
from compensation paid by an employer.
   (c)   Returns, Information Required and Reconciliation with Federal
Returns.  The return shall be filed with the Tax Administrator on a form or
forms furnished by or obtainable upon request from such Administrator, or an
acceptable generic form that contains all of the information required to be
submitted with the City’s prescribed form setting forth:
      (1)   The aggregate amounts of qualifying wages, including sick and
vacation pay, bonuses, commissions, incentive payments, settlements, stock
options, grievance pay, severance pay, any pay as part of an employee buyout or
wage continuation plan, other compensation earned, received, apportioned or set
aside from each employer, gambling winnings, and the net profits from any
business, profession or other activity, including the rental from use of real
and personal property, distributive shares from pass-through entities and other
income defined by statute as taxable, received for the period covered by the
return and such other pertinent facts and information in detail as the Tax
Administrator may require.
      (2)   The amount of the tax imposed by this chapter on such earnings and
profits; and
      (3)   Such other pertinent statements, information returns, copies of
federal or state tax returns and/or schedules or other information as the Tax
Administrator may require, including a statement that the figures used in the
return are the figures used in the return for federal income tax, adjusted to
set forth only such income as is taxable under the provisions of this chapter.
      (4)   Information returns, schedules and statements required to support
tax returns which are incomplete without such information shall be filed within
the time limits set forth for the filing of the tax returns and the failure to
file such information returns, schedules and statements shall be a violation of
this chapter.  Provided, however, that the taxpayer shall have ten (10) days
after notification by the Tax Administrator, or his authorized representative,
to file the items required by this paragraph.
      (5)   The Tax Administrator shall accept a generic form of any return,
report, or document required to be filed if the generic form once completed and
filed contains all of the information required to be submitted with the City’s
prescribed returns, reports or documents, and if the taxpayer or return
preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with this chapter and Rules
and Regulations governing the filing of returns, reports or documents.
      (6)   Where figures of total income, deductions, and net profits are
included, as shown by a federal return, any items of income that are not
subject to the City tax and unallowable expenses shall be eliminated in
determining net income subject to the City tax. The fact that any taxpayer is
not required to file a federal tax return does not relieve him from filing a
City tax return.
      (7)   If a change in federal income tax liability, made by the Internal
Revenue Service, or by a judicial decision, results in an additional amount of
tax payable to the City, a report of such change shall be filed by the taxpayer
within three (3) months after receipt of the final notice from the Internal
Revenue Service or final court decision.
      (8)   If a change in federal income tax liability results in a reduction
of taxes owed and paid to the City, a claim for refund shall be filed with the
Tax Administrator as prescribed in Section
171.11.
   (d)   Extensions.
      (1)   Any taxpayer that has requested an extension for filing a federal
income tax return may request an extension for the filing of the City’s tax
return.  The taxpayer shall make the request by filing a copy of the taxpayer’s
request for a federal filing extension with the Tax Administrator.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to file a federal income tax return may
request an extension for filing the City’s tax return in writing.
      (3)   The request for extension shall be filed not later than the last
day for filing the City’s tax return as prescribed by this chapter and Rules
and Regulations.
      (4)   A valid extension request extends the due date for filing a return
to the last day of the month following the month to which the due date of the
federal income tax return has been extended.
      (5)   The Tax Administrator may deny a taxpayer’s request for extension
if the taxpayer:
         A.   Fails to timely file the request;
         B.   Fails to file a copy of the federal extension request (if
applicable);
         C.   Owes the City any delinquent income tax or any penalty, interest,
assessment or other charge for the late payment or nonpayment of income tax;
         D.   Has failed to file any required income tax return, report, or
other related document for a prior tax period.
      (6)   The granting of an extension for filing a City income tax return
does not extend the due date for paying of the tax; hence, penalty and interest
may apply to any unpaid tax during the period of extension at the rate set out
by Section
171.10.  No penalty shall be assessed in those cases in which the return is
filed and the final tax paid within the extension period provided all other
filing and payment requirements of the City Tax Code have been met.  Any
extension by the Tax Administrator shall be granted with the understanding that
declaration filing and payment requirements have been fulfilled; however, if,
upon further examination it then becomes evident that declaration filing and
payment requirements have not been fulfilled, penalty and interest may be
assessed in full and in the same manner as though no extension had been
granted. 
      (7)   Information returns, schedules and statements needed to support tax
returns are to be filed within the time limits set forth for filing the tax
returns.
   (e)   Payment with Returns.
      (1)   The taxpayer making a return shall, at the time of the filing
thereof, pay to the Tax Administrator the amount of taxes shown as due
thereon.  However, where any portion of the tax so due shall have been deducted
at the source, pursuant to the provisions of Section
171.06, where any portion of such tax shall have been paid by the taxpayer,
pursuant to the provisions of Section
171.07, or where an income tax, creditable against the City tax pursuant to
Section
171.14 has been paid to another taxing municipality, credit for the amount so
paid shall be deducted from the amount shown to be due and only the balance, if
any, shall be due and payable at the time of filing the return. 
      (2)   Subject to the limitations contained in Section
171.11(b), a taxpayer who has overpaid the amount of tax to which the City is
entitled under the provisions of this chapter may have such overpayment applied
against any subsequent liability hereunder or, at his election indicated on the
return, such overpayment, or part thereof, shall be refunded, provided that no
additional taxes or refunds of less than one dollar ($1.00) shall be collected
or refunded.
   (f)   Amended Returns.
      (1)   Where necessary an amended return must be filed in order to report
additional income and pay any additional tax due, or claim a refund of tax
overpaid, subject to the requirements and limitations contained in Sections
171.11 and
171.14.  Such amended returns shall be on a form obtainable on request from the
Tax Administrator or upon an acceptable generic form that contains all of the
information required to be submitted with the City’s prescribed form.  A
taxpayer may not change the method of accounting or apportionment of net
profits after the due date for filing the original return.
      (2)   Within three (3) months from the final determination of any federal
tax liability affecting the taxpayer’s City tax liability, such taxpayer shall
make and file an amended City return showing income subject to the City tax
based upon such final determination of federal tax liability, and pay any
additional tax shown due thereon or make claim for refund of any overpayment.

   171.06  COLLECTION OF TAX AT THE SOURCE.
   (a)   Duty of Withholding and Payment of Tax Withheld by Employer. 
      (1)   It is the duty of each employer within, or doing business within
the City, who employs one or more persons, whether as an employee, officer,
director or otherwise, on a salary, wage, commission or other personal service
compensation basis to deduct, each time any such compensation is paid,
allocated or set aside to an employee the tax at the rate provided in Section
171.03 hereof on the qualifying wages, including sick and vacation pay,
bonuses, commissions, incentive payments, settlements, stock options, grievance
pay, severance pay, any pay as part of an employee buyout or wage continuation
plan or other compensation due by such employer to each such employee and
shall, on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the month following such
withholding, make a return and pay to the Tax Administrator the amount of taxes
so deducted.  However, the Tax Administrator shall have the authority to grant
to employers with three or less resident employees permission for said
employees to file individually. The return shall be on a form or forms
prescribed by or acceptable to the Tax Administrator and shall be subject to
the Rules and Regulations prescribed by the Tax Administrator.  Nothing in this
section prohibits an employer from withholding tax on a basis greater than
qualifying wages.  The tax shall be deducted by the employer from:
         A.   The gross amount of all salaries, wages, including sick and
vacation pay, bonuses, commissions, incentive payments, settlements, stock
options, grievance pay, severance pay, any pay as part of an employee buyout or
wage continuation plan or other forms of compensation subject to the City
income tax paid, allocated or set aside to residents of the City, regardless of
the place where services are rendered; and 
         B.   The gross amount of all salaries, wages, including sick and
vacation pay, bonuses, commissions, incentive payments, settlements, stock
options, grievance pay, severance pay, any pay as part of an employee buyout or
wage continuation plan or other forms of compensation subject to the City
income tax paid, allocated or set aside to nonresidents for work done or
service performed or rendered in the City or as a result of employment in the
City or other activities engaged in within the City.
         C.   An employer is liable for the payment of the tax required to be
deducted and withheld, whether or not such tax in fact has been withheld.
      (2)   All employers within or doing business within the City are required
to makethe collections and deductions specified, regardless of the fact that
the services on account of which any particular deduction is required, as to
residents of the City, were performed outside the City.
      (3)   Employers who do not maintain a permanent office or place of
business in the City, but who are subject to tax on net profits attributable to
the City, under the method of allocation provided for in this chapter, are
considered to be employers within the City and subject to the requirements of
withholding.
      (4)   Commissions and fees paid to professionals, brokers and others who
are independent contractors, and not employees of the payer, are not subject to
withholding or collection of the tax at the source. Such taxpayers must in all
instances file a declaration and return and pay the tax pursuant to the
provisions of this chapter and Rules and Regulations.
      (5)    Where a nonresident receives compensation for personal services
rendered or performed partly within and partly without the City, the
withholding employer shall deduct, withhold and remit the tax on that portion
of the compensation which is earned within the City in accordance with the
following rules of apportionment:
         A.   If an employer is located within the City, all non-resident
employees who report to the City location are taxable to the City unless the
employer is withholding tax for other taxing municipalities where the
employee’s work is performed.  For purposes of determining the tax liability of
non-resident employees who report to the City location and who perform their
work in non-taxing locations, a flat percentage of twenty percent (20%) will be
used as the percent of time in the City, provided the wages were withheld
correctly. 
         B.   If the nonresident is a salesman, agent or other employee whose
compensation depends directly on the volume of business transacted or chiefly
effected by him, the deducting and withholding shall attach to the portion of
the entire compensation which the volume of business transacted or chiefly
effected by the employee within the City bears to the total volume of business
transacted by him within and outside the City.
         C.   The deducting and withholding of personal service compensation of
other nonresident employees, including officers of corporations shall attach to
the proportion of the personal service compensation of such employee which the
total number of his working hours within the City is of the total number of
working hours.
         D.   The fact that nonresident employees are subject to call at any
time does not permit the apportionment of pay for time worked within the City
on a seven-day per week basis. The percentage of time worked in the City will
be computed on the basis of a forty-hour week unless the employer notifies the
Tax Administrator that a greater or lesser number of hours per week is worked.
            1.   The determination of tax liability of nonresidents working in
and out of the corporate limits is to be computed on the formula of the total
number of days worked in the City divided by the total number of days worked
during the year and the resulting percentage applied to the total annual income
from qualifying wages including sick leave, holiday pay, vacation pay and other
wage continuation plans during periods of disability, sickness or absence from
work. Where no record can be substantiated of the number of days worked, the
figure 260 is to be used as the total number of days worked.
         E.   Wages of occasional entrants as defined in Section
171.03(a)(2)C. are not subject to withholding.
         F.   Wage continuation plans paid by the employer or third party agent
on behalf of the employer for the purpose of health, rest, recuperation or
other reward are deemed to have the same tax situs as the primary job
assignment or job location of the employee and are taxable on the same ratio as
the normal earnings of such employee for this primary job assignment.
      (6)   An employer shall withhold the tax on the full amount of any
advances made to an employee on account of commissions.
      (7)   An employer required to withhold the tax on compensation paid to an
employee shall, in determining the amount on which the tax is to be withheld,
ignore any amount allowed and paid to the employee for expenses necessarily and
actually incurred by the employee in the actual performance of his services,
provided such expenses are incurred in earning compensation, including
commissions, and are not deducted as a business expense by the employee.
      (8)   An employer whose records show that an employee is a nonresident of
the City and has no knowledge to the contrary shall be relieved of the
responsibility of withholding the tax on personal service compensation paid to
such employee for services rendered or work done outside the City by such
employee, provided, however, that such employer must withhold the tax on all
personal service compensation paid such employee after the Tax Administrator
notifies said employer in writing that such employee is a resident of the City.
All employees are required to notify the employer of any change of residence
and the date thereof.
      (9)   An employer shall not be required to withhold the City tax from the
qualifying wages earned by a resident of the City for work done or services
performed in another taxing municipality which imposes a tax upon such
qualifying wages of such City resident if such employer withholds the tax on
such resident's wages or other compensation for such other taxing
municipality.  Except, where such municipal tax is for a smaller amount than
the tax imposed by this chapter, the employer shall withhold and remit the
difference to the City.
      (10)   The Tax Administrator shall have authority to enter into agreement
with other taxing municipalities permitting an employer to withhold the entire
tax on the qualifying wages, including sick and vacation pay, bonuses,
commissions, incentive payments, settlements, stock options, grievance pay,
severance pay, any pay as part of an employee buyout or wage continuation plan
or other forms of compensation subject to the City income tax of a floater
either for the taxing municipality in which the employer has his principal
place of business or the taxing municipality in which the employee resides.
   (b)   An employer is not required to make any withholding with respect to an
individual’s disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the
time of the disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of the
corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued.
   (c)   (1)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer to withhold the tax as required by a municipal
corporation or by the employer’s exemption from the requirement to withhold the
tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer to remit to the municipal corporation
the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability for that tax unless the
employee colluded with the employer in connection with the failure to remit the
tax withheld.
   (d)   Compensation deferred before the effective date of this amendment is
not subject to any municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax
withholding requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not
constitute qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or
distributed.
   (e)   So long as the taxes withheld by an employer for the City during the
measurement period are less than three hundred dollars ($300.00) per month,
payments may be made quarterly on or before the last day of the month following
the end of the quarter, subject to the approval of the Tax Administrator.  The
Tax Administrator may grant an exemption to an employer from the duty to make
payment of withheld taxes by electronic funds transfer upon application for
such exemption by the employer and the employer’s demonstration to the Tax
Administrator that the requirement to make payment of withheld taxes by
electronic funds transfer will impose a hardship upon the employer.  The Tax
Administrator may revoke either approval granted in this section whenever the
Tax Administrator has reason to believe that the conditions for granting such
authorization have changed, were judged incorrectly, were not met, or when it
is in the best interest of the City to do so.  Notice of withdrawal shall be
made in writing and, in such case, the employer must begin to file in
accordance with this section.
(Ord. 2005-57.  Passed 11-29-05; Ord. 2015-40.  Passed 11-24-15.)
   (f)   Employer Considered as Trustee. 
      (1)   Each employer in collecting the tax shall be deemed to hold the
same, until payment is made by such employer to the City, as a trustee for the
benefit of the City, and any such tax collected by such employer from his
employees shall, until the same is paid to the City, be deemed a trust fund in
the hands of such employer. 
      (2)   Each employer shall be liable for the payment of the tax required
to be deducted and withheld, whether or not such tax in fact has been withheld.
   (g)   Personal Liability for Collection and Payment of Tax.  Any person who
is required to withhold tax from qualifying wages, including sick and vacation
pay, bonuses, commissions, incentive payments, settlements, stock options,
grievance pay, severance pay, any pay as part of an employee buyout or wage
continuation plan or other compensation, shall pay all such tax to the City in
accordance with the provisions of this section.  In the event taxes withheld
from the qualifying wages of employees are not paid to the City in accordance
with the provisions of this section, all officers, members, managers,
employees, and trustees having control or supervision of or charged with the
responsibility of filing the return and making payment are jointly and
severally personally liable for the tax not returned or paid to the City as
well as any related interest and penalties, and are also criminally liable
under the provisions of Section
171.12.  The dissolution, termination, or bankruptcy of a corporation, limited
liability company, or business trust does not discharge an officer’s, member’s,
manager’s, employee’s, or trustee’s liability for a failure of the corporation,
limited liability company, or business trust to file returns or pay said taxes.
   (h)   Withholding Return; List of Employees. 
      (1)   Each employer shall file a withholding tax reconciliation form
showing the sum total of all compensation paid all employees, the portion of
which, if any, was not subject to withholding along with an explanation for
same, and the portion of which was subject to withholding, together with the
amount of such withholdings remitted.  Such return shall include Form W-2 for
each employee or a list of employees containing W-2 information concerning each
employee from whom the City tax was withheld, showing the name, address, zip
code and social security number of each such employee, the total amount of
compensation paid during the year and the amount of City tax withheld.  If the
total tax withheld from any employee included tax withheld and remitted to
another taxing municipality, the amount of same shall be separately shown on
the return of information to the City concerning each employee.  The
withholding tax reconciliation shall be filed by each employer on or before
February 28 following the end of such calendar year.
      (2)   If more than the amount of tax required to be deducted by this
chapter is withheld from the employee's pay, the excess shall be refunded by
the employer to the employee. If less than the amount of tax required to be
deducted is deducted and withheld by the employer in any pay period or pay
periods, the deficiency shall be deducted in subsequent pay periods.
      (3)   When an employer has withheld the tax from all wages of a
nonresident of the City and such nonresident has been employed outside the City
for all or a part of the time and has been withheld for or has paid taxes due
another municipality as a result of that employment, such employee shall file a
claim with the Tax Administrator covering such erroneous withholding and the
Tax Administrator shall, upon verification thereof by the employer, refund to
the employee the amount of such withholding paid to another municipality,
subject to the requirements and limitations contained in Sections
171.11 and
171.14. 
   (i)   Form 1099 Reporting.  In addition to the wage reporting of this
section, any person required by the Internal Revenue Service to report on Form
1099-Misc. payments to individuals not treated as employees for services
performed shall also report such payment to the City when the services were
performed in the City.  The information may be submitted on a listing, and
shall include the name, address and social security number (or federal
identification number), and the amount of the payments made.  Federal Form(s)
1099 may be submitted in lieu of such listing.  The information shall be filed
annually on or before February 28.
   (j)   Domestic Servants.  However, no person shall be required to withhold
the tax on the qualifying wages, commissions, other compensation and other
taxable income paid to domestic servants employed exclusively in or about such
person’s residence.  However, such domestic servants shall be responsible for
filing and paying their own returns and taxes.
   (k)   Fractional Parts Of Cents. In deducting and withholding tax at the
source and in payment of any tax due under the Ordinance, a fractional part of
a cent shall be disregarded unless it amounts to one-half cent (.005) or more
in which case it shall be increased to one cent (.01).
(Ord. 2003-96E.  Passed 12-23-03; Ord. 2015-40.  Passed 11-24-15.)
   171.07  DECLARATIONS.
   (a)   Requirement for Filing. 
      (1)   Every person who anticipates any taxable income which is not or
will not be withheld by an employer or employers subject to Section
171.06, or who engages in any business, profession, enterprise or activity
subject to the tax imposed by Section
171.03, shall file a declaration setting forth such estimated income or the
estimated profit or loss from such business activity together with the
estimated tax due thereon, if any.  Provided, however, if a person’s income is
wholly from qualifying wages from which the tax will be withheld and remitted
to this City in accordance with Sections
171.03,
171.06 and
171.14, such person need not file a declaration.
      (2)   A taxpayer’s final return for the preceding year may be used as the
basis for computing his declaration of estimated tax for the current year.  In
the event a taxpayer has not previously been required to file a return, a
declaration of estimated tax on anticipated income shall be filed in good
faith.
   (b)   Dates for Filing.
      (1)    Such declaration shall be filed on or before April 15th of each
year during the effective period of this chapter, or on or before the fifteenth
(15th) day of the fourth (4th) month following the date the taxpayer first
becomes subject to the provisions of this section.
      (2)   Those taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a
declaration on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth (4th) month
following the start of each fiscal year or period.
   (c)   Forms: Credit for Tax Withheld or Paid Another Taxing Municipality.
      (1)   Such declaration shall be filed upon a form furnished by or
obtainable from the Tax Administrator, or upon an acceptable generic form that
contains all of the information required to be submitted with the City’s
prescribed form.  Credit shall be taken in such declaration for City tax to be
withheld from any portion of such income and for income taxes to be paid to
another taxing municipality for which credit is allowed against City tax under
Section
171.14.
      (2)   For taxpayers who are individuals, such declaration of estimated
tax to be paid the Municipality shall be accompanied by a payment of at least
twenty- two and one-half percent (22.5%) of the estimated tax liability for the
current year and at least a similar amount shall be paid on or before the last
day of the seventh (7th), tenth (10th) and thirteenth (13th) months after the
beginning of the taxable year.
      (3)   For taxpayers that are not individuals, such declaration of
estimated tax to be paid the Municipality shall be accompanied by a payment of
at least twenty-two and one-half percent (22.5%) of the estimated tax liability
for the current year and at least a similar amount shall be paid on or before
the fifteenth (15th) day of the sixth (6th), ninth (9th) and twelfth (12th)
months after the beginning of the taxable year.
      (4)   The mere submission of a declaration estimating a tax liability
shall not constitute filing unless accompanied by the required payment. 
   (d)   Amended Declaration.
      (1)   A declaration may be amended at any time, provided, however, that
in case an amended declaration is filed, the unpaid balance shown due thereon
shall be paid in equal installments on or before the remaining payment dates.
      (2)   An amended declaration must be filed on or before the last day of
the month following the close of the taxpayer’s tax year, if it appears that
the original declaration made for such year underestimated the taxpayer’s
income by ten percent (10%) or more.  At such time a payment, which together
with prior payments, is sufficient to pay the taxpayer’s entire estimated
liability, shall be made.  If, upon the filing of the return required it
appears that the taxpayer did not pay ninety percent (90%) of his tax
liability, as shown on such return, on or before the last day of the month
following the close of the tax year, the difference between ninety percent
(90%) of such taxpayer’s tax liability and the amount of estimated tax he
actually paid on or before such date shall be subject to the interest and
penalty provisions of Section
171.10.
      (3)   In the event an amended declaration has been filed the unpaid
balance shown due thereon shall be paid in equal installments over the
remaining payment dates. 
   (e)   Annual Return Required.  On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the
fourth (4th) month following the end of the calendar or fiscal year an annual
return shall be filed and any balance which may be due the City shall be paid
therewith in accordance with the provisions of Section
171.05.

unpaid taxes, interest and penalties on a schedule of installment payments,

hardship conditions, he is unable to pay the full amount of the tax due. Such
authorization shall not be granted until the proper returns are filed by the
taxpayer for all amounts owed by him under this chapter.
      (5)   Failure to make any deferred payment when due shall cause the total

filed a return which does not show the proper amount of tax due, the Tax
Administrator may determine the amount of tax appearing to be due the City from
the taxpayer, may assess the taxpayer upon the basis of such determination and
may send to such taxpayer a written statement showing the amount of tax so
determined, together with interest and penalties thereon, if any.
      (2)   Such determination of tax may be adjusted upon submission by the
taxpayer of actual records from which his tax may be computed.

Administrator shall have the power to compromise penalty and interest
liabilities imposed by this Ordinance, consistent with this chapter and Rules
and Regulations.

   171.10  INTEREST AND PENALTIES.
   (a)   All taxes imposed and monies withheld or required to be withheld by
employers under the provisions of this chapter and remaining unpaid after they
become due shall bear interest at the same rate which Section 718.12 of the
Ohio Revised Code requires be paid by municipalities on their income tax
refunds, i.e., the federal short-term rate as defined in Section 5703.47 of the
Ohio Revised Code, as amended, plus three percent (3%) per year.
   (b)   In addition to interest as provided in subsection (a) hereof,
penalties for failure to pay taxes and to withhold and remit taxes pursuant to
the provisions of this chapter are hereby imposed as follows:
      (1)   In the case of taxpayers and/or residents failing to file a tax
return by the due date or by the date resulting from an extension, and/or
failing to pay the full amount of tax due, other than taxes withheld:  the
higher of twenty- five dollars ($25.00) or one percent (1%) per month or

      (3)   Where the taxpayer has failed to file a declaration on which he has

   171.11  COLLECTION OF UNPAID TAXES AND REFUNDS OF OVERPAYMENTS.
   (a)   Unpaid Sums – A Civil Debt.
      (1)   All taxes imposed by this chapter and not paid when due shall be
collectible, together with any interest and penalties thereon, by suit as other
debts of like amount are recoverable.  Employers who are required, under
Section
171.06, to withhold or remit the taxes required to be withheld at the source
and who fail to withhold or remit, become liable to the City in a civil action
to enforce the payment of the debt created by such failure.
      (2)   No additional assessment shall be made by the Tax Administrator
after three (3)  years from the time the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later.  Provided, however, there shall be no period of limitation
on an additional assessment in a case of a return that omits gross income in
excess of twenty-five percent (25%) of that required to be reported or in the
case of filing a false or fraudulent return with intent to evade the tax, or in
the case of failure to file a return.
      (3)   In those cases in which the Commissioner of Internal Revenue
Service and the taxpayer have executed a waiver of the federal statute of
limitations the period within which an additional assessment may be made by the
Tax Administrator shall be extended one (1) year from the time of the final
determination of the federal tax liability.
   (b)   Refunds and Overpayments.
      (1)   Taxes erroneously paid shall not be refunded unless a claim for
refund is made within three (3) years from the date on which such payment was
made or the return was due, or within three (3) months after final
determination of the federal tax liability, whichever is later.
      (2)   No refund shall be made to any taxpayer until he has complied with
all provisions of this chapter and has furnished all information required by
the Tax Administrator.
      (3)   Overpayments will be either refunded or credited to the taxpayer's
current liability at his option.  Where the taxpayer has made no election,
overpayments of any year's taxes shall be applied as follows:
         A.   To taxes owed for any previous years in the order in which such
taxes become due.
         B.   To current estimated tax liability
   (c)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any City income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment, except that if
any overpayment is refunded within ninety (90) days after the final filing date
of the annual return or ninety (90) days after the complete return is filed,
whichever is later, no interest shall be allowed on the refunded overpayment. 
For purposes of computing the payment of interest on overpayments, no amount of
tax for any taxable year shall be treated as having been paid before the date
on which the tax return for that year was due without regard to any extension
of time for filing that return.  The interest shall be paid at the rate of
interest prescribed by Ohio Revised Code 5703.47.
   (d)   Amounts of less than ten dollars ($10.00) shall not be collected,
refunded or credited.  (Ord. 2003-96E.  Passed 12-23-03; Ord.  2015-40.  Passed

incentive payments, settlements, stock options, grievance pay, severance pay,

income tax has been paid on such income to another taxing municipality or to a
joint economic development zone or district created under Sections 715.69
through 715.83 of the Ohio Revised Code, the taxpayer shall claim a credit of
the amount of tax paid by him or on his behalf to such municipality or joint
economic development zone or district, but the credit is limited to the income
apportioned to the other taxing municipality or joint economic development zone
or district times the City tax rate.  No credit is given for county or school
district taxes paid; only other municipal taxes.

the second municipal corporation shall allow a nonrefundable credit against the
tax or withholding the second municipality claims is due with respect to such
income or wages, equal to the tax or withholding paid to the first municipal
corporation with respect to such income or wages.

authority of the taxing municipality to which the taxes are paid that a City
resident or his employer is paying the tax shall be considered as fulfilling
the requirement of this section.

chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a comparable
context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax
and in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised Code and the use is not consistent, then
the use of the term in the laws of the United States relating to federal income
tax shall control over the use of the term in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised

other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (J)    A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.
   (K)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax
on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.

behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (B)(1)(a) of this section among those two or more municipal
corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and reasonable
method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among such municipal
corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales made by the
employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal corporation to which
qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall be the employee's
"principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying wages for the
purposes of this section.
For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends a
particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division (B)(2) of this
section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal
corporation" wherever "municipal corporation" appears in that division.
   (B)   (1)    Subject to divisions (C), (E), and (F) of this section, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on qualifying wages

than twenty days of actual services to complete the services;
            (ii)    The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform actual services
at the location for more than twenty days.
         (c)    The employee is a resident of the Municipality and has
requested that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages
as provided in Section
172.051 of this Chapter.
               (d)    The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
      (2)     For the purposes of division (B)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day.  For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         (a)    Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         (b)    Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         (c)    Traveling from any location to another location in order to
pick up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that
has been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished,
processed, remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
         (d)    Transporting or delivering property described in division (B)
(2)(c) of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the
employee does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate
owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
         (e)    Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (C)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
   (D)   (1)    Except as provided in division (D)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)    If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (E)    Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
172.03 of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (F)    Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
172.051 of this Chapter.

   "Municipal Taxable Income" for a taxpayer who is not an individual for the
Municipality is calculated as follows:
   (A)   "Income" reduced by "Exempt Income" to the extent otherwise included
in income, multiplied by apportionment, further reduced by any "Pre-2017 Net
Operating Loss Carryforward" equals "Municipal Taxable Income".
      (1)   "INCOME" for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the "Net
Profit" of the taxpayer. 
         (a)   "Net Profit" for a person other than an individual is defined in
Section
 172.03(W). 
         (b)   "Adjusted Federal Taxable Income" is defined in Section
172.03(A) of this Chapter.
      (2)   "EXEMPT INCOME" is defined in Section

   This section applies to any taxpayer engaged in a business or profession in
the Municipality unless the taxpayer is an individual who resides in the
Municipality or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company, or
telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under Chapter
5745 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (A)   Net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a

the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)    The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,
wherever the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from
which taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
172.052 of this Chapter;
      (3)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B)      (1)    If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of
this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business
activity in the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax
Administrator of the Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with
respect to all or any portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative
apportionment method involving one or more of the following:
         (a)    Separate accounting;
         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
Municipality;
         (d)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of Section
 172.19 of this Chapter.
      (3)    A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of Section
172.19 of this Chapter.
      (4)    Nothing in division (B) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
   (C)    As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)    A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:

         (b)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)    Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)    For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal
corporation as follows:
      (1)    Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall

purposes of this division, a sale of property originates in a municipal
corporation if, regardless of where title passes, the property meets any of the
following criteria in (a), (b) or (c) for taxable years beginning on or after
January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2017; and only if, regardless of where
title passes, the property meets either of the following criteria (a) or (b)
for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018:
         (a)    The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         (b)    The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from
a location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is
regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of
sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
         (c)    The property is shipped from a place within the municipal
corporation to purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the
taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the
solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
      (2)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (E)    The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in
which the property generating the net profit is located and the municipal
corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit
resides.
A municipal corporation shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate
accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this
division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
      (1)   For purposes of the application of any net operating loss realized
from the rental of real estate, said loss is to be applied using separate
accounting as it relates to those properties within a given municipal taxing
jurisdiction. 
      (2)   Common or shared expenses relating to rental real estate shall be
allocated equally among all rental properties. 
   (F)   (1)    Except as provided in division (F)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation
in which the real estate is located.  Net profit reported by the real estate
agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
      (2)     An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation.  The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section
172.081 of this Chapter.
   (G)     If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (K)(12) and (GG)(1)(c) of Section
172.03 of this Chapter, by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has
apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that
is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to
that municipal corporation.  In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to
its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount
other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were
the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation. 
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.
   (H)   When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.  (Ord.  2015-40.  Passed 11-24-

   (B)   (1)    For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the municipal
income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable

Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the
last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a

Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year

172.03 of this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
172.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to municipal income taxation as a
separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of the entity's
net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated federal
taxable income of the affiliated group.

consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
172.062 of this Chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group. The entity shall be subject to
taxation as a separate taxpayer on that portion of the entity's net profit or
loss not included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated
group and sitused to the municipal corporation. 
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
172.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section
172.062 of this Chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.

172.07  DECLARATION OF ESTIMATED TAX.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "ESTIMATED TAXES" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's tax liability for a municipal corporation's
income tax for the current taxable year.
      (2)    "TAX LIABILITY" means the total taxes due to a municipal

the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars. For the
purposes of this section:
         (a)    Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as
paid to the municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld in equal
amounts on each payment date. If the taxpayer establishes the dates on which
all amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as
paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)    An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic
funds transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division,
"DATE OF THE POSTMARK" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
         (c)   A taxpayer having a taxable year of less than twelve months
shall make a declaration under rules prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
         (d)    Taxes withheld by a casino operator or by a lottery sales agent

      (2)   Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations of
estimated taxes.
        (3)    The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before
the date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under
division (G) of Section
172.091 of this Chapter or on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month
of the first taxable year after the taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the
first time.
      (4)    Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a
declaration on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of each fiscal year or period.
      (5)    The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
   (C)   (1)    The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the Municipality or
Tax Administrator, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes
and withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half per cent of the tax
liability for the taxable year;

beginning of the taxable year, forty-five per cent of the tax liability for the
taxable year;
         (c)    On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half per cent of the tax
liability for the taxable year;

month of the following taxable year, ninety percent of the tax liability for
the taxable year.  For a person other than a individual, on or before the
fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the taxable year, ninety per cent of the
tax liability for the taxable year.
      (2)    A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by the
Tax Administrator.  When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid
balance shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal
installments on or before the remaining payment dates.  The amended declaration
must be filed on the next applicable due date as outlined in (C)(1)(a) through
(d) of this section.
      (3)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with section
172.091 of this Chapter.
         (a)     For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals
and are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return is
due on the same date as the filing of the federal tax return, unless extended
pursuant to division (G) of section 5747.08 of the Revised Code.
         (b)     For taxpayers who are not individuals, and are reporting and
filing on a fiscal year basis or any period other than a calendar year, the
annual return is due on the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end
of the taxable year or period.
      (4)     An amended declaration is required whenever the taxpayer's
estimated tax liability changes during the taxable year.  A change in estimated
tax liability may either increase or decrease the estimated tax liability for
the taxable year.
   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
172.10 of this Chapter upon the amount of underpayment for the period of
underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described
in division (E) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be
determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by
the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;
         (c)    For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by
the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)    For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety per
cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety per cent of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined
by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the municipal corporation under Section
172.091 of this Chapter for that year.
      (3)     The  taxpayer  is  an  individual  who  resides  in  the
Municipality  but was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the
calendar year that includes the first day of the taxable year.
   (F)   A Tax Administrator may waive the requirement for filing a declaration
of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that the waiver is
reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other factors.

172.08  CREDIT FOR TAX PAID. 
172.081  CREDIT FOR MUNICIPAL INCOME TAX PAID.
   (A)    Resident Individual.
      (1)   An individual taxpayer who resides in the municipality, and earns
qualifying wages for work done or services performed or rendered in any
municipal corporation, shall be allowed a credit in the amount of municipal
income tax paid on the same income (i.e. on each dollar taxed) by or on behalf
of that individual if it is demonstrated that a municipal income tax has been
so paid.  Such credit shall be allowed only to the extent of the tax levied by
this chapter.
      (2)   An individual taxpayer who resides in the municipality, and
receives or wins prizes, awards, sweepstakes, and other income associated with
any lottery winnings, gambling and sports winnings, or other similar games of
chance in any municipal corporation shall be allowed a credit in the amount of
municipal income tax paid on the same income (i.e. on each dollar taxed) by or
on behalf of that individual if it is demonstrated that a municipal income tax
has been so paid.  Such credit shall be allowed only to the extent of the tax
levied by this chapter.
       (3)   A resident individual with income from an ownership interest in
one or more pass-through entities, activities of a sole proprietor, or rental
activities, after the deduction of distributable losses from other pass-through
entities or business activities not utilized as a net operating loss carry-
forward in any municipal taxing jurisdiction after January 1, 2018 shall be
allowed a non-refundable credit for the amount so paid on the same income (i.e.
on each dollar taxed) by or on behalf of the resident individual in such other
municipal corporation only to the extent of the tax levied by this chapter.
      (4)   The credit for tax paid by a resident individual for salaries or
wages earned in a non-resident municipal corporation is limited to the tax that
is paid on the same income (i.e. on each dollar taxed) after all allowable 2106
expenses have been deducted and shall not exceed the tax established by this
chapter. 
      (5)   If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other
municipality, then for purposes of this division, the income subject to tax in
the other municipality shall be limited to the amount computed by dividing the
tax withheld or paid to the other municipality by the tax rate for that
municipality.
      (6)   No credit shall be given to a resident individual for any county or
school district income tax. 
   (B)   Non-resident individual.
      (1)   Every individual taxpayer who is a non-resident of the municipality
who earned qualifying wages for work done or services performed or rendered in
the municipality, shall be allowed a credit for the amount so paid if it is
demonstrated that a municipal income tax has been paid by or on behalf of that
individual to the municipality. Such credit shall be applied only to the extent
of the tax levied by this chapter.
      (2)   A non-resident individual with ownership interest in one or more
pass-through entities taxed at the entity level shall not report said income or
losses on a non-resident individual annual return and shall not be allowed any
credit for taxes paid on their behalf by the pass-through entity to any
municipal corporation.
      (3)   No credit shall be given to a non-resident individual for any
county or school district income tax.  (Ord.  2019-45-E.  Passed 6-18-19.)
172.082  REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR QUALIFYING LOSS.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    “NONQUALIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN" means a compensation
plan described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   (a)    Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) of this section,
"QUALIFYING LOSS" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)    If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   "QUALIFYING TAX RATE" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a
refundable credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a
municipal corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during
the taxable year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the
qualifying loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)    A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)    In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)   (1)    For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)    Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (D)    The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)    The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)    The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
         (Ord.  2015-40.  Passed 11-24-15.)
172.083  CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.
   (A)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
172.096 of this Chapter. 
   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality.  To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in Section
172.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (C)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
172.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   Nothing in this section requires a Municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation.  Section
172.081 of this Chapter regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail. 
(Ord.  2015-40.  Passed 11-24-15.)
172.09  ANNUAL RETURN.
172.091  RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (A)   (1)    Unless the provisions of division (A)(2) of this section apply,
an annual return with respect to the income tax levied on Municipal Taxable
Income by the Municipality shall be completed and filed by every taxpayer for
any taxable year for which the taxpayer is subject to the tax, regardless of
whether or not income tax is due.
      (2)     The Tax Administrator shall accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer located in the Municipality under division
172.051(C) of this Chapter when the nonresident individual taxpayer's sole
income subject to the tax is the qualifying wages reported by the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer, and no additional tax is due to the
Municipality.
      (3)   All resident individual taxpayers, eighteen years of age and older,
shall file an annual municipal income tax return with the Municipality,
regardless of income or liability.  The fact that any resident individual
taxpayer is not required to file a federal return does not relieve the resident
individual taxpayer from filing a Municipality return. 
      (4)   All resident individual taxpayers under the age of eighteen who
have municipal taxable income shall file an annual municipal income tax return
with the Municipality. 
   (B)    If an individual is deceased, any return or notice required of that
individual shall be completed and filed by that decedent's executor,
administrator, or other person charged with the property of that decedent.
   (C)    If an individual is unable to complete and file a return or notice
required by the Municipality in accordance with this chapter, the return or
notice required of that individual shall be completed and filed by the
individual's duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other
person charged with the care of the person or property of that individual. 
Such duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person
charged with the care of the person or property of that individual shall
provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to support
that they are authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the taxpayer. 
This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and contact
information including name, address, and phone number of the duly authorized
agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person.
   (D)    Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be
completed and filed by the fiduciary of the estate or trust.  Such fiduciary
shall provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to
support that they are authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the
taxpayer.  This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and
contact information including name, address, and phone number of the fiduciary.
   (E)   No municipal corporation shall deny spouses the ability to file a
joint return.
   (F)   (1)    Each return required to be filed under this section shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer, and shall include
the taxpayer's social security number or taxpayer identification number. Each
return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of perjury.
      (2)    A taxpayer who is an individual is required to include, with each
annual return, amended return, or request for refund required under this
section, copies of only the following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal
Revenue Service form W-2, "Wage and Tax Statements," including all information
reported on the taxpayer's federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or
withheld for any municipal corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service
form 1040 and, with respect to an amended tax return or refund request, any
other documentation necessary to support the refund request or the adjustments
made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer who files the annual return
required by this section electronically is not required to provide paper copies
of any of the foregoing to the Tax Administrator unless the Tax Administrator
requests such copies after the return has been filed.   
      (3)    A taxpayer that is not an individual is required to include, with
each annual net profit return, amended net profit return, or request for refund
required under this section, copies of only the following documents: the
taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form 1065, form 1120, form 1120-
REIT, form 1120F, or form 1120S, and, with respect to an amended tax return or
refund request, any other documentation necessary to support the refund request
or the adjustments made in the amended return.
      (4)   A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net
profit return electronically through the Ohio business gateway or in some other
manner shall either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax
Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available,
submit the documents electronically through the Ohio business gateway or a
portal provided by Municipality. The department of taxation shall publish a
method of electronically submitting the documents required under this division
through the Ohio business gateway on or before January 1, 2016. The department
shall transmit all documents submitted electronically under this division to
the appropriate Tax Administrator. 
      (5)    After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (6)   Any other documentation, including 1099s, schedules, other
municipal income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to
verify credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall
also be included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax
Administrator of undocumented credits or losses.
   (G)   (1)    (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under division
(G) of section 5747.08 of the Ohio Revised Code. The taxpayer shall complete
and file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or
on generic forms, together with remittance made payable to the Municipality or
Tax Administrator.
         (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each annual net
profit income tax return required to be filed under this section by a taxpayer
that is not an individual shall be completed and filed as required by the Tax
Administrator on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the
end of the taxpayer's taxable year or period.  The taxpayer shall complete and
file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on
generic forms, together with remittance made payable to the Municipality or Tax
Administrator.
         (c)   In the case of each individual income tax return required to be
filed by an individual, and each net profit income tax return required to be
filed by a taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the
amount shown to be due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
172.092 of this Chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this
division conflicts with any provision in Section
172.092 of this Chapter, the provision in Section
172.092 of this Chapter prevails. 
   (H)   (1)    For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is ten dollars or less. 
      (2)    Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the
Municipality an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) and (4) of this
section.
   (I)    This division shall not apply to payments required to be made under
Section
172.051(B) of this Chapter. 
      (1)    If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to be
filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or
before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period or
that date to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"THE DATE OF POSTMARK" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)   If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds
transfer the payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the
timestamp assigned by the first electronic system receiving that payment.
   (J)    The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent
of an employer, or other payer as described in Section
 172.051 of this Chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation
as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the
amounts withheld were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld. 
   (K)    Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this chapter and of the
Municipality's ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents. 
   (M)     When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (N)   (1)   As used in this division, "WORKSITE LOCATION" has the same
meaning as in Section
172.052 of this Chapter.
      (2)   A person may notify a Tax Administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (a)   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. 
The Tax Administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer
who has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year. 
      (3)   The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that
briefly explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within the municipal corporation.  The affidavit
also shall include the following statement:  "The affiant has no plans to
perform any services within the municipal corporation, make any sales in the
municipal corporation, or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the
municipal corporation during the taxable year.  If the affiant does become
subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation for the taxable year,
the affiant agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly register as a
taxpayer with the municipal corporation, if such a registration is required by
the municipal corporation's resolutions, ordinances, or rules."  The person
shall sign the affidavit under penalty of perjury.
      (4)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2) of
this section, the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year.  It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with
the provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of
municipal taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an
affidavit has been filed with the Tax Administrator for the taxable year. 
Nothing in division (N) of this section prohibits the Tax Administrator from
performing an audit of the person.  (Ord.  2015-40.  Passed 11-24-15; Ord.

reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the

extension of time for payment of taxes required by the Municipality in
accordance with this chapter during the period of the member's or civilian's
duty service and for one hundred eighty days thereafter. The application shall
be filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after the member's or
civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax
Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (B)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the one hundred eighty-first day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates. Except as provided in division
(B)(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms
as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
      (2)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the Municipality before the one hundred eighty-first day after
the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)    Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (B)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require
any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
   (C)   (1)    Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (A) and (B) of this section.
      (2)   (a)    A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the Municipality in accordance
with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (C)(2)(a)
of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
section, "QUALIFYING TAXPAYER" means a member of the national guard or a member
of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to
active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of
the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces.
         (b)    Taxes, the payment of which are extended in accordance with
division (C)(2)(a) of this section, are not delinquent during the extension
period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.

withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
   (D)     The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,

party to the administration of municipal income taxes or to an appeal of a
municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
   (E)     Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing
the authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce
the provisions of its municipal income tax.

172.094  EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE.

extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax
return.  The extended due date of the municipal income tax return shall be the
fifteenth day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates.  The taxpayer shall attach a copy of said federal
extension request to the municipal income tax return.
   (B)     Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal extension for a
period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return.  The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended federal income tax return.  The
taxpayer shall attach a copy of said federal extension request to the municipal
income tax return.
   (C)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that the Tax
Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return.  If the request is received by the
Tax Administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (D)     An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
   (E)     If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of section 5747.08 of the
Ohio Revised Code, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the
filing of a municipal income tax return.  The extended due date of the
municipal income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of the

return to determine the tax due levied by the Municipality in accordance with
this chapter must be altered.
      (2)   Within sixty days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars or less.
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return, following the provisions of Section
 172.063 of this Chapter. 
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as
provided under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless the
applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
Section
172.19 of this Chapter has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)    The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were

filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (A)(2) of
this section for filing the amended return even if it is filed beyond the
period prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements
of that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars or less, no refund
need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set forth in
division (C)(2) of this section, a request filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed within
the time prescribed in Section
172.096 of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.
      (2)    The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
         (Ord.  2015-40.  Passed 11-24-15.)
172.096    REFUNDS.
   (A)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund or credit, the Tax
Administrator of the Municipality, in accordance with this section, shall
refund or credit to employers, agents of employers, other payers, or taxpayers,
with respect to any income or withholding tax levied by the Municipality:
      (1)    Overpayments of more than ten dollars;
             (2)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund or credit requested
exceeds ten dollars.
   (B)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing.  Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and / or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses. 
      (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)    If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
172.18 of this Chapter.
   (C)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (B) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:

postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)    The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)     The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (D)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
division (A)(4) of Sectio
n 172.10 of this Chapter.

have accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to
accrue and be due. 
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall have sole discretion to determine
whether or not penalty, interest, charges or applicable fees will be charged
through the duration of any compromise or payment-over-time agreement.
   (F)   The Tax Administrator may require that the taxpayer provide detailed
financial documentation and information, in order to determine whether or not a
payment-over-time agreement will be authorized.  The taxpayer's failure to
provide the necessary and required information by the Tax Administrator shall
preclude consideration of a payment-over-time agreement.

172.133  AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE. 
   (A)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter.  Upon written request by
the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice
served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.
   (D)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal and state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply. 
(Ord.  2015-40.  Passed 11-24-15.)
172.134  AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; REQUIRING IDENTIFYING  INFORMATION.
   (A)    The Tax Administrator may require any person filing a tax document
with the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which may
include the person's social security number, federal employer identification
number, or other identification number requested by the Tax Administrator. A
person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information. 
   (B)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
172.10 of this Chapter, in addition to any applicable penalty described in
Section
172.99 of this Chapter.
      (2)    If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (A) of this section
within thirty days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to section
172.10 of this Chapter.
      (3)    The penalties provided for under divisions (B)(1) and (2) of this
section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
172.99 of this Chapter for a violation of
 172.15 of this Chapter and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax
Administrator by law.
         (Ord.  2015-40.  Passed 11-24-15.)
172.14  CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by ORC 718 or by the charter
or ordinance of the Municipality is confidential, and no person shall access or
disclose such information except in accordance with a proper judicial order or
in connection with the performance of that person's official duties or the
official business of the Municipality as authorized by ORC 718 or the charter
or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax Administrator of the Municipality or
a designee thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received

administering this chapter. 
      (1)   All employees of the Municipality Income Tax Department shall
maintain complete confidentiality over all data and statistical information
compiled by them in their capacity as employees of the Municipality Income Tax
Department, subject to the exceptions provided for in this section.  This
section shall apply only to the Municipality income tax, and not to any other
tax data gathered by such employees in the normal course of their employment. 
All confidential information may be subject to Court Order or subpoena, or may
be disclosed upon a proper release executed by the affected taxpayer.
      (2)   The following statistical data may be transmitted to another
Municipality department for internal administrative purposes:  information that
may be obtained from a separate source, including names, addresses and
telephone numbers.
      (3)   The following statistical data may be transmitted to another
Municipality department for internal administrative purposes:  data regarding
the collective payroll withholding taxes of a business entity located within
the Municipality, as long as such business entity involves more than one
individual for whom the withholding tax payments are being generated.
      (4)   The following statistical data may be transmitted to another
Municipality department for internal administrative purposes:  data regarding
the number of employees and the total payroll taxes generated by all employees
of a business entity located within the Municipality as long as the business
entity employs more than one individual at any time.  This data shall only
include the total number of employees and the combined total payroll taxes, and
shall not include earnings or payroll taxes of individual employees of such
business entity.
      (5)   No employee of the Municipality Income Tax Department shall
disclose to the general public or to any other Municipality department data
concerning individual earnings or profits earned by an individual or by a
business entity.  No statistical or administrative data shall be disseminated
or disclosed to members of the general public.
      (6)   Upon proper release, individual data, including confidential data,
may be released.  The Municipality Income Tax Department shall maintain a copy
of the release after such data has been disclosed.
         (Ord.  2015-40.  Passed 11-24-15.)
172.15  FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by municipal corporation ordinance or
state law to be filed with  the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,
or knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment
of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or

Administrator.
(Ord.  2015-40.  Passed 11-24-15.)
172.16  OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   (A)    An "OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR" means an opinion issued under
this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (B)    A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an "opinion of the Tax Administrator" and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (C), (G), and (H) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)    The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)    The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in
accordance with this chapter.
      (3)    The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax
Administrator and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."
   (C)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)    The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax
Administrator sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested.
The effective date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or
one year after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)    The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the Municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)    The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the Municipality's income tax ordinance;
             (4)    If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)    The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)    The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (D)    (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of sectio
n 172.15 of this Chapter. 
   (E)    If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section,
the opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)    The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to
change for any of the reasons stated in division (C) of this section;
      (2)    It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (G)    This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)    An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)    A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under division (F) may not be appealed.
(Ord.  2015-40.  Passed 11-24-15.)
172.17  ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)    The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code. 
      (2)    The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)    Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)    (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division.  A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
         (Ord.  2015-40.  Passed 11-24-15.)
172.18  LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX  REVIEW.
   (A)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio Revised Code
Chapter 718.
      (2)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members.
         (a)   Two members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of
the Municipality, and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors
with the Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years
immediately preceding the date of appointment.
         (b)   One member shall be appointed by the Mayor, the top
administrative official of the Municipality. This member may be an employee of
the Municipality, but may not be the director of finance or equivalent officer,
or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly
involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)    The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the Mayor.
      (4)    Members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by the
legislative authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth
in section 718.11(A)(4) of the Revised Code. 
      (5)    A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)    A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)     If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place.  This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)     Non-employee members of the Local Board of Tax Review shall
receive such compensation as the legislative authority may determine and as may
be restricted by the laws of the State of Ohio. 
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall
be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination.  The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's
final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review.  Such records are not public records
available for inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code.  For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing.  Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code.  For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing.
(Ord.  2015-40.  Passed 11-24-15.)
172.19  ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            (i)    Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "QUALIFYING DEFERRAL PERIOD" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)    Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in
Section
172.18 of this Chapter.  That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five per cent or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
 172.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   (1)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal.  The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)    If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
172.18 of this Chapter, of the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals, or any court to which
the decision of the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals has been appealed, so that the
amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than
the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's
assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as
provided by Section
172.096 of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by
172.096(D) of this Chapter. 
   (E)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)    The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
          (2)    The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of
that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.

   181.01  DEFINITIONS.
   Except where the context otherwise requires, the definitions given in this
section govern the construction of this chapter.
   (a)    "Person" means any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture,
association, social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company,
corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate or any
other group or combination acting as a unit.
   (b)    "Treasurer" means the City Treasurer of the City of Sharonville, or
the Tax Administrator, agent for the Treasurer.
      (Ord.  77-2.  Passed 2-22-77; Ord. 2015-40.  Passed 11-24-15.)
   (c)    "Hotel" means every establishment kept, used, maintained, advertised
or held out to the public to be a place where sleeping accommodations are
offered for a consideration to guests, in which five or more rooms are used for
the accommodation of such guests, whether such rooms are in one or several
structures. (Ord. 77-2. Passed 2-22-77.)
   (d)    "Transient guests" means persons occupying a room or rooms for
sleeping accommodations regardless of the duration of their occupancy.
      (Ord. 90-49. Passed 6-10-90.)
   (e)    "Rent" means the consideration received for occupancy valued in
money, whether received in money or otherwise, including all receipts, cash,
credits and property or services of any kind or nature, and also any amount for
which the occupant is liable for the occupancy without any deduction therefrom
whatsoever.
   (f)    "Operator" means the person who is proprietor of the hotel, whether
in the capacity of owner, lessee, mortgagee, in possession, licensee or any
other capacity. Where the operator performs his functions through a managing
agent of any type or character other than an employee, the managing agent shall
also be deemed an operator for the purposes of this chapter and shall have the
same duties and liabilities as his principal. Compliance with the provisions of
this chapter by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be
considered to be compliance by both.
   (g)    "Occupancy" means the use or possession, or the right to the use or
possession of any room or rooms or space or portion thereof, in any hotel for
dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes. The use or possession or right to use
or possess any room or any suite of connecting rooms as office space, banquet
or private dining rooms, or exhibit, sample or display space shall not be
considered occupancy within the meaning of this definition unless the person
exercising occupancy uses or possesses, or has the right to use or possess all
or any portion of such room or suite of rooms for dwelling, lodging or sleeping
purposes. (Ord. 77-2. Passed 2-22-77.)
   181.02  RATE OF TAX.
   (a)    Commencing on October l, l99l, there is hereby levied an excise tax
of three percent (3%) on all transactions by which lodging by a hotel or motel
is furnished to transient guests. Prior to such time, the rate of tax shall be
one and one-half percent (1-l/2%).
(Ord. 91-50. Passed 6-l l-91.)
   (b)    Such tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient guest to the City
which is extinguished only by payment to the operator as trustee for the City,
or to the City. The transient guest shall pay the tax to the operator of the
hotel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a
proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid
tax shall be due upon the transient guest ceasing to occupy space in the hotel.
If for any reason, the tax due is not paid to the operator of the hotel, the
Treasurer may require that such tax shall be paid directly to the Tax
Administrator. (Ord. 77-2. Passed 2-22-77; Ord.  2015-40.  Passed 11- 24-15.)
   181.03  EXEMPTIONS.
   No tax shall be imposed under this chapter:
   (a)    Upon rents not within the taxing power of the City under the
constitutional laws of Ohio or the United States;
   (b)    Upon rents paid by the State of Ohio or any of its political
subdivisions;
   (c)    Upon rents of two dollars ($2.00) a day or less.
   No exemption claimed under subsections (a) or (b) hereof shall be granted
except upon a claim therefor made at the time rent is collected and under
penalty of perjury upon a form prescribed by the Treasurer. All claims of
exemption under subsection (c) hereof shall be made in the manner prescribed by
the Treasurer. (Ord. 77-2. Passed 2-22-77.)
   181.04  TAX TO BE SEPARATELY STATED AND CHARGED.
   (a)    The tax to be collected shall be stated and charged separately from
the rent and shown separately on any record thereof, at the time when the
occupancy is arranged or contracted and charged for, and upon every evidence of
occupancy or any bill or statement or charge made for such occupancy issued or
delivered by the operator, and the tax shall be paid by the occupant to the
operator as trustee for and on account of the City, and the operator shall be
liable for the collection thereof and for the tax.
   (b)    No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner,
whether directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be
assumed or absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be added to the rent,
or that, if added, any part will be refunded except in the manner hereinafter
provided. (Ord. 77-2. Passed 2-22-77.)
   181.05  REGISTRATION.
   Within thirty days after the effective date of this chapter, or within
thirty days after commencing business, whichever is later, each operator of any
hotel renting lodging to transient guests shall register such hotel with the
Tax Administrator and obtain from him a "Transient Occupancy Registration
Certificate" to be posted at all times in a conspicuous place on the premises.
Such certificate shall, among other things, state the following:
   (a)    The name of the operator;
   (b)    The address of the hotel;
   (c)    The date upon which the certificate was issued;
   (d)    "This Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate signifies that the
person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the Transient
Occupancy Tax Ordinance by registering with the Tax Administratorfor the
purpose of collecting from transient guests the Transient Occupancy Tax and
remitting said tax to the treasurer. This certificate does not constitute a
permit."
      (Ord. 77-2. Passed 2-22-77; Ord.  2015-40.  Passed 11-24-15.)
   181.06  REPORTING AND REMITTING.
   Each operator shall, on or before the last day of the month following the
close of each calendar quarter, or at the close of any shorter reporting period
which may be established by the Treasurer, make a return to the Treasurer, on
forms provided by him, of the total rents charged and received and the amount
of tax collected for transient occupancies. All claims for exemption from tax
filed by occupants with the operator during the reporting period shall be filed
with the report. At the time the return is filed, the full amount of the tax
collected shall be remitted to the Treasurer. The Treasurer may establish
shorter reporting periods for any certificate holder if he deems it necessary
in order to insure collection of the tax and he may require further information
in the return as such information is pertinent to the collection of the tax.
Returns and payments are due immediately upon cessation of business for any
reason. All taxes collected by operators pursuant to this chapter shall be held
in trust for the account of the City until payment thereof is made to the
Treasurer. All returns and payments submitted by each operator shall be treated
as confidential by the Treasurer and shall not be released by him except upon
order of a court of competent jurisdiction or to an officer or agent of the
United States, the State, the County, or the City for official use only. (Ord.
77-2. Passed 2-22-77.)
   181.07  PENALTIES AND INTEREST.
   (a)    Delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this
chapter within the time required shall pay a penalty equal to ten percent of
the amount of the tax, in addition to the tax.
   (b)    Fraud. If the Tax Administrator determines that the nonpayment of any
remittance due under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty equal to twenty-
five percent of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition to the
penalties stated in subsection (a) hereof.
   (c)    Interest. In addition to the previous penalties imposed, any operator
who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter shall pay interest at the
rate of one percent per month, or fraction thereof, on the amount of the tax,
exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became
delinquent until paid.
   (d)    Penalties During Pendency of Hearing or Appeal. No penalty provided
under the terms of this chapter shall be imposed during the pendency of any
hearing provided for in Section
181.08 nor during the pendency of any appeal to the Board of Review provided
for in Section
181.09.
   (e)    Abatement of Interest and Penalty. In cases where a return has been
filed in good faith and an assessment has been paid within the time prescribed
by the Treasurer, the Tax Administrator may abate any charge of penalty or
interest or both.
(Ord. 77-2. Passed 2-22-77; Ord. 2015-48.  Passed 11-24-15.)
   181.08  FAILURE TO COLLECT AND REPORT TAX; DETERMINATION OF TAX BY CITY
TREASURER.
   If any operator fails or refuses to collect such tax and to make, within the
time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of such tax or any
portion thereof required by this chapter, the Tax Administrator shall proceed
in such manner as he may deem best to obtain facts and information on which to
base his estimate of the tax due. As soon as the Tax Administrator procures
such facts and information as he is able to obtain upon which to base the
assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter and payable by any operator who
has failed or refused to collect the same and to make such report and
remittance, he shall proceed to determine and assess against such operator the
tax, interest and penalties provided for by this chapter. In case such
determination is made, the Tax Administrator shall give a notice of the amount
so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States
mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his last known
place of address. Such operator may within ten days after the serving or
mailing of such notice make application in writing to the Tax Administrator for
a hearing on the amount assessed. If application by the operator for a hearing
is not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if
any, determined by the Tax Administrator shall become final and conclusive and
immediately due and payable. If such application is made, the Tax Administrator
shall give not less than five days written notice in the manner prescribed
herein to the operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in such notice
why such amount specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest
and penalties. At such hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why
such specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After such
hearing, the Tax Administrator shall determine the proper tax to be remitted
and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed
herein of such determination and the amount of such tax, interest and
penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be payable after fifteen days
unless an appeal is taken as provided in Section
 181.09.
(Ord. 77-2. Passed 2-22-77; Ord.  2015-40.  Passed 11-24-15.)
   181.09  APPEAL.
   Any operator aggrieved by the decision of the Tax Administrator with respect
to the amount of such tax, interest and penalties, if any, may appeal to the
Board of Review by filing a notice of appeal with them within fifteen days of
the serving or mailing of the determination of tax due. The Board of Review
shall fix a time and place for hearing such appeal, and shall give notice in
writing to such operator at his last known place of address. The findings of
the Board of Review shall be final and conclusive and shall be served upon the
appellant in the manner prescribed in Section
181.08 for service of notice of hearing. Any amount found to be due shall be
immediately due and payable upon the service of notice.
(Ord. 77-2. Passed 2-22-77; Ord. 2015-40.  Passed 11-24-15.)
   181.10  REFUNDS.
   (a)    Whenever the amount of any tax, interest or penalty has been overpaid
or paid more than once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or
received by the City under this chapter, it may be refunded as provided in
subsections (b) and (c) hereof provided a claim in writing therefor stating
under penalty of perjury the specific grounds upon which the claim is founded,
is filed with the Treasurer within three years of the date of payment. The
claim shall be on forms furnished by the Treasurer.
   (b)    An operator may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes
collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once or erroneously
or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner
prescribed by the Treasurer that the person from whom the tax has been
collected was not a transient guest; provided, however, that neither a refund
nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has
either been refunded to the transient guest or credited to rent subsequently
payable by the transient guest to the operator.
   (c)    A transient guest may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid or paid more
than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the City by
filing of a claim in the manner provided in subsection (a) hereof, but only
when the transient guest having paid the tax to the operator, establishes to
the satisfaction of the Treasurer that the transient guest has been unable to
obtain a refund from the operator who collected the tax.
   (d)    No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section unless
the claimant establishes his right thereto by written records showing
entitlement thereto.
(Ord. 77-2. Passed 2-22-77.)
   181.11  RECORDS.
   It shall be the duty of every operator liable for the collection and payment
to the City of any tax imposed by this chapter to keep and preserve, for a
period of three years, all records as may be necessary to determine the amount
of such tax as he may have been liable for the collection of and payment to the
City, which records the Treasurer shall have the right to inspect at all
reasonable times. (Ord. 77-2. Passed 2-22-77.)
   181.12  ACTIONS TO COLLECT.
   Any tax required to be paid by a transient guest under the provisions of
this chapter shall be deemed a debt owed by the transient guest to the City.
Any such tax collected by an operator which has not been paid to the City shall
be deemed a debt owed by the operator to the City. Any person owing money to
the City under the provisions of this chapter shall be liable to an action
brought in the name of the City for the recovery of such amount.
(Ord. 77-2. Passed 2-22-77.)
   181.13  SEPARABILITY.
   If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase of this
chapter or any part thereof is for any reason held to be unconstitutional, such
decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this
chapter or any part thereof. The Council hereby declares that it would have
passed each section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase thereof,
irrespective of the fact that any one or more sections, subsections,
paragraphs, sentences, clauses or phrases be declared unconstitutional. (Ord.
77-2. Passed 2-22-77.)
   181.14  MONEYS CREDITED TO  CONVENTION CENTER FUND.
   (a)   The first nine hundred thousand dollars ($900,000) of Transient
Occupancy Tax received in each year beginning with 2011 shall be credited to
the Convention Center Fund.
   (b)   Any fund above that shall be allocated to the General Fund.  This fund
allocation may be reconsidered and re-appropriated annually based upon the
respective expenditures necessary for the operation of the Sharonville
Convention Center Fund and the needs of the General Fund of the City of
Sharonville. 
(Ord. 2011-55.  Passed 12-13-11.)
   181.15  VIOLATIONS.
   Any operator or other person who fails or refuses to register as required
herein, or to furnish any return required to be made, or who fails or refuses
to furnish a supplemental return or other data required by the Treasurer, or
who renders a false or fraudulent return or claim, is guilty of a misdemeanor,
and is punishable as provided in Section
181.99. Any person required to make, render, sign or verify any report or claim
with intent to defeat or evade the determination of any amount due required by
this chapter to be made, is guilty of a misdemeanor and is punishable as
aforesaid. (Ord. 77-2. Passed 2-22-77.)

   313.01  OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer. 
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person.  Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place. 
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.  If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree.  If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.

   313.02  THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section.  Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations.  When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction.  Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of
that proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing
or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways.  For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway
or portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical
terminus of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at
which vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or
yield to traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence
districts the Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway,
or portion thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected
residence district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. 
Where two or more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b)
intersect and no traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield
signs shall be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department
of Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop.  Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the
operator of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.

there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street.  The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow, and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making
a stop at a stop sign.

      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices.  Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to

opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time.  Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to

time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection.  The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a

device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable. 
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application.  Any stop required shall be made at a
sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in
the absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception.  This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. 
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be

conflict with turning vehicles.  The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.

subsection (b)(1) to (4) hereof.
      (3)   Subsection (d)(2)A.3. of this section does not apply to a person
who is in physical control of a vehicle while the person has a concentration of
a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance
in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, or urine that equals or
exceeds the amount specified in subsection (a)(1)J. hereof, if both of the
following apply:
         A.   The person obtained the controlled substance pursuant to a
prescription issued by a licensed health professional authorized to prescribe
drugs.
         B.   The person injected, ingested, or inhaled the controlled
substance in accordance with the health professional’s directions.
   (e)   Evidence; Tests. 
      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of (a)(1)A. of this section or for any equivalent offense, that is
vehicle-related the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn and
analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may be
admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation.  The three-hour time limit
specified in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not
extend or affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as
the maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test
or tests as described in that section.
   The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, or a combination of them as described in this section when a person
submits to a blood, breath, urine or other bodily substance test at the request
of a law enforcement officer under Ohio R.C. 4511.191, or a blood or urine
sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant.  Only a physician, a
registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency
medical technician-paramedic or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma.  This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens.  A person
authorized to withdraw blood under this subsection may refuse to withdraw blood
under this subsection, if in that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the
person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under subsection (e)(1)B.  hereof shall be
analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.  This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B.  hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer.  If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own
expense.  If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)
(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as
required under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an
independent test performed at the person’s expense.  The failure or inability
to obtain an additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the
admission of evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the
request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma,breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section.  (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports. 
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)

section or for an equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to any of
those subsections, a laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a
permit by the Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this
subsection that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the
information specified in this subsection shall be admitted as prima- facie
evidence of the information and statements that the report contains.  The
laboratory report shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the

of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them that was found;
         C.   A copy of a notarized statement by the laboratory director or a
designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst’s or test performer’s
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the
report.  The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the
interest of justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood.  Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid

section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person.  The immunity provided in this subsection also extends
to an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section.  The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and

otherwise authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days.  As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours.  The court may sentence an offender
to both an intervention program and a jail term.  The court may impose a jail
term in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program. 
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program.  The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs.  The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection

drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38. 
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours.  If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days. 
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education  programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs.  The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for a
definite period of one to three years.  The court may grant limited driving
privileges relative to the suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. 
The court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock
device relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree.  The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days.  The court shall impose the ten-day mandatory jail term under
this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring.  The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term.  The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall
not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider.  The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted.  Upon the request of the
court, the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the
court, including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related
to alcohol use.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days.  The
court shall impose the twenty-day mandatory jail term under this subsection
unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead imposes a
sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term and a term of
house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or
with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring.  The court
may impose a jail term in addition to the twenty-day mandatory jail term.  The

court, including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related
to alcohol use.
            3.   In all cases, notwithstanding the fines set forth in Section

(1)B.1. or 2. or (h)(1)C.1. or 2. of this section and if, within sixty days of
sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written finding on the record
that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is

term within the sixty-day period following the date of sentencing, the court
may impose an alternative sentence under this subsection that includes a term
of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring,

governed by subsection (b)(4) hereof and on freeways, if the right-of-way line
fence has been erected without pedestrian opening, the speed shall be governed
by subsection (b)(7) hereof.  The end of every school zone may be marked by a

and place of such alleged violation, except that in affidavits where a person
is alleged to have driven at a greater speed than will permit the person to
bring the vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead the
affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven.
   (f)   When a speed in excess of both a prima-facie limitation and a
limitation in subsection (d) hereof is alleged, the defendant shall be charged
in a single affidavit, alleging a single act, with a violation indicated of
both subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or of a limit declared or
established pursuant to this section by the Director or local authorities, and
of the limitation in subsection (d) hereof.  If the court finds a violation of
subsection (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or established
pursuant to this section has occurred, it shall enter a judgment of conviction
under such subsection and dismiss the charge under subsection (d) hereof.  If
it finds no violation of subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof or a limit

previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.

to, the fact that the employer, school official, or official affiliated with a
religious event provided the holder of a  probationary driver’s license with
the written documentation described in subsection (a)(2) of this section.
The Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall make available at no cost a form to serve

member occupying the vehicle unless the probationary license holder is
accompanied by the probationary license holder’s parent, guardian or custodian.
   (b)   It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection (a)(1)A. or

holder’s parent or guardian during the period of time determined by the court
under that subsection.  In granting the driving privileges, the court shall
specify the purposes of the privileges and shall issue the person appropriate
forms setting forth the privileges granted.  If a person is convicted of,
pleads guilty to, or is adjudicated in juvenile court of having committed a
second or subsequent moving violation, the court with jurisdiction over the
violation may terminate any driving privileges previously granted under this
division.
      (3)   No person shall violate any operating restriction imposed under

occupant restraining device.
   (e)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law

determining whether each occupant of the motor vehicle is wearing all of the
available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device as
required by subsection (d) hereof, or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket,
citation, or summons if the requirement in that subsection has been or is being
violated, or for causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person
for a violation of that requirement.
   (f)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of

electronic wireless communications device.
   (b)   Subsection (a) of this section does not apply to either of the

   (d)   The filing of a sworn complaint against a person for a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4511.205 does not preclude the filing of a sworn complaint for a
violation of a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same
conduct.  However, if a person is adjudicated a delinquent child or a juvenile
traffic offender for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.205 and is also adjudicated
a delinquent child or a juvenile traffic offender for a violation of a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same conduct, the two

properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license.  A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.

this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor.  When the offense is an
unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced pursuant to Ohio R.C.

the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C.

suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section.  The
person charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may

evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in the tort action
and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that represents noneconomic
loss, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011 in a tort action that could have been
recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of the available elements
of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device.  Evidence of that failure

sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:

Codified Ordinances or Ohio Revised Code shall be construed to also refer to a
previous conviction of or plea of guilty to a substantially equivalent offense
under an existing or former law of this State, another state, or the United
States or under an existing or former municipal ordinance.
   (d)   Any provision of the Codified Ordinances that refers to a section, or
to a division of a section, of the Codified Ordinances that defines or
specifies a criminal offense shall be construed to also refer to an existing or
former law of this State, another state, or the United States, to an existing
or former municipal ordinance, or to an existing or former division of any such
existing or former law or ordinance that defines or specifies, or that defined
or specified, a substantially equivalent offense. 
(ORC 2901.04)
   501.05  CRIMINAL LAW JURISDICTION.
   (a)    A person is subject to misdemeanor prosecution and punishment in this
Municipality if any of the following occur:
      (1)   The person commits an offense under the laws of this Municipality,
any element of which takes place in this Municipality.
      (2)   While in this Municipality, the person attempts to commit, or is
guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in another jurisdiction,
which offense is an offense under both the laws of this Municipality or this
State and the other jurisdiction, or, while in this Municipality, the person
conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction, which offense is an
offense under both the laws of this Municipality or this State and the other
jurisdiction, and a substantial overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is
undertaken in this Municipality by the person or another person involved in the
conspiracy, subsequent to the person’s entrance into the conspiracy.  In any
case in which a person attempts to commit, is guilty of complicity in the
commission of, or conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as
described in this subsection, the person is subject to criminal prosecution and
punishment in this Municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and
for any resulting offense that is committed or completed in the other
jurisdiction.
      (3)   While out of this Municipality, the person conspires or attempts to
commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.
      (4)   While out of this Municipality, the person omits to perform a legal
duty imposed by the laws of this Municipality, which omission affects a
legitimate interest of the Municipality in protecting, governing or regulating
any person, property, thing, transaction or activity in this Municipality.
      (5)   While out of this Municipality, the person unlawfully takes or
retains property and subsequently brings any of the unlawfully taken or
retained property into this Municipality.
      (6)   While out of this Municipality, the person unlawfully takes or
entices another and subsequently brings the other person into this
Municipality.
      (7)   The person, by means of a computer, computer system, computer
network, telecommunication, telecommunications device, telecommunications
service, or information service, causes or knowingly permits any writing, data,
image, or other telecommunication to be disseminated or transmitted into this
Municipality in violation of the law of this Municipality.
   (b)   This Municipality includes the land and water within its boundaries
and the air space above such land and water, and real property outside the
corporate limits, with respect to which this Municipality has either exclusive
or concurrent legislative jurisdiction.  Where the boundary between this
Municipality and another jurisdiction is disputed, the disputed territory is
conclusively presumed to be within this Municipality for purposes of this
section.
   (c)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this Municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this Municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this Municipality.
   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (f)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this Municipality.
   (g)   For purposes of subsection (a)(2) of this section, an overt act is
substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the part of
the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (h)   As used in this section, “computer”, “computer system”, “computer
network”, “information service”, “telecommunication”, “telecommunications
device”, “telecommunications service”, “data”, and “writing” have the same
meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2913.01. (ORC 2901.11)
   501.06  LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be
barred unless it is commenced within the following periods after an offense is
committed:
      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for an offense of which an element is
fraud or breach of a fiduciary duty, within one year after discovery of the
offense either by an aggrieved person, or by his legal representative who is
not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a  public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs.  In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first.  A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same.  A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution.  Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a mentally retarded,
developmentally disabled, or physically impaired child under twenty-one years
of age shall not begin to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred.  (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
   501.07  REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
 
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense.  Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense.  Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug. 
         (ORC 2901.21)
   501.08  CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature.  A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. 
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature.  A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature.  A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element.  When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element.  When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element. 
(ORC 2901.22)
   501.09  ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense.  An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt.  An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted.  In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor.  An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section. 
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.  (ORC 2923.02)
   501.10  COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
"The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
"It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender.  A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
   501.11  ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission.  This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity.  "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.  (ORC 2901.23)
   501.12  PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf.  (ORC
2901.24)
501.13  CONSPIRACY.
   (a)   No person, with purpose to commit or to promote or facilitate the
commission of aggravated murder, murder, kidnapping, abduction, compelling
prostitution, promoting prostitution, trafficking in persons, aggravated arson,
arson, aggravated robbery, robbery, aggravated burglary, burglary, engaging in
a pattern of corrupt activity, corrupting another with drugs, a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, theft of drugs,
or illegal processing of drug documents, the commission of a felony offense of
unauthorized use of a vehicle, illegally transmitting multiple commercial
electronic mail messages or unauthorized access of a computer in violation of
Ohio R.C. 2923.421 or the commission of a violation of any provision of Ohio
R.C. Chapter 3734, other than Ohio R.C. 3734.18, that relates to hazardous
wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy.  For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators.  In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section.  In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.
   (m)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession
offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;
         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.
      (2)   “Minor drug possession offense” has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 2925.01.  (ORC 2923.01)
   501.99  PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions.  In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section.  If the court in its
discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to,
the following:
      (1)   Restitution.  Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor
or could be disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court
under Traffic Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the
offender’s crime or any survivor of the victim, in an amount based on the
victim’s economic loss.  The court may not impose restitution as a sanction
pursuant to this section if the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13.  If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
   If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine the amount of
restitution to be paid by the offender.  If the court imposes restitution, the
court may base the amount of restitution it orders on an amount recommended by
the victim, the offender, a presentence investigation report, estimates or
receipts indicating the cost of repairing or replacing property, and other
information, provided that the amount the court orders as restitution shall not
exceed the amount of the economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and
proximate result of the commission of the offense.
   If the court decides to impose restitution, the court shall hold an
evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim or survivor disputes
the amount of restitution.  If the court holds an evidentiary hearing, at the
hearing the victim or survivor has the burden to prove by a preponderance of
the evidence the amount of restitution sought from the offender.
All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery of economic
loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any survivor of the victim
against the offender.  No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the offender pay a
surcharge, of not more than five per cent of the amount of the restitution
otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and processing
restitution payments.
The victim or survivor may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered.  If the court grants the motion, it may
modify the payment terms as it determines appropriate.
      (2)   Fines.  A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);

      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions.  The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection.  If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37.  In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms. 
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of

eighty days;

section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B).  The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case.  The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
      2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program.  During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:

Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations.  Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections

the fine as follows:
 
Type of Misdemeanor                     Maximum Fine

organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not

opportunity for a hearing, by himself or herself or with the assistance of
counsel, by an entry made upon the Mayor’s court journal.  This provision does

Mayor or Magistrate determines that the convicted individual has not complied
with the prior order or conditions imposed upon such individual.

be imprisoned for not more than ten days or fined not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00).  In the event that the defendant is guilty of contempt of

the capability to perform, the defendant may be imprisoned after conviction

upon the date named, the court may issue an arrest warrant or order the
forfeiture of the appearance bond of the defendant, or both.  An individual
found guilty of indirect contempt of court may be fined up to five hundred
dollars ($500.00) for each such contempt and may be imprisoned not more than
ten days for such contempt, or both, in the sole discretion of the Mayor or the
Magistrate.  (Ord. 92-63.  Passed 8-11-92; Ord.  00-58.  Passed 9-12-00.)

   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   "Sexual conduct" means vaginal intercourse between a male and female;
anal intercourse, fellatio and cunnilingus between persons regardless of sex;
and, without privilege to do so, the insertion, however slight, of any part of
the body or any instrument, apparatus or other object into the vaginal or anal
opening of another.  Penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete
vaginal or anal intercourse.
   (b)   "Sexual contact" means any touching of an erogenous zone of another,
including without limitation the thigh, genitals, buttock, pubic region, or, if
such person is a female, a breast, for the purpose of sexually arousing or

   (d)   "Prostitute" means a male or female who promiscuously engages in
sexual activity for hire, regardless of whether the hire is paid to the
prostitute or to another.
   (e)   “Harmful to juveniles” means that quality of any material or
performance describing or representing nudity, sexual conduct, sexual
excitement, or sado- masochistic abuse in any form to which all of the
following apply:
      (1)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, appeals to
the prurient interest of juveniles in sex.
      (2)   The material or performance is patently offensive to prevailing
standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable
for juveniles.
      (3)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, lacks
serious literary, artistic, political and scientific value for juveniles.
   (f)   When considered as a whole, and judged with reference to ordinary
adults, or, if it is designed for sexual deviates or other specially
susceptible group, judged with reference to such group, any material or
performance is "obscene" if any of the following apply:
      (1)   Its dominant appeal is to prurient interest;
      (2)   Its dominant tendency is to arouse lust by displaying or depicting

bestiality or extreme or bizarre violence, cruelty or brutality;
      (4)   Its dominant tendency is to appeal to scatological interest by
displaying or depicting human bodily functions of elimination in a way which

serving any genuine scientific, educational, sociological, moral or artistic
purpose;
      (5)   It contains a series of displays or descriptions of sexual
activity, masturbation, sexual excitement, nudity, bestiality, extreme or
bizarre violence, cruelty or brutality, or human bodily functions of
elimination, the cumulative effect of which is a dominant tendency to appeal to

primarily for its own sake or for commercial exploitation, rather than
primarily for a genuine scientific, educational, sociological, moral or
artistic purpose.

genitals when in a state of sexual stimulation or arousal.

   (a)    The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)    If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item,
antique, museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is
either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial
time, effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)    If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(l) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)    If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(l) hereof, and
the physical term is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)    As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in

this section that the defendant acted with the consent of the other person.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of arson, a misdemeanor of the
first degree.  If the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, arson is a felony and shall
be prosecuted under appropriate State law.    (ORC 2909.03)

   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.

545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,

545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense.  When a series of offenses under Section 545.05, or a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or
complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense.  The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving

service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense.  If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.

span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section.  While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services.  As used in this section, "fair
market value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.  (ORC 2913.61)
 
   545.03  PROPERTY EXCEPTIONS AS FELONY OFFENSE.
   Regardless of the value of the property involved, and regardless of whether
the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions

   PREAMBLE: The Municipality has enacted this chapter to efficiently and
adequately regulate the businesses contained herein in order to protect the
community's safety and aesthetic concerns. In addition to possible dangerous
and unsightly conditions these businesses may produce, such business operations
also provide opportunities for a harboring and exchanging of stolen goods, even
if such legal status is unknown to the operator of the business. It has been
determined by this Municipality that these provisions should fairly protect the
interest of the community and the businesses covered herein. In addition, this
chapter regulates uses not permitted under the Municipality's zoning code which
are tolerated only as legal non-conforming uses. Such businesses often involve
outdoor storage of materials which may present health, safety and aesthetic
problems and are illegal under the zoning code.
   717.01  DEFINITIONS.
   (a)    "Impound Lot" means a facility, business or property which stores,

such vehicles was not voluntarily given to the facility or business by the
owner, for an indefinite amount of time, and returns such vehicles to their
rightful owners in consideration of a fee payable to such owner of the facility
or property. An impound lot does not include a facility, business or property
which temporarily holds motor vehicles, for a period of 60 days or not longer
than customarily and reasonably necessary, for purposes of repair or sale or
resale without alteration, such as a new or used automobile dealership or

hearing and variance hearing held before such Board. All deliberation and
discussions by the Board shall be confidential and not subject to public
participation. The failure of the Board to act within the thirty-day period

being sought by the applicant.

determination made by the Safety Service Director or his designate concerning
the enforcement or application of the requirements of Chapter
717 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Sharonville.  The Board may

decision. The Board may swear in witnesses, record any such hearings and may
issue findings of fact and conclusions of law. The Board shall allow any
individual to testify at such hearing and to have an authorized agent or
attorney represent such individual at the hearing. The Board shall allow any
such party to subpoena witnesses and to subpoena documents and other tangible
evidence.

regulations of Chapter
717 by reason of exceptional lot configuration, unusual relationship between
the lot and adjoining properties and adjoining rights of way, or other
extraordinary situations which create an undue hardship based upon the strict
application of Chapter
717. No such variance shall substantially impair the public good or the
aesthetics of the surrounding community or the public safety considerations
benefited by the provisions of Chapter
717. The Board may reverse, affirm, modify or otherwise alter the contents and

hearings and may issue findings of fact and conclusions of law. The Board shall
allow any individual to testify at such hearing and to have an authorized agent
or attorney represent such individual at the hearing. The Board shall allow any
such party to subpoena witnesses and to subpoena documents and other tangible
evidence. A variance maybe granted by the Board if it finds by a preponderance
of the evidence that all of the following conditions exist:

hardship, to preserve the applicant’s right to continue operating a legal and
conforming business, not merely for the financial or practical convenience of
the applicant.
      (2)   The requested variance shall not constitute an increase in the
nonconforming use of the regulated business without proof that such extension
of a nonconforming use has been approved by the Sharonville Planning Commission
pursuant to the Zoning Code of the City of Sharonville.
      (3)   That special circumstances or conditions apply to the property and
the business in question and are unique to such property.
      (4)   That the special circumstances which are unique to the property in
question are not the result of previous actions taken by the applicant.
      (5)   The aesthetic and safety considerations of adjoining properties,
including public rights of way, will not be detrimentally affected by the
granting of the variance.
In a request for a variance, the applicant shall clearly state in writing the
above five criteria and how the requested variance shall address all of the
required criteria.    
   (c)   After the determination by the Architectural Review Board concerning
appeals and variances, the decision of the Architectural Review Board shall be
final. Any further remedy shall involve Court appeals at the discretion of the
applicant. No further action shall be necessary from the Safety Service
Director, the City Council or any other administrative body of the City of
Sharonville to enact the decision of the Architectural Review Board.

   751.02  INITIAL REVIEW OF BASIC CABLE RATES.
   (a)   Notice.  Upon the adoption of this chapter and the certification of
the City by the FCC, the City or the ICRC shall immediately notify all cable
operators in the City, by certified mail, return receipt requested, that the
City intends to regulate subscriber rates charged for the basic service tier
and associated equipment as authorized by the Cable Act of 1992.
   (b)   Cable Operator Response.  Within thirty days of receiving notice from
the City or the ICRC, a cable operator shall file with the City or the ICRC,
its current rates for the basic service tier and associated equipment and any
supporting material concerning the reasonableness of its rates.
   (c)   Expedited Determination and Public Hearing.
      (1)   If Council is able to expeditiously determine that the cable
operator’s rates for the basic service tier and associated equipment are within
the FCC’s reasonable rate standard, as determined by the applicable benchmark,
Council shall:
         A.   Hold a public hearing at which interested persons may express
their views; and
         B.   Act to approve the rates within thirty days from the date the
cable operator filed its basic cable rates with the City.
      (2)   If Council or the ICRC takes no action within thirty days from the
date the cable operator filed its basic cable rates with the City, the proposed
rates will continue in effect.
      (3)   Such public hearing may be held in conjunction with other ICRC
communities under the direction of the ICRC.
   (d)   Extended Review Period.
      (1)   If Council is unable to determine whether the rates in issue are
within the FCC’s reasonable rate standard based on the material before it, or
if the cable operator submits a cost-of-service showing, Council shall, within
sixty days from the date the cable operator filed its basic cable rates with
the City and by adoption of a formal resolution, invoke the following
additional periods of time, as applicable, to make a final determination:
         A.   Ninety days if Council needs more time to ensure that a rate is
within the FCC’s reasonable rate standard; or
         B.   150 days if the cable operator has submitted a cost-of-service
showing seeking to justify a rate above the applicable benchmark.
      (2)   If Council has not made a decision within the ninety or 150 day
period, the City Council shall issue a brief written order at the end of the
period requesting the cable operator to keep accurate account of all amounts
received by reason of the proposed rate and on whose behalf the amounts are
paid.
   (e)   Public Hearing.  During the extended review period and before taking
action on the proposed rate, Council or the ICRC shall hold at least one public
hearing at which interested persons may express their views and record
objections.
   (f)   Objections.  An interested person who wishes to make an objection to
the proposed initial basic rate may request the secretary to record the
objection during the public hearing or may submit the objection in writing
anytime before the decision resolution is adopted.  In order for an objection
to be made part of the record, the objector must provide the secretary with the
objector’s name and address.
   (g)   Benchmark Analysis.  If a cable operator submits its current basic
cable rate schedule as being in compliance with the FCC’s reasonable rate
standard, Council or the ICRC shall review the rates using the benchmark
analysis in accordance with the standard form authorized by the FCC.  Based on
the Council or the ICRC’s findings, the initial basic cable rates shall be
established as follows:
      (1)   If the current basic cable rates are below the benchmark, those
rates shall become the initial basic cable rates and the cable operator’s rates
will be capped at that level.
      (2)   If the current basic cable rates exceed the benchmark, the rates
shall be the greater of the cable operator’s per channel rate on September 30,
1992, reduced by ten percent (10%), or the applicable benchmark, adjusted for
inflation and any change in the number of channels occurring between September
30, 1992 and the initial date of regulation.
      (3)   If the current basic cable rates exceed the benchmark, but the
cable operator’s per channel rate was below the benchmark on September 30,
1992, the initial basic cable rate shall be the benchmark, adjusted for
inflation.
   (h)   Cost-of-Service Showings.  If a cable operator does not wish to reduce
the rates to the permitted level, the cable operator shall have the opportunity
to submit a cost-of-service showing in an attempt to justify an initial basic
cable rates above the FCC’s reasonable rate standard.  Council will review a
cost-of-service review.  Council may approve initial basic cable rates above
the benchmark if the cable operator makes the necessary showing; however, a
cost-of-service determination resulting in rates below the benchmark or below
the cable operator’s September 30, 1992 rates minimum ten percent (10%), will
prescribe the cable operator’s new rates.
   (i)   Decision.
      (1)   By Formal Resolution.  After completion by the City or the ICRC of
its review of the cable operator’s proposed rates, Council shall adopt its
decision by formal resolution.  The decision shall include one of the
following:
         A.   If the proposal is within the FCC’s reasonable rate standard or
is justified by a cost-of-service analysis, Council shall approve the initial
basic cable rates proposed by the cable operator; or
         B.   If the proposal is not within the FCC’s reasonable rate standard
and the cost-of-service analysis, if any, does not justify the proposed rates,
Council shall establish initial basic cable rates that are within the FCC’s
reasonable rate standard or that are justified by a cost-of-service analysis.
      (2)   Rollbacks and Refunds.  If Council determines that the initial
basic cable rates as submitted exceed the reasonable rate standard or that the
cable operator’s cost-of-service showing justifies lower rates, Council may
order the rates reduced in accordance with subsections (g) or (h) above, as
applicable.  In addition, Council may order the cable operator to pay to
subscribers, refunds of the excessive portion of the rates with interest
(computed at applicable rates published by the Internal Revenue Service for tax
refunds and additional tax payments), retroactive to September 1, 1993.  The
method for paying any refund and the interest rate will be in accordance with
FCC regulations as directed in Council’s decision resolution.
      (3)   Statement of Reasons for Decision and Public Notice.  If rates
proposed by a cable operator are disapproved in whole or in part, or if there
were objections made by other parties to the proposed rates, the resolution
must state the reasons for the decision and the City Council must give public
notice of its decision.  Public notice will be given by advertisement once in
the official newspaper of the City.
   (j)   Appeal.  Council’s decision concerning rates for the basic service
tier or associated equipment, may be appealed to the FCC in accordance with
applicable Federal regulations.  (Ord. 93-89.  Passed 12-28-93.)
   751.03  REVIEW OF REQUEST FOR INCREASE IN BASIC CABLE RATES.
   (a)   Notice.  A cable operator in the City who wishes to increase the rates
for the basic service tier or associated equipment shall file a request with
the City and the ICRC and notify all subscribers at least thirty days before
the cable operator desires the increase to take effect.  This notice may not be
given more often than annually and not until at least one year after the
determination of the initial basic cable rates.
   (b)   Expedited Determination and Public Hearing.
      (1)   If Council or the ICRC is able to expeditiously determine that the
cable operator’s rate increase request for basic cable service is within the
FCC’s reasonable rate standard, as determined by the applicable price cap,
Council shall:
         A.   Hold a public hearing at which interested persons may express
their views; and
         B.   Act to approve the rate increase within thirty days from the date
the cable operator filed its request with the City.
      (2)   If Council takes no action within thirty days from the date the
cable operator filed its request with the City, the proposed rates will go into
effect.
      (3)   During the extended review period and before taking action on the
proposed rate, Council or the ICRC shall hold at least one public hearing at
which interested persons may express their views and record objections.
   (c)   Extended Review Period.
      (1)   If Council and the ICRC are unable to determine whether the rate
increase is within the FCC’s reasonable rate standard based on the material
before it, or if the cable operator submits a cost-of-service showing, Council
shall, by adoption of a formal resolution, invoke the following additional
periods of time as applicable, to make a final determination:
         A.   Ninety days if Council or the ICRC needs more time to ensure that
the requested increase is within the FCC’s reasonable rate standard as
determined by the applicable price cap; and
         B.   150 days if the cable operator has submitted a cost-of-service
showing seeking to justify a rate increase above the applicable price cap.
      (2)   The proposed rate increase is tolled during the extended review
period.
      (3)   If Council has not made a decision within the 90 to 150 day period,
Council shall issue a brief written order at the end of the period requesting
the cable operator to keep accurate account of all amounts received by reason
of the proposed rate increase and on whose behalf the amounts are paid.
   (d)   Public Hearing.  During the extended review period and before taking
action on the requested rate increase, Council or the ICRC shall hold at least
one public hearing at which interested persons may express their views and
record objections.
   (e)   Objections.  An interested person who wishes to make an objection to
the proposed rate increase may request the secretary to record the objection
during the public hearing or may submit the objection in writing anytime before
the decision resolution is adopted.  In order for an objection to be made part
of the record, the objector must provide the secretary with the objector’s name
and address.
   (f)   Delayed Determination.  If Council is unable to make a final
determination concerning a requested rate increase within the extended time
period, the cable operator may put the increase into effect, subject to
subsequent refund if Council later issued a decision disapproving any portion
of the increase.
   (g)   Price Cap Analysis.  If a cable operator presents its request for a
rate increase as being in compliance with the FCC’s price cap, Council shall
review the rate using a price cap analysis in accordance with the standard form
authorized by the FCC.  Based on Council’s findings, the basic cable rates
shall be established as follows:
      (1)   If the proposed basic cable rate increase is within the price cap
established by the FCC, the proposed rates shall become the new basic cable
rates.
      (2)   If the proposed basic cable rate increase exceeds the price cap
established by the FCC, Council shall disapprove the proposed rate increase and
order an increase that is in compliance with the price cap.
   (h)   Cost-of-Service Showings.  If a cable operator submits a cost-of-
service showing in an attempt to justify a rate increase above the price cap,
Council will review the submission pursuant to the FCC standards for cost-of-
service review.  Council may approve a rate increase above the price cap if the
cable operator makes the necessary showing; however, a cost-of-service
determination resulting in a rate below the price cap or below the cable
operator’s then current rate will prescribe the cable operator’s new rate.
   (i)   Decision.  Council’s decision concerning the requested rate increase,
shall be adopted by formal resolution.  If a rate increase proposed by a cable
operator is disapproved in whole or in part, or if objections were made by
other parties to the proposed rate increases, the resolution must state the
reasons for the decision.  Objections may be made at the public hearing by a
person requesting the city secretary to record the objection or may be
submitted in writing at anytime before the decision resolution is adopted.
   (j)   Refunds.
      (1)   Council may order refunds of subscribers’ rate payments with
interest if:
         A.   Council was unable to make a decision within the extended time
period as described in subsection (c) above; and
         B.   The cable operator implemented the rate increase at the end of
the extended review period; and
         C.   Council determines that the rate increase as submitted exceeds
the applicable price cap or that the cable operator failed to justify the rate
increase by a cost-of-service showing, and Council disapproves any portion of
the rate increase.
      (2)   The method of paying any refund and the interest rate will be in
accordance with FCC regulations as directed in Council’s decision resolution.
   (k)   Appeal.  Council’s decision concerning rates for the basic service
tier or associated equipment, may be appealed to the FCC in accordance with
applicable federal regulations.  (Ord. 93-89.  Passed 12-28-93.)
   751.04  CABLE OPERATOR INFORMATION.
   (a)   City May Require.
      (1)   In those cases when the cable operator has submitted initial rates
or proposed an increase that exceeds the reasonable rate standard, Council or
the ICRC may require the cable operator to produce information in addition to
that submitted, including proprietary information, if needed to make a rate
determination.  In these cases, a cable operator may request the information be
kept confidential in accordance with this section.
      (2)   In cases where initial or proposed rates comply with the reasonable
rate standard, Council or the ICRC may request additional information only in
order to document that the cable operator’s rates are in accord with the
standard.

sidewalk or public way, unless a permit to make such opening has been issued.
(Ord. 685. Passed 8-19-41.)
   (b)    A fee of fifteen dollars ($15.00) shall be charged at the time the

(Ord. 87-7. Passed 2-24-87.)
   901.02  APPLICATION; SECURITY FOR RESTORATION.
   Permits for making openings in Municipal streets, sidewalks and public ways,
shall be issued only by the Sharonville Community Services Director or the
Safety-Service Director or his or her agent for some duly authorized purpose.
Applications for street opening permits shall be made on forms provided by the
Municipality. The application shall give the size and location of the proposed
opening and shall state the kind of paving where the cut is to be made. The
permit shall be issued only after ample security has been given the
Municipality to insure the proper restoration and subsequent maintenance of the
street pavement disturbed. Such security may be furnished in one of the
following ways:
   (a)    A cash deposit or a surety bond shall be posted with each
application, sufficient to cover the cost of restoration.
   (b)    In the case of Municipal contracts involving the cutting of street
pavements, permits may be issued without a cash deposit or surety bond but in
such cases, sufficient money to pay for the necessary street restoration shall
be withheld from the contract moneys owing to the contractor, until such street
restoration is completed by the contractor to the satisfaction of Council, or
until such contractor shall have paid the requisite amount for the street
restoration to the Municipality. (Ord. 685. Passed 8-19-41; Ord. 87-7. Passed
2-4-87.)
   901.03  PUBLIC SERVICE CORPORATIONS.
   Public service corporations may do their own restoration work in connection
with the opening of streets for maintenance and construction work, and may

issued only when the restoration work is promptly done, and when the subsequent
opening proceeds at a rate no faster than the previous restoration. (Ord. 685.
Passed 8-19-41.)
   901.04  NOTICE TO PROPERTY OWNERS.
   Previous to the paving, repair, resurfacing or reconstruction of any street
or public way, the Safety-Service Director shall, under the direction of
Council, cause notices to be sent to all abutting property owners requiring
them to install any needed water or sewer service branches. Notice shall also
be sent to all public service corporations to install all necessary mains,
conduits, service branches and structures. Property owners and public service
corporations shall be allowed the necessary and reasonable time required for
the aforesaid installations before the new pavement is laid. Thereafter, during
the period of three years from the final completion and acceptance of the new
pavement, no permit for making any opening in such pavement shall be issued,
except by express authority from Council. Council shall exercise this special
authority only for reasons of public necessity or for undue private hardship
where the necessity for the opening arises from causes over which the applicant
has no control. Lack of foresight in not installing service connections prior
to the laying of a new pavement or the repairing or resurfacing of a pavement
shall not be considered an adequate reason for abrogation of the general rule.
In all cases where a street opening permit shall be issued during the three
year period, an additional suitable charge in excess of the scheduled rate,
shall be assessed. (Ord. 685. Passed 8-19-41.)

   903.04  NATURE OF ISSUANCE.
   A Certificate of Registration shall not convey equitable or legal title in

limited right to occupy Rights of Way in the City for the limited purposes and
for the limited period stated in the Certificate of Registration and in
accordance with Codified Ordinances Chapter
903  and all Laws including any Ru1es and Regu1ations adopted by the City
Safety Service Director. The rights to locate Facilities and/or a System in and
the rights to occupy the Right of Way itself may not be  subdivided or
subleased; provided, however provider may sublease capacity (or other
nonmaterial Facility aspects) and two or more Providers may collocate
Facilities in the same area of the Rights of Way so long as each such Provider
complies with the provisions of this Chapter. Collocating Providers may file a
joint application for a Construction Permit. A Certificate of Registration does
not excuse a Provider from obtaining appropriate access or pole attachment
agreements before collocating its Facilities on Facilities of others, including
the City's Facilities.  A Certificate of Registration does not prevent a
Provider from leasing space in or on the Provider's System, so long as the
sharing of Facilities does not cause a violation of Law, including the
provisions of this Chapter. A Certificate of Registration does not excuse a
Provider from complying with any provisions of this Chapter or other applicable
Law.  (Ord. 2001-49-E.  Passed 8-28-01.)
   903.05  OTHER APPROVALS, PERMITS AND AGREEMENTS.

all regulatory approvals, permits, authorizations, or licenses necessary for
the offering or provision of such Services from the appropriate federal, state
and local authorities and upon the City's reasonable request, shall provide
copies of such documents to the City. Further, a Certificate of Registration
issued pursuant to this Chapter shall not entitle a Provider to use, alter,
convert to, or interfere with, the Facilities, easements, poles, conduits,
lines, pipelines, wires, fiber, cable, or any other real or personal property
of any kind whatsoever under the management or control of the City.

   903.18  CONSTRUCTION, RELOCATION AND RESTORATION.
   
   903.18.1 Technical Information Required.
   Prior to commencement of any initial Construction of Facilities in the
Rights of Way a Construction Permittee, upon the reasonable request of the
City, shall provide technical information about the proposed route of
Construction.  The technical information required may consist of completion of
the following tasks:
   (a)   Secure all available "as-built" plans, plats, and other location data
indicating the existence and approximate location of all Facilities along the
proposed Construction route.
   (b)   Visibly survey and record the location and dimensions of any
Facilities along the proposed Construction route, including, but not limited
to, manholes, valve boxes, utility boxes, posts, and visible street cut
repairs.
   (c)   Determine and record the presence of and the approximate horizontal
and vertical location of all Underground Facilities the Applicant or Person on
whose behalf the Permit was applied for owns or controls in the Rights of Way
along the proposed System route. Upon the reasonable request of the City Safety
Service Director, a Permittee shall also record and identify the general
location of all other Facilities in the Rights of Way along the proposed System
route. For the purposes of this Section, general location shall mean the
alignment of other Facilities in the Rights of Way, but shall not necessarily
mean the depth of other Facilities in the Rights of Way.
   (d)   If a Provider records the information requested above in an electronic
format, the Provider shall provide the City with an electronic copy of the data
obtained from completion of the tasks described in this section.  Incorporation
of the data required herein (
903.18.1  et seq.) by electronic means shall include only data for new
Facilities that can be readily incorporated into the City's database.
   (e)   Where the proposed location of Facilities and the location of existing
Underground Facilities appear to conflict with the plans as drafted,
Construction Permittee has the option of either utilizing non-destructive
digging methods, such as vacuum excavation, at the critical points identified
to determine as precisely as possible, the horizontal, vertical and spatial
position, composition, size and other specifications of the conflicting
Underground Facilities, or re-designing the Construction plans to eliminate the
apparent conflict. A Construction Permittee shall not excavate more than a
three (3) foot by three (3) foot square hole in the Rights of Way to complete
this task.
   (f)   Based on all of the data collected upon completion of the tasks
described in this Section, adjust the proposed System design to avoid the need
to relocate other Underground Facilities.
   (g)   All Confidential/Proprietary Information submitted herein shall be so
labeled.
   903.18.2 Qualified Firm. 
   All utility engineering studies conducted pursuant to this Section
903.18  shall be performed by a firm specializing in utility engineering or may
be performed by the Construction Permittee if the Construction Permittee is
qualified to complete the project itself.
   903.18.3 Cost of Study.
   The Construction Permittee shall bear the cost of compliance with Sections
903.18.1  through
903.18.3  of this Chapter.
   903.18.4 Construction Schedule.  
   Unless otherwise provided for in this Chapter, or unless the Department of
Community Development waives any of the requirements of this Section due to
unique or unusual circumstances, a Construction Permittee shall be required to;
submit a written Construction schedule to the City ten (10) Working Days before
commencing any work in or about the Rights of Way and, shall further notify the
City not less than two (2) Working Days in advance of any excavation in the
Rights of Way. This Section shall apply to all situations with the exception of
emergency situations as described in this Chapter.
   903.18.5 Location of Facilities.
   (a)   The placement of new Facilities and replacement of old Facilities,
either above ground or underground, shall be completed in conformity with
applicable Laws.
   (b)   The City shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of
new or additional Facilities within the Rights of Way if the Right of Way is
Full.  In making such decisions, the City shall strive to the extent possible
to accommodate all existing and potential users of the Rights of Way, but shall
be guided primarily by considerations of the public health, safety, and
welfare, the condition of the Rights of Way, the time of year, the protection
of existing Facilities in the Rights of Way, future City and County plans for
public improvements, development projects which have been determined to be in
the public interest, and the non-discriminatory and competitively neutral
treatment of providers.
   (c)   Upon the concurrence of the City, or if it is determined by the
Construction Permittee and any appropriate local, state, or federal agency (or
other entity with jurisdictional authority) that any existing poles in the
Rights of Way are Full, then those poles may be replaced with bigger and/or
taller poles in order to accommodate additional Facilities or Systems only
after the Construction Permittee has made reasonable attempts to reach an
acceptable solution without replacement with bigger and/or taller poles. This
paragraph shall not apply to replacement of any existing pole(s) with
identically sized pole(s) which results from the destruction of or hazardous
condition of the existing pole( s) as long as no new Facilities or additional
Facilities are attached.
   903.18.6 Least Disruptive Technology. 
   All Construction or maintenance of Facilities shall be accomplished in the
manner resulting in the least amount of damage and disruption of the Rights of
Way. In addition, all cable, wire or fiber optic cable installed in the
subsurface Rights of Way under this Chapter may be required to be installed in
conduit, and if so required, no cable, wire or fiber optic cable may be
installed under this Chapter using "direct bury" techniques.
   903.18.7 Relocation of Facilities.
   (a)   A Provider shall, at its own expense, permanently remove and relocate
its Facilities in the Rights of Way whenever the City finds it necessary to
request such removal and relocation. In instances where the City requests
removal and/or relocation, the City shall waive all applicable Construction
Permit Fees. Upon removal and/or relocation, the Provider shall restore the
Rights of Way to a condition at least as good as its condition immediately
prior to said removal or relocation. If existing poles are required to be
removed and/or relocated, then the existing poles will be replaced with
reasonably obtainable poles of the same or similar size unless otherwise
permitted by the City. The City may request relocation and/or removal in order
to prevent unreasonable interference by the Provider's Facilities with:
      (1)    A public improvement undertaken or approved by the City, City, or
County;
      (2)    When the public health, safety, and welfare requires it, or when
necessary to prevent interference with the safety and convenience of ordinary
travel over the Rights of Way.
   (b)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Provider who has Facilities in the
Right of Way subject to a vacation or narrowing that is not required for the
purposes of the City, shall have a permanent easement in such vacated portion
or excess portion in conformity with O.RC. §723.04.01.
   (c)   If, in the reasonable judgment of the City, a Provider fails to
commence the removal process and/or relocation of its Facilities as designated
by the City, within thirty (30) days after the City's removal order is served
upon Provider, or if a Provider fails to substantially complete such removal,
including all associated repair of the Rights of Way of the City, within twelve
(12) months thereafter, then, to the extent not inconsistent with applicable
Law, the City shall have the right to:
      (1)    Declare that all rights, title and interest to the Facilities
belong to the City with all rights of ownership, including, but not limited to,
the right to connect and use the Facilities or to effect a transfer of all
right, title and interest in the Facilities to another Person for operation; or
      (2)    Authorize removal of the Facilities installed by the Provider in,
on, over or under the Rights of Way of the City at Provider's cost and expense,
by another Person, however the City shall have no liability for any damage
caused by such action and the Provider shall be liable to the City for all
reasonable costs incurred by the City in such action; and
      (3)    To the extent consistent with applicable Law, any portion of the
Provider's Facilities in, on, over or under the Rights of Way of the City
designated by the City for removal and not timely removed by the Provider shall
belong to and become the property of the City without payment to the Provider,
and the Provider shall execute and deliver such documents, as the City shall
request, in form and substance acceptable to the City, to evidence such
ownership by the City.
   903.18.8 Pre-Excavation Facilities Location.
   Before the start date of any Rights of Way excavation, each Provider who has
Facilities located in the area to be excavated shall be responsible to mark the
horizontal and make every reasonable attempt using best efforts, to mark the
approximate vertical placement of all its Facilities. All Providers shall
notify and work closely with the excavation contractor in an effort to
establish the exact location of its Facilities and the best procedure for
excavation.
   903.18.9 Rights of Way Restoration.
   (a)   The work to be done under the Permit, and the Restoration of the
Rights of Way as required herein, must be completed within the dates specified
in the Permit. In addition to its own work, the Permittee must restore the
general area of the work, and the surrounding areas, including trench backfill,
paving and its foundations in accordance with the standards established by the
City Safety Service Director, subject to any applicable Laws. The Permittee
must also inspect the area of the work and use reasonable care to maintain the
same condition for twelve (12) months thereafter.
   (b)   In approving an Application for a Permit, the City may choose either
to have the Permittee restore the Rights of Way or the City may restore the
Rights of Way itself at the expense of the Permittee.
   (c)   If the City chooses to allow Permittee to restore the Rights of Way,
Construction Permittee shall at the time of Application of a Construction
Permit post a Construction Bond in an amount determined by the City to be
sufficient to cover the cost of restoring the Rights of Way to a condition at
least as good as its condition immediately prior to Construction. If, twelve
(12) months after completion of the Restoration of the Rights of Way, the City
determines that the Rights of Way have been properly restored, the surety on
the Construction Bond shall be released.
   (d)   The Permittee shall perform the work according to the standards and
with the materials specified and approved by the City.
   (e)   By restoring the Rights of Way itself, the Permittee guarantees its
work and shall maintain it for twelve (12) months following its completion.
During this twelve (12) month period, it shall, upon notification from the
Department of Community Development, correct all Restoration work to the extent
necessary using the method required by the City Safety Service Director.
Weather permitting, said work shall be completed within five (5) calendar days
of the receipt of the notice from the Department of Community Development.
   (f)   If the Permittee fails to restore the Rights of Way in the manner and
to the condition required by the City, or fails to satisfactorily and timely
complete all repairs required by the City, the City, at its option, with notice
to Provider and a reasonable time to cure, may do such work. In that event, the
Permittee shall pay to the City, within thirty (30) days of billing, the cost
of restoring the Rights of Way and any other costs incurred by the City. Upon
Failure to pay, the City may call upon any bond or letter of credit posted by
Permittee and/or pursue any and all legal and equitable remedies.
   903.18.10 Damage to Provider's Facilities and to Other Facilities.
   (a)   In the case of an Emergency, and if possible after reasonable efforts
to contact the Provider seeking a timely response, when the City performs work
in the Rights of Way and finds it necessary to maintain, support, or move a
Provider's Facilities to protect those Facilities, the costs associated
therewith will be billed to that Provider and shall be paid within thirty (30)
days from the date of billing. Upon failure to pay, the City may pursue all
legal and equitable remedies in the event a Provider does not pay or the City
may call upon any bond or letter of credit posted by Permittee and pursue any
and all legal or equitable remedies.
   (b)   Each Provider shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any
Facilities in the Rights of Way which it or its Facilities damage. Each
Provider shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any damage to the
Facilities of another Provider caused during the City's response to an
Emergency caused by such Provider's Facilities.
   903.18.11 Rights of Way Vacation.
   If the City vacates a Rights of Way which contains the Facilities of a

   (c)   At any time, including the time of inspection, the Inspector may order
the immediate cessation of any work which poses a serious threat to the health,
safety, or welfare of the public, violates any Law, or which violates the terms
and conditions of the Permit and/or this Chapter.
   (d)   The Inspector may issue an order to correct work which does not
conform to the Permit and/or applicable standards, conditions or codes. The
order shall state that failure to correct the violation will be cause for
revocation of the Permit. The order may be served on the Permittee as provided
in Section
903.23.4 . An order may be appealed to the City Safety Service Director. The
decision of the Safety Service Director may be appealed to the BZA whose
decision shall be final. If not appealed, within ten (10) days after issuance

safety and convenience of ordinary travel of the public over the Rights of Way,
and by considerations relating to the public health, safety, and welfare.
   903.20.2 Permissive Denial.
   The Safety Service Director may deny a Permit in order to protect the public
health, safety, and welfare, to prevent interference with the safety and
convenience of ordinary travel over the Rights of Way, or when necessary to
protect the Rights of Way and its users. The Safety Service Director, in his or
her discretion, may consider one or more of the following factors: the extent
to which Rights of Way space where the Permit is sought is available; the
competing demands for the particular space in the Rights of Way; the
availability of other locations in the Rights of Way or in other Rights of Way
for the proposed Facilities; the applicability of this Chapter or other
regulations of the Rights of Way that affect location of Facilities in the
Rights of Way; the degree of compliance of the Provider with the terms and
conditions of this Chapter and its requirements, and other applicable
ordinances and regulations; the degree of disruption to surrounding communities
and businesses that will result from the use of that part of the Rights of Way;
the condition and age of the Rights of Way, and whether and when it is
scheduled for total or partial re-construction; the balancing of the costs of
disruption to the public and damage to the Rights of Way, against the benefits
to that part of the public served by the expansion into additional parts of the
Rights of Way; and whether such Applicant or its agent has failed within the
past three (3) years to comply, or is presently not in full compliance, with
the requirements of this Chapter or, if applicable, any other Chapters of the
Codified Ordinances, or any other applicable Law.
   903.20.3 Discretionary Issuance. 
   Notwithstanding the provisions of Section's

903.20.1 (b), the Safety Service Director may issue a Permit in any case where
the Permit is necessary:
   (a)   To prevent substantial economic hardship to a customer of the Permit
applicant if established by credible evidence satisfactory to the City; or
   (b)   To allow such customer to materially improve its Service; or
   (c)   To allow a new economic development project. To be granted a Permit
under this Section, the Permit Applicant must not have had knowledge of the
hardship, the plans for improvement of Service, or the development project at
the time it was required to submit its list of next year projects.
   903.20.4 Work Done Without a Permit.
   (a)   Emergency Situations. Each Provider shall, as soon as reasonably
practicable, notify the Department of Community Development of any event
regarding its Facilities which it considers to be an Emergency. The Provider
may proceed to take whatever actions are necessary in order to respond to the
Emergency. Within two (2) business days, unless otherwise extended by the City
Safety Service Director, after the occurrence or discovery of the Emergency
(whichever is later), the Provider shall apply for the necessary Permits, pay
the fees associated therewith and fulfill all the requirements necessary to
bring itself into compliance with this Chapter for any and all actions taken in
response to the Emergency. In the event that the City becomes aware of an
Emergency regarding a Provider 's Facilities, the City may attempt to contact
the Provider or System Representative of each Provider affected, or potentially
affected, by the Emergency. In any event, the City may take whatever action it
deems necessary in order to respond to the Emergency, the cost of which shall
be borne by the Provider whose Facilities caused the Emergency.
   (b)   Non-Emergency Situations. Except in the case of an Emergency, any
Provider who Constructs in, on, above, within, over, below or through a Right
of Way without a valid Permit shall subsequently obtain a Permit, pay double

Codified Ordinances, deposit with the City the fees necessary to correct any
damage to the Rights of Way and comply with all of the requirements of this
Chapter.
   903.20.5 Revocation of Permits.
   (a)   Permittees hold Permits issued pursuant to the Codified Ordinances as
a privilege and not as a right. The City reserves the right, as provided
herein, to revoke any Permit, without refunding any fees, in the event of a
substantial breach of the terms and conditions of any Law or any provision or
condition of the Permit. A substantial breach by Permittee shall include, but
shall not be limited to, the following:
      (1)    The violation of any provision or condition of the Permit;  or
      (2)    An evasion or attempt to evade any provision or condition of the
Permit, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit upon
the City or its citizens; or
      (3)    Any material misrepresentation of fact in the Application for a
Permit; or
      (4)    The Failure to obtain and/or maintain required Construction or
Removal Bonds and/or insurance; or
      (5)    The failure to obtain and/or maintain, when required, a
Certificate of Registration; or

      (7)    The failure to correct any nonconformity as ordered pursuant to
Section
903.18.13 (d).
   (b)   If the Safety Service Director determines that the Permittee has
committed a substantial breach of a term or condition of any Law or any
provision or condition of the Permit, the Safety Service Director shall serve a
written demand upon the Permittee to remedy such violation. The demand shall
state that continued violations may be cause for revocation of the Permit.
Upon, a substantial breach, as stated above, the Safety Service Director, may
place additional or revised conditions on the Permit. Any obligation of the
Safety Service Director in this Section and within this Chapter may be carried
out by a designated official of the Safety Service Director, including a third
party engineering firm if the Safety Service Director so directs.
   (c)   By the close of the next business day following receipt of
notification of the breach, Permittee shall contact the Safety Service Director
with a plan, acceptable to the Safety Service Director, for its correction.
Permittee's failure to so contact the Safety Service Director, or the
Permittee's failure to submit an acceptable plan, or Permittee's failure to
reasonably implement the approved plan, shall be cause for immediate revocation
of the Permit.
   (d)   From time to time, the Safety Service Director may establish a list of
standard conditions for the Permit. A substantial breach of any condition shall
also constitute an unauthorized use of the public Rights of Way as defined in
Section
903.14 .
   (e)   If a Permittee, commits a second substantial breach as outlined above,
Permittee's Permit will automatically be revoked and not be allowed further
Permits for one full year, except for Emergency repairs.
   (f)   If a Permit is revoked, the Permittee shall also reimburse the City
for the City's reasonable costs, including Restoration costs and the costs of
collection and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in com1ection with such
revocation.

City Law Director, an irrevocable, unconditional letter of credit or a surety
bond in an amount equal to or greater than Fifty Thousand Dollars
(US$50,000.00). The City Safety Service Director shall malce all reasonable
efforts to allow Provider a period of five (5) business days after serving

      (Ord. 2018-23-E.  Passed 7-17-18.)
904.15  DESIGN AND SITING REQUIREMENTS.
   General Requirements.
   (a)   Wireless support structures shall align with other poles to achieve a
uniform inline appearance.
   (b)   Wireless support structures shall be setback from the edge of pavement
according to applicable safety and construction standards as set forth in
904.14(a).
   (c)   All small cell facilities and wireless support structures and any
related items shall be installed and maintained plumb and level and shall
maintain an orderly and neat appearance.
   (d)   The City may deny requests to install structures and facilities in the
right-of-way in an area where the City has required all structures and
facilities except those owned by the City to be placed underground or elsewhere
in the right-of-way or utility easement.  These areas can be easily
identifiable as those locations where electric has been placed underground,
such as within the Northern Lights Entertainment District; however, if an
applicant is uncertain as to whether such facilities have been placed
underground in the area, the applicant should contact the City for
clarification before applying for or installing any wireless support structures
and/or or small cell facilities in the area.  The applicant may request a
waiver if unable to achieve its service objective using a location in the
right-of-way where the prohibition does not apply, in a utility easement the
applicant has the right to access, or in or on other suitable locations or
structures made available by the City at reasonable rates, fees and terms. 
   (e)   In residential districts, new wireless support structures should be
located to avoid obstructing the view of building facades by placing the
wireless support structure at a corner, intersection or along a lot line. New
wireless support structures should be located in the yard location where other
overhead utilities are located unless it is not technically feasible to do so.
Applicants shall clearly explain the rationale for requests that deviate from
this expectation.
   (f)   In the Downtown District, when collocating on the City's ornamental
black traffic signal mast arms, the preferred collocation spot is on the
traffic signal pole without attached street signs, with the antenna placed at
the top of the vertical pole immediately below the finial.  Each proposed
collocation will be subject to a site-specific review.  The City strongly
discourages the use of the City's ornamental green streetlights as wireless
support structures.  They should be used only when no other options exist,
including the ability to install a new wireless support structure.  If used,
the height may not be increased more than five (5) feet, the light fixture must
be located at the top of the pole, and the small cell facility must not
interfere with the attachment of flags, hanging planters and/or banners.  If
existing utility poles are not available for collocation, applicants may
propose a new wireless support structure.  Wireless support structures that
will be more than twenty (20) feet in height shall match the design of the
City's ornamental black traffic signal mast arms.  New wireless support
structures that will be twenty (20) feet or less in heights shall match the
City's ornamental green streetlights.  Applicants should look to the rear of
properties.  In order to meet the service needs of applicants, the City will
consider requests to locate small cell facilities on City property in the
downtown area, such as parking lots.   
   (g)   All equipment and enclosures shall be attached, anchored and/or
strapped tightly to poles using corrosion resistant steel hardware.
   (h)   Wireless support structures shall support no more than two small cell
facilities.
   (i)   A landscaping plan, approved by the Community Development Director
shall be required for each Application.  Facilities shall be camouflaged using
existing land forms, vegetation and structures to screen the facilities from
view and to blend in with surrounding built and natural environment.  The City
may require additional concealment elements before approving an application,
especially in residential districts.  Concealment elements may include, but
shall not be limited to, fencing, public art, or strategic placement.   
   (j)   Ambient noise suppression measures or placement of the equipment in
locations less likely to impact adjacent properties shall be required to ensure
compliance with all applicable noise regulations.
   (k)   Unless otherwise required for compliance with FAA or FCC regulations,
the small cell facility or wireless support structure shall not include any

Location
   (a)   In accordance with ORC 4939.0314(D), Authority of a Municipal
Corporation, the City shall reserve the right to propose an alternate location
to the proposed location of a new wireless support structure, provided the
alternate location is within 100' or a distance equal to the width of the Right
of Way in or on which the new wireless support structure is proposed, whichever
is greater. The City of Sharonville also finds that certain locations and
collocation configurations are preferred. A preferred location and collocation
configuration should be utilized whenever possible and should only be surpassed
if in the determination of the Public Works Director, clear and convincing
evidence supports such a decision. Cost alone should not be grounds for such a
determination. The order of preference is as follows:
      (1)   First, small cell facilities should be collocated on an existing
pole or wireless structure within a utility easement.  If so such pole or
wireless support structure is available then proceed to the next preference;
      (2)   Second, small cell facilities should be collocated on an existing
pole or wireless support structure within an alley. If no such pole or wireless
support structure is available then proceed to the next preference;
      (3)   Third, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new wireless
support structure within a utility easement. If no such location is available
then proceed to the next preference;
      (4)   Fourth, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new
wireless support structure within an alley. If no such location is available
then proceed to the next preference;
      (5)   Fifth, small cell facilities should be collocated on a wireless
support structure currently supporting a small cell facility located within the
City Right of Way. If no such wireless support structure is available then
proceed to the next preference;
      (6)   Sixth, small cell facilities should be collocated on an existing
pole located within the City Right of Way. If no such existing pole is
available then proceed to the next preference;
      (7)   Seventh, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new
wireless support structure located within a utility easement. If no such
location is available then proceed to the next preference;
      (8)   Eighth, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new
wireless support structure located within an alley. If no such  location is
available then  proceed to  the next preference
      (9)   Ninth, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new wireless
support structure located within the City Right of Way.
   (b)   Any new wireless support structure shall be located at least 500' from
any existing small cell facility.
Wireless Facilities Design
   (a)   Wireless support structures shall be subject to the following design
standards:
      (1)   Wireless support structures shall be limited to 40 feet in height.
      (2)   Wireless support structures shall be capable of supporting at least
two small cell facility operators.

         F.   Exception - If the aesthetics and character of the immediate area
would be better matched by a pole of a different material, color, style, or
base as determined by the Public Works Director, then such design elements may
be substituted with an alternate design element. Such determination shall be
based on the following factors:
            1.   The design features of nearby poles serving in a similar
capacity;
            2.   The design features of the existing or proposed streetscape,
district, or site;
            3.   The historical context of a district or specific site;

         A.   Antenna and all associated equipment shall be concealed to the
extent deemed necessary by the Public Works Director in response to the
aesthetic context of the small cell facility. Some possible configurations
include but shall not be limited to the following:
            1.   Antenna(s) associated with the first fitting on a wireless
support structure shall be top-mounted and concealed within a radome that also
conceals the cable connections, antenna mount and other hardware. The Public
Works Director may approve a side-mounted antenna with the initial fitting if,
in the [Decision Maker]'s discretion, the side-mounted antenna would be a
better match to the aesthetics and character of the immediate area and would
promote the purposes of this Chapter.
            2.   GPS antennas be placed within the radome or directly above the
radome not to exceed six inches.
      (2)   Each Antenna and all associated equipment shall not exceed 6 cubic
feet in volume.

it is mounted.
         C.   Style - The enclosure shall match the style of the pole on which
it is mounted.
         D.   Coordinated Design Elements - Common enclosures shall match the
material, color, and style of nearby existing common enclosures when:
            1.   Such enclosures are located within 5000' of an existing common
enclosure; and
            2.   Such enclosures are mounted on wireless support structures of
a similar or matching design.
         E.   Exception - If the aesthetics and character of the immediate area
would be better matched by an enclosure a different material, color, style, or
by deviating from the design of a nearby existing common enclosure as
determined by the Public Works Director, then such design elements may be
substituted with an alternate design element.  Such determination shall be
based on the following factors:
            1.   The design features of nearby poles serving in a similar
capacity;
            2.   The design features of the existing or proposed streetscape,
district, or site;
            3.   The historical context of a district or specific site;
            4.   A desire to camouflage or conceal the enclosure from view.

facility is permitted unless the following conditions can be satisfied as
determined by the Public Works Director :
         A.   The applicant has submitted clear and convincing evidence that
the equipment cannot feasibly be pole-mounted, placed in an underground vault,
or hidden within or integrated into an existing streetscape element (i.e. - bus
stop shelter). Increased costs alone shall not be a consideration. If a  ground
mounted enclosure is approved, the [Decision Maker] shall reserve the right to
require any of the following conditions:
            1.   Concealed Enclosure - All equipment shall be completely
concealed within a metal, composite, or equivalent material enclosure as
determined by the Public Works Director.
            2.   Smallest Size - The enclosure shall be no larger than
necessary based on the smallest available size of the proposed equipment as
determined by the Public Works Director.
            3.   Camouflage - Camouflaging elements may be required. Such
elements may include, but shall not be limited to, public art displayed on the
enclosure, strategic placement in less visible or obtrusive locations,
placement within an existing streetscape element, landscape screening, and
strategic painting or coating to camouflage such enclosure or equipment.
         B.   The maximum height of any such enclosure shall be 30".

   1119.03  PLATTED MONUMENTS TO BE PLACED.
   Improvements shall not be accepted until the Municipal Engineer has verified
in the field, that monuments, shown on the plat and certified by the surveyor
and/or engineer, have been placed. (Ord. 60-11. Passed 6-14-60.)
   1119.04  RESPONSIBILITY OF PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS.
   All public improvements shown on the Subdivision Plan are the responsibility
of the subdivider, unless otherwise expressly indicated and shall be installed
in accordance with these Platting and Subdivision Regulations. (Ord. 60-11.
Passed 6-14-60.)
   1119.05  INSPECTION AND TESTING.
   The developer, his engineer or his contractor, shall give notice to the
Municipal Engineer at least twenty-four hours in advance of any construction of
physical public improvements, including grading of such public improvements, in
order that an inspector may be assigned. The contractor shall be billed for all
inspections at the currently prevailing rate for inspectors.
   All necessary testing of materials will be done by a testing laboratory at
no cost to the Municipality. It is customary for the contractor to be billed by
the testing laboratory for any testing of materials incorporated in the paving.
(Ord. 60-11. Passed 6-14-60.)
   1119.06  SEWER AND WATER LINES TO BE INSTALLED PRIOR TO PAVING.
   Sewer and water line house connections or crossovers shall be installed
before the paving of the streets, unless written permission has been obtained
from the Municipal Engineer to do otherwise. (Ord. 60-11. Passed 6-14-60.)
   1119.07  STREET CONFORMITY TO MASTER PLAN; DEDICATION AND ACQUISITION.
   All streets shall have concrete combined curbs and gutters and shall conform
substantially to the Master Plan adopted by the Planning Commission and any
revisions or amendments thereto. Whenever a tract to be subdivided includes any
part of a street indicated as a thoroughfare in the Master Plan, such part of
the street shall be dedicated by the subdivider, except as provided below. This
required dedication shall also apply to the widening of existing bordering
streets except in cases where the proposed subdivision is limited to a tier of
lots fronting on such bordering street and where the subdivider owns or
controls no adjoining land beyond the rear line of such tier of lots. In no
case shall the required dedication exceed forty feet in width as measured from
the center line of the bordering street. If a thoroughfare within a proposed
subdivision has a recommended width in excess of eighty feet, the Planning
Commission shall recommend to Council that such additional width be acquired by
the Municipality by purchase or appropriation proceedings. If within a maximum
of ninety days thereafter, Council has not indicated its intention or
proceeding with such acquisition, either by passage of a resolution agreeing to
purchase such property at a price agreed to by the subdivider and Council, or
by the passage of a resolution declaring its intent to appropriate such
property to a public use, then the recommendation by the Planning Commission
for a width in excess of eighty feet shall not be used as grounds for
disapproval of either the Subdivision Improvement Plan or the Plat of
Subdivision. Whenever a tract to be subdivided includes any part of an
expressway or modified expressway wherein the right of access is denied the
subdivider, then the Planning Commission shall recommend to Council that the
right of way for such expressway or modified expressway be acquired by the
Municipality by purchase or appropriation proceedings. If within a maximum of
six months thereafter, Council has not indicated its intention of proceeding
with such acquisition, either by passage of a resolution agreeing to purchase
such property at a price agreed to by the subdivider and Council, or by the
passage of a resolution declaring its intent to appropriate such property to
public use, then the recommendation by the Planning Commission for such right
of way shall not be used as a ground for disapproval of either the Subdivision
Improvement Plan or the Plat of Subdivision.
   In the case of either a thoroughfare in excess of eighty feet or an
expressway or modified expressway, if Council advises the Planning Commission
prior to the maximum time limits set out above that it has no intention of
proceeding with the desired acquisition, then the Planning Commission shall
consider a design for the subdivision which does not deny the immediate lawful
use of the property within such proposed right of way, but recognizes a
possible future acquisition of such right of way and provides accordingly for a
minimum degree of resultant disruption to the remaining streets and lots of the
subdivision.
(Ord. 60-11. Passed 6-14-60.)
   1119.08  STREET DESIGN STANDARDS AND SPECIFICATIONS.
   (a)    Neighborhood Plan. If a tentative plan has been prepared by the
Planning Commission for the neighborhood of the proposed subdivision, the
street system of the latter shall conform in general thereto.
   (b)    Physical Features. Streets shall be platted with appropriate regard
for topography, creeks, wooded areas and other natural features which would
enhance attractive development.
   (c)    Continuation of Existing Streets. Existing streets, constructed or
recorded in adjoining territory shall be continued at equal or greater width
and in similar alignment in the proposed subdivision, unless variations are
recommended by the Planning Commission.
   (d)    Ease of Circulation. The street pattern shall provide ease of
circulation within the subdivision as well as convenient access to adjoining
streets, thoroughfares or unsubdivided land, as may be required by the Planning
Commission. Minor residential streets should be so planned as to discourage
their use by nonlocal traffic. Where a street will eventually be extended
beyond the Plat but is temporarily dead-ended, an interim turnaround may be
required.
   (e)    Access to Modified Expressway. If a new subdivision involves frontage
on a modified expressway, the street layout should be planned to avoid, as far
as possible, any private residential driveways from having direct access to
such modified expressway. In such cases, access should be provided by means of
a service roadway with motor access at suitably spaced points.
   (f)    Unsubdivided Portion of Tract. If the Plat to be submitted includes
only part of the tract owned by the subdivider, the Planning Commission may
require a sketch of a tentative future street system for the unsubdivided
portion.
   (g)    Half-streets. The street layout shall be planned to avoid half-
streets, if possible. Where there exists a dedicated or platted half-street
adjacent to the tract to be subdivided, the other half shall be platted if
deemed necessary by the Planning Commission.
   (h)    Intersections. Streets shall intersect as nearly at right angles as
possible.
   At the intersection of two streets, property line corners shall be rounded
by an arc of twelve and one-half foot radius.
   All intersecting streets shall have a minimum curb or edge of paving radius
of twenty-five feet.
   The minimum radius, noted above, shall be increased when the smallest angle
of intersection is less than sixty degrees, or in any case where the Planning
Commission considers an increase necessary.
   (i)   Alleys. Except where justified by special conditions, alleys shall not
be approved in residential areas. At an intersection of alleys, a five foot
chord shall cut off each corner. Dead-end alleys are prohibited.
   (j)   Cul-de-sacs. Cul-de-sacs shall not be longer than 800 feet, unless
necessitated by topography or other circumstances beyond the subdivider's
control.
   Where a proposed street ends in a cul-de-sac, a "T" or ball-shaped turn-
around may be acceptable. If a ball-shaped turn-around is proposed, the minimum
curb radius shall be twenty-seven and one-half feet. If a "T" is proposed, the
minimum radius shall be twenty-five feet.
   (k)    Minimum Right of Way Widths.
      (1)    Expressways, modified expressways and thoroughfares as indicated
by the adopted Motorway Plan.
      (2)    Important neighborhood streets, County roads and State roads if
not part of the adopted Motorway Plan: sixty feet. (Ord. 60-11. Passed 6-14-
60.)
      (3)    Minor streets: sixty feet. All cul-de-sacs shall terminate in a
circular area with a minimum diameter of eighty feet, unless the Planning
Commission approves a "T" or "Y" type of turning facility.
         (Ord. 68-6. Passed 2-27-68.)
      (4)    Alleys: twenty feet.
      (5)    Crosswalk ways: ten feet.
      (6)    Easements: four feet on each side of the designated center line,
or such width as may be required for necessary maintenance of utility involved.
   (l)    Minimum Pavement Widths. The limits of any proposed pavement shall be
clearly indicated and all streets including side streets and alleys shall be
paved within the limits of the subdivision. (Ord. 60-11. Passed 6-14-60.)
      (1)    All streets: twenty-nine feet without curb, or thirty feet back to
back of curb where curb or combined concrete curb and gutter are used.
         (Ord. 68-6. Passed 2-27-68.)
      (2)    In case of a thoroughfare or important neighborhood street, the
matter of additional pavement width shall be discussed with the public
officials having jurisdiction, to determine whether or not public expenditures,
if any, for such additional width shall be made simultaneously with the
developer's improvement.
      (3)    Cul-de-sac streets shall terminate in a paved turn-around with a
minimum outside radius of twenty-seven and one-half feet. If a "T" or "Y"
shaped arrangement is approved by the Planning Commission in lieu of a turn-
around, such paved space shall extend the entire width of the right of way, and
shall be at least twelve and one-half feet wide, with the flared portions
rounded by at least a twelve and one-half foot radii.
      (4)    Alleys: twenty feet.
      (5)    Sidewalks at least four feet wide, and normally one foot from the
property line, crosswalks the same width, in the center of crosswalk ways.
   (m)    Vertical and Horizontal Alignment.
      (1)    Vertical. For thoroughfares and important neighborhood streets
profile grades shall be connected by vertical curves of a minimum length,
measured horizontally, equivalent to fifteen times the algebraic difference
between the rates of grade, expressed in feet per hundred. For minor streets
and alleys, one-half that minimum.
      (2)    Horizontal - Radii of centerline curvature:
         A.    Thoroughfares: 500 feet.
         B.    Important neighborhood streets: 200 feet.
         C.    Minor streets: 100 feet.
   There shall be a tangent between reverse curves of at least 100 feet,
wherever possible. In any case, standards shall be such as to produce
visibility to the satisfaction of the Municipal Engineer. All horizontal curves
shall show the complete functions of such curve and each P.C. (point of
curvature) and P.T. (point of tangent) shall be stationed.
   (n)    Street Name Signs. Street name signs shall be erected by the
developer in accordance with Municipal specifications.
   (o)    Profiles and Grades. All streets, including side streets and alleys
within the limits of the subdivision shall be graded the full width between
street property lines and all roadways shall be paved.
   All proposed grades shall be the centerline grades of the respective streets
and shall be indicated in complete detail in profiles and referenced to the
stationing shown on the Plan.
   The maximum grades shall not exceed six percent for main and secondary
thoroughfares or twelve percent for minor or local service streets and alleys.
The minimum grade of all streets shall be one-half of one percent. Grades
across intersections shall not be in excess of four percent except at the
discretion of the Municipal Engineer. The maximum grade of a crosswalk shall be
twelve percent, unless supplemented by steps.
   All changes in grade shall be connected by vertical curves of minimum length
equal to fifteen times the algebraic difference in rate of grade. The P.C. and
P.T. of all vertical curves shall be stationed and elevations shall be shown at
least every twenty-five feet within the limits of vertical curves.
   (p)    Construction and Standard Drawings; Typical Sections. All streets
shall have concrete combined curbs and gutters and shall be constructed in
accordance with the State of Ohio, Department of Highways, Construction and
Materials Specifications, including amendments thereto, in effect on the date
of approval of the Improvement Plan.
   Standard pavement drawings shall be either Ohio State Highway standards or
Hamilton County standards, all of which are on file in the office of the
Municipal Engineer and are titled "Typical Sections of Streets Required for
Subdivisions". Typical sections shall be drawn in accordance with Types 1, 2, 3
or 4 of the standard pavement drawings.
   Combined roll type concrete curb and gutter shall be thirty inches wide from
back of curb to inside edge of gutter, and of Class "D" mix concrete. The
entire right of way of all streets shall be graded the full width between
property lines with appropriate slopes for cuts and fills beyond property
lines. Proof of necessary right of way shall be required.
   The street may be Type 2 (reinforced concrete), or, if Type 1, 3 or 4, all
ditches shall be backfilled with gravel.
   (q)    Joints in Concrete Pavement. These provisions shall apply to
reinforced (T-71) and nonreinforced (T-70) pavement.
      (1)    One inch nonextruding expansion joint (Type A or B Dowel Bar Unit)
shall be installed in the pavement on each side of all intersections in
accordance with the standard pavement drawings. Expansion joints shall be
placed not farther than 600 feet apart.
      (2)    Transverse false (dummy) joints shall be constructed every fifteen
feet. Transverse joints between pours shall be standard key joints or standard
construction joints.
      (3)    Longitudinal joints between pours shall be standard key joints.
      (4)    All joints shall be thoroughly cleaned and sealed in accordance
with the applicable section of Ohio State specifications.
      (5)    All inlets, manholes, valve chambers, etc., shall be boxed or
blocked out in accordance with the standard pavement drawings.
         (Ord. 60-11. Passed 6-14-60.)
   1119.09  BLOCKS.
   (a)    Length. The normal maximum length for blocks is 1,800 feet. In a
block over 900 feet long a crosswalk way may be required.
   (b)    Width. The width of a block shall normally be sufficient to allow two
tiers of lots of appropriate depth.
   (c)    Irregular Shape. Irregularly shaped blocks, including superblocks,
indented by cul-de-sacs, containing interior parks or playgrounds and adequate
parking spaces, will be acceptable when properly designed and covered by
agreements as to maintenance of such park areas.
   (d)    Orientation on Motorway. If frontage on a motorway is involved, the
long dimension of the block shall preferably front thereon in order to create
as few intersections as possible with the motorway.
   (e)    Business or Industrial.  Blocks intended for business or industry
shall be of such length as may be considered most suitable for their
prospective use, including adequate provision for parking and deliveries. (Ord.
60-11. Passed 6-14-60.)
   1119.10  LOTS.
   (a)    Size, Shape and Orientation. Size, shape and orientation of lots
shall be appropriate to the location of the proposed subdivision and for the
types of development contemplated.
   (b)    Length and Width Ratio. Excessive length in relation to width shall
be avoided.
   (c)    Fronting on Motorways. Lots fronting on motorways should have extra
depth and deep setbacks, if topography permits.
   (d)    Double Frontage. Double frontage lots shall be avoided as far as
possible.
   (e)    Building Setback Lines. When topographical conditions require that
the septic tank and leaching bed be placed on the front portion of the lot, the
County Health Commissioner shall designate the proper building setback line.
   (f)    Side Lot Lines. Side lot lines shall be approximately at right angles
or radial to street lines unless, in the opinion of the Planning Commission, a
variation from this rule will give a better street and lot plan.
   (g)    Corner Lots. Corner lots shall have an extra width sufficient to
allow for building setback lines on both front and side, with thirty percent
less required for the side yard setback. (Ord. 60-11. Passed 6-14-60.)
   1119.11  PUBLIC OPEN SPACES AND SITES.
   Where, as indicated by the Master Plan, a proposed subdivision contains,
wholly or in part, a proposed public open space or a proposed site for a public
building, the Planning Commission will immediately notify the public authority
concerned (Council, Park Board, Board of Education, etc.). If within thirty
days thereafter, the Planning Commission is not advised that such property has
been acquired by negotiation and agreement, or within a second period of thirty
days after such notification that such authority has commenced the necessary
procedure to acquire such property by appropriation, then the Planning
Commission will not require that such open space or site be reserved or
included in the Subdivision Plan.
(Ord. 60-11. Passed 6-14-60.)
   1119.12  SIDEWALKS.
   (a)    Sidewalks shall be constructed on both sides of all streets and in
all crosswalk ways within all subdivisions. One course cement sidewalks of
Class "C" concrete, four feet wide and five inches thick (seven inches thick
across driveways), shall be constructed where shown on the Plan or typical
section and including all walkways. One-half inch expansion joints shall be
placed at intervals not to exceed 100 feet. Final determination of the
necessity for the construction of sidewalks in any specific instance shall rest
with the Planning Commission.
   (b)    All developers and/or builders in development hereinafter of all
residential lots and business lots shall, at the time of such development,
construct sidewalks thereon in accordance with the specifications set forth in
subsection (a) hereof.
(Ord. 64-48. Passed 5-12-64.)
   1119.13  UTILITY EASEMENTS OUTSIDE STREET LINES.
   Where utilities are located outside of street right-of-way lines, easements
shall be provided. Easements along rear or side lot lines are preferable where
possible.
(Ord. 60-11. Passed 6-14-60.)
   1119.14  WATER MAINS.
   (a)    Location. Proposed new water mains in existing roads or streets shall
generally be located on the north or east side of the existing road or street
outside of the existing or proposed pavement area.

the engineers of the agency, who will supply the water to the system, either
directly and/or indirectly through the Hamilton County Sanitary Department.
   (b)    Materials and Installation. All materials used and the installation
of those materials in the line shall be in accordance with the specifications
and charges for inspection of the agency, who will supply the water to the main
and/or the Hamilton County Sanitary Department.
   (c)    Fire Hydrants. Fire hydrants shall be placed at approximately 400-
foot intervals.
   (d)    Control Valves. There shall be four control valves at each cross
intersection and three control valves at each "T" intersection. All main line
control valves shall be housed in a standard brick valve chamber. Fire hydrant
control valves may be housed in a standard valve box.
   (e)    Connection to Existing Mains. Wherever it is possible, proposed mains
shall connect to existing mains. Dead-ends shall not be permitted where it is
possible to obtain a closed circuit to existing mains.
   (f)    Main Size. The size of water mains to be installed in a new system
will be determined by the water supply agency and/or the Municipal Engineer,
and installed in accordance with the City-County water contract.
   (g)    Service Branches. All water service branches from the water mains to
the property line will be installed by the water supply agency and/or its
agent, upon application and payment of the tapping charge.
   (h)    Application for Construction. Upon the approval of a water main plant
showing all of the construction details of design, etc., the Hamilton County
Sanitary Department will make a preliminary estimate of cost of construction
for the water main. The subdivider then shall make a formal request for
permission from the Municipality to construct the water main and appurtenances
at his own cost and expense and in accordance with the plans, specifications,
City-County water contract and estimate on file in the Hamilton County Sanitary
Department. The subdivider shall agree to pay to the Municipality, two percent
of the estimated cost for overhead and maintenance charge. He shall agree in
the request to save the Municipality and all its representatives harmless from
all suits, actions or claims of any character brought on account of any
injuries or damages sustained by any person or property in consequence of any
neglect in safeguarding the work or through the use of unacceptable materials

and recommendation. The SHPC shall complete and make its recommendations to the
City Council within 60 days after referral. Upon request by the SHPC, the City
Council may grant an extension of one additional 30-day period for review of
the application.  Should no recommendation be rendered by the SHPC within the
aforesaid approved time frame, the application shall be considered approved and
forwarded to City Council.
      (2)   After the receipt of the SHPC's recommendation, or should no
recommendation be rendered by the SHPC within the allotted time frame, the City
Council shall convene a Public Hearing within 60 days of receipt and shall
notify property owners of the proposed landmark, historic district,
contributing building, or historic site, by certified mail at least 30 days
prior to holding the Public Hearing to consider such designation. Applications
for contributing buildings, when including 25 or more applications, may waive
the certified mail notice and instead advertise via legal notice published in a
newspaper of general circulation at least 30 days in advance. All hearing(s)
under this subsection (c)(2) shall be published at least 15 days in advance of
such hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation in the City.
   (d)   Decision of the Council. Within 30 days following such hearing,
Council shall take action on the designation by approving or disapproving the
application by Resolution.
   (e)   Criteria.  To be considered for designation, a property must be fifty
years old or older and retain integrity of its design and materials.  In acting
on such designation, the City Council shall consider the recommendations of the
SHPC, the Public Hearing and the following criteria of the property. 
      (1)   Its character, interest or value as part of the development,
heritage or cultural characteristics of the City, the State or the United

heritage of the City.
      (5)   Its embodiment of distinguishing characteristics of an
architectural type or specimen.
      (6)   Its identification as the work of an architect or master builder
whose work has influenced the development of the City.
      (7)   Its embodiment of elements of architectural design, detail,
materials or craftsmanship which represent a significant architectural

      (9)   Its unique location or singular physical characteristic
representing an established and familiar visual feature of a neighborhood or
the City.
      (10)   It has yielded, or is likely to yield information important to
historic understanding.
   (f)   Zoning District Map.  Upon the designation of a landmark, historic
district, contributing building or historic site by ordinance, the zoning
district map of the City shall be revised by the city to indicate by an
appropriate symbol or device that the parcel so marked is subject to the listed
designation, and the Clerk of the Council shall send a certified copy of the
ordinance by registered mail to the owner(s) of record.
   (g)   Limitations. The City Council may designate landmarks, historic
districts, contributing buildings or historic sites without limitation as to
number or period when designation proceeds from an application for the same.
   (h)   Lists.  Any area, building, structure, premises, etc. that is

(Ord. 2010-10.  Passed 3-30-10; Ord. 2015-36.  Passed 9-8-15.)
   1126.06  REGULATIONS GOVERNING EXISTING BUILDINGS, NEW  BUILDINGS,
ADDITIONS, DEMOLITIONS AND REMOVAL OF BUILDINGS.
     (a)   Limitations on Issuance of Building and Demolition Permits.  No
construction, reconstruction, addition, demolition or removal of any building
or significant exterior architectural feature thereof to any listed landmark,
contributing building, or any other structure within an historic district shall
be undertaken prior to obtaining a Certificate of Appropriateness from the
Sharonville Historic Preservation Commission (SHPC) and a zoning certificate
from the Zoning Administrator, if applicable. No zoning certificate shall be
issued by the Zoning Administrator for the construction, addition, demolition
or removal of a listed landmark, contributing building or non-contributing
building and historic sites in or outside of an historic district, except in
cases falling within the exclusion set forth in this section, unless the
application for such permit is approved by the SHPC through the issuance of a
Certificate of Appropriateness in the manner prescribed herein.
   (b)   Certificate of Appropriateness.
      (1)   Applicability.
         A.   When the owner of a listed landmark, contributing building or
non-contributing building or historic site in or outside of an historic
district intends to construct, reconstruct, alter or demolish any exterior
architectural feature of such building or an accessory building exceeding 150
square feet in floor area located on the same lot as the landmark, contributing
or non-contributing building, unless said building is designated as an historic
site, or when the owner intends to subdivide the lot they shall first apply for
and secure a Certificate of Appropriateness. A Certificate of Appropriateness
is required for any exterior change to the building or its property, as
otherwise regulated by this section. 
            1.   The application for a Certificate of Appropriateness shall be
filed with the Department of Community Development with such plans,
specifications, and other materials as the City requires, on such forms
provided by the Department.
            2.   The SHPC shall make a determination on an application for
Certificate of Appropriateness within thirty (45) days of the filing of
application listed above or within sixty (60) days if a public hearing is
required, unless an extension of time is approved by the applicant.  If the
Commission fails to render its decision within the specified time period, the
application for Certificate of Appropriateness shall be deemed approved. 
      (2)   Procedure.
         A.   Once an application for a Certificate of Appropriateness is filed
with the Department of Community Development, it shall be scheduled on the
agenda of the next available meeting of the SHPC, except, however, that such
application shall be heard within 45 days of the receipt of the completed
application and necessary attachments by the City. At the hearing, the SHPC
shall approve the application or make suggestions to modify the application for
approval at its next meeting.
         B.   Within 75 days of the receipt of the completed application and
necessary attachments by the City, the SHPC shall file a report approving the
Certificate of Appropriateness, approving the Certificate of Appropriateness
with conditions, or denying the application.
         C.   If the application is not heard by the SHPC within 45 days or no
report is filed within 75 days of the receipt of the completed application and
the necessary attachments by the City, the Certificate of Appropriateness shall
be considered approved by the SHPC.
         D.   A application shall be deemed filed only when it contains the
plans, specifications, and other materials prescribed by the City.
         E.   A denial of a Certificate of Appropriateness application may be
appealed to City Council according to the provisions of Section
 1126.07.
      (3)   Design guidelines.  In general, the treatment of landmarks,
contributing properties, and historic sites shall comply with the Secretary of
the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation. The SHPC may supplement the design
requirements listed in the following sections by issuing design guidelines.
These guidelines are meant to assure that any alteration, demolition, or
removal of landmarks, contributing buildings or historic sites preserves and
protects the historic character of those resources. These guidelines shall then
be submitted to the City Council for review and approval prior to their
becoming effective. Once approved, the guidelines shall be made available by
the City to interested parties in order to provide them guidance in designing
work scope and submitting requests. SHPC shall review and update the design
guidelines during the first SHPC meeting of each year and then immediately
submit same to the City Council for approval.
   (c)   Design Requirements and Guidelines for Existing Landmarks or
Contributing Buildings.
      (1)   Alterations.  The historic character of a property shall be
retained and preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of
features and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided. Deteriorated
historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of
deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature
shall match the old in design, color, texture, and other visual qualities and,
where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features shall be
substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence.
      (2)   Additions.  New additions, exterior alterations, or related new
construction should be compatible in character with the original building. They
should be sympathetic but not duplicative in design.  In general, additions
should avoid changing significant elevations that are visible from public
rights-of-way and should not overpower the original building. 
      (3)   Materials.  Buildings shall have exterior materials of painted
wood, brick, stucco, stone masonry, or other materials deemed appropriate by
the SHPC. Vinyl, aluminum and synthetic stucco are not appropriate.
      (4)   Window and door openings.  Window and door openings are a major
character-defining feature of a building and usually occupy 20% to 50% of the
front elevation.  They are typically vertically aligned and proportioned with a
2:1 ratio of height to width and defined by elements such as lintels and
sills.  The original openings should be maintained.  New windows should have a
configuration that is historically appropriate such as one-over-one, two-over-
two or six-over-six double-hung sashes.  Tinted or reflective glass is not
appropriate. 
      (5)   Scale and massing. Overall building height to width ratios, chimney
construction, roof pitch, footprint size, both absolute footprint size and size
relative to lot size, placement and orientation, and other pertinent data, as
deemed important to the overall building appearance shall be considered in the
design of any addition, alteration or replacement of existing structures.
      (6)   Accessory buildings. Accessory buildings exceeding 300 square feet
of floor area shall be of the same architectural style and same exterior
material as the main building unless the accessory building is a reconstruction
of an accessory building that previously existed on the lot, in which case
substantial freedom shall be afforded the applicant to replicate the structure
as it previously existed.
   (d)   Design Requirements for New Buildings in Historic Districts.
      (1)   Scale and massing.  New buildings shall be similar in size, scale,
mass and architectural style as the surrounding contributing buildings. 
Overall building height-to-width ratios, roof pitch, size, placement,
orientation, and other pertinent data, as deemed important to the overall
building appearance shall be considered in the design of any new or replacement
structures.
      (2)   Materials.  New buildings shall have exterior materials of painted
wood, brick, stucco, or stone masonry, or other material deemed appropriate by
the SHPC. Vinyl, aluminum and synthetic stucco are not appropriate.
      (3)   Window and door openings.  Window and door openings are a major
character-defining feature of a building and usually occupy 20% to 50% of the
front elevation.  They are typically aligned vertically with a 2:1 ratio of
height to width and defined by elements such as lintels and sills.  New windows
should have a configuration that is historically appropriate such as one-over-
one, two-over-two or six-over-six double-hung sashes.  In all cases, glass
should be clear; tinted or reflective glass is not appropriate. 
      (4)   Site location of new buildings.  In order to maintain historic
landscapes around landmarks and contributing buildings, no new buildings shall
be built on lots in front of landmarks or contributing buildings. New lots can
be next to or behind landmarks and contributing buildings.  New buildings shall
have front yard setbacks similar to surrounding contributing buildings,
provided that no new front yard of greater than 50 feet shall be required.
      (5)   Garages.  In order to maintain the characteristics of a historic
district, no new house may be built with garage doors on the front elevation of
said house facing the street. For corner lots, garage doors may face the street
on the side elevation.  Detached garages built behind the rear elevation of new
or existing houses may have garage doors facing the front or side of the lot.
      (6)   Accessory buildings.  Accessory buildings exceeding 300 square feet
of floor area shall be of the same architectural style and same exterior
material as the main building unless the accessory building is a reconstruction
of an accessory building that previously existed on the lot, in which case
substantial freedom shall be afforded the applicant to replicate the structure
as it previously existed. 
   (e)   Design Guidelines for Site Improvements to Landmarks, Historic
Districts, and Historic Sites.
      (1)   Building signage.  Any sign requiring a permit from the city, which
is proposed to be attached to a landmark or contributing building shall be of
material and style harmonious with the building and its surroundings.  All such
signs shall be presented to the SHPC for Certificate of Appropriateness
approval prior to initiation or erection of such sign.
      (2)   Parking and paving.  Reducing green space by adding additional
pavement for driveways or parking areas should be limited whenever possible.
New driveways and parking areas shall respect existing contours and natural
features and be set back from adjoining property lines at least five feet.
   (f)   Non-contributing Buildings.  Additions and alterations to, and
rehabilitations of non-contributing buildings should either be compatible with
the style and character of the non-contributing buildings or should cause the
buildings to become more compatible with the district.
   (g)   Demolition.  The demolition of existing buildings shall not be
unreasonably denied. The SHPC shall consider the following criteria in
evaluating applications for demolition.
      (1)   Public safety.  Demolition has been ordered by the Building
Official for public safety because of an unsafe or dangerous condition that
constitutes an emergence.
      (2)   Commercial property.  The owner can demonstrate to the satisfaction
of the SHPC that the building cannot be reused nor can a reasonable economic
return be gained from the use of all or part of the building proposed for
demolition.
      (3)   Dwellings and accessory buildings.  The owner can demonstrate to
the satisfaction of the SHPC that the building can not be economically restored
and will not adversely affect the character of the City.
      (4)   Non-significant items.  The demolition request is for an
inappropriate addition or a non-significant portion of building and the
demolition will not adversely affect those parts of the building that are
significant as determined by the SHPC.
      (5)   Non-contributing buildings.  Non-contributing buildings may be
demolished if the demolition will not adversely affect the character of the
district. Any new construction on the cleared site will be subject to the
guidelines for new construction and site improvements.
      (6)   Demolition by neglect.  No owner of a building or structure in the
historic district shall by action(s) or willful neglect, fail to provide
sufficient and reasonable care, maintenance and upkeep to ensure such
building's perpetuation and to prevent its destruction by deterioration." 
   (h)   Subdivision of Lots Containing Landmark Buildings.
      (1)   The subdivision of any lot containing a landmark shall be
accomplished in such way that both the new lot and reduced lot conform to the
minimum lot size in the zoning district and shall provide sufficient space so
that a minimum 30 foot distance is maintained between any landmark building and
any structure proposed on the new lot.
      (2)   Any new lot created from the subdivision of a lot containing a
landmark must be at least one-half the size of the remaining portion of the lot
containing the landmark.
         (Ord. 2010-10.  Passed 3-30-10; Ord. 2015-36.  Passed 9-8-15.)
   1126.07   APPEAL PROCEDURES.
       (a)   Within 30 days of any Sharonville Historic Preservation Commission
decision, any affected party may appeal the decision to the City Council by
filing notice thereof with the Clerk of the Council.
   (b)   The City Council shall schedule a public hearing within 45 days of the
date the appeal is received. At the public hearing, the Council shall hear all
interested parties. Within 30 days of the public hearing, the Council shall
pass a resolution either confirming, rejecting, amending, or remanding the
decision of the Sharonville Historic Preservation Commission. The Clerk of
Council shall notify the owner of any property involved of the Council action
by regular first class mail.  If remanded to the Sharonville Historic
Preservation Commission, the remand must be resolved or returned to the City
Council within 45 days of the remand.
(Ord. 2010-10.  Passed 3-30-10.)
   1126.99   PENALTY.
   (a)   Any person violating the provisions of this chapter by failing to
perform any act required by this section or by performing any act which is
prohibited by this section shall be subject to the penalty provisions listed in
Chapter
1199 of the Sharonville Zoning Code, of which this chapter is a part.  Every
day on which a violation exists shall constitute a separate violation.
   (b)   In case any building or structure is erected, constructed, altered,
added to or demolished in violation of this section, the Director of Community
Development, the SHPC or any other person designated by the City Council may
institute appropriate action or proceeding to prevent such unlawful action. The
imposition of any penalty hereunder shall not preclude the city, the SHPC, a
neighborhood or adjacent property owner or any proper person from instituting
any proper action or proceeding to require compliance with the provisions of
this section and with administrative orders and determination made hereunder.
   (c)   Any person, who demolishes, either by action(s) or by willful neglect,

be required to restore with due diligence the building or structure and its
site to its appearance prior to the violation. Any action to enforce the
subsection may be brought by the Director of Community Development, the SHPC or
any other person designated by the City Council. This civil remedy shall be in
addition to and not in lieu of any criminal prosecution and penalty.
   (d)   The SHPC on its initiative may file a petition with the Director of
Community Development to take action against any owner which, in the opinion of
the SHPC, is in violation of the chapter.
   (e)   An applicant who demolishes, alters or constructs a building or
structure in violation of this section shall also be deemed in violation of the
Zoning Code of the City of Sharonville.  (Ord. 2010-10.  Passed 3-30-10.)

   (a)    The incorporated territory of the City is hereby divided into
fourteen districts in order to classify, regulate and restrict the location of
businesses, industries, residences, recreation and other land uses and the
location of buildings designed for specific uses; to regulate and limit the
height, number of stories and size of buildings and other structures hereafter
erected or altered; to regulate and limit the percentages of lot areas which
may be occupied; and to establish setback lines, sizes of yards and other open
spaces within and surrounding such buildings and the density of population, the
incorporated territory of the City is hereby divided into districts as follows.
All such regulations are uniform for each class or kind of building, structure
or use throughout each class of district. Such districts shall be known as:
 
      District Title                Abbreviation
      Residential Districts
(1)   One Family A                  R1-A

   Whenever the abbreviated terms such as PF, R1-A, LB, GB, etc. are used in
this Zoning Ordinance, they shall be construed as referring to their
corresponding district titles.
   (b)    The above classification of districts shall not be construed as an
enumeration of most restrictive to least restrictive districts except for the
specific purposes set forth in this Ordinance. All districts are as shown on
the officially adopted Zoning Map which accompanies this Ordinance and is
declared to be a part hereof as if fully described. The map designation and the
rules which accompany the Zoning Map are declared to be a part of this
Ordinance. No buildings or premises shall be erected or used except in
conformity with the rules herein prescribed for the use districts in which such
buildings or premises are located and with all other rules contained in this
Ordinance. (Ord. 82-61. Passed 1-11-83.)
   1127.02  ESTABLISHMENT OF REGULATIONS.
   Any building or parcel of land may be used; and the use of any building and
any parcel of land may be changed or extended; and any existing building may be
altered, converted, enlarged, reconstructed, moved or maintained, only for the
uses specifically enumerated or referred to as permitted or required, in the
district in which the building or parcel of land is located and for no other
use. The enumeration of uses within a district shall not be construed as a
ranking of the most desirable to less desirable uses.
   (a)    Main Buildings and Uses. Main buildings and uses enumerated in the
various use regulations of this Zoning Ordinance shall be permitted by right as
the principal building, use or activity of a zoning lot only in a district in
which it is specifically permitted.
   (b)    Similar Uses. Similar uses are uncommon uses which have
characteristics similar to and compatible with those uses enumerated as
permitted in a district by right, but since they occur only infrequently it is
not reasonable to enumerate all such uncommon uses. They may, however, be added
to the enumerations of permitted uses by procedures established in Section
1161.07.
   (c)    Conditional Uses. Conditional uses are certain types of main uses so
classified in this Ordinance because of their uncommon or unique
characteristics, large land area requirements or for other reasons, uses which
cannot be permitted by right, in specific locations in districts in which they
are not appropriate and compatible without certain adjustments. The uses which
may be considered for conditional approval in specific districts are enumerated
throughout the sections dealing with use regulations. The procedures are
enumerated throughout the sections dealing with use regulations. The procedures
and standards for evaluating and approving conditional uses are set forth in
Chapter
1159.
   (d)    Accessory Buildings and Uses. Accessory buildings and uses as
enumerated in the various use regulations of this Ordinance shall be permitted
as a subordinate building or subordinate use if it is clearly incidental to and
located on the same zoning lot as the main building or use, and if located in a
district in which it is specifically permitted. The use, change, extension,
alteration, conversion, enlargement, reconstruction, relocation, or maintenance
of accessory buildings and land shall be subject to all area, yard, height,
off-street parking and other regulations set forth or referred to for the
district in which the accessory building or parcel of land is located and to
all other applicable regulations of this Ordinance. (Ord. 82-61. Passed 1-11-
83.)
   1127.03  MAP AND NOTATIONS INCORPORATED.
   The boundaries of the districts are shown upon the Zoning Map which is
attached hereto and made a part of this Zoning Ordinance, which Map is
designated as the "Zoning Map". The Map and all notations, references and other
information shown thereon, are a part of the Ordinance and have the same force
and effect as if the Map and all notations, references and other information
shown thereon were fully set forth and described herein.
(Ord. 82-61. Passed 1-11-83.)
   1127.04  ZONING VACATED PROPERTY.
   Whenever any street, alley or other public way is vacated by official action
of Council, the zoning of the district adjoining each side of such street,
alley or other public way shall be automatically extended to the center of such
vacation and all area included in the vacation shall henceforth be subject to
all appropriate regulations of the extended districts.
(Ord. 82-61. Passed 1-11-83.)
   1127.05  ZONING ANNEXED TERRITORIES.
   All territory which may hereinafter be annexed to the City, if already
zoned, shall be continued in its existing zoning classification until amended
in conformance with the procedures outlined in this Zoning Ordinance. (Ord. 82-
61. Passed 1-11-83.)
   1127.06  RULES FOR UNCERTAIN BOUNDARIES.
   Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of the various
districts as shown on the Zoning Map accompanying and made a part of this
Zoning Ordinance, the following rules apply:
   (a)    The district boundaries are the center lines of streets or alleys,
unless otherwise shown and where the districts designated on the Map are
bounded approximately by street or alley center lines, such center lines shall
be construed to be the boundary of the districts;
   (b)    Where the district boundaries are not otherwise indicated and where
the property has been or may hereafter be divided into blocks and lots, the
district boundaries shall be construed to be the lot lines. Where the districts
designated on the Map are bounded approximately by lot lines, such lot lines
shall be construed to be the boundary of the districts, unless the boundaries
are otherwise indicated on the Map; and
   (c)    In unsubdivided property, the district boundary lines on the Map
shall be determined by dimensions or the use of the scale appearing on the Map.
      (Ord. 82-61. Passed 1-11-83.)
   1127.07  RULES FOR MAP AND TEXT INTERPRETATION.
   (a)    In interpreting the text, the particular shall control the general.
   (b)    In case of any difference of meaning or implication between the text
and any table, the text shall control.
(Ord. 82-61. Passed 1-11-83.)
   1127.08  OVERLAY DISTRICTS.
   Overlay districts are zoning tools used for dealing with unique situations
or accomplishing special planning and zoning goals.  Overlay districts may be
created where the land use regulations and associated development standards of
the underlying zoning districts are deemed inadequate to be effective.  As the
name implies, overlay zoning districts are “overlaid” on top of base zoning
districts.  The overlay district alters or adds to the zoning requirements of
the base zoning district or districts.  Overlay districts are shown on the
official Zoning Map as dashed lines labeled with the overlay map designation or
with the overlay district name.  Overlay districts shall be given a two or
three letter designator that follows the designation of the underlying base
zoning district.  For example, a lot located in the GB General Business
District and in the Northern Lights Overlay District shall have the zoning
designation of GB-NLO.
   The following overlay districts are included in the City of Sharonville
Zoning Code:

      (Ord. 82-61. Passed 1-11-83.)
   1131.06  YARD REGULATIONS FOR ATTACHED SINGLE FAMILY; MULTI-FAMILY DWELLINGS
AND ACCESSORY USES.
   In order to encourage greater flexibility in design and more attractive
arrangements of buildings and greater utilization of open spaces, yard
regulations for multi-family dwellings are hereby established for single
development and yard regulations for locating several buildings within a group
development.
   The yards of multi-family buildings shall be related to the space within the
dwelling units as well as the yards. Buildings shall be arranged so as to
assure privacy between adjacent buildings and intersecting wings of buildings,
from streets, parking and recreation areas in accordance with the following:
   (a)    Definitions. The terms used in this section are defined as follows:
(1)    "Single development" means a development of one multi-family building on
one lot coordinated with the surrounding neighborhood and fronting on a
dedicated street.
(2)    "Group development" means a development of more than one multi- family
building on a parcel planned as a unit and coordinated with the surrounding
neighborhood.
(3)    "Main wall" means any exterior wall of a multi-family building
containing the principal windows of a living, dining and/or sleeping room or
rooms.
(4)    "End of secondary wall" means any exterior wall of a multi-family
building other than a main wall and containing secondary windows required for
ventilation and not intended to provide a direct view.
(5)    "Overlapping walls" means that portion of the exterior walls which are
directly opposing when two buildings, parallel or within thirty degrees of
being parallel, face each other across an open yard or court.
   (b)    Front yard depth or setback for multi-family buildings in single
development or  group development shall not be less than thirty feet measured
from the street right-of-way line or as established otherwise by ordinance.
   (c)    The distance between facing and overlapping buildings or parts
thereof in a group development of multi-family buildings shall vary in direct
relation to the length and height of buildings. Such minimum distance shall be
determined by the formula:
         Minimum Distance = LA + LB + HA + HB
                  F
   
The elements of the formula are illustrated in Appendix I and defined as
follows:
(1)    "Minimum distance" means the required minimum horizontal distance
between any wall of building A and the nearest wall of building B or the
vertical prolongation of either.
(2)    "LA" means the total length of building A which, for the purposes of the
formula, is defined as the maximum length of the portion or portions of any
wall or walls of building A from which lines drawn perpendicular to the face of
such wall or walls shall intersect any wall of building B.
      (3)    "LB" means the total length of building B which, for the purposes
of the formula, is defined as the maximum length of the portion or portions of
any wall or walls of building B from which lines drawn perpendicular to the
face of such wall or walls shall intersect any wall of building A.
      (4)    "HA" means the height of building A.
      (5)    "HB" means the height of building B.
      (6)    "F" means the divisor factor. In the R2-C and RM-D Districts the
divisor factor is four. However, the minimum distance between any two main
walls of separate buildings shall not be less than forty feet.
   (d)    For distances in angular arrangements of thirty to sixty degrees,
such minimum distances are determined by the formula:
   
      Minimum Distance = 2LB + HA + HB - k
               F
   
The elements of the formula are as defined in subsection (c) hereof and are
shown on the illustration Appendix I. The "k" in the formula varies as the
   sine of 2n where n is the angle from building B to building A or extensions
thereof.
   
 
Where n is (Degrees) k equals (Feet)
30 to 34             10
35 to 39             20
40 to 50             25
51 to 55             20
56 to 60             10
   
   (e)    For distances between walls of court arrangements, such minimum
distances shall be determined by applying the formula set forth in subsection
(c) hereof to each set of facing walls. In arrangements of parallel walls with
offset sections, the distance between the corresponding parallel walls shall be
determined by such formula. The elements of the formula are shown on the
illustration Appendix I.
   (f)    For the distance between nonoverlapping walls where walls of two
buildings do not directly face each other or do not overlap, that is where
lines drawn perpendicular from the face of any wall of any building shall not
intersect the face of any wall of another building, the minimum horizontal
distance between such buildings shall not be less than one-half of the combined
height of the two buildings. Such minimum distances shall be determined by the
formula:
   
         Minimum Distance = HA + HB
                  2
   (g)    Distance between building and boundary lines of a multi-family
building or part thereof, in a single development or group development and any
side or rear lot line of the parcel or development area shall vary in direct
relation to the length and height of the building. Such minimum distance shall
be as determined by the formula:
   
         Minimum Distance = 2(LL) + HA
                  F
   
The elements of such formula are shown on the illustration Appendix I and
defined as follows:
(1)    "Minimum distance" means the minimum required horizontal distance
between any wall of a building and the nearest side or rear lot line, or
boundaries of the parcel or development area.
(2)    "LL" means the maximum length of the side or rear lot line which can be
intersected by lines drawn perpendicular from the face or faces of any wall or
walls of the building.
(3)    "HA" means the height of building A.
(4)    "F" means the divisor factor. In the R2-C and RM-D Districts, the
divisor factor is four. Where any multi-family development abuts a one and two-
family residential district along any rear property line, the minimum distance
from any property line in such districts and any main building shall not be
less than two times the height of the main building.
   (h)    For townhouse dimensions, any main or longitudinal wall of a sequence
of townhouse units shall not exceed 132 feet in length without a ninety degree
offset of at least ten feet, and the aggregate length of any wall, including
its offsets, shall not exceed 176 feet in length.
   (i)    In the use and design of yards, the required yards set forth in this
section shall be landscaped and may be used for driveways, pedestrian walks and
passive recreation areas. If, however, yards between buildings are used for
parking areas or playgrounds, the distances between buildings shall be
increased by the dimensions of such intermediary facilities. The site shall be
designed so that entrances to all buildings shall be located not more than 200
feet from the accessory parking area, the distance to be measured along
pedestrian walks.
   (j)    Site plans for all apartment and townhouse dwellings, shall be
submitted to the Planning Commission in accordance with the provisions of
Chapter
1157. Building permits shall not be issued until such plans are found to comply
with all applicable provisions of this Zoning-Ordinance and the plans are
finally approved by the Commission. The diagrams in Appendix I indicate the
regulations and planning criteria as set forth in this section and constitute a
part of this Ordinance.
      (1)    The applicant is encouraged to informally consult with the Zoning
Enforcement Officer and the Planning Commission prior to the submittal of the
required site plans. It shall be understood that no statement or representation
by the Zoning Enforcement Officer or the Commission shall be binding upon the
formal review process.
(2)    The Zoning Enforcement Officer shall transfer one copy of the site plan
to the City Engineer for his/her review, report and recommendations. The
Engineer shall, within thirty days from the receipt of such site plan, provide
and furnish to the Commission a report upon the site plans compliance to those
regulations within the jurisdiction of the Engineer.
   (k)    Minimum distances for accessory uses in the R2-C and RM-D Districts
shall conform to the following schedule:

   (b)   Use Regulations.  The following use regulations shall apply to
container port depots and other similar uses.
      (1)   New depots.  A proposed newly constructed or newly established
depot that is more than 1000 feet from the nearest existing Container Port
Depot, more than 1000 feet from the nearest interstate expressway and 1000 feet

topography, walls, decorative fences or other approved features instead of
landscaping, if they achieve the same degree of screening as the required
landscaping.
         B.   The proposed landscaping shall be required to screen the
container port facility to the extent that it softens the appearance to the
surrounding areas as approved by Planning Commission.
      (5)   Site plan required.  A full site plan shall be required for all
proposed container port depot sites, at a scale of 1 inch to 100 feet
(1"=100'), indicating, as a minimum, the following:
         A.   The total area of the site.
         B.   The existing zoning of the property in question and of all
adjacent properties.
         C.   All public and private right-of-way and easement lines located on
or adjacent to the property which is proposed to be continued, created,
relocated or abandoned.
         D.   Existing topography with a maximum of five foot contour
intervals.
         E.   The proposed finished grade of the development shown by contours
not exceeding five foot intervals.
         F.   The location of all existing buildings and structures and the
proposed location of new structures and a layout of all outside storage
including dimensions, heights, and where applicable, the gross floor area of
the buildings.
         G.   The locations and dimensions of all curb cuts, driving lanes,
off- street parking and loading areas including the number of spaces, grades,
surfacing materials, drainage plans and illumination of the facility.
         H.   All existing and proposed sidewalks and open areas on the site.
      I.   The location of all proposed fences, screening and walls.
         J.   The location of all existing and proposed streets.
         K.   All existing and proposed utilities including types and grades.
         L.   The schedule of any phasing of the project.
         M.   Any other information as may be required by the Planning
Commission to determine the conformance with this Zoning Code.
Upon submission of a complete application for site plan review to the Building
Official, the plan shall be reviewed to determine if it meets the purpose and
requirements as established in this section, of the zoning district where the
proposed container port depot is located and of any other applicable section of
the Zoning Code.
      (6)   Definition.  For the purposes of this section, the term “container”
means an article of transport equipment which is of a permanent character and
strong enough for repeated use; is specially designed to facilitate the
carriage of goods by one or more modes of transport, without intermediate
reloading; and is fitted with devices permitting its ready handling from one
mode of transport to another; and is so designed as to be easy to fill and
empty; and has an internal volume of one cubic meter or more.

   1139.01  PURPOSE.
   Traditional zoning, with its rigid separation of uses into different zones
under very restricted placement controls, has now been recognized as being
inappropriate to many medium and large scale developments. Planned
developments, which modify the traditional forms of zoning, permit a developer
to secure advantages which can be passed on to the general public by virtue of
more desirable and more economical development. This chapter provides a
controlled degree of flexibility in the placement of structures and lot sizes
and types of uses, while maintaining adequate planning and development
standards. The Planned Unit Development (PUD) provisions shall apply in
specific zoning districts converting and expanding the development otherwise
permitted in those zoning districts, all in accordance with the following
additional regulations. The Residential PUD provisions replace the normal
density, lot size, type of uses and yard setback requirements with more general
flexible requirements, and may be utilized in one or more residential zoning
districts as one development site. The Commercial PUD provisions modify the
normal type of use restrictions in separate commercial districts by allowing a
wider variety of uses in a controlled planned development concept. (Ord. 82-61.
Passed 1-11-83.)
   1139.02  OBJECTIVES.
   The objectives, principles and standards are intended to guide the applicant
in the preparation of the land use and development plan and they shall be used
as the basis for the evaluation of the plan by the Planning Commission and
Council.
   The following objectives shall be considered in reviewing any application
for any PUD in order to realize the inherent advantages of coordinated,
flexible, comprehensive, long-range, planning and development of such planned
development:
   (a)    To provide more desirable living, shopping and working environments
by preserving the natural character of open fields, stands of trees, brooks,
ponds, floodplains, hills and similar natural assets;
   (b)    To encourage with regard to residential use the provision of open
space and the development of recreational facilities and neighborhood
commercial facilities in a generally central location within reasonable
distance of all living units;
   (c)    To encourage developers to use a more creative and imaginative
approach in the development of residential areas, especially through the
mixture of several housing types in one development;
   (d)    To encourage underground utilities which can be more efficiently
designed when master planning a larger area;
   (e)    To allow phased construction with the knowledge that subsequent
phases shall be approved as originally planned and approved by the City; and

collector or local streets;
      (6)    Any proposed public use areas including schools, parks, open
space, etc;
      (7)    Existing floodplains, bodies of water and other unbuildable areas;
and
      (8)    The written statement to be included along with the preliminary
sketch plan shall contain the following information:
         A.    An explanation of the character of the PUD, the manner which it
has been planned to take advantage of the PUD regulations, the manner in which
it reflects the "purpose" and "objectives" of PUD as stated in Sections
1139.01 and
1139.02 and its conformance to the City's Comprehensive Plan;
         B.    A statement of ownership of or option to purchase all land
within the proposed PUD; and
         C.    A general indication of the expected schedule of development.
   (b)    Planning Commission Review. Following the pre-application conference,
the applicant shall submit the preliminary sketch plan including maps and
written statement, in ten copies to the Commission. The Commission shall review
the preliminary sketch plan to determine its conformance with the purpose and
objectives of Sections
1139.01 and
1139.02 and the City's Comprehensive Plan.
   (c)    Application. Upon completion of the preliminary review process,
including the pre-application conference and Commission review, an application
may be submitted to the Commission. A public hearing shall be held by the
Commission before approval of a PUD. Notification of the public hearing shall
be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the City and be either
mailed or personally delivered to persons to whom real property is assessed
within 300 feet of the boundary of the property on which the PUD is to be
located, and to the occupants of all structures within 300 feet of that
property. Notice is to be given at least five and not more than fifteen days
before the application shall be considered. The notice is to describe the
nature of the PUD, the property on which the PUD shall be located and to state
the place and time of the public hearing and indicate when and where written
comments shall be received concerning the request.
If the Commission approves the PUD, it may require any conditions or
modifications it deems necessary subject to approval by Council.
Such application shall include a final site plan containing the information set
forth in Chapter
1157. If the PUD is to be built in phases, a preliminary site development plan
designating various use areas may be approved. A final detailed site plan shall
then be required before the approval of each phase. The following information
shall be provided:
      (1)    A development schedule indicating:
         A.    Approximate date for commencement of construction;
         B.    Stages or phases in which the project shall be built and the
expected starting and completion dates of each stage; and

use, maintenance and continued protection of the PUD and any of its common use
or open space areas.
   (d)    Council Approval. After receipt of the recommendation from the
Commission, Council shall review the application, site plan and recommendations
and shall make its finding as to denial, final approval or approval with
modifications through a majority vote. The latter approval with modifications
shall not be considered as final approval until the applicant submits in
writing to Council his acceptance of the modifications. A site plan
incorporating the modifications shall be presented to the Zoning Enforcement
Officer. No building permits may be issued until final approval has been
rendered by Council on the entire site plan and any associated rezoning
matters. When the PUD with its site plan is approved by Council, the detailed
final site plans for each phase of a multi-phase PUD shall be reviewed and
shall be approved by the Commission. After final approval, the following
conditions shall apply where applicable.
      (1)    Where the provisions of Ohio R.C. Chapter 711 and Title 3,
Platting and Subdivision Regulations, City of Sharonville, as amended, shall
apply, the applicant shall thereafter submit the information and plans as may
be required by the Act and all other local procedures or regulations pertaining
to platting approval.
      (2)    Council shall cause to have legal documents or contracts prepared
which involve the City and are required as a result of the conditions contained
in the final approval. All contracts shall be executed and recorded in the
office of the Hamilton County Register of Deeds.
      (3)    The Zoning Enforcement Officer shall inspect the development at
each stage to insure reasonable compliance with the conditions of final
approval, the final site plan and the approved schedule of improvements. Any
changes in the final site plan shall be approved by the Commission in
accordance with Section
1157.05. (Ord. 82-61. Passed 1-11-83.)
   1139.04  RESIDENTIAL PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT.
   Rapid and intensive urbanization over the past decade has produced a need
for an economical family unit that is adaptable to urban densities but that
retains many of the suburban home amenities. Among the housing concepts
emerging to meet this need are townhouses, apartments and similar types of
housing units with common property areas; cluster types of single family
subdivisions in which housing units are arranged in cluster forms, with
clusters separated from each other by common open space; and housing units
developed with related recreational space, such as golf courses, swimming
pools, private parks, community centers and other recreational facilities.
   (a)   Purpose. It is the purpose of this section to encourage more
imaginative and livable housing environments with the residential districts, as
noted, through a planned reduction, or averaging, of the individual lot area
requirements for each zone district. Such averaging or reduction of lot area
requirements shall only be permitted when a land owner, or group of owners
acting jointly, can plan and develop a tract of land as an entity and thereby
qualify for regulation of that tract of land as one complex land use unit,
rather than an aggregation of individual buildings located on separate,
unrelated lots. Under these conditions, approval may be granted for the
construction and occupancy of a PUD; providing the standards, procedures and
requirements set forth in this chapter can be complied with.
   (b)    Qualifying Conditions. Any application shall meet the following
conditions to qualify for consideration as a Residential PUD.
      (1)    The PUD site shall be located within R1-A, R1-B, R2-C and RM-
D districts;
      (2)    The PUD site shall not be less than five acres in area;
      (3)    Public water and sewer facilities shall be available to serve the
PUD site; and
      (4)    For each square foot of land gained through the reduction or
averaging of lot sizes, equal amounts of land shall be set aside for the common
use of the home or lot owners within the PUD, so that there are assurances that
the required open space shall remain open.
   (c)    Permitted Uses. The following uses of land and structures may be
permitted within a Residential PUD:
      (1)    Any "permitted use" within the residential district in which the
PUD is located;
      (2)    Single-family attached dwellings, townhouses or zero lot line
single family dwellings may be allowed in an R1-A, R1-B, R2-C and RM-D District
provided the density of the total PUD does not exceed the overall density
permitted within the residential district in which the PUD is located.
         This shall be a maximum of three and six-tenths units/acre in R1-A;
four and five-tenths units/acres in R1-B; five and one-tenth units/acre in R2-
C; and ten and eight-tenths units/acre in RM-D. For any PUD exceeding the
aforementioned densities for the uses permitted herein, a rezoning would be
necessary prior to PUD consideration;
      (3)    Apartments within an RMD District;
      (4)    Golf courses, tennis clubs and athletic clubs; and
      (5)    Customary accessory uses, as permitted in districts where located.
   (d)    Development Requirements. As applicable, the following regulations
supersede the regulations otherwise provided for in the underlying residential
zoning district. Density increases are made possible in return for improvements
in    the design and amenities of the planned development subject to such
increase not producing adverse traffic conditions or undue burden on public
facilities and also subject to the following additional conditions.
      (1)    Site acreage computation. The net residential site proposed for a
PUD shall be computed to determine the total land area available for
development into lots under the minimum lot size requirements of the applicable
zoning district in which the proposed PUD is located.
In determining the net residential site the following procedures shall be
required:
In arriving at a net residential site, the following lands or areas shall be
subtracted from the gross site:
         A.    Land utilized by public utilities as easements or otherwise for
such use as electrical transmission lines, sewer lines and water mains;
         B.    Lands within floodplains and water retention areas as required
by the water retention ordinance provisions; and
         C.    The gross site area for street right of way purposes shall be
subtracted from the gross acreage of the proposed development.
      (2)    If the project is located in more than one zoning district, the
number of allowable dwelling units shall be calculated separately for each
zoning district, then combined to determine the project density.
(3)    Density transfer. Under this procedure, if approved by the Planning
Commission, the lot area per dwelling unit for a PUD within a residential
district may be reduced from those sizes required by the applicable zoning
district within which the PUD is located, however, such reduction shall not
exceed the minimum permissive requirements as specified herein.
(4)    Permissive minimum lot area. Lot sizes within PUD's shall not be varied
or reduced in area below the following standards:
         A.    One Family Detached Dwellings. 6,500 square feet of lot area.
         B.    Two Family Dwellings. 8,500 square feet of lot area.
         C.    Townhouses or Other Similar Permitted Single Family Attached
Dwelling Types. 6,500 square feet of lot area for the first dwelling unit in
each structure plus 2,000 square feet for each additional dwelling unit within
a structure.
      (5)    Permissive minimum yard requirements. Under the lot averaging or
reduction procedure, each lot shall have at least the following minimum yards.
         A.    Front Yard. Twenty feet for all dwellings, provided, that front
yard setbacks may be staggered if an average twenty foot setback is maintained.
         B.    Side Yard. Eight feet on each side yard for all one and two
family detached dwellings; none for attached single family, two family,
townhouses or apartments, provided that there shall be a minimum of twenty feet
between ends of continuous groups of dwelling units; and three feet for zero
lot line projects on one side yard only with a total of at least twenty feet
for both side yards.
C.    Rear Yard. Twenty-five feet for all dwellings, provided, that rear yard
requirements may be varied by the Commission after consideration of common open
space areas or parks which abut the rear yard.
D.    Perimeter Setback. The yard requirements at the exterior boundaries of
the project shall not be less than thirty-five feet required in the district
where located.
      (6)    Minimum floor area. The minimum required floor area shall be
provided in the following amounts:
         A.    Single Family Detached. Each dwelling unit shall have a minimum
finished living area of 950 square feet of floor area per dwelling unit with a
minimum of 624 square feet on the ground floor for units of more than one
story.
         B.    Attached Single Family Including Two Family and Townhouses. Each
dwelling unit shall have a minimum finished living area of 900 square feet per
dwelling unit with a minimum of 600 square feet on the ground floor for units

constructed in conformity with the provisions of Section
1119.08(p) in that they will be constructed in accordance with the State of
Ohio, Department of Highways, Construction and Materials Specifications,
including any amendments made thereto, in effect on the date of application of
the planned unit development. Standard pavement drawings shall be either Ohio
State Highway standards or Hamilton County standards, all of which are on file
in the office of the City of Sharonville Engineer and are titled "Typical
Sections of Streets Required for Subdivisions". Typical sections shall be drawn
in accordance with types l, 2, 3, or 4 of the standard pavement drawings. The
entire right of way of all streets shall be graded the full width between
property lines with appropriate slopes for cuts and fills beyond property
lines. The streets may be Type 2 (Reinforced concrete) or if Type l, 3 or 4,
all ditches shall be backfilled with gravel. These street construction
standards shall not apply to private driveways and shall not require curbs or
gutters unless they are deemed appropriate. In addition, all of the street
construction shall be inspected by the City Engineer and the normal fees for
such inspection shall be paid by the developer. (Ord. 88-21. Passed 3-29-88.)

High Density Residential Planned Unit Development District (HDR-PUD)
1140.01   Purpose and objectives.
1140.02   Permitted uses.
1140.03   Development requirements.
1140.04   Approval procedure.
1140.05   Prohibited uses.
   1140.01  PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES.
   Traditional zoning, with its rigid separation of uses into different zones
under very restricted placement controls, has now been recognized as being
inappropriate to many medium and large scale developments. Planned
developments, which modify the traditional forms of zoning, permit a developer
to secure advantages which can be passed on to the general public by virtue of
more desirable and more economical development. This chapter provides a
controlled degree of flexibility in the placement of structures and lot sizes
and types of uses, while maintaining adequate planning and development
standards.
   The objectives, principles and standards are intended to guide the applicant
in the preparation of the land use and development plan and they shall be used
as the basis for the evaluation of the plan by the Planning Commission and
Council.
   The following objectives shall be considered in reviewing any application
for any PUD in order to realize the inherent advantages of coordinated,
flexible, comprehensive, long-range, planning and development of such planned
development:
   (a)    To provide more desirable living, shopping and working environments
by preserving the natural character of open fields, stands of trees, brooks,
ponds, floodplains, hills and similar natural assets;
   (b)    To encourage with regard to residential use the provision of open
space and the development of recreational facilities and neighborhood
commercial facilities in a generally central location within a reasonable
distance of all living units;
   (c)    To encourage developers to use a more creative and imaginative
approach in the development of residential areas, especially through the
mixture of several housing types in one development;
   (d)    To encourage underground utilities which can be more efficiently
designed when master planning a larger area;
   (e)    To allow phased construction with the knowledge that subsequent
phases shall be approved as originally planned and approved by the City; and
   (f)    To reserve adequate land areas for schools, parks and other public
uses.
   The High Density Residential Planned Unit Development District is intended
to assure long term protection for those areas that should be developed for
high residential density purposes as identified by the Comprehensive Plan of
the City while allowing for planned unit development flexibility. This district
will assure adjacent land owners that PUD procedures, standards and policies
will apply on all property so designated. (Ord. 89-58. Passed 9-12-89.)
   1140.02  PERMITTED USES.
   The following uses shall be permitted within the HDR-PUD District:
   (a)    Any permitted use within the RMD Residential District (see Chapter
1131. Residential Districts);

   1147.05  DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.
   Except as otherwise noted, buildings and uses in the Northern Lights Overlay
District shall comply with the architectural and site development standards
established in the Sharonville Northern Lights Design Standards and Guidelines,
as adopted and amended by City Council.  The Sharonville Northern Lights Design
Standards and Guidelines are hereby adopted by reference, in their entirety, as
if their entire text and substance were a part of this Chapter.  Any Planned
Unit Developments proposed for approval must conform with the land use and
minimum design requirements as regulated by this chapter and the Sharonville
Northern Lights Design Standards and Guidelines.
   (a)   Unobstructed Sight Distance.  In addition to the provisions of the
Sharonville Northern Lights Design Standards and Guidelines, no fence, wall,
sign, structure, vehicle, or planting shall be erected, established or
maintained on any lot which will obstruct the view of drivers in vehicles
approaching an intersection of two (2) roads or the intersection of a road and
a driveway or curb cut.  Fences, walls, signs, structures, vehicles or
plantings located in the triangular area described below shall not be permitted
to obstruct cross-visibility between a height of thirty (30) inches and five
(5) feet above the lowest point of the intersecting road(s).  The unobstructed
triangular area is described as follows:
      (1)   Driveway Intersection Sight Triangle.  At intersections of
driveways with streets, the sight triangle shall be established by locating the
intersection of the street curb with the driveway edge, and by measuring from
this point a distance of ten (10) feet along the driveway to a point and a
distance of twenty (20) feet along the street curb to a point and connecting
these points.
      (2)   Street Intersection Sight Triangle.  At street intersections, the
sight triangle shall be formed by measuring at least thirty-five (35) feet
along curb lines and connecting these points.  Within the first twenty (20)
feet of the street intersection sight triangles, no structure or landscaping
material is permitted except required ground cover.  Within the portion of
sight triangle that is located between twenty (20) feet and thirty-five (35)
feet signs and trees shall be permitted only when the pole or trunk is the only
part of a sign or tree that is visible between the ground and five (5) feet
above the ground, or otherwise does not present a traffic visibility hazard. 
(Ord. 2007-67.  Passed 2-12-08.)
   1147.06  PRE-APPLICATION MEETING.
   The developer shall meet with the Zoning Administrator prior to the
submission of a site plan.  The purpose of this meeting is to discuss early and
informally the purpose and effect of the Northern Lights Overlay District and
the criteria and standards contained herein, and to familiarize the developer
with other applicable regulations.
(Ord. 2007-67.  Passed 2-12-08.)
   1147.07  SITE PLAN REVIEW PROCESS.
   The purpose of this section is to create a unique site plan review process
that applies only to properties within the Northern Lights Overlay District. 
This review process streamlines the site plan review and approval process in
return for full compliance with the Sharonville Northern Lights Design
Standards and Guidelines.
   (a)     The Sharonville Northern Lights Design Standards and Guidelines
contain both mandatory Standards and an elective set of Guidelines. 
Applications must meet 100% of the Standards in order to receive zoning
approval.  Applications that meet 50% or more of the Guidelines, in addition to
meeting 100% of the Standards, will receive an expedited zoning approval. 
Applications that meet less than 50% of the Guidelines are referred to the
Architectural Review Board for review.  The flowchart in Ordinance 2007-67
illustrates the review procedure for the Design Standards and Guidelines.
   (b)     An expedited zoning review consists of a review by City staff,
without the need for Architectural Review Board or Planning Commission meetings
or action.  Staff will utilize the review matrix included with the Sharonville
Northern Lights Design Standards and Guidelines as a means of evaluating site
plan applications against the Standards and Guidelines.
   (c)     Within fourteen (14) days after the receipt of a complete
application, the Safety Service Director, or designee shall approve, refer to
the Architectural Review Board, or disapprove the site plan application in
conformance with the provisions of the Design Standards and Guidelines.  The
Zoning Administrator shall mark one copy of the site plan as approved, referred
to the Architectural Review Board, or disapproved and forward such copy with a
letter of transmittal to the applicant.
   (d)     The Architectural Review Board reviews site plans that are referred
to it and, consistent with Section
1162.07 of the Zoning Code, makes a recommendation to the Planning Commission. 
The Planning Commission then evaluates the recommendations and site plans and
approves, approves with conditions, or denies the proposal.     
   (e)     The Planning Commission shall schedule a public hearing on the
application for approval of the site plan not less than twenty (20) days or
more than forty (40) days from the date the Architectural Review Board forwards
its recommendation to the Planning Commission.
   (f)     Before conducting the public hearing, notice of such hearing shall
be given in one or more newspapers of general circulation in the City and in
writing by first class mail to all adjacent property owners at least ten (10)
days before the date of said hearing.  The notice shall set forth the time and
place of the hearing, and shall provide a summary explanation of the project
and a description of the nonconforming items.
   (g)     All site plan applications shall comply with the requirements of
Chapter
1157 Site Plan Review and Chapter
1162 Architectural Review Board.
      (Ord. 2017-32.  Passed 9-26-17.)
   1147.08  GROUND AND POLE SIGN AMORTIZATION.
   (a)     Context and Intent.  The City, after a comprehensive study, has
adopted a Master Plan for the revitalization of the Chester Road Corridor (aka
Sharonville Northern Lights District) including recommendations for a
coordinated design of signage on private property.  The Sharonville Northern
Lights Design Standards and Guidelines include design requirements for new
freestanding signs that are consistent with Master Plan recommendations.  The
effect of these requirements is to ensure that freestanding signs created or
erected after the adoption of the Northern Lights Overlay District regulations
will be consistent with the City's stated purposes of encouraging the effective
use of freestanding signs as a means of communication in Sharonville Northern
Lights; maintaining a sustainable and pleasing environment, which attracts to
Sharonville Northern Lights major events of regional, national and
international interest; preserving a community that is attractive to business;
improving pedestrian and traffic safety; minimizing the possible adverse
effects of signs on nearby public and private property; and implementing
relevant provisions of the Sharonville Northern Lights Master Plan, as updated
periodically.  However, there remain in Northern Lights a moderate number of
ground and pole signs that violate the letter and purpose of the new
regulations but that were lawfully erected under regulations applicable to
signs prior to the adoption of this Chapter.  Such signs are protected as pre-
existing nonconforming signs under Section
1153.17.  Although such protection is both fair and rational for the period of
time necessary for the signs' owners to recover reasonable investments in the
signs, it is the intent of the City that these signs should at some point be
improved.  The purpose of this section is to provide for the eventual
improvement of such nonconforming ground and pole signs, after allowing their
owners a reasonable period of use during which to recover their reasonable
investment in such signs. (Within eighteen (18) months of amendment of this
section of the Northern Lights District Zoning Regulations, property owners
with pre-existing ground and pole signs shall present a Sign Improvement plan
to the Planning Commission for review and approval of existing ground and pole
signs.  The Planning Commission may approve, approve with conditions, or deny
any sign improvement plan). 
   (b)     Applicability.  The requirements of Section
1147.08 apply only to existing ground and pole signs that are located in yards
that are adjacent to Chester Road within the Northern Lights Overlay District.
   (c)     Findings.  In support of the purposes of this Chapter and as a basis
for its adoption, the City Council hereby finds that:
      (1)     Certain ground and pole signs erected lawfully in Sharonville
Northern Lights under previous sign regulations are inconsistent with both the
letter and purpose of new freestanding sign regulations adopted by the City;
      (2)     The existence of such signs will in part hinder the purposes of
the City in adopting this Chapter, which was based on careful study and
community discussion;
      (3)     The City recognizes the need to allow an individual to recover a
lawful investment, such as the erection or placement of a sign, but the City
also recognizes that the period of time necessary to recover such an investment
is finite;
      (4)     The Internal Revenue Code and regulations adopted thereunder
allow businesses to depreciate the full cost of a sign over a period of five
years or less;
      (5)     Most signs are financed or leased for a period of five years or
less;
      (6)     Many signs are routinely replaced after a period of five years;
      (7)     Many general advertising signs are erected on property leased for
a period of five years, which may be renewable for an additional period of five
years;
      (8)     There are thus many indications in the market that a reasonable
sign user anticipates recovery of the investment in a sign over approximately
five years;
      (9)     Therefore, the requirement that a sign be removed after a
specified period that is more than five years long will, in most cases, permit
an owner to recover the full investment in the sign;
      (10)     This concept is commonly called the "amortization" of an
investment.
      (11)     A planned expansion of Chester Road may result in some existing
ground and pole signs being located in the right-of-way or public roadway
easement.
   (d)     Action Required.  Any legal ground and pole sign in existence
eighteen (18) months of amendment of this section of the Northern Lights
District Zoning Regulations which does not comply with all of the applicable
requirements of this Chapter for freestanding signs (i.e. Sign Improvement Plan
approved or in process of approval by the Planning Commission), shall be
brought into conformance with the requirements of this Chapter shall be subject
to the following remedy.
   (e)     Remedies.  The Safety Service Director, or designee shall notify the
owner of a ground or pole sign affected by this chapter of the requirements of
said chapter at least thirty (30) days before the date on which such sign must
be brought into compliance with this chapter.  The owner of the sign shall have
a period of thirty days from the date of such notice to bring such sign into
conformance with the requirements of this chapter, whether by removal of the
sign or modification of the sign.  If the sign is not so removed or modified,
the owner shall be subject to a separate penalty under Chapter
1199 for each day for which the sign continues to exist in violation of the
requirements of this chapter.
   (f)     Appeal.
      (1)     The owner of a ground or pole sign affected by this chapter may,
at any time after the effective date of this chapter and before the expiration
of thirty (30) days after the date of notice under Section
1147.08(d), file a hardship appeal with the Board of Zoning Appeals.   
      (2)     The Board of Zoning Appeals shall consider said appeal at its
next regular meeting.  If and only if the Board of Zoning Appeals finds that
the sign owner will not be able to recover reasonable investment in the sign by
the date established by Section
1147.08(c), the Board of Zoning Appeals may extend that date by a reasonable
period which shall not be longer than is necessary to allow the owner to
recover the reasonable investment in the sign and shall in no event extend such
date more than an additional five years.
      (3)     In making its determination, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall
consider only the reasonable investment of the owner in the sign prior to the
effective date of this chapter; no considerations of alleged "market value"
shall be considered, nor shall investments made after the effective date of
this chapter.
      (4)     The sign owner shall have the burden of proof in such a matter
and shall be obligated to provide to the Zoning Board of Appeals original or
certified copies of all invoices for work or materials related to the sign and
certified copies of applicable land leases, equipment leases and/or security
agreements related to the sign.  Any appeal of the determination of the Zoning
Board of Appeals shall be to the District Court.
      (5)     For purposes of this section, a sign owner shall be deemed to
have recovered the investment in the sign when:
         A.     For a leased sign, the total lease revenues equal the cost of
the sign plus actual, necessary maintenance expense, plus a net return on
investment equal to three percentage (3%) points above the cost of funds
borrowed for the sign, or if the cost of such funds cannot be determined or if
no funds were borrowed, fifteen percent (15%) per annum; or
         B.     For a sign used by its owner, when the sign has been in use for
one year past the date when it could first have been fully depreciated under
the Internal Revenue Code, regardless of whether the owner actually claimed
such depreciation.
   (g)    Sign Improvement Plan for Existing Chester Road Ground and Pole Signs
As outlined in
1147.08 (a), within eighteen (18) months of amendment of the Northern Lights
District Zoning Regulations, property owners with pre-existing ground and pole
signs shall present an improvement plan to the Planning Commission for review
and approval of existing ground and pole signs.  The Planning Commission may
approve, approve with conditions, or deny any sign improvement plan.
   In order to present the best possible sign improvement plan for
consideration by the Planning Commission, Chester Road property owners are
encouraged to consult the list below for ideas of sign improvements.  Sign
Improvement Plans should not be limited to face change/message area or message
panel changes only. (examples included in Northern Lights Overlay Zone
Standards  and Guidelines).  The intent of the Northern Lights Overlay Zoning
District regulations is to create a modern, vibrant, pedestrian and vehicular
accessible, regional business district destination.
   •   Sign Base cladding (addition of brick, stone, metal or other suitable
material to hide or partially hide existing pole or poles that support the sign
and help give the sign a sense of being permanent, durable, and modern)
   •   Up-lighting
   •   Internal Illumination
   •   External Illumination
   •   Landscaping
   •   Sign face/message area change
   •   Addition of digital electronic message center (EMC), provided there is
no increase in overall sign area up to a maximum of 150 square feet.
      (Ord. 2017-32.  Passed 9-26-17.)
1147.09  PROHIBITED USES.
   No medical marijuana retail dispensary, medical marijuana cultivation,
medical marijuana processing, or medical marijuana-related business or home
occupation may be established, operated, or maintained within the City of
Sharonville, nor shall any provision of the Zoning Code be construed to permit
the use of any property for that purpose.

in order to achieve, among others, the following purposes:
   (a)   To relieve congestion so the streets can be utilized more fully for
movement of vehicular traffic;
   (b)   To promote the safety and convenience of pedestrians and shoppers by
locating parking areas so as to lessen car movements in the vicinity of
intensive pedestrian traffic;
   (c)    To protect adjoining residential neighborhoods from on-street
parking;
   (d)    To promote the general convenience, welfare and prosperity of
business, service, research, production, manufacturing and distribution
developments which depend upon off-street parking facilities; and
   (e)    To provide regulations and standards for the development of accessory
off-street parking and loading facilities in accordance with the objectives of
the General Plan of the City. (Ord. 82-61. Passed 1-11-83.)
   1151.02  SCOPE OF REGULATIONS.

condition precedent to occupancy of all residential, institutional, business,
office, research, production, distribution, service and industrial uses in
conformance with the provisions of this chapter:
   (a)    Whenever a building is constructed or a new use established;
   (b)    Whenever an existing building is altered and there is an increase in
the number of dwelling units, seating capacity and the floor area of building;
and
   (c)    Whenever the use of an existing building is changed to a more
intensive use which requires more off-street parking facilities, except certain
nonconforming uses may continue as provided in Section
1155.09.

1157, Site Plan Review. (Ord. 82-61. Passed 1-11-83.)
   (b)    Determination of Required Parking Facilities. The minimum number of
spaces required for accessory off-street parking shall be determined by
applying the parking area design standards in subsection (c) hereof, the
schedule of parking requirements for the various uses in Section
1151.05 and any other applicable provisions of this Zoning Ordinance. Where the
computation results in a fractional space, it shall be counted as one
additional space required. Handicapped parking is required and shall be
designed according to the Ohio Basic Building Code, Section 515.0 (4101:2-5-
15). (Ord. 83-53. Passed 9-13-83.)

parking area included with an application to construct a building or parking
area, or change in use, shall be designed and dimensioned in accordance with
the following:
      (1)    A parking space shall not be less than nineteen feet in length by
nine feet in width and in conformance with Appendix II of this Ordinance,
"Parking Area Design Standards";
         (Ord. 82-61.  Passed 1-11-83.)
      (2)    All parking spaces shall be permanently surfaced of either
blacktop or concrete in accordance with construction standard as required by

proposed building or use. (Ord. 82-61. Passed 1-11-83.)
   1151.05  MODIFICATIONS OF REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)    Public Facilities Available. The required spaces as determined by the
schedule and standards in Section
1151.04 may be modified by the Planning Commission in the City central business
area where free parking areas or publicly owned parking areas are readily
accessible and where land is not available for development of accessory off-
street parking as required herein.
   (b)    Parking for Single and Mixed Uses. A building occupied by one use
shall provide the off-street parking spaces as required for the specific use. A
building or a group of buildings, occupied by two or more uses, operating
normally during the same hours, shall provide spaces for not less than the sum
of the spaces required for each use. For a large unit development of business
uses, such as a shopping center, spaces shall be provided for the total area of
the building or buildings as set forth in such schedule instead of the
requirements based on each separate use.
   (c)    Joint Use of Parking Facilities. Churches, civic clubs, community
centers, auditoriums, lodge halls, gymnasiums and stadiums may make
arrangements with business establishments which normally have different hours
of operation for sharing up to, but not more than fifty percent (50%) of their
requirements in adjacent parking areas which are accessory to such business
uses. However, where there is a sharing of facilities by different owners or
tenants, there shall be an agreement covering a specific period of time as may
be required by the Commission. Should any of the uses be changed or the
facilities discontinued, then the required spaces for the use or uses remaining
shall be provided elsewhere as a condition precedent to the continued use of
such building or buildings.

use on the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance, and those required as
accessory to a use created or a building constructed or altered thereafter,
shall be continued and maintained in operation, and shall not be used for
automobile sales, service or repair of motor vehicles, and shall not be reduced
below the requirements of this Ordinance during the period that the main use is
maintained, unless an equivalent number of spaces shall be provided for such
use in another approved location. (EDITOR'S NOTE: The effective date of Zoning
Ordinance 82-61, is February 10, 1983.)
   (b)    Wherever parking facilities are permitted on land other than the
zoning lot on which the building or use served is located, such facilities
shall be in the same ownership as the zoning lot occupied by the building or
use to which the parking facilities are accessory. Such ownership shall be by
deed or a long term lease agreement, whereby the owner of the land on which the
parking facilities are to be located shall be bound by a covenant filed and
recorded in the office of the County Recorder, requiring each such owner, his
heirs or assigns to maintain the required number of parking facilities for the
duration of the use served as a precedent to the continuation of such use.
(Ord. 82-61. Passed 1-11-83.)

forth in the Zoning Code for the City of Sharonville.
   (b)   The implementation of revised Section
1151.07 shall be as follows:
      (1)   As to motor vehicles, which were previously parked on residential
premises and have been made illegal by the passage of this ordinance
enforcement of revised Section
1151.07 by the City will commence six (6) months from the effective date of the
section.  This six month amortization period applies only to those non-
conforming boats, tractor trucks, trailers, recreation vehicles, trucks and
vans at one specific location, for only one owner displaying an exemption
sticker issued by the City.  Any vehicle not displaying the exemption sticker,
or any change in ownership, location or vehicle shall necessitate the parking
and storage of such vehicle to be in conformance with amended Section
1151.07.
      (2)   A sticker for all such motor vehicles, now made illegal by this
ordinance, may be obtained from the City of Sharonville Department of Community
Development.  Owners of such nonconforming vehicles are to identify those
existing motor vehicles in order that they may be validly stored or parked on
the property.
         A.   For special conditions that represent a clear and demonstrable
hardship, the Planning Commission may grant one or more extensions of six
months, not to exceed a total of five years from the effective date of this
section.

   1153.01  INTENT.
   Sign regulations, including provisions to control the type, design, size,
location, motion, illumination and maintenance thereof, are established in
order to achieve, among others, the following purposes:
   (a)   To maintain high value residential districts by permitting only
nameplates, bulletin boards and signs related to the rental or sale of
properties in such districts;
   (b)   To provide reasonable, yet appropriate, conditions for advertising
goods sold or services rendered in business districts by relating the size,
type and design of signs to the type and size of establishments;
   (c)   To eliminate any conflict between advertising signs and traffic
control signs, which would be hazardous to the safety of the motoring public or
the pedestrian;
   (d)   To control the design of signs so that their appearance shall be
aesthetically harmonious with an overall urban design for the area;
   (e)   To promote the most desirable developments and economic activity in
accordance with the objectives of the Comprehensive Plan of the City; and
   (f)   To promote the public right to receive religious, political, economic,
social, philosophical and other First Amendment protected messages.
      (Ord.  2006-61.  Passed 11-28-06.)
   1153.02  ESTABLISHING REGULATIONS.

(Ord.  2006-61.  Passed 11-28-06.)
   1153.04  MEASUREMENT STANDARDS.
   Signs are regulated in this Zoning Ordinance by relating the gross area of
signs to the building or use of a lot, or to the size of the building unit to
which the sign is accessory.
   (a)   The “gross area of signs” for a building or use shall include all the
surfaces visible from a public way and shall be measured as the area enclosed
by one rectangle, the sides of which make contact with the extreme points or
edges of the sign, excluding the supporting structure, if such structure does
not form a part of the advertisement of the sign proper. The area of a sign
composed of characters or words attached directly to a large, uniform building
wall surface shall be the smallest rectangle, which encloses the entire group.
   (b)   Whenever the gross area of the signs is related to the size of the
building or lot:
      (1)   The “frontage of a building” shall be the width of the facade of
building, store, service or office unit which faces the principal street, or
the facade containing the main entrance of a store, office, service or
manufacturing building. For corner buildings, forty percent (40%) of the
building depth facing the side street may be included in the frontage width
factor.
      (2)   The “frontage of a lot” not occupied by a building shall be the
number of lineal feet the lot abuts on the principal street.
   (c)   Buildings or lots having frontage on a second street or a secondary
entrance to a parking area may be permitted additional signs along such
secondary streets which shall, however, not exceed twenty percent (20%) of the
area of the signs permitted along the main face.
(Ord. 2006-61.  Passed 11-28-06.)
   1153.05  DESIGN STANDARDS.
   Signs, as permitted in the various use districts shall be designed so as to
be similar in character with regard to materials, color and size to signs
designed or located on the same building and on adjoining buildings in order to
equalize the attention they are meant to attract, and to produce an overall
unified effect and in accordance with the standards set forth in this section.
   (a)   Wall or Panel Signs. Wall or panel signs shall not project more than
twelve inches from the building wall to which it is attached and shall be set
back from the end of the building and party wall lines for a distance of at
least three feet and shall not project above the coping or eaves of any
building.
   (b)   Projecting Signs. Projecting signs may be attached to the building
wall or canopy and project at an angle of approximately ninety degrees for a
distance of not more than four feet or project over the cornice line more than
one-third of the total height of the sign. Projecting signs shall be located
not less than five feet from a party wall line and the lowest member of a
projecting sign shall be at least eight feet above a public sidewalk and
fifteen feet above any drive. Signs shall not project into any dedicated right
of way.
   (c)   Pole Signs. Pole signs shall not exceed seventy feet in height within
400 feet of IR-75 and IR-275 and thirty feet in height in all other districts
where such signs are permitted.
   (d)   Permanent Ground Signs. Permanent ground signs shall not extend higher
than fifteen feet above the finished grade.
   (e)   Vertical Dimension. The lowest member for all signs, which project or
are supported on posts shall not be less than eight feet above the finished
grade of a sidewalk or any other pedestrian way. If located over a pavement
used for vehicular traffic or within eighteen inches of the vertical projection
of the edges of such pavement, the lowest member of the sign shall not be less
than fifteen feet above the finished pavement.
   (f)   Relation to Openings. Signs shall not project over or obstruct the
required windows or doors of any building and shall not be attached to or
obstruct a fire escape or interfere with other safety provisions as may be
further regulated in the Building Code of the City.
   (g)   Relation to Traffic Devices. Signs shall not be erected so as to
obstruct sight lines along any public way, traffic control lights, street name
signs at intersections or street sight lines or signals at railroad grade
crossings. Signs visible from the sight lines along a street shall not contain
an arrow or words such as “stop”, “go”, “slow,” etc.; and the movement,
content, coloring or manner of illumination shall not resemble highway traffic
signs.
   (h)   No animated, revolving or moving sign shall be permitted, except that
electronic message boards are separately permitted and shall not be affected by
this limitation.
   (i)   Permitted signs in business, industrial and public facilities
districts may include changeable copy portions, including electronic message
boards and other signs on which the message is changed electronically. 
Incidental, temporary and real estate signs shall not include electronic
message boards or copy that is changed electronically.

building or public street.
   (b)   In residential districts, illumination of signs is not permitted. All
signs in public facilities, business and industrial districts may be
illuminated. Parking lots and automotive sales area lots shall be illuminated
in accordance with the provisions of this section.
(Ord. 2006-61.  Passed 11-28-06.)
   1153.07  SIGNS; RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS.
   Accessory signs in residential districts shall be designed, erected,

less than twenty-five feet from any side lot line or ten feet from the street
right-of-way line. Illumination shall not be permitted.  A real estate sign
shall be permitted on a property only as long as the property or a portion

lease or rental agreement or upon the transfer of title to the property, the
sign shall be removed.
   (d)   Subdivision Project Sign. Subdivision project signs not exceeding 100
square feet in total area may be permitted while a subdivision is under
construction provided such sign is located on the parcel being developed and
not less-than 100 feet from any occupied residence and not less than thirty-
five feet from the nearest street right-of-way line. A permit for such signs
shall be for an initial period of one year; such permit may be renewed for
additional periods of one year each provided that at least five building
permits have been issued for construction in the subdivision during the
preceding year and at least five lots or speculative homes remain unsold.
   (e)   Free Speech Signs. Free speech signs not exceeding six square feet in
area are permitted in residential districts provided such signs are located not
less than two feet from the edge of the road pavement (whether curb or street),
not blocking any sidewalks, and at least ten feet from adjoining property
lines. If a building is located within the two-foot setback area described
above, and if it would be practically impossible to place such a sign beyond
the ten foot setback, then such a free speech sign may be placed upon any side
of the building.  A free speech sign may bear any noncommercial message deemed
by the property owner or occupant to be of public interest, including, but not
limited to, expressions of support for one or more political candidates or
expressions of opinion on other election issues.  If such sign relates to an
election or other event, such sign shall be removed within ten (10) days after
the occurrence of the election or other event to which it relates.
      (Ord. 2006-61.  Passed 11-28-06.)
   1153.08  SIGNS; PUBLIC FACILITIES DISTRICTS.

is located within the two-foot setback area described above, and if it would be
practically impossible to place such a sign beyond the ten foot setback, then
such a free speech sign may be placed upon any side of the building.  A free
speech sign may bear any noncommercial message deemed by the property owner or
occupant to be of public interest, including, but not limited to, expressions
of support for one or more political candidates or expressions of opinion on
other election issues.  If such sign relates to an election or other event,
such sign shall be removed within ten (10) days after the occurrence of the

in accordance with regulations as follows:
   (a)   Use Types Permitted. The following use types shall be permitted:
      (1)   Business signs, directing attention to the business establishment;
      (2)   Incidental signs containing directional or other information not
exceeding four square feet in area.  Incidental signs identifying entrances,
exits or other directional information may also include a commercial message
occupying up to one-half the permitted sign face; no other incidental sign
shall bear a commercial message;
      (3)   Real estate and project signs of a temporary nature;
      (4)   Free speech signs such as religious, political, economical, social,
philosophical, and other First Amendment protected messages and speech signs
are permitted as part of the gross area permitted for signs on a property;
      (5)   Temporary campaign signs not exceeding 15 square feet in area are
permitted in addition to the gross area permitted for signs until ten (10) days
after an election provided such signs are located at least ten feet from the
edge of the pavement (whether curb or street) not blocking any sidewalk, and
the signs must be at least ten feet from the adjoining property line. If a
building is located within the ten foot setback area described above, and if it
would be practically impossible to place such a sign beyond the ten foot
setback, then such a political sign may be placed upon any side of the
building; and
      (6)   Portable sidewalk signs shall be limited to one per business and
shall be no larger than six square feet in area, professionally designed and
constructed in a workmanlike manner, containing no writing or attachments other
than the sign surface, and may have a portion of the sign left blank for hand-
written daily specials or sales. Such signs must advertise only items or
services that are provided in the business adjacent to the location of the
sidewalk sign; such a sign may also or alternatively bear one or more
noncommercial messages, provided that the sign is owned and maintained by a
business adjacent to the location of the sidewalk sign. The sign shall be
removed outside of the hours of the business establishment to which they are
adjacent and they shall not be illuminated. The sign must be placed in such a
way that pedestrians shall have an unimpeded pathway of at least six feet in
width. If this unimpeded distance is unable to be achieved due to the narrow
configuration of the sidewalk, then such a sign may be permitted by Conditional
Use Permit if granted by the Sharonville Planning Commission pursuant to
Section
1159.04.
   (b)   Structural Types Permitted.  Wall or panel, window, canopy, ground,
projecting, and sidewalk signs shall be permitted in any Local Business
District.
   (c)   Maximum Area and Number Permitted.
      (1)   The maximum gross area of all permanent signs permitted for each
separate use occupying a building, unit of a building or lot not occupied by a
building shall be related to the width of the building, unit thereof or lot not
occupied by a building; adjusted, however, so that the smaller establishments
may be permitted reasonable sign areas and so that the larger establishments
may not have excessive sign areas.  Excluded from this limitation are temporary
political, real estate and project signs, incidental signs bearing no
commercial message, and portable sidewalk signs, where permitted; this
limitation shall apply to all other signs.  Signs accessory to a building or
unit thereof shall be determined by the following formula:
         A.   Local Business District. Maximum gross areas of signs = (W x 1.2)
+ 30 square feet.
         B.   Office Building, General Business District and Central Business
District. Maximum gross area of signs = (W x 1.5) + 40 square feet.
The elements of such formula being defined as follows: "Maximum gross area"
means the total area of all permanent signs as defined in Section
1153.04(a). “W” means the frontage of a building as defined in Section
1153.04(b). C. Lot Not Occupied by Building. Signs permitted for each separate
use of a lot not occupied by a building shall be determined by the formula:
Maximum gross area of sign = (W x .75). The element “W” of such formula means
the frontage of a lot as defined in Section
1153.04(b).
      (2)   The maximum area of temporary signs permitted is established in
Section
1153.11.
   Example: Assume a thirty foot wide store facing one street in a Local
Business District: Maximum gross area of sign equals 30 x 1.2 + 30 = 66 square
feet. 
(Ord. 2006-61.  Passed 11-28-06.)
   1153.10  LOCATION AND DESIGN STANDARDS; BUSINESS SIGNS.
   Accessory signs in any business district shall also be controlled by
location and supplementary area regulations as follows:
   (a)   Wall Signs.  A single wall sign shall not exceed 150 square feet in
total area.
   (b)   Projecting Signs.
      (1)   Projecting signs shall be limited to not more than one for each
establishment or store unit and shall not exceed twenty-four square feet in
total area of each face visible from any location on a public way. Projecting
signs shall be located not less than five feet from a side lot line and not
less than twenty-five feet from a residential district boundary line.
      (2)   Central Business District projecting signs shall be permitted and

         A.   Projecting signs over public right of way not to exceed seven
feet from the property line or closer than three feet to the inside of the curb
line.
         B.   Height of projecting signs shall have minimum above grade

   The following standards shall apply to all conditionally permitted cellular
or wireless communications antennas and towers:
   (a)   The cellular or wireless communications company shall be required to
demonstrate. using the latest technological evidence, that the antenna or tower
must be placed where it is proposed in order to satisfy its necessary function
in the company's grid system.
    (b)   If the communications company proposes to build a cellular or
wireless communications tower (as opposed to mounting the antenna on an
existing structure), it is required to demonstrate that it has contacted the
owners of nearby tall structures within a one (1) mile radius of the site
proposed, asked for permission to install the cellular communications antenna
on those structures, and was denied for reasons other than economic ones. "Tall

   Regulations for the continuance, maintenance, repair, restoring, moving and
discontinuance of nonconforming buildings, land and uses are established in
order to achieve, among others, the following purposes:
   (a)    To permit their continuance but control nonconformity so as to
minimize any adverse affect on the adjoining properties and development;
   (b)    To regulate their maintenance and repair;
   (c)    To restrict their rebuilding if substantially destroyed;
   (d)    To require their permanent discontinuance if not operated for certain
periods of time; and
   (e)    To require conformity if it is discontinued, to bring about eventual
conformity in accordance with the objectives of the Official Land Use Plan, the
Official Thoroughfare Plan and Zoning Ordinance of the City.
      (Ord. 82-61. Passed 1-11-83.)
   1155.02  LAWFUL NONCONFORMANCE.
   The lawful use of any dwelling, building or structure and of any land or
premises as existing and lawful at the time of enacting this Zoning Ordinance,
may be continued, although such use does not conform to the provisions of this
Ordinance. The completion, restoration, reconstruction, extension or
substitution of nonconforming uses shall be subject to the provisions and
conditions as set forth in this chapter. (EDITOR'S NOTE: The effective date of
Zoning Ordinance 82-61 is February 10, 1983.) (Ord. 82-61. Passed 1-11-83.)

improvements may be made. For the purpose of this Zoning Ordinance, normal
repairs shall include the ordinary maintenance of a building or structure, and
the replacement of equipment which is required for safety of operation, and the
replacement or substitutions of machinery or equipment. A nonconforming
residential building may be enlarged if the required yard areas are determined
adequate by the Planning Commission. (Ord. 82-61. Passed 1-11-83.)
   1155.05  RESTORATION OF DAMAGED STRUCTURE.
   (a)    Any nonconforming building or structure except a one or two-family
residence which has been destroyed or damaged by fire, other casualty, act of
God or a public enemy to the extent of sixty percent (60%) or more of its cost
of restoration to the condition in which it was before the occurrence, shall
thereafter conform to all the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance.
   (b)    The total structural repairs, improvements and alterations including
repairs occasioned by fire, other casualty, act of God or a public enemy to the
extent of less than sixty percent (60%) of its cost of restoration, shall not,

abandoned. (Ord. 82-61. Passed 1-11-83.)
   1155.06  EXTENSION PROHIBITED.
   Any nonconforming building shall not be enlarged or structurally altered
except to make it a conforming building. A nonconforming residential building
may, however, be enlarged in accordance with the provisions of Section
1155.04. A nonconforming use may not be extended within a building, enlarged or
added to in any manner, except that nonconforming uses and buildings may be
improved by a conditional use permit granted under the provisions of Section
1159.01(c). (Ord. 92-36. Passed 6-9-92.)
   1155.07  NONCONFORMING CHANGE PROHIBITED.
   The use of a nonconforming building may be changed only to a use conforming
to the district in which the building is located if approved by the Planning
Commission. Thereafter it shall not be changed back to the former nonconforming
use. (Ord. 82-61. Passed 1-11-83.)
   1155.08  MOVING NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   A nonconforming structure may be moved to a different location on the same
lot or other parcel of land within the district with approval of the Planning
Commission, after a hearing, and provided proper and adequate alterations are
secured to make the structure conform to the regulations of the district where
it is located. (Ord. 82-61. Passed 1-11-83.)
   1155.09  NONCONFORMING PARKING FACILITIES.
   A building or use existing lawfully at the time this Zoning Ordinance or any
amendment thereto became effective, but which does not conform with the off-
street parking or off-street loading regulations, may be occupied by the
existing use without such parking and/or loading facilities being provided.
However, any additional parking spaces that may be provided thereafter shall
comply with the regulations set forth in Chapter
1151. If the existing building is altered so that there is an increase of the
number of dwelling units, seating capacity or floor area, or if the use is
changed to a use requiring more off-street facilities, then off-street parking
and loading facilities shall be provided at least equal to the number of spaces
required for the entire building or use in accordance with all provisions of
Chapter
1151. (EDITOR'S NOTE: The effective date of Zoning Ordinance 82-61 is February
10, 1983.)

   1157.01  DESCRIPTION AND PURPOSE.
   Certain land uses are quite necessary to the proper development of a
community, but likewise, possess characteristics which warrant special
treatment. These characteristics, in many situations, can easily become
undesirable to some degree, basically because their intricate needs and/or
appearance have a wide-ranging influence beyond their own perimeter. In
conformance with the purpose of this Zoning Ordinance, it is hereby deemed
prudent and necessary to apply limits and guidelines which shall both encourage
good development and discourage undesirable effects on surrounding development.
(Ord. 82-61. Passed 1-11-83.)

districts and conditions cited below; and/or
   (b)    In connection with a rezoning request in any district, the Commission
may require a preliminary site development plan.
   (c)    Once a site plan is approved with or without conditions, the
developer is expected to follow such plan unless changes are proposed by the
developer, submitted to the Commission and approved with changes.
      (Ord. 82-61. Passed 1-11-83.)
   1157.03  SITE PLAN REQUIRED.
   A site plan shall be submitted unless specifically waived by the Planning

shall not be regarded as inflexible requirements. They are not intended to
discourage creativity, invention or innovation.
   (a)    Landscape Preservation. The landscape shall be preserved in its
natural state, insofar as practical, by minimizing tree and soil removal, and
any grade changes shall be in keeping with the general appearance of
neighboring developed areas.
   (b)    Relation of Buildings to Environment. Proposed structures shall be
related harmoniously to the terrain and to the existing buildings in the
vicinity that have a visual relationship to the proposed buildings. The
achievement of such relationship may include the enclosure of space in
conjunction with other existing buildings or other proposed buildings and the
creation of focal points with respect to avenues of approach, terrain features
or other buildings.
   (c)    Drives, Parking and Circulation. With respect to vehicular and
pedestrian circulation, including walkways, interior drives and parking,
special attention shall be given to location and number of access points,
general interior circulation, separation of pedestrian and vehicular traffic
and arrangement of parking areas that are safe and convenient and, insofar as
practical, do not detract from the design of the proposed buildings and
structures and the neighboring properties.

installations, service areas, truck loading areas, utility buildings and
structures, and similar accessory areas shall be subject to such setbacks,
screen plantings or other screening methods as shall reasonably be required to
prevent their being incongruous with the existing or contemplated environment
and the surrounding properties.
   (h)    Other. Public health, safety and general welfare shall also be
considered.
      (Ord. 82-61. Passed 1-11-83.)
1157.12  ARCHITECTURAL AND BUILDING DESIGN STANDARDS.
   (a)   Purpose.  The purpose of this section is to establish architectural
and building design standards that encourage higher quality development and
function in order to protect property values, and protect real estate from
impairment or destruction of value. These architectural and building design
criteria can encourage quality development through the use of a variety of
design and site techniques while continuing to provide for a wide range of
economic development.
   (b)   Applicability.
      (1)   This section shall apply to all new buildings and development in
the Local Business (LB), General Business (GB), and Office Building (OB) zoning
districts and any accessory structure or use over 500 square feet in floor area
located within the LB, GB, or OB zoning district.
      (2)   All new buildings shall be subject to review by the Planning
Commission in accordance with Chapter
1157 Site Plan Review to ensure conformance with this section.
   (c)   General Requirements for All Nonresidential Buildings in the LB, GB
and OB Districts.
      (1)   Buildings should generally be parallel to the street they front,
unless an alternate orientation is consistent with existing adjacent
development and is approved by the Planning Commission during site plan review.
      (2)   The primary entrances of buildings should be oriented:
         A.   Towards a street along the perimeter of the development or
towards a public space, if located adjacent to the proposed project; or
         B.   Towards streets in the interior of the development if none of the
building's facades has frontage on a public street; or
         C.   As approved by the Planning Commission during Site Plan Review
process.
      (3)   Building Facades.
         A.   Blank building walls visible from public streets (including
alleys adjacent to non-residential or mixed use buildings) are prohibited.
These requirements shall not generally apply to those walls that are not
visible from a street or are completely hidden due to topography or natural
features preserved as open space.

required for a notice of a request for conditional use approval may be held
before a decision on the request which is based on discretionary grounds.  If
the applicant or the Commission requests a public hearing, only notification of
the public hearing need be made.  A decision on a conditional use request shall
not be made unless notification of the request for conditional use approval, or
notification of a public hearing on a conditional use request is given as may
be required by this section.
      (2)   The Commission may deny, approve or approve with conditions,
requests for conditional use approval.  The decision on a conditional use shall

consideration.  The decision shall specify the basis for the decision, and any
conditions imposed.
   (d)   A conditional use permit granted pursuant to this chapter, shall be
valid for a  period of one year from the date of approval. If construction has
not commenced and proceeded meaningfully toward completion by the end of this
one year period, Director of Community Development shall notify the applicant
in writing of the expiration of approval for the conditional use.
   (e)    The Commission shall have the authority to revoke any conditional use
permit after the applicant has failed to comply with any of the applicable

   (x)   Churches and Similar Places of Religious Assembly in Support Mixed-
Downtown (SM-D) District.  Consistent with the Vision and Goals of the Downtown

standards and criteria shall be considered as part of the approval process:

established in Section
1135.04, Schedule of Minimum Yard and Setback Dimensions as listed for Support

religious assembly shall not exceed 6% of total land area in the District,

of total land area in the District, no more approvals for Churches and Similar
Places of Religious Assembly shall be granted.  The SM-D District contains
approximately 16.5 acres.  6% equals approximately 1 acre. 
      (5)   Applications for Conditional Use approval shall first be reviewed
by the Architectural Review Board.  Design of the proposed building and grounds
shall be consistent with the general appearance of the downtown and in
accordance with the Standards and Criteria in Chapter
1162 of the Sharonville Zoning Code.
      (6)   Parking shall be in compliance with Chapter
1151, Parking and Loading Facilities, which may, upon Planning Commission

   1165.01  INTENT.
   A Board of Zoning Appeals is hereby established to assist in the
administration of this Zoning Ordinance, particularly, to decide and interpret
provisions which require impartial adjustments of conflicting interests and to
grant variances from the strict letter of this Ordinance in instances of
unnecessary hardship. The Board is herein established to achieve, among others,
the following purposes:
   (a)    To provide a method for alleviating unnecessary hardship by allowing
a reasonable use for individual parcels of property which, because of unusual
or unique circumstances, may be denied a reasonable use by literal application
of the terms of this Ordinance;
   (b)    To review or appeal any order, requirements, decision or
determination made by the Safety-Service Director;
   (c)    To provide an administrative board, independent from all other City
boards or commissions, to act only pursuant to and in accordance with the
standards established by Council to hear and decide appeals which are to be
tried over again from the beginning (de novo); and
   (d)    To ensure that decisions and the granting of variances shall sustain
the constitutionality of this Ordinance and to be in compliance with the
objectives of the Official Land Use Plan. (Ord. 82-61. Passed 1-11-83.)
   1165.02  MEMBERSHIP.
   (a)    A Board of Zoning Appeals is hereby created. Such Board shall consist
of seven members, to be appointed by the Mayor, all of whom shall be residents
of the City. The terms of all members shall be of such lengths and so arranged
so that the term of at least one but not more than two members shall expire
each year. Each member shall serve until his successor is appointed and
qualified. (Ord. 88-76. Passed 12-27-88.)
   (b)    Members of the Board shall be removable for nonperformance of duty,
misconduct in office or other cause, by the Mayor, upon written charges having
been filed with the Mayor and after a public hearing has been held regarding
such charges. A copy of the charges shall be served upon the member at least
ten days prior to the hearings, either personally, by registered mail or by
leaving the same at his usual place of residence. The member shall be given
opportunity to be heard and answer such charges. Vacancies shall be filled by
the Mayor and shall be for the unexpired term. (Ord. 82-61. Passed 1-11-83.)
   1165.03  OFFICERS AND DUTIES; GENERAL POWERS.
   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall elect from among its members, a Chairman
and a Vice Chairman. The Board shall adopt rules and regulations not
inconsistent with this Zoning Ordinance, as may be necessary to carry into
effect the duties, powers and responsibilities conferred herein. The powers,
duties and responsibilities of the Board shall be:
   (a)    To hear appeals and decide any issues involving the application of
impartial considerations and judgments in regard to decisions made by the
Safety-Service Director or any other administrative officer on matters relating
to this Ordinance, for relief from any order, requirement, decision or
determination, including the refusal, granting or revocation of permits;
   (b)    To hear and decide upon applications for variations from the terms
provided in this Ordinance subject to the standards set forth in Section
1165.08; and
   (c)    To hear and decide all matters specifically referred to it for
decisions in other sections of this Ordinance. (Ord. 82-61. Passed 1-11-83.)
   1165.04  PROCEDURES ON APPEALS.
   Appeals to the Board of Zoning Appeals may be taken by any person aggrieved.
Such appeals shall be taken within thirty days after the decision by filing
with the officer from whom the appeal is taken and with the Board a notice of
appeal specifying the grounds thereof. A filing fee shall accompany the notice
of appeal for all appeals other than those filed by churches, schools and
governmental agencies.  The officer from whom the appeal is taken shall
forthwith transmit to the Board all the papers constituting the record upon
which the action appealed from was taken. The Board shall fix a reasonable time
for the hearing of the appeal, which hearing shall be held within sixty days of
the filing of the appeal, unless extended by agreement of the parties, given
ten days' notice to the parties in interest, unless waived, and decide the same
within a reasonable time after it is submitted. Upon the hearing, any party may
appear in person or by attorney. Any party adversely affected by a decision of
the Board may appeal to the court of Common Pleas of Hamilton County, on the
grounds that such decision was unreasonable or unlawful.
(Ord. 82-61. Passed 1-11-83; Ord. 89-60. Passed 10-10-89; Ord. 2010-61.  Passed
1-25-11.)
   1165.05  MEETINGS AND HEARINGS.
   (a)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall schedule meetings to conduct
business as required.  The Board shall act within thirty days from the date of
the final hearing or extensions thereof, and failure to act within such period
shall be considered approval of the appeal unless an extension of time is
mutually agreed upon.  Before making any decision on an appeal, the Board may
hold a public hearing or hearings, at such times as shall be determined by the
Board itself.  Notices of the time and place of hearings shall be mailed to the
appellant and to the affected property owners as they appear in the current
records of the County Auditor or be published, for two successive weeks prior
thereto, in one newspaper of general circulation in the City.
   (b)   The Board shall hear and decide appeals de novo and shall review or
appeal any order, requirement, decision or determination made by the Safety-
Service Director in the enforcement or application of this Zoning Ordinance. 
Within its powers, the Board may reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or
modify any such order, requirement, decision or determination as, in its
opinion, ought to be made under the circumstances and to that end it shall have
all the powers of the officer from whose decision the appeal is taken.
   (c)   All hearings conducted by the Board shall be open to the public.  Any
person may appear and testify at a hearing, either in person or by duly
authorized agent or attorney.  The Board shall have the power to subpoena and
require the attendance of witnesses, to administer oaths, to compel testimony
and to produce reports, findings and other evidence pertinent to any issue
referred to it for decision.
(Ord. 82-61.  Passed 1-11-83.)
   1165.06  QUORUM AND VOTE.
   (a)   A majority of the members of the Board of Zoning Appeals shall
constitute a quorum needed for action by the Board of Zoning Appeals. The Board
shall act by resolution, in which a majority of the quorum concur and every
variation granted or denied shall be accompanied by a written finding of fact
based upon testimony and evidence, and specifying the reason for granting or
denying the variation.
(Ord. 95-55. Passed 9-12-95.)   
   (b)   A member of the Board shall not be qualified to vote if he has not
attended the hearing, or if he has a direct or indirect interest in the issue
appealed.
(Ord. 82-61.  Passed 1-11-83.)
   1165.07  RECORD OF DECISIONS.
   The Board of Zoning Appeals is authorized to engage the services of a
Secretary, and shall provide a detailed report of all its proceedings, setting
forth its reasons for decisions, the vote of each member participating therein
and the absence of a member or his failure to vote.  Immediately following the
Board’s decision, such record including conditions prescribed by the Board
shall be filed and posted for two weeks in the offices of the Safety-Service
Director.  The report shall be open to public inspection and copies shall be
mailed forthwith to each interested party noted therein.
(Ord. 82-61.  Passed 1-11-83.)
   1165.08  REASONS FOR GRANTING VARIANCES.
   The Board of Zoning Appeals may authorize a variance from strict application
of these regulations, by reasons of exceptional lot narrowness, shallowness,
shape, topographic conditions or other extraordinary situation in order to
relieve undue hardship. The variance shall not substantially impair the public
good nor the intent of these regulations. No variance shall be granted unless
the Board finds that the following conditions exist:
   (a)    The granting of the variance shall be necessary to relieve hardship
and preserve the applicant's right to the reasonable and legitimate use of his
property; the request shall not be granted merely for the convenience of the
applicant.
   (b)    The requested variance shall not constitute a change in land use
resulting in the establishment of a use not normally permitted in the
applicable zoning district.
   (c)    The special circumstances or conditions applying to the building or
land in question are peculiar to such lot or property, and do not generally
apply to other land or buildings in the vicinity.
   (d)    The special conditions or circumstances which form a basis for the
variance application shall not result from the actions of the applicant.
   (e)    Nonconforming use of neighboring lands, structures or buildings in
the same zoning district, and permitted or nonconforming use of lands,
structures or buildings in other zoning districts shall not be considered
grounds for the issuance of a variance.
   (f)    The application for a variance shall not be based exclusively upon a
desire to increase the value or income potential of the parcel of land or any
structures or uses thereupon.
   When appealing for a variance, the appellant shall state and substantiate
his claim that the conditions listed above exist and the Board shall make a
finding on the conditions as they apply in each specific case as a prerequisite
for the granting of the variance.
(Ord. 82-61. Passed 1-11-83.)
   1165.09  LAPSE OF VARIANCES.
   (a)    A variance once granted shall not be withdrawn or changed unless
there is a change of circumstances, or if, after the expiration of one year, no
substantial construction is done in accordance with the terms and conditions
for which such variance was granted. In such circumstance, the Safety-Service
Director shall give a notice in writing, and thirty days thereafter, the
variance shall be deemed null and void, and all regulations governing such
premises in question shall revert to those in effect before the variance was
granted.
   (b)    If an appeal has been denied by the Board of Zoning Appeals, it need
not reconsider the same appeal if resubmitted within six months after the date
of decision unless the underlying conditions have substantially changed. (Ord.
82-61. Passed 1-11-83.)
   1165.10  NOTICE TO COUNCIL AND PLANNING COMMISSION.
   Upon issuance by the Board of Zoning Appeals of any ruling, determination or
order, the Secretary of the Board shall send within three days of the date of
such ruling, determination or order, a copy thereof to the Clerk of Council and
to the Secretary of the Planning Commission who shall present such report at
the next regular meeting.
(Ord. 82-61. Passed 1-11-83.)
   1165.11  APPEALS TO COURTS.
   A person aggrieved by a decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals may, within
thirty days after the filing of such decision, appeal to the Court of Common
Pleas of Hamilton County. Such appeals may be either on questions of law, on
questions of fact or on questions of law and fact.

   1321.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization.  Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens. Therefore, the City Council of the City of Sharonville, State of
Ohio, does ordain as follows:
   (b)   Findings of Fact.  The City of Sharonville has special flood hazard
areas that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life
and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection
and relief, and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are
inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such
damages and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations
are adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose.  It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (11)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss.  In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction.
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply.  These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of
Sharonville as identified in subsection (f) hereof, including any additional
areas of special flood hazard annexed by the City of Sharonville.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard.  For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study for Hamilton County, Ohio and Incorporated
Areas, effective date of  May 17, 2004.
Flood Insurance Rate Maps for Hamilton County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas; Map
Numbers 39061C0087 D, 39061C0089 D, 39061C0091 D, 39061C0092 D, 39061C0093 D,
39061C0094 D, 39061C0113 D, and 39061C0115 D; effective date of May 17, 2004.

registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City of Sharonville as required by Section
1321.04.
   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby adopted
by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or
studies are on file at the City of Sharonville City Hall, 10900 Reading Road,
Sharonville, Ohio.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.  These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including subdivision regulations,
zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations shall not impair any deed restriction, covenant or easement but the
land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the regulations.
   (h)   Interpretation.  In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.  The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the City of Sharonville, any officer or employee thereof, or the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from
reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.
   (j)   Severability.  Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. 
(Ord. 2004-17E.  Passed 3-30-04.)
   1321.02  DEFINITIONS.

   (d)   Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE)  The water surface elevation of
the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, and
usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In Zone AO areas, the base
flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number (from 1 to
3 feet).
   (e)   Basement Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   (f)   Development  Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of
equipment or materials.
   (g)   Enclosure Below the Lowest Floor     See  "Lowest Floor."
   (h)   Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management) Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)  The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   Fill  A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   Flood or Flooding  A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      1.   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      2.    The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   Flood Hazard Boundary Man (FHBM)  Usually the initial map, produced by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (m)   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)  An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   Flood Insurance Risk Zones  Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
      Zone A:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; base flood
elevations are not determined.
      Zones A1-30 and Zone AE:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; base flood
elevations are determined.
      Zone AO:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; with flood depths
of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain); average depths are
determined.
      Zone AH:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; flood depths of 1
to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood elevations are determined.
      Zone A99:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood to be protected from
the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection system under construction; no
base flood elevations are determined.
      Zone B and Zone X (shaded):
Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject to the 100-year flood with average
depths of less than 1 foot or with contributing drainage area less than 1
square mile; and areas protected by levees from the base flood.
      Zone C and Zone X (unshaded):
Areas determined to be outside the 500-year floodplain.
   (o)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS)  The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   Flood Protection Elevation  The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE, is
the base flood elevation plus 1 foot of freeboard. In areas where no base flood
elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection elevation
can be historical flood elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or
approved by the floodplain administrator, plus 1 foot of freeboard.
(Ord. 2004-17E.  Passed 3-30-04.)
   (q)   Floodway  A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base
flood discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height as specified in the Flood Insurance Study. In no case shall the
designated height be more than .5 foot at any point within the community.
   The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized by
any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
(Ord. 2004-17E.  Passed 3-30-04; Ord. 2006-32.  Passed 5-23-06.)
   (r)   Freeboard  A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   Historic structure Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic

   (t)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis  An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC)  A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies.
LOMC's are broken down into the following categories:
Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA)  A revision based on technical data showing that
a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood hazard area.
A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and establishes
that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard area.
Letter of Map Revision (LOMR)  A revision based on technical data that, usually
due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood elevations,
floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One common type
of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a structure or parcel
has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation and is, therefore,
excluded from the special flood hazard area.
Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMP)  A formal review and comment by FEMA
as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum National Flood
Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does not amend or
revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps,
or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)   Lowest floor  The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure below the
lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   (w)   Manufactured home  A structure, transportable in one or more sections,
which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term
"manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the purposes
of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes and
mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (x)   Manufactured home park  As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701- 27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (y)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)  The NFIP is a Federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   New construction  Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of Sharonville
Flood Insurance Rate Maps, January 2, 1987, and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
   (aa)   Person  Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local
governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio Revised Code
Section 111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not
limited to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society,
council, institution, state college or university, community college district,
technical college district, or state community college. "Agency" does not
include the general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general's
department, or any court.
   (bb)   Recreational vehicle  A vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a
light duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent
dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or
seasonal use.
   (cc)   Registered Professional Architect  A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the provisions of Sections 4703.01 to
4703.19 of the Revised Code.
   (dd)   Registered Professional Engineer  A person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ee)   Registered Professional Surveyor A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ff)   Special Flood Hazard Area  Also known as "Areas of Special Flood
Hazard", it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, Al-30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal,
state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   Start of construction  The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (hh)   Structure  A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas or
liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (ii)   Substantial Damage  Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure
before the damage occurred.
   (jj)   Substantial Improvement Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty
percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the  improvement. This term includes structures which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure which is considered "new
construction,"
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are  the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (kk)   Variance  A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   Violation  The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations. 
(Ord. 2004-17E.  Passed 3-30-04.)

minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to
ensure that the City of Sharonville flood maps, studies and other data
identified in Section
1321.01(f) accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain 
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are  identified:
      (1)   Requirement to Submit New Technical Data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section
1321.04(c).
         B.   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with subsection (j)(1) hereof, prepared in a format
required for a Conditional Letter of Map Revision  or Letter of Map Revision,
and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and processing fees for these map revisions
shall be the responsibility of the applicant.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than 0.5 (half) foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood
elevations but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to subsection (j)(1)A.
      (2)   Right to Submit New Technical Data.  The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of the City
of Sharonville, and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/Detachment.  Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the City
of Sharonville have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed
authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the City
of Sharonville's Flood Insurance Rate Maps accurately represent the City's
boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the City of
Sharonville suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate limits
or the new area for which the City of Sharonville has assumed or relinquished
floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation.  The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and /or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1321.05.
      (5)   Where the map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations.
      (1)   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including
tornado, wind, heavy snow, flood, fire, etc. After such a damage event, the
Floodplain Administrator shall:
         A.    Determine whether damaged structures are located in special
flood hazard areas;
         B.    Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
         C.    Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially
damaged structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior
to repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
      (2)   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
federal, state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
Increased Cost of Compliance insurance claims.

         A.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided, the cumulative effect of any proposed
development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development,
shall not increase the base flood elevation more than .5 foot at any point.
Prior to issuance of a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit
a hydrologic and hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional
engineer demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided  causing more than .5 foot
increase in the base flood elevation may be permitted provided all of the
following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of .5 foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
(Ord. 2004-17E.  Passed 3-30-04; Ord. 2006-32.  Passed 5-23-06.)
            2.   Subsection (i)(1)B.1. and 3. to 5.
      (3)   Alterations of a Watercourse.  For the purpose of these
regulations, a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within  its banks.
The extent of the banks shall be established by a field determination of the
“bankfull stage.” The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on
methods presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical
Report RM-245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field
Technique or other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or
other authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a
watercourse, the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the
City of Sharonville specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an
agreement is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain
development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
 1321.03(j)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the
relocation or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the
placement of culverts.
            (Ord. 2004-17E.  Passed 3-30-04.)
   1321.05  APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)   Appeals Board Established.
      (1)   The City Council shall appoint an Appeals Board consisting of the
members of the City of Sharonville Planning Commission. The members shall serve
6 year terms after which time they shall be reappointed or replaced by the City
Council. Each member shall serve until  his/her successor is appointed.
      (2)   A chairperson shall be elected by the members of the Appeals Board.
Meetings of the Appeals Board shall be held as needed and shall be held at the
call of the Chairperson, or in his absence, the Acting Chairperson. All
meetings of the Appeals Board shall be open to the public except that the Board
may deliberate in executive sessions as part of quasi-judicial hearings in
accordance with law. The Appeals Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings
showing the vote of each member upon each question and shall keep records of
all official actions. Records of the Appeals Board shall be kept and filed in
the Department of Community Development.
   (b)   Powers and Duties.
      (1)   The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is an error in any  order, requirement, decision or determination made by
the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of these
regulations.
      (2)   Authorize variances in accordance with subsection (d) of these
regulations.
   (c)   Appeals.
      (1)   Any person affected by any notice and order, or other official
action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be granted a
hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such person shall
file, within 30 days of the date of such notice and order, or other official
action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for the mitigation
of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain Administrator's decision.
Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the applicant, and be filed with the
Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the appeal, the Floodplain
Administrator shall transmit said notice and all pertinent information on which
the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made to the Appeals Board.
      (2)   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)   Variances.  Any person believing that the use and development
standards of these regulations would result in  unnecessary hardship may file
an application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, due to special conditions of the lot or parcel, a
literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would result in
unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a Variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant, legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
         C.   All applications for a variance shall be accompanied by a
variance application fee set in the schedule of fees adopted by the City of
Sharonville.
      (2)   Notice for Public Hearing.  The Appeals Board shall schedule and
hold a public hearing within thirty (30) days after the receipt of an
application for a variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the
hearing, a notice of such hearing shall be given in one (1) or more newspapers
of general circulation in the community at least ten (10) days before the date
of the hearing.
      (3)   Public Hearing. 
         A.   At such hearing the applicant shall present such statements and
evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such variance
applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of fact on all
evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of
these regulations and the following factors:
            1.    The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to
the injury of others.
            2.    The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
            3.    The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
            4.    The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community.
            5.    The availability of alternative locations for the proposed
use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
            6.    The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
            7.    The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
            8.    The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive
plan and floodplain management program for that area.
            9.    The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
            10.    The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
            11.    The costs of providing governmental services during and
after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities
and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets
and bridges.
         B.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
            1.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
            2.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the
property. Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
            3.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these
regulations; additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense,
nuisances, fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing
local laws.
            4.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
            5.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
         C.   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (4)   Other Conditions for Variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in subsection (d)(3) 1. to 11. have
been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court.  Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas, as
provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code. 
(Ord. 2004-17E.  Passed 3-30-04.)
