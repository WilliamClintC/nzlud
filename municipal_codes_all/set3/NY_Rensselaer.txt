in respect to any matters pending or referred to either of them or to any
commission of the city. Such subpoena may be served at any place within
the State of New York, in the same manner as subpoenas for witnesses in
criminal cases. Any person who shall refuse to attend in obedience to any
such subpoena may be arrested by an order of attachment which shall be

refusal and may be committed to the county jail or other place of detention
until he so appears to testify. Such witness so refusing to attend may also
be fined or imprisoned for disobedience of such subpoena by the City Judge
in the manner and to the same extent as a witness refusing to attend in
obedience to a subpoena duly issued by a City Court Judge. Whenever
any person summoned as a witness before said Mayor, Common Council
or any other committee thereof or the head of any department, board or
commission shall refuse to be sworn or affirmed or to answer any proper or
pertinent question, the City Judge may forthwith commit such person to the
county jail or other proper place of detention for a period not exceeding 20
days or until he shall be sworn or affirmed or answer such questions. Such
commitment shall be made by a warrant directed to the Sheriff of the county
or other officer having such place of detention in charge and shall recite the
cause of such commitment, and such officer shall keep such person in close
confinement as directed thereby.
§ 100. Witnesses not to be excused from testifying.

any investigation or inquiry before the Common Council, committee thereof
or before any officer, commission or board conducting an investigation

highway or public place until the sewer and water mains and sewers have
been laid therein or provide therefor and service and house-connection
pipes and the same laid in front of each separate lot or piece of property to
a point within the sidewalk or curbline.
Except as by this Act otherwise provided, the entire expense of the
improvements above specified will be assessed and apportioned as herein
provided.
The expense of laying and repairing service and house-connection pipes,
water mains and sewers shall be apportioned and assessed against the
owner or owners of the property abutting on such improvement, except
that when such sewer and water mains are not owned by the city, then the
expense of laying and repairing such service and house-connection pipes
from such sewer and water mains shall be apportioned and assessed against
the owner or owners of such sewer and water mains, as the case may be.
The expense of repairing pavements and the expense of repairing and
ordinary work of all streets shall be paid by the city out of the Street Fund.
The expense of laying new pavements in said city with granite, asphalt,
brick, macadam or other material, including all grading and preparation of
street therefor and the construction of bridges, arches, viaducts, gutters,

shall be made by general assessment of all the taxable property and all
§ 107 RENSSELAER CITY CHARTER § 108
C:47
persons in said city; provided, however, that property which has already
been separately or specifically assessed for granite, block or asphalt
pavement laid prior to April 5, 1901, shall be assessed in such general
assessment for any new pavements only to the amount which would
properly be assessed upon such property for such new pavements after
deducting therefrom the amount actually paid upon such assessment for
such granite block or asphalt pavements laid prior to April 5, 1901, and
that property which is already been separately or specifically assessed for
sewer or sewers constructed prior to December 31, 1902, shall be assessed

such sewer or sewers constructed prior to December 31, 1902.
When the grade of a street has once been established by the city and such
grade recorded and conformed to in the making of local improvements, any
change in the grade therefor, insofar as any expense is incurred therein and
to that extent only, must be made at the expense of the city at large.
Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to prevent the city from
financing pursuant to the Local Finance Law, in whole or in part, any of the
expenditures enumerated in this section.
§ 109. Declaration of intention to make local improvement.
Any expenditures for local improvements in said city, except as to curbing
and sidewalks, the expense of which is to be defrayed wholly or partly by
local assessment, shall not be incurred unless the Common Council shall by
resolution declare its intention to make such local improvement.

After the Common Council shall declare its intention to make such local
improvement, except as to curbing and sidewalks, before ordering the same
done, the Common Council shall order a district of assessment which shall
contain all of the property which, in the judgment of the Common Council, is
likely to be benefited by the local improvement and may at any time enlarge
such district and cause notices to be published and served upon all persons
within such enlargement.
§ 111. Special provisions as to sewers.
The Common Council may order a sewer for the drainage of streets, cellars,
buildings, lots, pools, vaults and other proper sewerage purposes to be
constructed in any street and, with the consent of the owners, in, upon
or across any real property outside of a street. If the Common Council
shall declare its intention to construct any sewer in, upon or across the
real property outside the streets of said city and the owners of such real
property shall not consent thereto and the city is unable to agree with the
owners of such real property upon the compensation to be made therefor,
the Common Council, in the name and behalf of the city, may acquire the
§ 108 RENSSELAER CODE § 111
C:48
title, easement and right in and to such real property for such sewer by
condemnation, in pursuance of the provisions of the Condemnation Law,
Chapter 23 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The cost and expense of such
condemnation proceedings, together with the compensation determined,
shall be paid to the owner or owners of such real property for such title,
easement and right so acquired.
§ 112. Notice of proposed improvement.
If a district of assessment has been established, then upon the passage
of a resolution by the Common Council declaring its intention to make
local improvement, the expense of which is payable wholly or partly by
local assessment, the City Clerk shall prepare and sign a written notice of
the proposed improvement, specifying therein the time which any person
interested may file his objections thereto with the City Clerk, which shall
not expire before the next regular meeting of the Common Council, and,
in case no objection is so filed within the time so specified, all persons
interested will be deemed to have acquiesced in the proposed improvement.
Such notice shall either be published at least once in the official newspaper
of the city at least 10 days before the expiration of the time for objections
thereto or shall be served upon each such owner of property within the
district of assessment fixed for such improvement as follows: by delivering
to him personally a copy thereof or by leaving a copy thereof at his
residence in said city with some member of his family or some person of
suitable age or discretion or, if he resides elsewhere, by service as above
described upon his agent or other person having the property in charge
or by depositing in the post office, properly enclosed and postage prepaid
thereon, directed to such owner at his last known place of residence. If
there be two or more owners of any one piece of property, service on
any one of them shall be sufficient notice to the owners of such piece of
property. Affidavits of service and publication of such notice may be filed or
recorded, or both, in the office of the City Clerk, and the affidavits or record
thereof or a certified copy of either shall in all courts and places, actions or
proceedings be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.
§ 113. Objections to improvements and decisions thereon.
Objections to such improvements must be made in writing and filed with
the City Clerk within the time specified in such notice, and the Common
Council may at any regular meeting within two months after the expiration
of such 10 days, subject to the Mayor's veto as in other cases, order the
improvement to be made.

[Amended by L.L. No. 3-1990]
Upon the certificate of the Commissioner of Public Works that the work
of such local improvement, the expense of which is to be defrayed wholly
or partly by local assessment, has been completed, the Common Council
shall direct the cost thereof be assessed by the City Assessor, and it shall
§ 111 RENSSELAER CITY CHARTER § 114
C:49
be the duty of the City Assessor to immediately assess the cost of such
local improvement upon the property lying within the district of assessment
declared for such improvement in an equitable manner in as near as may
be in proportion to the benefits which each owner of such property may
be deemed to derive therefrom without reference to the erections or
improvements thereon, except as herein otherwise provided; the cost of any
local improvement shall be deemed to include the entire expense thereof,
including the inspection, except the engineering and publishing and serving
of notices.
§ 115. Assessment roll. [Amended by L.L. No. 3-1990]
The City Assessor shall make out an assessment roll and a duplicate thereof,
both of which shall be deemed originals, and set the amount of tax assessed
in the last column of the roll and file the same in the office of the City Clerk
and thereupon give public notice in the official newspaper for one week and
by posting a copy of such notice in four public places in said city that such
assessment rolls have been prepared and will remain at the office of the City
Clerk for a term of 15 days from the date of such notice, during which time
any person interested may examine said roll, and, at the expiration of said
15 days, on the day and hour and at the place to be specified in said notice,
the City Assessor shall attend and hear any objections to said assessment
and shall decide upon the same and shall, if it need be, alter and correct
said assessment roll and, when completed, sign the same and file them with
the City Clerk.
§ 116. Appeal from assessment. [Amended by L.L. No. 3-1990]
Any party thinking himself aggrieved may file with the Clerk a written
appeal therefrom briefly stating the grounds of such appeal, and the
Common Council shall thereupon proceed to hear and determine such
appeal or appeals, upon view of the property assessed or upon the evidence
or both and may affirm or reverse the assessment. In case of affirmance,
it shall be final and conclusive, and the proceedings thereafter to collect
such assessment shall remain the same as if no appeal had been taken.
Said assessment roll shall be signed by the Mayor and the President of the
Common Council. In case of reversal, the Common Council shall appoint
three disinterested electors of the city as commissioners, who shall proceed
in like manner upon view of the property assessed or upon evidence or both
and for such purposes be invested with the same powers as the Assessor to
make a new assessment. They shall make their tax rolls in the same manner
and sign the same and file them with the City Clerk, and the same shall be
final and conclusive on all parties. Such commissioners shall receive $25
per day for their services, to be paid by the city, unless the assessments of
the appellants as determined by such commissioners shall be less favorable
to them than the assessment appealed from, in which case the fees of
said commissioners shall be paid by the appellants added to the amount of
their taxes respectively by the commissioners in proportion to the amount
thereof.
§ 114 RENSSELAER CODE § 117
C:50
§ 117. Unpaid local assessment to be inserted in annual city tax
roll.
In case any assessment or installment thereof has become due and the
whole or any part thereof remains unpaid, it shall be the duty of the
Assessor to insert the same when reported, as provided in this Act, by
the City Treasurer in the annual tax roll for the current year, against the
respective lots or parcels of land on which the assessments were originally
levied and, in addition to such assessment or assessments, 6% per annum
to the time when due to the date of the annual city tax sale following the
insertion. Up to the date of the annual city tax sale following the insertion.
Up to the date of such sale, the Treasurer, in his discretion, shall receive the
amount of any assessment or installment inserted or to be inserted in the
annual tax roll for the current year with the aforesaid addition of 6% per
annum.
§ 118. Assessment for acquiring land for city purposes. [Amended
by L.L. No. 3-1990]
If damages arise in acquiring land for making public improvement and such
improvement is payable by the city at large, the amount of such damages
shall be included in the cost of making such improvement and payment
thereof made or provided for in accordance with this Act. After they have
been ascertained and determined, if they arise out of the making of local
improvement, said Common Council shall declare a district of assessment
therefor and shall direct such part of the amount of such damages and
the expenses to be assessed by the city and such part locally as they shall
deem just. The Common Council shall then direct the Assessor to assess
the amount of award for damages and the expenses so directed to be borne
by the property benefited locally, specifying the aggregate amount of the
same upon the property within such district of assessment. The Assessor
shall proceed to assess such amount upon the property benefited by such
improvement in a just and equitable manner and nearly as may be in
proportion to the benefits, if any, received. Such assessment shall be made
in the same manner as other local assessments. When the assessment roll
shall be filed, the assessment may be appealed from in the same manner,
and the Common Council shall possess the same powers in reference
thereto and proceed in the same manner as on appeals from other
assessments.
§ 119. Local assessments payable in installments. [Amended by L.L.
No. 3-1990]
The Common Council may, by 2/3 vote of all the members elected thereto,
provide in any ordinance or resolution for a street or other improvement,
the expense of which may be imposed and assessed upon the property
benefited thereby, as provided by law, that the assessment shall be payable
in any number not less than five and not more than 15 annual installments,
together with interest thereon, from and after the date of the confirmation
of such assessment at the rate of 9% per annum upon the whole amount
§ 117 RENSSELAER CITY CHARTER § 119
C:51
of the entire assessment remaining to be paid, shall be due and payable on
the first day of June following the confirmation of such assessment until the
whole of such assessment and the interest thereon shall be paid; the owner
or occupant of any piece of property so assessed may at any time pay to the
Treasurer the entire assessment upon his or such property, with the interest
at the rate aforesaid, upon the time of such assessment, and thereupon such
property shall be discharged from lien of such assessments.
§ 120. Collection of local assessment. [Amended by L.L. No. 3-1990]
If no appeal is taken from the assessment roll filed with the City Clerk
or if an appeal is taken therefrom and such assessment be affirmed, the
Common Council shall cause the proper warrant to be attached to one
of the assessment rolls and to the other a copy of such warrant and the
Treasurer's receipt for such special assessment roll, with a warrant to the
City Treasurer, and secure his signature and the receipt thereof in the
duplicate roll filed in his office. If an appeal is taken from such assessment
and the same is reversed, the Common Council shall cause the proper
warrant to be attached to one of the assessment rolls filed by such
commissioners and to the other a copy of such warrant. The City Clerk
shall deliver such assessment roll and warrant to the City Treasurer and
secure his signature to the receipts therefor in the duplicate roll filed in
his office. Such warrant shall be signed by the Mayor and the President of
the Common Council. Whenever the assessment roll and the warrant for its
collection for any local improvement shall be left with the City Treasurer,
he shall receive the taxes thereon for the same time and with the same fees
as directed herein for the collection of city taxes and shall give notice to
that effect immediately upon receipt of such assessment roll by publication
thereof in the official paper of the city. If any such taxes or any installments
thereof remain unpaid at the expiration of 60 days from the time of the
delivery of such assessment roll to the Treasurer, said Treasurer shall report
the same to the Assessor on or before July 1 of each year for insertion in the
city tax roll as provided by this Act.
§ 121. Guardians ad item for infants and dependents.
Whenever an infant or other incompetent person shall be interested in real
estate affected by any local improvement, the County Court of Rensselaer
County or the Supreme Court shall have power to appoint a guardian in
the nature of a guardian ad litem to protect the interests of such infant or
such incompetent person, and such guardian shall be entitled to receive for
his services such compensation as the court making the appointment may
direct. The compensation so paid shall be included in the amount of the
assessment made against the property of such infant.
§ 122. Rebates and deficiencies. [Amended by L.L. No. 3-1990]
In all cases of assessment for improvement, the Assessor shall include in
the apportionment all the expenses connected with or which were incident
to the making of the improvement and assessment. Whenever the amount
§ 119 RENSSELAER CODE § 122
C:52
of apportionment shall exceed the actual cost of the improvement, including
all expenses connected therewith and incidental thereto, the City Treasurer
shall certify the amount of the surplus to the Assessor, and they shall
thereupon declare a rebate, and the excess shall be refunded pro rata to
the persons who paid their assessments. If the amount assessed for any
improvement shall be insufficient to cover the cost of the improvement,
including all expenses connected therewith and incidental thereto, the City
Treasurer shall certify the amount of the deficiency to the Common Council
and Assessor; and the Common Council and the Assessor shall forthwith
cause to be levied and assessed the amount of such deficiency pro rata upon
the property included within the original assessment, and the same shall be
assessed and levied and collected in like manner as other assessments of
like character.
§ 123. Right to review assessment for local improvement limited.
No action or proceeding to set aside, vacate, cancel or annual any
assessment or tax for local improvement shall be maintained, except for
total want of jurisdiction to levy and assess the same on the part of the
Common Council, officers, board or commission authorized by law to make
such levy or assessment or to order the improvement on account of which
the levy or assessment was made. No action or proceeding shall be
maintained to modify or reduce any such assessment or tax, except for
fraud or substantial error, by reason of which the amount of such tax or
assessment is in excess of the amount which should have been locally levied
or assessed.
§ 124. Review procedure.
No action or proceeding shall be maintained to set aside, vacate, cancel,
annual, review, reduce or otherwise question, test or affect the legality
or validity of any assessment or tax for local improvement except in the
form and manner and by proceedings herein provided. If in the proceedings
relative to an assessment or tax entire absence of jurisdiction on the part
of the Common Council, officers, board or commission authorized by law
to levy or assess the same or to order the improvement on account of
which the assessment was made or the tax imposed is alleged to have
existed or in case of fraud or substantial error, other than errors in the
direction specified in the preceding section by reason of which substantial
damages have been sustained, as alleged or to have existed or to have been
committed, any party aggrieved thereby who shall have filed objections
thereto within the time and the manner specified by law thereto may apply
to the Supreme Court at a special term thereof held within the judicial
district in which the city is situated for an order affecting or modifying
such assessment as to the lands in which he is interested upon the grounds
in such objections specified and no other and upon due notice of such
application to the Corporation Counsel. Such application shall be made
within 20 days after the confirmation of the assessment. Thereupon such
court may proceed to hear the proofs and the allegations of the parties and
determine the same or may appoint a referee to take the proofs and report
§ 122 RENSSELAER CITY CHARTER § 124
C:53
thereon or hear, try and determine the same. If it shall be determined in
such proceeding that the Common Council, officers, board or commission
had no jurisdiction to make and levy the assessment complained of or
to order the improvement, the court may order such assessment or tax
vacated. If it shall be determined therein that any such fraud or substantial
error has been committed and that the party appearing for such relief has
suffered substantial damages by reason thereof, the court may order that
the assessment or tax be modified as to such party and, as so modified, that
it be confirmed. A like application may be made to secure a modification
or reduction of any such assessment or tax on account of fraud or such
substantial error occurring in the performance of the work or improvement
on account of which such assessment or tax is made or levied, and it shall be
determined in like manner. If in any such proceeding it shall be determined
that such fraud or substantial error has been committed by reason of which
any such assessment or tax upon the lands of any such aggrieved party
has been unlawfully increased, the court may order that such assessment
or tax be modified by deducting therefrom said amount, as in the same
proportion such assessment or tax as the whole amount of such unlawful
increase is to the whole amount of assessment or tax for the improvement.
An order so made in such proceeding shall be entered in the County Clerk's
office of Rensselaer County and shall have the same force and effect as
a judgment. The court may, during the pendency of any such proceeding,
stay the collection of any assessment or tax involved therein as against
the parties thereto. The costs and disbursements of any such proceeding
may be allowed in the discretion of the court as in an action. No appeal
shall be allowed or taken from an order made in any such proceeding, but
determination so made therein shall be final and conclusive upon all parties
thereto. No assessment or tax shall be modified otherwise than to reduce it
to the extent that the same may be shown by the party complaining thereof
to have in fact increased in dollars and cents by reason of such fraud or
substantial error. In no event shall that proportion of any such assessment
which is equivalent to the fair value or fair cost of the improvement be
disturbed for any cause. No money paid on account of any assessment
or tax shall be recovered for any cause except the amount of the excess
of such assessment or tax over and above the fair value and cost of the
improvement. In case of the failure of any assessment or tax for any cause,
the City Treasurer shall certify such fact to the Common Council, and it
shall be its duty to forthwith cause the same to be relevied or reassessed in
a proper manner.
§ 125. Consolidation of separate proceedings.
Two or more persons may unite in commencing and prosecuting the
proceedings to vacate or modify an assessment; and when two or more
persons have commenced separate proceedings to vacate or modify an
assessment for the same improvement, the court before whom the same
was commenced or pending or the judge thereof at such term or chambers
may, upon an order and upon due application and notice, consolidate such
separate proceedings into one proceeding.
§ 124 RENSSELAER CODE § 126
C:54
§ 126. Errors and irregularities may be corrected.
Errors and irregularities in a proceeding contemplated by this Act, if shown
to injuriously affect a party or parties thereto, may be corrected on the
review thereof, on the application of the party injured, or his damages
occasioned thereby recovered in an action against the city, subject to the
regulations of this Act.
§ 127. State lands.
Nothing herein contained shall affect any assessment upon any lands owned
by the state nor be deemed to repeal or modify any of the provisions of § 21
of the Public Lands Law.
§ 128. Street cleaning and repairing.
The Common Council shall have the power to cause the streets, lanes,
alleys, highways and public ground and places in the city to be cleaned from
time to time, and the expense thereof shall be paid by the city out of the
Street Fund.
§ 129. Maintenance of sidewalks and curbs.
It shall be the primary duty of every owner of every lot or piece of land
to keep the sidewalks and curb adjoining his lot or piece of land, from
his property line to the curbline and, if no curbline, then the space of the
street within 12 feet of his property line, at all times free and clear of all
obstructions and in a safe and passable condition and keep the same clean
and free from snow and ice. It shall be the duty of such owner to remove
new ice and freshly fallen snow from such curb and sidewalks before 12:00
noon of each day and keep the same so cleaned and removed at all times. In
default thereof, such owners shall be subject to such fine or penalty therefor
as may be prescribed by the Common Council. Also, the Commissioner of
Public Works shall have power to remove such obstructions and also to
place said sidewalks and curbs in safe and passable condition and to remove
all snow and ice which the owner has neglected to remove before said hour
of 12:00 noon or any other obstructions upon the sidewalk and curb, and no
ordinance or resolution for the same need be passed or notice given, and
the expenses therefor shall be assessed and collected in the same manner as
the expense of constructing and repairing sidewalks, and such owners shall
be liable and responsible to the City of Rensselaer for all loss or damage
which it may sustain or incur, directly or indirectly, or, in consequence of
the owner of such lot, piece or parcel of land failing to do so, and perform
the duties and obligations hereby imposed upon him.
§ 130. Construction and relaying of sidewalks and curbstones.
[Amended by L.L. No. 3-1990]
Whenever the Common Council shall deem it necessary for any sidewalk
or curbstone and the whole or any part of such sidewalk or curbstone,
from curbline to property line, to be constructed, made, flagged, concreted,
§ 126 RENSSELAER CITY CHARTER § 130
C:55
bricked, curbed, relaid or reset by the owners of land adjoining such
sidewalk or curb, it shall have power to require any or either of said
improvements, acts or things to be made or done; it shall prescribe by
resolution or ordinance that the same be done at such times and in such
manner and of such materials as it may direct, and such improvements
shall conform to the grade established or to be established before such
improvements are made. The Common Council shall cause to be served at
least 10 days before the expiration of time so specified for such work to
be done upon the owners or occupants of the land adjoining such sidewalk
or curbstone so to be improved as aforesaid a copy of such resolution and
ordinance, with a notice that if the same is not done within a specified time
by the owner of the adjoining land, it will be done by said Common Council
at the expense of such owner. Such notice shall be served upon such owner
by delivering a copy thereof to him personally or by leaving the same, in
his absence, with some member of his family of suitable age and discretion
or some person of suitable age or discretion residing with him, if he be
a resident of the city, or otherwise on his agent or other person having
charge of the property or by depositing the same in the post office, properly
enclosed and postage prepaid thereon and directed to said owner at his last
known place of residence; in case such owner or his place of residence is
unknown, then upon the occupant or occupants of said premises; and in
case such owner or his place of residence is unknown and there be no agent
or occupant to the knowledge of the Common Council, such service may be
made by affixing a copy of such ordinance or resolution and notice upon
a conspicuous part of the premises. The Common Council shall at least 10
days before the expiration of the time specified for said work to be done
cause a copy of such resolution or ordinance to be published at least once
in the official paper of the city. If there be two or more owners or two or
more occupants of one piece of property, service upon one of them will
be sufficient. Affidavits of the publication and service of such resolution or
ordinance may be filed or recorded or both in the office of the Clerk of
said city, and affidavits or records thereof or a certified copy of either shall,
in all courts and places, actions and proceedings, be prima facie evidence
of the facts stated therein. In case any such improvement, act or thing so
required shall not be made, done or completed within the time specified,
the Common Council shall have power to make, do or complete the same
and, having done so, shall, without giving any other or further notice, upon
affidavits of the Commissioner of Public Works, as the case may be, having
the work in charge, showing the actual expense thereof, which affidavit
shall be made and filed with the said City Clerk, proceed to make a special
assessment roll and duplicate thereof, both of which are deemed originals,
against the delinquent owners and upon such adjoining land owned by
them, assessing each parcel or lot of land and the expense of sidewalk and
curbstone immediately adjoining it and filing the same, when completed, in
the office of the City Clerk, and such special assessment roll, from the time
of filing the same in the office of said City Clerk, shall be final and conclusive
upon all persons interested in such real estate or affected thereby, and the
amount therein assessed shall be a lien upon the lands and premises in said
assessment roll and adjoining which said improvements have been made.
§ 130 RENSSELAER CODE § 130
C:56
Whenever such special assessment roll and a warrant for the collection of
the taxes therein assessed shall be left with the City Treasurer, he shall
proceed to collect the same with the same fees thereon and in the same
manner as provided by this Act for the collection of the local assessments.
Whenever the grade of any sidewalk has been established by said city and
recorded and been conformed to by the owner of said property, any change
of grade thereof made by the city, insofar as any expense is incurred therein
and to that extent only, must be borne by the city at large.
§ 131. Changing name of street.
The majority of the owners of property abutting on a street may petition the
Common Council to change the name of said street to a name specified in
such petition, and the Common Council may then by ordinance or resolution
change the name of said street to the name specified in such petition. The
name of a street shall not be changed, except as provided by this section.
§ 132. Designation of street numbers.
The Common Council shall have full power and authority to designate the
street numbers of houses, lots and premises in the city and change, alter
and renumber the same as it may deem proper from time to time.
§ 133. Gas mains. [Amended by L.L. No. 3-1990]
Whenever the Common Council shall finally determine to pave or repave
any street or portion of a street in which gas mains are not at said time laid,
the Common Council may cause to be served written, typewritten or printed
notice of its intention to pave or repave said street or portion thereof upon
said gas company or owner of gas mains, having the same laid in any of
the streets of said city, contiguous to the street so intended to be improved,
and notify said gas company or owner of gas mains as aforesaid to extend
its mains throughout the portion of the street to be improved and to lay
lateral service pipes connected therewith, opposite each separate piece of
property on said street or portion thereof, so to be improved to a point or
points within the curb line or lines opposite thereto.
If such gas company or owners of gas mains shall fail to extend their gas
mains within a reasonable time, to be fixed by said Common Council in
said notice, to date from the service of such notice on such gas company
or owner of such gas mains, as required to be extended, they shall not be
permitted thereafter to lay their mains in the portion of the streets so paved
or repaved but shall only be permitted thereafter to lay their mains under
the sidewalks of the street so paved or repaved.
§ 134. Sewer connections.
Whenever the sewer mains have been laid or completed in any street or
portion thereof in or upon which the Common Council shall have finally
determined to make improvements by paving or repaving, said Common
Council shall immediately cause a notice to be published in the official paper
§ 130 RENSSELAER CITY CHARTER § 134
C:57
of the city requiring the owner or owners of any and all property fronting
or abutting on said street or portion thereof upon which improvements are
to be made to make connections with the sewer mains on said streets or
portion thereof to be improved and to make and lay service and house
connection pipes from said sewer mains in front of each separate piece of
property and, where directed by the Common Council, at least to a point
within the line of the curbing, within such time and in such manner as the
Common Council shall prescribe. Whenever any such owner or occupant
shall have made default in making such connections with such sewer mains
opposite the lands or premises owned or occupied by him or in making
and laying service and house connection pipes therefrom at least to a
point within the line of the curbing, as directed in and required by said
printed notice therefor, in the manner and within the time therein specified,
the Common Council shall have power and authority to make, extend and
complete the same to a point within the line of curbing opposite thereto and
in front thereof, and the actual expense thereof, including all labor done and
materials used in doing and completing the same, shall be assessed by the
Common Council upon each separate piece of property opposite which the
same shall be done and completed and shall be a lien on said premises and
the lots of land respectively, and the same shall be collected in the same
manner as provided by this Act for the collection and enforcement of the
expenses of constructing and relaying of sidewalks and curbstones.

In the assessment of any lands in the city for any purpose, it shall be
sufficient to state the name of one of the owners of such lands if the
owner or owners or any of them be residents of the city and known to the
Assessors. If the owner or owners are unknown to the Assessors or if, by
nonresidence, the ownership is unknown to the Assessors, then the owner
may be described as unknown, and there shall be stated the number of the
lot and block, if subdivided into lots or blocks, and so designated upon the
city map last adopted by the Common Council, if any, and of the number of
the lot or farm lot, if not so subdivided into lot or lots and so designated, and
also the street and number of any building thereon, and, if the land is vacant

on which it fronts and a brief description of the premises shall be given. In
case no inhabited building is on the lands and the residence of the owner
is unknown, such owner may be designated as unknown. No assessment
hereafter made in said city shall be held to be invalid because the same may
be made out in terms against the owner or owners unknown or the estate
of a deceased person, naming such person or the executor, administrator,
heirs or devisees of the deceased person, naming such person or any of
them or against a company or firm name or against a person in whom is

arising through ignorance or mistake as to names of owner or owners of
the property assessed, whether individually or a corporation, provided that
such property is sufficiently described on the assessment roll to reasonably
identify and indicate to a person familiar with the same the particular
property which it was intended to assess. Every assessment roll shall be
considered as referring to the last adopted map if any, unless it be otherwise
stated therein.

§ 164. Levying of city taxes and warrant for the collection thereof.
[Amended by L. 1953, c. 878, § 265]
Immediately after the filing of said duplicate assessment rolls with the
City Clerk as in this Act provided, the Common Council shall cause the
amount authorized to be raised for city purposes, as finally determined to be
rated and assessed upon the property of each person, company, corporation
or association appearing on such assessment rolls, to be set opposite the
name of each person, company, corporation or association, respectively,

thereon extended, the same shall be adopted by a resolution of the Common
Council and filed with the City Clerk. The City Clerk shall, on or before

§ 165. Correction of tax and assessment error; reassessment.
[Amended by L.L. No. 3-1990]
Whenever, in the judgment of the Common Council, there is any irregularity,
omission, error or lack of jurisdiction in any of the proceedings relating
§ 162 RENSSELAER CITY CHARTER § 165
C:63
to any tax or local assessment heretofore or hereafter levied and assessed
or in the making, levying or assessment of the same, the Common Council
has power. after causing notice to the person or corporation to be taxed
or assessed to be served personally or by mail directed to his last known
place of residence or his last known place of business and to be heard at the
time specified in such notice, to correct any such tax or local assessment
or any part thereof and reassess the same in such manner as it deems
proper, including therein interest at such rate on such amount as it deems
proper against the proper person, corporation or property it deems liable to
such tax or benefited by such improvement or both and such correction or
reassessment has the same effect as though the tax or assessment as thus
corrected and reassessed had originally been properly levied and assessed
at and for such corrected amount. The Common Council has power, when
it deems it for the best interest of the city, to set aside the whole of a local
assessment and thereupon to cause a reassessment to be made and may
pass a resolution designating the public improvement or work so made, the
whole expense thereof, including any and all interest thereon and the date
of the reassessment or installment thereon becomes due, including all that
may be imposed as provided by this Act, in case of local assessment and
the part or portion of the city deemed to be benefited thereby, and it may
direct the City Assessor to assess the lots or parcels of land in said territory
described for such expense according to the benefit received and proceed
in all respects as in cases of local assessments; and such assessment has
the same valid and binding force as if it had originally been properly made.
A resolution setting aside the whole of a local assessment and directing a
reassessment thereof must provide that any moneys paid on the assessment
set aside, with interest at a rate determined by the Common Council not
exceeding the rate received by the city on such money, must be credited
on the amount of the new assessment against the property on which the
assessment was paid and that in case the amount so paid exceeds the
amount reassessed on the same property, such surplus, including interest
as aforesaid, must be paid to the person who may have paid the same.
§ 166. Taxes as personal debt liens. [Amended by L. 1953, c. 878,
§ 266]
Every city tax creates a debt and personal obligation in favor of the city
against the person or corporation taxed, provided that at the time of the
preparation of the tax rolls containing the same person or corporation taxed
is a resident of the State of New York and, in case of a tax or assessment for
local improvement upon real estate, against the owner or occupant thereof,
from the date of the receipt of the tax roll and warrant by the City Treasurer
until the same shall be fully paid.
§ 167. Assessment not invalidated by irregularity.
No assessment or tax shall be vacated, set aside, canceled, annulled,
reviewed or otherwise questioned or affected by reason of any error,
irregularity or defect not actually fraudulent in any of the steps or
proceedings required to be had or taken as a preliminary to, or in the
§ 165 RENSSELAER CODE § 167
C:64
making of, the assessment or in the levying or collection of the taxes
nor in relation to or in connection with any proposal or designation of
materials, contract, work or improvement having or on account of which
such assessment was made or tax imposed, but all property shall be liable
to assessment, and all assessments shall be valid and of full force and effect
notwithstanding any such error, omission, irregularity or defect.
§ 168. Limitations of liens.
All taxes and assessments heretofore or hereafter levied on real estate shall
cease to be a lien at the end of 20 years from the time when such tax or
assessment shall have become due and payable, but nothing in this section
contained shall revive the lien of any tax or assessment of real estate which
has ceased to be a lien as against subsequent purchasers, mortgagees or
other encumbrances.
§ 169. Apportionment of taxes and assessments. [Amended by L.L.
No. 3-1990]
Any person whose real property is assessed upon the assessment roll with
the real property of any other person as one piece or plot may, at any
time after the delivery of the tax rolls to the Treasurer, submit his deed
or other evidence of title to the property to the Assessor. The Assessor
shall thereupon cause a written notice to be served personally or by mail
upon each owner of such real property affected thereby that on the day
and place specified in such notice, the Assessor will apportion the taxes
on such property between the divided interests therein. The Assessor shall
at the time and place, after hearing any person interested, apportion the
assessments and taxes thereon and shall forthwith deliver a written
statement of such apportionment to the Treasurer. The Treasurer shall
thereupon enter the apportionment upon the assessment roll and shall
thereafter separately receive the taxes so apportioned. Each apportioned
piece or plot shall thereafter be subject only to the lien of the corresponding
portion of the taxes and interest.

Sale of Real Property to Satisfy Tax Liens
§ 192. Annual sale of real property to satisfy tax liens.
There shall be an annual sale of real property within the city to satisfy tax
liens thereon between the first and 15th days of July. Such a tax lien against
a piece or parcel of real property shall consist of unpaid taxes, assessments
or installments of assessments for local improvement, which on said day
shall remain unpaid for more than 60 days after the same shall have become
due and payable, together with the accrued fees penalties, percentage and
interest on such tax and assessment and the charge for advertising the sale

§ 193. Notice of sale.

§ 194. Payment of amount of tax lien.
Before the sale, the owner of any piece or parcel of real property included in
the notice of sale or his representative or any person interested therein may
avoid the sale thereof by paying the amount of the tax lien to the Treasurer.
§ 195. Conduct of sale.
At the time and place fixed for the sale, the Treasurer shall offer at public
auction to the highest bidder each piece or parcel of real property published
on which the tax lien shall not have been paid. No bid shall be accepted
for the same less than the aggregate amount of the tax lien. A purchaser
on such sale shall pay the amount of his bid to the Treasurer immediately
after the piece or parcel of real property is struck off to him. If he shall
fail to do so, the Treasurer shall forthwith offer the piece or parcel of real
property for sale again and proceed as though it had not been struck off.

C:71
property advertised has been sold. If the Treasurer shall be unable to attend
and conduct the sale, the City Clerk may conduct the sale.
§ 196. Purchase by city.
If there is no bid of the amount due on any piece or parcel of real property
to be sold, the Treasurer shall bid in the same for the city, and the city may
acquire such real property, and the Common Council shall have the care and
control thereof and may lease or sell and convey the same in the manner
provided by this Act for the lease or sale of real property or sell the same at
an arrears sale as herein provided.
§ 197. Certificate of sale.
As soon as practical, the Treasurer shall prepare and execute, in duplicate,
as to each piece or parcel of real property sold a certificate of such sale
containing a brief general description of the location, boundary, estimated
quantity thereof, date of sale, name of purchaser, the sum paid therefor, the
amount of the tax lien thereon, the name of the person or persons against
whom the items of the tax lien were assessed and the name of the reputed
owner thereof. One of such duplicates shall be delivered to the purchaser,
or, if the piece or parcel was struck off to the city, it shall be retained by
the Treasurer. The Treasurer shall deliver the other duplicate certificate to
the County Clerk of Rensselaer County, who shall file such certificate in his
office and record the same in the book to be kept for that purpose and shall
index the certificate in the name of the person to whom the piece or parcel
was assessed in the name of the reputed owner thereof and in the name
of the purchaser in the same book and in the same manner as deeds are
required to be indexed. The County Clerk shall be entitled to receive a fee

§ 198. Disposition of proceeds of sale.

the city shall be applied by the Treasurer to the payment of the tax lien
for which it was sold, and, if there is any surplus, the same shall remain in
the custody of the Treasurer, who shall keep a record thereof. The owner of
the equity of the redemption or any other person interested in such surplus
may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for a further distribution
of such surplus in the same manner as in proceedings for the distribution of
surplus money in foreclosure actions. Any person making such application
or any heir sharing in the distribution of such moneys shall be deemed to
have waived all his right for the recovery of the value or the possession of
such real property or any part thereof.
§ 199. Redemption.
The owner or any person interested in or having a lien upon any piece
or parcel of real property so sold may redeem the same from such sale

C:72
at any time within two years by paying to the Treasurer for the use of
the purchaser or successors in interest or, if the premises shall have been
previously redeemed by any person other than the owner thereof, then for
the use of such person the sum mentioned in the certificate as having been
paid for the premises, with interest thereon at the rate of 12% per annum
from the time of the sale, together with any tax or assessment or part
thereof upon such parcel or other portion thereof that the purchaser or his
successors in interest or the person previously redeeming shall have paid
between the time of the sale and such redemption, with interest at the rate
of 12% per annum upon said tax or assessment from the time of the payment
thereof. The time until which such redemption may be made shall not begin
to run against an infant or incompetent person until the termination of their
disability. In case of the redemption of any land sold to satisfy a tax lien
as herein provided by the person who was the owner thereof at the time
of the sale or by the person succeeding to his interest, the Treasurer shall
give such owner or person a receipt for the amount paid by him to effect
such redemption and on production thereof by such owner or person to the
County Clerk; such Clerk shall cancel such certificate of sale by the proper
entry at the foot of the record of such certificate in his office.
§ 200. Notice of redemption.
At least three months before the expiration of the time for the final
redemption of any piece or parcel of real property so sold, the Treasurer
shall commence publication of a notice of such redemption from such sale,
which shall show the year when such sale took place and the last day for the
redemption of the real property not already redeemed by the owner thereof,
without other or further description, which notice shall be published at
least once a week for six successive weeks in the official newspaper. The
publication of such notice shall bar and preclude any or all persons, except
the purchaser or his heirs and assigns or the person finally redeeming from
claiming any interest or lien upon such real property or any part thereof,
in case such real property shall not be redeemed from such sale as herein
provided.
§ 201. Disposition of redemption money.
If any piece or parcel of real property shall have been redeemed as herein
provided, the Treasurer shall pay on demand to the person entitled thereto
the moneys received on such redemption, or, if the city shall be at the
time thereof the holder of the certificate of sale, he shall place the amount
received in the general fund.
§ 202. Conveyance. [Amended by L. 1917, c. 680; L.L. No. 3-1990]
If any piece or parcel of real property so sold shall not be redeemed as
herein provided, the Treasurer, immediately after the expiration of the
time for the final redemption, shall execute and deliver to the purchaser,
his heirs or assigns or to the city or its assigns or to the person finally
redeeming, as the case may be, a conveyance of the real property so
§ 199 RENSSELAER CITY CHARTER § 202
C:73
sold, which conveyance shall vest in the grantee an estate in fee subject
only to the lien of any unpaid taxes or assessments thereon. All purchases
made for the city in any year shall be included in one conveyance. Every
such conveyance shall be executed by the Treasurer, the execution thereof
proved or acknowledged in the manner required by law for the proof or
acknowledgment of a deed to be recorded; any such conveyance shall be
conclusive evidence that the sale and subsequent proceedings were regular
and presumptive evidence that all the previous proceedings were regular
and in conformity to law; any such conveyance may be recorded in like
manner and with like effect as other conveyances of real property. The
City Treasurer executing such conveyances shall be entitled to demand and
receive from the grantee $5 for the benefit of the city for preparing every
such conveyance.
§ 203. Possession of real property sold.
The grantee under such a conveyance or his assigns or the city or its
assigns, as the case may be, shall be entitled to have possession of the
granted lands from and after the execution of such conveyance and may
cause the occupants of such lands to be removed therefrom and the
possession thereof delivered to them in the same manner and by the same
proceeding and by and before the same court and officer as in case of a
tenant holding over after the expiration of his term without the permission
of his landlord.
§ 204. Treasurer's record of sales, redemption and proceedings.
The Treasurer shall keep in his office a book arranged for the registry of all
memoranda relating to matters governed by this Title IX and shall keep all
records of sales, redemptions, notices, conveyances and other memoranda
therein.
§ 205. Invalid sales.
If any sale of real property to satisfy a tax lien is adjudged invalid by a court
of competent jurisdiction, the amount of the purchase money with interest
at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of payment of the same shall be
returned by the city to the purchaser or his assigns, and the city shall not
be subject to any other or further liability, and the Common Council shall
have power and it shall be its duty to cause the same to be reassessed in a
proper manner.
§ 206.
No interest to be charged after expiration of two years from time of any
sale. No interest shall be charged or added to any tax lien after the
expiration of two years from the time of such sale.

Sick Leave Donation Program
[Adopted 8-2-1995]
§ 37-11. Intent.
§ 37-12. Eligibility to donate.
§ 37-13. Eligibility to receive donations.
A. The intent of the leave donation program is to provide a means to assist
employees who, because of long-term personal illness or injury, have
exhausted their leave benefits, vacation time, compensatory time and
other accruals and would otherwise be subject to a severe loss of
income during a continuing absence from work. It is the intent of the
City to have both union and nonunion employees eligible to participate
in the leave donation program. It is not, however, the intent of this
policy to conflict with or to supersede any collective bargaining unit
agreements.
B. The program is not intended to provide supplemental income which
would result in compensation levels exceeding normal wages for
employees who have other sources of substitute income, such as that
provided by disability insurance programs.
A. In order to donate sick credits, an employee must meet the following
eligibility criteria:
(1) The employee must be employed by the City of Rensselaer; and
(2) The employee must have a minimum balance of at least 10 days
after making a donation to the sick leave program.
B. An employee may donate a total of 10 sick days every six months as long
as the individual donor has a sick leave balance of at least 10 days after
making the donation.
C. Donations must be made in full-day (7.5 hours) units, regardless of the
work schedule or percentage of employment of the donor or the
recipient. The work schedule or employment percentage of the
intended recipient is not a factor in determining the minimum units of
donation.
D. The identity of donors may not be disclosed by the City. All donations
must be made through the use of a signed consent form.
E. An employee who has submitted his/her resignation or retirement or
who has received notice of termination of employment can only donate
10 days' credit.
A. In order to receive donated leave credits, an employee must meet the
following eligibility criteria:
§ 37-11 RENSSELAER CITY CHARTER § 37-13
C:145
§ 37-14. Use of donated credits.
(1) The employee must be a full-time employee or otherwise eligible to
earn leave credits.
(2) The employee must have completed at least one cumulative year of
service.
(3) The employee must be absent due to a nonoccupational personal
illness or disability for which medical documentation satisfactory to
management is submitted as required.
(4) The employee must be expected to be absent for at least two
biweekly payroll periods following exhaustion of leave credits,
vacation time, compensatory time and other accruals.
(5) The employee must have donated sick leave time to the sick leave
program.
B. The requirement that a person donate sick credits to the sick leave
program shall not become effective until one year from the effective
date of this article. The eligibility of an employee to participate in this
program shall be approved by the Common Council. There is no
maximum number of days which a recipient employee may accept;
provided, however, that donated credits cannot be used to extend
employment beyond the point it would otherwise end by operation of
law, rule or regulation. Similarly, there is no maximum number of
donors from whom an eligible employee may accept donations.
C. An employee's continuing eligibility to participate in this program must
be reviewed by the Common Council at least every 30 days and more
frequently if appropriate. Current standards as to what constitutes
medical documentation satisfactory to management for purposes of
determining medical disability continue to apply.
A. Time donated to the sick leave program will be distributed equally until
such time as all leave donated to the program is exhausted.
B. Donated credits may be used only after exhaustion of all leave credits,
vacation time, compensatory time and any other accrued time of the
recipient.
C. When the employee requests to use donated credits after exhaustion of
leave credits, vacation time, compensatory time and any other accruals,
the donated credits must be used in full-day units based on his/her work
schedule.
D. Normally, donated credits are only available for periods of continuous
absence which are expected to continue for at least two biweekly
payroll periods following exhaustion of leave accruals. However, in
certain cases of intermittent absence in connection with catastrophic
illness, the Common Council may waive the two biweekly payroll period

The City may not solicit donations on the employee's behalf. While the

to participate in the program, the City may not release any medical
information.
continuous absence requirement. The Common Council may also take
into account reoccurrence of illness and disability in determining an
employee's eligibility. In no event may any exception be granted to the
requirements that all leave credits, vacation time, compensatory time
and any other accruals be exhausted.
A. Recipient employees are deemed to be on leave without pay status for
attendance and leave purposes while charging donated leave credits.
They do not earn biweekly leave accruals or observe holidays nor do
they receive personal leave or vacation bonus days if their anniversary
dates fall while they are using donated leave credits. In such cases, the
personal leave anniversary date changes to the date of return to work,
and personal leave is granted on the adjusted anniversary date.
B. In some cases, donations may be received on an intermittent basis. For
example, in the first payroll period of participation in the program, the
employee may receive donations of four days, in the second payroll
period, two days and so on. Credits which have been donated must be
used each pay period prior to placing the employee on leave without
pay for the balance of that pay period.
C. While charging donated credits, the employee continues to have health
insurance premiums, retirement contributions and other payroll
deductions withheld from his or her paycheck, so long as the paycheck
is of an amount sufficient to cover these deductions.
D. Employees using donated leave continue to receive retirement service
credit for days in pay status.

Information Technology and Internet Use Procedures
[Adopted 3-17-2010]
§ 37-18. Internet use.
The computer network is the property of City of Rensselaer. The following
guidelines must be adhered to by City of Rensselaer' employees,
contractors, consultants and any other representatives of City of Rensselaer
who use the Internet through agency computers or networks.
A. Access to the Internet is granted for official City of Rensselaer business
only. Incidental personal use is permissible so long as it does not
consume more than a trivial amount of resources and such use does not
interfere with employee productivity or preempt any business activity.
Employees are reminded that the use of the agency's computer network
for personal use results in costs to the City due to lost employee time
and productivity. Therefore, regular personal Internet use on agency
computers may result in the revocation of Internet access or
disciplinary actions up to and including termination.
B. All employees have a responsibility to use the City of Rensselaer's
computer resources and the Internet in a professional, lawful and
ethical manner.
C. Employees should have no expectation of privacy when using the
agency's computer network or the Internet. Information transmitted
over the Internet is not secure and it can be readily intercepted,
changed and read by others. In addition, the content of information
transmitted and usage of the Internet may be monitored by the City of
Rensselaer to support operational, maintenance, auditing, security and
investigational activities.
D. Employees are cautioned that information on the Internet may include
offensive, sexually explicit, and inappropriate material. Employees
using the City of Rensselaer's computers who discover they have
connected with a website that contains sexually explicit, racist, violent,
or other potentially offensive material must immediately disconnect
from that site. The City of Rensselaer may also utilize software that
makes it possible to identify and block access to Internet sites
containing sexually explicit or other material deemed inappropriate in
the workplace. However, the ability to connect with a specific website
does not in itself imply that City of Rensselaer employees are permitted
to visit that site.
E. Employees may not disseminate or knowingly receive harassing,
sexually explicit, threatening or illegal information by use of the
agency's computer network or the Internet, including offensive jokes or
cartoons. Employees also may not intentionally develop or use
programs that harass other users or infiltrate a computer or computing
§ 37-18 RENSSELAER CITY CHARTER § 37-18
C:151
system and/or damage or alter the software components of a computer
or computing system.
F. The City of Rensselaer's computer network may not be used to
disseminate, view or store commercial or personal advertisements,
solicitations, promotions, destructive code (e.g., viruses, trojan horse
programs, etc.) or any other unauthorized materials.
G. Employees may only indicate their affiliation with the City of Rensselaer
in mailing lists, chat sessions, and other offerings on the Internet when
such affiliation is for City of Rensselaer related business and after the
employee has received permission from his/her supervisor. Please note,
all communications with the media (e.g., newspaper, television, radio)
must first be cleared through the City of Rensselaer Mayor's office.
H. Employees may not illegally copy material protected under copyright
law or make that material available to others for copying. Employees
are responsible for complying with copyright law and applicable
licenses that may apply to software, files, graphics, documents,
messages and other material they wish to download or copy.
I. Downloading material can also make the City's network vulnerable to
viruses. Therefore, programs or data files should not be downloaded
from the Internet unless there is substantial reason and approval given
from the City of Rensselaer's Information Security Officer.
J. Employees should not make use of streaming video, unless absolutely
necessary [e.g., viewing a news clip would be acceptable as opposed to
viewing an entertainment site (using the computer as a television)
which would be unacceptable].
K. Employees should have a reason to believe that the source is virus-free.
Employees may not agree to a license or download any material onto
agency equipment without first obtaining the approval of their
supervisor.
L. Unless expressly authorized to do so, employees are prohibited from
sending, transmitting, or otherwise distributing proprietary
information, data, trade secrets or other confidential information
belonging to the City of Rensselaer. Unauthorized dissemination of such
material may result in disciplinary action as well as substantial civil and
criminal penalties under state and federal economic espionage laws.
M. Employees should safeguard accounts and passwords. Any employee
changes of a password must comply with the Information Security
Officer's guidelines for good passwords. Each employee must exercise
reasonable care and due diligence to assure that equipment provided
for performance of his/her duties is used appropriately. Accounts and
passwords are not to be shared with another person without
authorization. Employees should not save fixed passwords on their
computer; rather, they should be typed by the employee each time they
are needed.
§ 37-18 RENSSELAER CODE § 37-18
C:152
§ 37-19. Electronic mail ("e-mail").
E-mail may be used by City of Rensselaer employees as long as the following
guidelines are adhered to:
N. The guidelines established herein are intended to be illustrative of the
range of acceptable and unacceptable uses of the City of Rensselaer
Internet facilities and are not necessarily exhaustive. Employees should
direct questions about specific uses not enumerated in this policy to
their supervisor.
O. If there is evidence that an employee is not adhering to the guidelines
set out in this policy, the City of Rensselaer reserves the right to take
steps to ensure compliance and may take disciplinary action, including
termination and/or legal action. Employees with questions or comments
about this policy should contact their supervisor.
A. E-mail generally must be used for official City of Rensselaer business
only. Incidental personal use is permissible so long as it (a) does not
consume more than a trivial amount of resources, (b) does not interfere
with employee productivity, and (c) does not preempt any business
activity. Users are forbidden from using City of Rensselaer electronic
communication systems for charitable endeavors, private business
activities, amusement, entertainment or to transmit pyramid schemes,
direct marketing pitches or other similar messages. The use of agency
e-mail should never create either the appearance or the reality of
inappropriate use. Employees are reminded that the use of agency email
for personal use results in costs to the City due to lost employee
time and productivity. Therefore, personal use of e-mail which violates
(a), (b) or (c) above may result in the revocation of e-mail privileges and
additional disciplinary actions up to and including termination.
B. City of Rensselaer employees should exercise judgment when drafting
and addressing e-mails, just as they do in drafting and addressing hardcopy
correspondence. Employees should not send or forward e-mail
messages that include libelous, offensive, racist, harassing, profane,
obscene, sexual or other derogatory content. Employees who receive an
e-mail of this nature must promptly notify their supervisor.
C. City of Rensselaer employees should not send unsolicited e-mail
messages (also known as "spam") and are strictly prohibited from
creating, replying to or forwarding chain mail. When City of Rensselaer
employees receive unwanted or unsolicited e-mail, they should delete
the message rather than responding to the sender. If the e-mail contains
harassing or offensive material, or if the volume of such messages is
exceptionally high, the recipient should notify the Information Security
Officer, who can then take steps to block the spam messages.
D. City of Rensselaer employees must not forge or attempt to forge e-mail
messages or disguise or attempt to disguise their identity when sending
e-mail.
§ 37-18 RENSSELAER CITY CHARTER § 37-19
C:153
E. All messages distributed via the City's e-mail system, even personal emails,
are property of the City of Rensselaer. City of Rensselaer
employees must have no expectation of privacy in anything that they
create, store, send or receive on the agency's e-mail system. E-mails
can be monitored without prior notification if the City of Rensselaer
deems this necessary. Electronic communications can be forwarded,
intercepted, printed and stored by others. In addition, the content and
usage of e-mail may be monitored, without prior notification, by the City
of Rensselaer to support operational, maintenance, auditing, security
and investigational activities. Therefore, confidential information
should not be sent via e-mail.
F. All information security alerts, warnings or other similar information
should be promptly reported to the Information Security Officer.
G. City of Rensselaer employees should comply with all existing laws,
regulations and requirements when using the City's e-mail system,
including, but not limited to, the Freedom of Information Law, trade
secret protection laws, the Personal Privacy Protection Laws and the
New York State Archives and Records Administration (SARA) General
Retention and Disposition Schedule for New York State Government
Records.
H. If there is evidence that an employee is not adhering to the guidelines
set out in this policy, the City of Rensselaer reserves the right to take
steps to ensure compliance and may take disciplinary action, including
termination and/or legal action. Employees with questions or comments
about this e-mail policy should contact their supervisor.

ARTICLE III
Force and Weapons Policies
[Adopted 12-19-1990 by L.L. No. 7-1990]
§ 43-20. Use of force.
In a complex urban society, officers are confronted daily with situations
where control must be exercised to effect arrest and to protect the public
safety. Control may be achieved through advice, warnings and persuasion
or by the use of physical force. While the use of reasonable physical force
may be necessary in situations which cannot be otherwise controlled, force
may not be resorted to unless all other reasonable alternatives have been
exhausted or would clearly be ineffective under the particular
circumstances. Officers are permitted by New York State Penal Law Article
35 to use whatever force is reasonable and necessary to protect others and
themselves from bodily harm. Officers should bear in mind that Article 35
of the Penal Law only authorizes use of physical force/deadly physical force,
it does not command its use.
§ 43-21. Use of deadly physical force.
A. No set of guidelines for the use of firearms can possibly cover every
situation that might arise, and every police officer is expected to
respond to all such emergencies decisively, with the highest level of
good judgment and professional competence.
B. Officers should have a thorough knowledge of Article 35 of the New
York State Penal Law and should periodically review this body of law.
C. In applying the above provision of the New York State Penal Law,
officers will be guided by the following procedures when considering
the use of deadly physical force:
(1) A police officer is authorized to use firearms in the following
circumstances if there is no other reasonable alternative available:
(a) To defend himself or another person from unlawful attack
when he has reasonable cause or believes there is imminent
danger of death or serious physical injury.
(b) To apprehend a person who is committing or has committed a
crime in which deadly physical force has been used or
threatened and when he has reasonable cause to believe that
such person would cause death or serious bodily injury unless
immediately apprehended.
(c) To kill a dangerous animal or an animal so badly injured that
humanity requires that it be removed from further suffering. In
the case of an injured animal, the permission of the owner
should be obtained whenever possible. Great care should be
taken to protect bystanders from a ricocheting bullet, and, if
§ 43-20 RENSSELAER CITY CHARTER § 43-21
C:191
§ 43-22. Weapons policy.
possible, the killing of an animal in the presence of children
should be avoided.
(2) For authorized target practice or competition with weapons
authorized by the Department.
(3) A police officer shall not use a firearm in the following
circumstances:
(a) To fire warning shots in order to induce a fleeing subject to
halt.
(b) To fire a weapon to effect an arrest, except as provided for in
Subsection C(1)(a) and (b) of this policy statement.
(c) To fire at or from a moving vehicle, unless the occupants of the
vehicle are using deadly physical force against the officer or
another by means other than the vehicle itself.
(4) Avoidance of recklessness should be considered in any situation
involving deadly physical force. Even a case where deadly physical
force is both authorized by law and reasonable under the
circumstances, the officer must consider the safety of innocent
bystanders (e.g., firing in a crowded street). The fact that an officer
is legally justified using deadly physical force does not constitute a
license for reckless conduct by the police officer, and such officer
may be held criminally and/or civilly liable.
(5) A police officer who injures any person through the discharge of his
firearm will ensure that steps are taken to provide the injured
person with necessary medical treatment.
(6) A police officer who discharges his firearm for any reason except
for authorized target practice or competition shall, as soon as
possible, submit to the Chief of Police a report in accordance with
departmental procedures, which should include the following
information:
(a) The names and addresses of any injured persons and
witnesses.
(b) The extent and treatment of any injuries, the hospital where
treated and/or the doctor who provided such treatment.
(c) The number of shots fired and the reasons and circumstances
that required the use of firearms.
A. Firearms.
§ 43-21 RENSSELAER CODE § 43-22
C:192
(1) Any firearm carried as an on-duty or an off-duty weapon must be
authorized by the Chief of Police in addition to being registered
with the Department.
(2) Ammunition for on-duty and off-duty weapons will be designated by
the Chief of Police.
(3) Carrying of off-duty weapons will be optional and left to the
discretion of the individual.
(4) The acquisition of any handgun by Department personnel will
require prior written permission from the Chief of Police, unless
such acquisition is pursuant to a valid pistol permit.
B. Firearms qualifications. All departmental personnel must qualify
semiannually with both on-duty and off-duty weapons. The course of
qualification will be prescribed by the Chief of Police.

PROCUREMENT POLICY
GENERAL REFERENCES
Purchasing Department  See Ch. 47.
§ 45-1. Determination of type of purchase; competitive bidding.
§ 45-2. Method for securing goods and services.
A. Every purchase to be made must be initially reviewed to determine
whether it is a purchase contract or a public works contract. Once the
determination is made, a good faith effort will be made to determine
whether it is known or can reasonably be expected that the item of
supply or service is not subject to competitive bidding, taking into
account past purchases and the aggregate amount to be spent in a year.
The following items are not subject to competitive bidding pursuant to
§ 103 of the New York State General Municipal Law:
(1) Purchase contracts under $7,000 and public works contracts under
$10,000.
(2) Emergency purchases.
(3) Goods purchased from agencies for the blind or severely
handicapped.
(4) Goods purchased from correctional institutions.
(5) Purchases under state and county contracts.
(6) Surplus and secondhand purchases from another governmental
entity.
B. The decision that a purchase is not subject to competitive bidding will
be documented in writing by the individual making the purchase. This
documentation may include written or verbal quotes from vendors, a
memo from the purchaser indicating how the decision was arrived at, a
copy of the contract indicating the source which makes the item or
service exempt, a memo from the purchaser detailing circumstances
which led to an emergency purchase or any other written
documentation that is appropriate.
A. All goods and services will be secured by the use of written requests for
proposals, written or faxed quotations, verbal quotations or any other
method that assures that goods will be purchased at the lowest price
and that favoritism will be avoided, except in the following
circumstances:
§ 43-22 RENSSELAER CODE § 45-2
C:194
(1) Purchase contracts over $7,000 and public works contracts over
$10,000.
(2) Goods purchased from agencies for the blind or severely
handicapped pursuant to § 175-b of the New York State Finance
Law.36
(3) Goods purchased from correctional institutions pursuant to § 186
of the New York State Correction Law.
(4) Purchases under state contract pursuant to § 104 of the New York
State General Municipal Law.
(5) Purchases under county contracts pursuant to § 103, Subdivision 3,
of the General Municipal Law.

B. The following method of purchase will be used when required by this
policy in order to achieve the highest savings:
(1) Purchase contracts.
Estimated Amount of
Purchase Contract Method
Up to $1,000 Discretion of Purchasing Agent
$1,000 to $2,499.99 2 verbal quotations, minimum

$10,000 and up Publicly bid
C. All purchased contracts and public works contracts greater than $7,000
shall be subject to Common Council approval. A good faith effort shall
be made to obtain the required number of proposals or quotations. If
the purchaser is unable to obtain the required number of proposals or

§ 45-3. Documentation required.
§ 45-4. Exceptions.
Pursuant to New York State General Municipal Law § 104-b, Subdivision
2g, the procurement policy may contain circumstances when, or types of
procurements for which, in the sole discretion of the governing body, the
solicitation of alternative proposals or quotations will not be in the best
interest of the municipality. In the following circumstances, it may not be in
the best interest of the City of Rensselaer to solicit quotations or document
the basis for not accepting the lowest bid:
quotations, the purchaser will document the attempt made at obtaining
proposals or quotations. In no event shall the failure to obtain the
proposals be a bar to the procurement.
D. "OGS or less." In the event that a commodity may be found at a price
lower than the current New York State contract price for that same
commodity, the purchaser is hereby precluded from obtaining further
quotations for that particular item. Documentation must be provided.
A. Documentation is required of each action taken in connection with each
procurement.
B. Documentation and an explanation are required whenever a contract is
awarded to other than the lowest responsible offeror. This
documentation will include an explanation of how the award will
achieve savings or how the offeror was not responsible. A
determination that the offeror is not responsible shall be made by the
purchaser, in conjunction with the Corporation Counsel, and may not be
challenged under any circumstances.
A. Professional service or services requiring special or technical skill,
training or expertise.
(1) The individual or company must be chosen based on accountability,
reliability, responsibility, skill, education and training, judgment,
integrity and moral worth. These qualifications are not necessarily
found in the individual or company that offers the lowest prices,
and the nature of these services are such that they do not readily
lend themselves to competitive procurement procedures. In
determining whether a service fits into this category, the City of
Rensselaer shall take into consideration the following guidelines:
(a) Whether the services are subject to state licensing or testing
requirements.
(b) Whether substantial formal education or training is a
necessary prerequisite to the performance of the services.
(c) Whether the services require a personal relationship between
the individual and municipal officials.

§ 47-1. Creation.
There is hereby created and established in and for the City of Rensselaer
a Purchasing Department, which shall consist of a Purchasing Agent, who
(2) Professional or technical services shall include but not be limited to
the following: services of an attorney; services of a physician;
technical services of an engineer engaged to prepare plans, maps
and estimates; securing insurance coverage and/or services of an
insurance broker, services of a certified public accountant;
investment management services; printing services involving
extensive writing, editing or artwork; management of municipally
owned property; and computer software or programming services
for customized programs or services involved in substantial
modification of prepackaged software.
B. Emergency purchases pursuant to § 103, Subdivision 4, of the General
Municipal Law. Due to the nature of this exception, these goods must be
purchased immediately, and a delay in order to seek alternate proposals
may threaten the life, health, safety or welfare of the residents. This
section does not preclude alternate proposals if time permits.
C. Goods or services under $1,000. The time and documentation required
to purchase through this policy may be more costly than the item itself
and would therefore not be in the best interests of the taxpayers. In
addition, it is not likely that such de minimus contract would be
awarded on this basis of favoritism.

receipt of all materials and supplies, including those on which bids are
obtained after publication of notice pursuant to law, as well as those

Social Hosts
[Adopted 8-1-2007]
§ 69-5. Findings and intent.
A. The City of Rensselaer does not have an ordinance to address adult
responsibility for the consumption of alcohol by minors in their home or
on their property.
B. Underage alcohol use is the number one lethal drug in New York State.
C. Present New York Law only covers those who "serve" or "provide"
alcohol, not those who allow it to be served or consumed on their
premises to/by underage persons.
D. With appropriate legal recourse, our communities can decrease
underage drinking.
E. The proposed ordinance reads:
"It is the purpose of this section to protect the public interest, welfare,
health and safety within the City of Rensselaer by prohibiting the
service to and consumption of alcoholic beverages and drugs by
persons under the age of 21 at private premises located in the City.
The City Council finds that the occurrence of social gatherings at
private premises where alcoholic beverages or drugs are served to or
consumed by persons under the age of 21 is harmful to such persons
themselves and a threat to public welfare, health and safety. The City
Council finds further that persons under the age of 21 often obtain
alcoholic beverages or drugs at such gatherings and that persons who
are in control of such premises know or have reason to know of such
service and/or consumption and will be more likely to ensure that
alcoholic beverages and drugs are neither served to nor consumed by
persons under the age of 21 at these gatherings."
F. This article will hold those adults (those over the age of 16) criminally
responsible for underage alcohol or drug use on their premises.
G. This article gives parents a tool to support their decision not to allow
youth to consume alcohol on their property.
H. This article holds those age 16 and over responsible for providing a
place where someone else's child can consume alcohol.
I. This article supports youth making good decisions.
J. The statistics from other communities with a similar ordinance show
that underage drinking has decreased significantly.

BUILDINGS, NUISANCE
GENERAL REFERENCES
Vacant buildings  See Ch. 84. Unsafe buildings  See Ch. 85.
§ 84-1. Legislative findings.
The Council finds that public nuisances exist in the City of Rensselaer in the
operation of certain establishments and the use and occupation of property
in flagrant and persistent violation of state and local laws and ordinances,
which nuisances substantially and seriously interfere with the interest of
the public in enhancing the quality of life and community environment in the
City, and in fostering and facilitating commerce, maintaining and improving
property values, and in preserving and protecting the public health, safety,
and welfare. The Council further finds that the persistence of such activities
and violations is detrimental to the health, safety, and welfare of the people
of the City of Rensselaer and of the businesses thereof and the visitors
thereto. It is the purpose of the Council to authorize and empower the
Mayor to impose sanctions and penalties for such public nuisances, and
such powers of the Mayor may be exercised either in conjunction with, or
apart from, the powers contained in other laws without prejudice to the use
of procedures and remedies available under such other laws. The Council
further finds that the sanctions and penalties that may be imposed by the
Mayor pursuant to this chapter constitute an additional and appropriate
method of law enforcement in response to the proliferation of the abovedescribed
public nuisances. The sanctions and penalties are reasonable and
necessary in order to protect the health and safety of the people of the City
and to promote the general welfare.
G. No person except a bona fide member of any such organization shall
participate in the management or operation of such game.
H. No person shall receive any remuneration for participating in the
management or operation of any game of bingo.

including the first day of the week, commonly known and designated as
"Sunday." [Added 4-7-1971 by L.L. No. 1-1971]

any provision of this chapter shall constitute and be punishable as a
misdemeanor.

size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures
constructed below the base flood level, provided that the items in
Subsection D(1) through (12) of § 105-16 have been fully considered. As
the lot size increases beyond 1/2 acre, the technical justification
required for issuing the variance increases.
B. Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or
restoration of structures and contributing structures listed on the
National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic
Places, without regard to the contributing structures procedures set

increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
E. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is
the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
F. Variances shall only be issued upon receiving written justification of:
§ 105-16 RENSSELAER CODE § 105-17
C:308
(1) A showing of good and sufficient cause.
(2) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant.

increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety or
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or
victimization of the public as identified in § 105-16D or conflict with
existing local laws or ordinances.
G. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted for a building with the
lowest floor below the base flood elevation shall be given written notice
that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the
increased risk resulting from lowest floor elevation.

RESIDENTIAL PARKING PERMIT SYSTEM
GENERAL REFERENCES
Vehicles and traffic  See Ch. 169.
§ 140-1. Authority.
Notwithstanding the provisions of any law to the contrary, the City Council
of the City of Rensselaer may, by adoption of a local law or ordinance,
provide for a residential parking permit system and fix and require the
payment of fees applicable to parking within the area in which such parking
system is in effect in accordance with the provisions of this section.
§ 140-2. Findings.
The area surrounding the Amtrak Station in the City of Rensselaer is a
residential neighborhood. This area contains many narrow streets that are
not conducive to heavy traffic, especially in the winter months. Many of
the properties in the neighborhood do not contain adequate space for
driveways. As a result, the streets within the area generally represent the
only space available to residents for parking. Because of the proximity of the
area to the Amtrak Station, many of the commuters use the streets within
this area for daily long-term parking. This severely diminishes the amount
of parking spaces available to residents in this area. The Council hereby
finds that because of the unique circumstances and location of this area,
§ 136-36 RENSSELAER CITY CHARTER § 140-2
C:445
the establishment of a residential parking system is such neighborhood
is necessary in order to preserve the character of this residential district
by reducing neighborhood noise and litter; improving access to dwellings
units and parking for residents and visitors; improving the efficiency of
City services such as street maintenance, snowplowing, street sweeping,
garbage collection and the movement of emergency vehicles.
§ 140-3. Area established.
Such residential parking permit system may only be established within the
area of the City consisting of the following streets:
§ 140-4. Additional findings; purpose.
§ 140-5. No permit required for adjacent commercial/retail uses.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no permit shall be required on streets
where the adjacent properties are zoned for commercial/retail use.
§ 140-6. Objectives.
The chapter providing for such residential parking system shall:
A. Elm Street.
B. East Street.
C. Wendell Street.
A. There has been a lack of parking for the residents in the neighborhoods
surrounding the Amtrak Station.
B. The streets in residential areas have been used for daily long-term
parking by Amtrak commuters.
C. The use of streets in the residential neighborhoods for Amtrak
commuters has severely diminished the amount of parking spaces
available to residents of the residential neighborhoods.
D. The establishment of a residential parking permit system in the
neighborhoods surrounding the Amtrak Station is necessary in order to
preserve the character of the neighborhoods by reducing neighborhood
noise and improving the efficiency of City services such as street
maintenance, snowplowing, street sweeping, garbage collection and
the movement of emergency vehicles, and reducing hazardous traffic
conditions and congestion in order to provide the health, safety, peace,
good order and comfort of the residents of the neighborhood.
A. Set forth factors necessitating the enactment of such parking system;
B. Provide that motor vehicles registered pursuant to Vehicle and Traffic
Law § 404-a shall be exempt from any permit requirements;
§ 140-2 RENSSELAER CODE § 140-6
C:446
§ 140-7. Public hearing required.
No ordinance or local law shall be adopted pursuant to this chapter until
a public hearing thereon has been had in the same manner as required for
public hearings on a local law pursuant to the Municipal Home Rule Law.
§ 140-8. Administration; suspension of privileges.
The Common Council of the City of Rensselaer shall establish rules,
regulation and fees relating to the issuance and use of residential parking
permits and visitors' passes and may suspend any parking permit privileges
for a period not to exceed 12 months for violation of said rules and
regulations. No such suspension shall be effective unless the Common
Council has given the permit holder at least 10 days' written notice of the
charges against the holder and offered the holder an opportunity to be
heard, either in writing or at a meeting, on said charges.
§ 140-9. Fees. [Amended 5-17-2006 by L.L. No. 2-2006]
The fee for a residential parking permit shall be a one-time fee of $5, and
the visitor's pass obtained by a resident shall be $5. All such fees shall be
collected by the City Clerk's Office and credited to the general fund at the
beginning of each month.
§ 140-10. Parking permit required; exception; fine. [Amended
5-17-2006 by L.L. No. 2-2006]
No person shall park a vehicle nor allow a vehicle to be parked in a parking
space along a street in the Amtrak area which has been designated by
the Common Council for residential parking only, unless said vehicle shall
have affixed thereto a valid residential parking permit or unless said vehicle
shall display a valid visitor's pass or unless said vehicle is registered in
accordance with § 404-a of the Vehicle and Traffic Law and said vehicle is
being used for the transportation of a disabled person. Any and all vehicles
parking without the residential parking permit or visitor's pass will be fined
$50 and towed at the owner's expense.

ARTICLE I
Item Pricing
[Adopted 11-18-1998 by L.L. No. 1-1998]
§ 141-1. Legislative intent.
This article recognizes that clear, accurate item pricing is a basic consumer
right that is not protected under current state law. It is the intent of this
legislation to ensure that consumer goods offered for sale in the City of
Rensselaer are clearly, accurately and adequately marked as to their selling
prices. Further, it is the intention of this body to provide for a waiver of
the item pricing requirement for certain stores which maintain a very high
degree of computer-assisted pricing accuracy and which provide certain
other services to permit consumers to record and verify individually priced
items. It is also the intention of this body to require clear and legible shelf
labels.
§ 141-2. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:

enforce the provisions of this section.
ITEM PRICE  A clearly readable tag, stamp or mark affixed to a

maintained at the point of sale.
PRICING ACCURACY INSPECTION  An inspection of a retail store for
purposes of determining that programmed computer prices are consistent
with the retail price or item, shelf, sale or advertised price. A pricing
accuracy inspection shall consist of not less than 100 nor more than 200
stockkeeping units, representing a cross section of all stockkeeping units
offered for sale.
RETAIL PRICE  The lowest price of a stockkeeping item as determined by
item, shelf, sale or advertised price of such stockkeeping item.

A. In retail stores equipped with a computer-assisted checkout system, the
Sealer of Weights and Measures of the City of Rensselaer shall have the
authority to conduct pricing accuracy inspections. Retail stores with
computer-assisted checkout systems which do not place price stickers
on individual stockkeeping units shall be required to:
(1) Display easy-to-read and properly located shelf tags or signs on
every stockkeeping unit or group of stockkeeping units of the same
brand, size and price. Each stockkeeping item's (SKI's) retail price
shall be printed on a shelf label in characters no less than 3/4 of an
inch in height. Shelf price labels on bottom shelves shall be tilted
§ 141-5 RENSSELAER CODE § 141-7
C:452
upward at an angle of between 30° and 60° from the floor. A retail
store failing to comply with this section shall be subject to a penalty

than $600 for the second and each subsequent violation.
(a) SKIs that are individually item priced are exempt from the

store may decrease the size requirement specified in
Subsection A(1). In theses situations the lettering cannot be
reduced below 3/8 inch.
(2) Achieve and maintain a pricing accuracy level of 98% from an
inspection of not less than 100 stockkeeping units nor more than
200 stockkeeping units, which shall represent a cross section of all
stockkeeping units offered for sale, to ascertain that the retail price
is the same as the computer-assisted checkout price.
(3) Designate and make available a price check scanner to enable
consumers to confirm the price of a stockkeeping unit. This price
check scanner shall be in a location convenient to customers, with a
sign of sufficient-sized lettering, identifying this unit to the
customers. Such waiver shall not be granted unless the location
and size of the sign are approved. The store may utilize this
scanner to meet unanticipated customer checkout needs. A retail
store failing to comply with this section may be assessed a penalty
not to exceed $300 per violation.
(4) Notify the Sealer of Weights and Measures of the City of Rensselaer
of the installation of scanning equipment. A retail store failing to
comply with this section may be assessed a penalty not to exceed
$300 per establishment.

granting of a waiver from item pricing within this store by the
Sealer of Weights and Measures of the City of Rensselaer, which
shall state consumer rights under this article. Such sign, content,
size and location are to be approved by the Sealer of Weights and
Measures of the City of Rensselaer.
B. The Sealer of Weights and Measures of the City of Rensselaer shall also
have the authority to respond to consumer complaints of overcharges.
In the event that the programmed computer price exceeds the retail
price, a penalty in the amount of $100 will be assessed. Inspections
done in response to a consumer complaint shall not be considered as
pricing accuracy inspections or result in greater penalties.
C. In the event that the programmed computer price exceeds the retail
price, the retail store will correct the pricing before the inspector
leaves the store.
§ 141-7 RENSSELAER CITY CHARTER § 141-7
C:453
D. The following penalties are established for pricing accuracy inspection
violations, based on a sample of not less than 100 stockkeeping units
nor more than 200 stockkeeping units. A violation exists when the
programmed computer price exceeds the retail price.
(1) Pricing accuracy of 98% or better: correction of pricing.
(2) Pricing accuracy of 97%: a penalty of $500.
(3) Pricing accuracy of 96%: a penalty of $750.
(4) Pricing accuracy 95%: a penalty of $1,000.
(5) Pricing accuracy below 95%: a penalty of $1,500.
E. If a retail store fails to achieve a pricing accuracy level of 95% on two
consecutive pricing accuracy inspections, on a sample of not less than
100 stockkeeping units nor more than 200 stockkeeping units, a penalty
in the amount of $2,000 will be assessed.
F. Waivers from item pricing.
(1) Every retail store which uses a computer-assisted checkout system
and which would otherwise be required to item price as provided in
§ 141-3 of this article may make application in writing to the Sealer
of Weights and Measures of the City of Rensselaer for a waiver of
said item pricing requirement. A separate application shall be
required for each store. Each application shall be subject to a
nonrefundable processing fee to cover the cost of conducting
scanner accuracy inspections as provided in Subsection F(2). The
processing fee shall be a minimum of $750, but in no event shall be
less than the cost of conducting the two required scanner accuracy
inspections as provided in Subsection F(4) of this section.
(2) Upon receipt of an application and fee, the Sealer of Weights and
Measures of the City of Rensselaer shall cause to be conducted two
scanner accuracy inspections of the store for which the application
has been submitted. These inspections shall be conducted on two
separate days and in a manner prescribed by this section; however,
a minimum of 100 store stockkeeping items (SKIs) shall be checked
at each inspection. In the event that any violations are detected, a
penalty shall be assessed as provided for in this article. If,
considering both inspections together, the number of SKIs found to
be in violation does not exceed 2% of all SKIs inspected, the Sealer
of Weights and Measures of the City of Rensselaer shall grant to the
applicant a one-year revocable waiver from the item pricing
requirement.
(3) A waiver from item pricing shall be valid for a period of one year
from the date of issuance. Stores may reapply annually for renewal
of waiver. The processing fee and two inspections shall be required
§ 141-7 RENSSELAER CODE § 141-7
C:454
for each annual renewal application, as are required for an original
waiver application.
(4) In the event that total violations in excess of 2% are discovered in
the inspections provided for, the Sealer of Weights and Measures of
the City of Rensselaer shall not grant a waiver to the applicant.
Such store must promptly reapply for a waiver and pay the
required fee to the Sealer of Weights and Measures of the City of
Rensselaer within five business days after being notified of the
failure. Stores which do not reapply must be in compliance with all
the requirements of the item pricing law. If the applicant continues
to maintain total violations in excess of 2% as determined by the
scanner accuracy inspections pursuant to Subsection F(2) of this
section, the applicant shall not be permitted to reapply for one year
from either the commencement date of the temporary waiver or the
scanner accuracy inspection test for the reapplication, whichever is
longer.
(5) In the event that the Sealer of Weights and Measures of the City of
Rensselaer is unable to conduct inspections pursuant to this
section within 30 days of receipt of a complete waiver application
and processing fee, the Sealer of Weights and Measures of the City
of Rensselaer shall grant a temporary waiver, pending completion
of the inspections. The Sealer of Weights and Measures of the City
of Rensselaer shall cause said inspections to be completed as soon
as practicable. If upon completion, the inspections detect a
violation rate of 2% or less, the Sealer of Weights and Measures of
the City of Rensselaer shall issue a regular waiver with an
expiration date of one year from the commencement date of the
temporary waiver. If the inspections detect a violation rate in

pipe and/or other approved pipe material shall be made with either lead
or approved hot-poured jointing material. Such material for hot-poured
joints shall not soften sufficiently to destroy the effectiveness of the
joint when subjected to a temperature of 160° F. nor be soluble in any
of the wastes carried by the drainage system. The joint shall first be
caulked tight with jute, hemp or similar approved material.
C. Premolded gasket joints for plain and cast-iron pipe may be used if
approved by the Plumbing Inspector and shall be a neoprene
compression-type gasket which provides a positive double seal in the
assembled joint. The gasket shall be a premolded, one-piece unit
designed for jointing the plain end cast-iron hub and spigot soil pipe

indemnity bond, in an amount to be determined by the Building Inspector,
shall be required to be posted before a permit will be granted to excavate
in or under the sidewalks, streets, highways or public places. Streets,
sidewalks, parkways and other public property disturbed in the course of
the work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the City of Rensselaer
or other authority having jurisdiction.
§ 143-27. Capping of building sewers for demolition.
In the case of the demolition of a building within the City of Rensselaer
which has a building sewer, the owner is responsible for properly capping
the building sewer at the property line to prevent entry of dirt, debris or any
foreign substances into the public sewer. This shall be accomplished under
the supervision of the Plumbing Inspector.
A. One day prior to the date of the proposed connection of the building
sewer to the public sewer, the applicant for the building sewer permit
shall notify the Building Inspector that the building sewer is ready for
inspection and connection to the public sewer, and the connection shall
be made only under the direct surveillance of the Plumbing Inspector,
the Superintendent of Public Works, the Building Inspector or the
representative of any of them.
B. When trenches are opened for the laying of building sewer pipes, such
trenches shall be inspected by the Plumbing Inspector before the
trenches are filled, and the contractor performing such work shall
notify the Plumbing Inspector when the laying of building sewer is
completed. The filling of a trench before inspection is made or approval
given will subject the contractor to whom a permit is issued to a penalty
of not to exceed $250 or imprisonment for not more than 15 days, or
both, for each offense, and the trench shall be reopened for inspection
by and at the expense of the contractor. [Amended 8-15-1990 by L.L.

Erosion and Sediment Control63
[Adopted 12-19-2007 by L.L. No. 4-200764]
§ 145-1. Findings of fact.
It is hereby determined that:
§ 145-2. Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to safeguard persons, protect property, and
prevent damage to the environment in the City of Rensselaer, New York.
A. Uncontrolled drainage and runoff associated with land development
has a significant impact upon the health, safety and welfare of the
community.
B. Eroded soil endangers water resources by reducing water quality and
causing the silting of streams, lakes and other water bodies adversely
affecting aquatic life.
C. Stormwater runoff and sediment transports pollutants such as heavy
metals, hydrocarbons, nutrients and bacteria to water resources,
degrading water quality.
D. Eroded soil necessitates repair and accelerates the maintenance needs
of stormwater management facilities.
E. Clearing, grading and altering natural topography during construction
tends to increase erosion.
F. Improper design and construction of drainage facilities can increase
the velocity of runoff, thereby increasing streambank erosion and
sedimentation.
G. Impervious surfaces increase the volume and rate of stormwater runoff
and allow less water to percolate into the soil, thereby decreasing
groundwater recharge and stream base flow.
H. Improperly managed stormwater runoff can increase the incidence of
flooding and the severity of floods that occur, endangering property and
human life.
I. Substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts.
J. Stormwater runoff, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be
controlled and minimized through the regulation of land development
activities.
63.Editor's Note: For additional stormwater management provisions, see also Ch. 179,
Zoning, Art. XV, Stormwater Control.
64.Editor's Note: This local law was originally adopted as Ch. 95, Art. I, but was redesignated
to maintain the organizational structure of the Code.
§ 145-1 RENSSELAER CITY CHARTER § 145-2
C:489
This article will also promote the public welfare by guiding, regulating,
and controlling the design, construction, use, and maintenance of any land
development activity as it relates to erosion and sedimentation control and
stormwater management. This article seeks to meet these purposes by
achieving the following objectives:
§ 145-3. Statutory authority.
In accordance with § 10 of the Municipal Home Rule Law of the State of
New York, the governing board of the City of Rensselaer has the authority
to enact local laws and amend local laws for the purpose of promoting
the health, safety or general welfare of the City of Rensselaer and for
the protection and enhancement of its physical environment. The City of
Rensselaer Common Council may include in any such local law provisions
for the appointment of any municipal officer, employees, or independent
contractor to effectuate, administer and enforce such local law.
§ 145-4. Applicability.
A. Meet the requirements of minimum control measures 4 (construction
site stormwater runoff control) and 5 (postconstruction stormwater
management) of the State Pollution Discharge Elimination System
(SPDES) general permit for stormwater discharges from municipal
separate stormwater sewer systems (MS4s), Permit GP-02-02 or as
amended or revised.
B. Require land development activities to conform to the substantive
requirements of the New York State Department of Environmental
Conservation (SPDES) general permit for construction activities
GP-02-01 or as amended or revised.
C. Minimize soil erosion and sedimentation impacts on streams, water
bodies, and neighboring properties.
D. Avoid excessive and/or unnecessary tree and vegetation removal.
E. Minimize windblown soil associated with properties being cleared and
graded for development.
F. Maintain the integrity of watercourses and sustain their hydrologic
functions.
G. Minimize increases in the magnitude and frequency of stormwater
runoff to prevent an increase in flood flows and the hazards and costs
associated with flooding.
H. Minimize decreases in groundwater recharge and stream base flow to
maintain aquatic life, assimilative capacity, and water supplies.
I. Facilitate the removal of pollutants in stormwater runoff to perpetuate
the natural biological function of water bodies.
§ 145-2 RENSSELAER CODE § 145-4
C:490
A. Except as otherwise provided herein, no person shall commence or
perform any land development activity, as defined herein, without the
approval of a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP).
B. Applicants shall also obtain all other permits required by state, federal,
and local laws. Whenever the particular circumstances of proposed
land development activity require compliance with special use, site
plan, or subdivision procedures of the City of Rensselaer, the
responsible board shall integrate the requirements prescribed herein
as appropriate and determine the adequacy of the SWPPP.
C. Redevelopment projects. Redevelopment projects, as defined herein,
provide an opportunity to reduce pollutant discharges and the rate, the
amount and quality of stormwater runoff leaving the redevelopment
site. However, the nature of the site, particularly in an urban location,
may impose constraints that prevent implementation of full
postconstruction compliance. Chapter 9 of the New York State
Stormwater Management Design Manual sets forth the standards for
compliance with water quantity and quality standards and
specifications. Consideration shall be given to using alternative
stormwater management practices such as rain gardens, pervious
pavers, green roofs and other low-impact development techniques to
reduce stormwater impacts.
D. No SWPPP is required for the following exempt activities:
(1) Any emergency activity that is immediately necessary for the
protection of life, property, or natural resources.
(2) Agricultural operations conducted as a permitted principal or
accessory use, including the construction of structures where the
land disturbance is less than one acre.
(3) Routine maintenance activities that disturb less than five acres and
are performed to maintain the original line and grade, hydraulic
capacity, or original purpose of a stormwater management facility.
(4) Mining as defined herein.
(5) The renovation/replacement of a septic system serving an existing
dwelling or structure.
(6) Normal lawn and landscaping activities/maintenance.
(7) Activities of an individual engaging in home gardening by growing
flowers, vegetables and other plants primarily for use by that
person and his or her family.
(8) Selective cutting of trees as defined herein, except log haul roads
and landing areas are subject to this article. ("Landing areas" are
cleared areas to which trees are hauled for their storage before
being transferred off site.)

§ 145-6. Retention of licensed/certified professional; payment.
(9) Repairs and maintenance of any stormwater management practice
or facility.
A. Construction completion guarantee. The applicant or developer may be
required to provide, prior to construction, a performance bond, cash
escrow, or irrevocable letter of credit, from an appropriate financial or
surety institution, which guarantees satisfactory completion of the
project and names the City of Rensselaer as the beneficiary. The
security shall be in an amount determined by the City of Rensselaer
based on submission of final design plans, with reference to actual
construction and landscaping costs. The performance guarantee shall
remain in force until the surety is released from liability by the City of
Rensselaer, provided that such period shall not be less than one year
from the date of final acceptance or such other certification that the
facilities have been constructed in accordance with the approved plans
and specifications and that a one-year inspection has been conducted
and the facilities have been found to be acceptable to the City of
Rensselaer. Per annum interest on cash escrow deposits shall be
reinvested in the account until the surety is released from liability.
B. Maintenance guarantee. Where stormwater management and erosion
and sediment control facilities are to be operated and maintained by the
developer or by a corporation that owns or manages a commercial or
industrial facility, the developer, prior to construction, may be required
to provide the City of Rensselaer with an irrevocable letter of credit
from an approved financial institution or surety to ensure proper
operation and maintenance of all stormwater management and erosion
control facilities both during and after construction and until the
facilities are removed from operation. If the developer or landowner
fails to properly operate and maintain stormwater management and
erosion control facilities, the City of Rensselaer may, upon notification,
draw upon the account to cover the costs of proper operation and
maintenance, including engineering and inspection costs.
C. Recordkeeping. The City of Rensselaer may require entities subject to
this article to maintain records demonstrating compliance with this
article.
A. The responsible board or municipal official is hereby authorized to
retain licensed/certified professionals as are determined to be
necessary to carry out the review of an SWPPP or to make regular or
final inspections of all control measures, lands, structures, and/or
appurtenances, to be dedicated to the City of Rensselaer in accordance

threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and
substantial danger to the environment, to the health or welfare of
persons, or to the MS4. The SMO shall notify the person of such
suspension within a reasonable time thereafter in writing of the reasons
for the suspension. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension
order issued in an emergency, the SMO may take such steps as deemed
necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or to minimize
danger to persons.
B. Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person
discharging to the municipality's MS4 in violation of this article may
have its MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or
reduce an illicit discharge. The SMO will notify a violator in writing of
the proposed termination of its MS4 access and the reasons therefor.
The violator may petition the SMO for a reconsideration and hearing.
Access may be granted by the SMO if he/she finds that the illicit
discharge has ceased and the discharger has taken steps to prevent its
recurrence. Access may be denied if the SMO determines, in writing,
that the illicit discharge has not ceased or is likely to recur. A person
commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises
terminated pursuant to this section without the prior approval of the
SMO.
A. Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that the SMO must
inspect to enforce any provision of this article or whenever the
authorized enforcement agency has cause to believe that there exists,
or potentially exists, in or upon any premises, any condition which
constitutes a violation of this article.

clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make
the necessary arrangements to allow access to the SMO.
(2) Facility operators shall allow the SMO ready access to all parts of
the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination
§ 145-15 RENSSELAER CITY CHARTER § 145-17
C:501
§ 145-18. Notification of spills.
Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person
responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency
response for a facility or operation, has information of any known or
suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal
discharges or pollutants discharging into the MS4, said person shall take all
necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such
release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials, said person
shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence
via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of nonhazardous
materials, said person shall notify the municipality in person or by
telephone or facsimile no later than the next business day. Notifications in
person or by telephone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and
mailed to the municipality within three business days of the in-person or
telephone notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from
a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such
establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge
and copying of records as may be required to implement this
article.
(3) The municipality shall have the right to set up on any facility
subject to this article such devices as are necessary in the opinion
of the SMO to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's
stormwater discharge.
(4) The municipality has the right to require the facilities subject to
this article to install monitoring equipment as is reasonably
necessary to determine compliance with this article. The facility's
sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all
times in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at
its own expense. All devices used to measure stormwater flow and
quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
(5) Unreasonable delay in allowing the municipality access to a facility
subject to this article is a violation of this article. A person who is
the operator of a facility subject to this article commits an offense if
the person denies the municipality reasonable access to the facility
for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required
by this article.
(6) If the SMO has been refused access to any part of the premises
from which stormwater is discharged and he/she is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a
violation of this article, or that there is a need to inspect and/or
sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program
designed to verify compliance with this article or any order issued
hereunder, then the SMO may seek issuance of a search warrant
from any court of competent jurisdiction.
§ 145-17 RENSSELAER CODE § 145-18

(2) If abatement of a violation and/or restoration of affected property is
required, the notice shall set forth a deadline within which such
remediation or restoration must be completed. Said notice shall
further advise that, should the violator fail to remediate or restore
within the established deadline, the work will be done by a
designated governmental agency or a contractor and the expense
thereof shall be charged to the violator.
B. Penalties. In addition to or as an alternative to any penalty provided
herein or by law, any person who violates the provisions of this article
shall be guilty of a violation punishable by a fine not exceeding $350 or
imprisonment for a period not to exceed six months, or both, for
conviction of a first offense; for conviction of a second offense, both of
which were committed within a period of five years, punishable by a
fine not less than $350 nor more than $700 or imprisonment for a
period not to exceed six months, or both; and upon conviction for a third
or subsequent offense, all of which were committed within a period of
five years, punishable by a fine not less than $700 nor more than $1,000
or imprisonment for a period not to exceed six months, or both.
However, for the purposes of conferring jurisdiction upon courts and
judicial officers generally, violations of this article shall be deemed
misdemeanors, and for such purpose only, all provisions of law relating
to misdemeanors shall apply to such violations. Each week's continued
violation shall constitute a separate additional violation.

the filing of the appeal and, within five days of making its decision, file its
decision in the office of the Municipal Clerk and mail a copy of its decision
by certified mail to the discharger.
§ 145-21. Corrective measures after appeal.
§ 145-22. Injunctive relief.
It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any provision or fail to comply
with any of the requirements of this article. If a person has violated or
continues to violate the provisions of this article, the SMO may petition for
a preliminary or permanent injunction restraining the person from activities
which would create further violations or compelling the person to perform
abatement or remediation of the violation.
§ 145-23. Alternative remedies.
A. If the violation has not been corrected pursuant to the requirements set
forth in the notice of violation or, in the event of an appeal, within five
business days of the decision of the municipal authority upholding the
decision of the SMO, then the SMO shall request the owner's
permission for access to the subject private property to take any and all
measures reasonably necessary to abate the violation and/or restore
the property.
B. If refused access to the subject private property, the SMO may seek a
warrant in a court of competent jurisdiction to be authorized to enter
upon the property to determine whether a violation has occurred. Upon
determination that a violation has occurred, the SMO may seek a court
order to take any and all measures reasonably necessary to abate the
violation and/or restore the property. The cost of implementing and
maintaining such measures shall be the sole responsibility of the
discharger.
A. Where a person has violated a provision of this article, he/she may be
eligible for alternative remedies in lieu of a civil penalty, upon
recommendation of the Municipal Attorney and concurrence of the
municipal Code Enforcement Officer, where:
(1) The violation was unintentional.
(2) The violator has no history of pervious violations of this article.

§ 147-8. Street openings.
If any applicant desires to open the carriageway of any paved street,
avenue, alley or public place in the City of Rensselaer for the purpose of
making or repairing water or sewer connections, or for any other purpose
not especially provided for in this article, such applicant shall deposit with
the Commissioner of Public Works an amount sufficient to cover the cost of
inspection, the removal of all clay or other materials which, in the opinion
of the Commissioner of Public Works, are unsuitable for backfilling, the
refilling of the opening with a mixture of sand and gravel and the repairing,
relaying and maintenance of the pavement to be removed, together with
the costs of any new materials required, as may be determined by the
Commissioner of Public Works, after which payment the Commissioner of
Public Works may issue a permit and the applicant may proceed to do
the work. The permit issued shall state the location, purpose and size of
the opening, the exact time the opening is to remain open, the kind of
§ 147-5 RENSSELAER CODE § 147-8

The Commissioner of Public Works may place an inspector in charge of
any street opening thus made for such time as he may deem necessary or
expedient. Upon the completion of the work, the Commissioner of Public
Works shall have the opening refilled and the pavement relayed and
repaired. All moneys for permits shall be received by the Commissioner
of Public Works, who shall keep an accurate account of same and who
shall deposit the same monthly with the City Treasurer to the credit of the
Commissioner of Public Works office. The Commissioner of Public Works
shall, from time to time, prepare a schedule of prices to be charged for the
refilling of openings and for the repairing of the various kinds of pavement
so open and the inspection of same. Should the applicant understate the
quantity of refilling to be done of the area of pavement to be opened or
removed or so perform the work that a larger quantity of refilling is to
be done or a larger area of pavement is displaced or injured than was
applied for and for which payment has been made, the Commissioner of
Public Works will collect the excess from said applicant and, in default
of payment for same, upon demand, will refuse further permits to such
applicant until such excess is paid. The inspector may, before the work
is commenced, compare the estimated quantities with the actual work
proposed and, unless an emergency exists, have any corrections made
before the street is opened. In case the applicant has deposited a larger
sum than the final estimate shows for such work, the Commissioner of
Public Works will give an order to such applicant for the refund by the City
Treasurer of the difference between the final estimate and the amount so
deposited.
§ 147-9. Sidewalk openings.
The Commissioner of Public Works shall have the power to issue a permit
to any applicant who desires to open the sidewalk of any street, avenue,
alley or public place in the City of Rensselaer for the purpose of making or
repairing water or sewer connections, or for any other purpose whatever,
provided that said applicant files the proper application therefor, as
provided in § 147-3, and furnishes the bond required in § 147-4. The
applicant to whom such permit is granted will be required to refill all
openings and replace and repair all sod, flag, brick, macadam or cement
sidewalk, curb, pavement or other work disturbed or injured by reason of
such opening in a manner satisfactory to the Commissioner of Public Works.
§ 147-10. Permits for defects found during City openings.
Where the City employees of the Department of Streets of the City of
Rensselaer make openings in the pavement, sidewalk or other public places
of the City and find defects in the water service or house drains for which
the owner of such water service or house drains is responsible, the plumber
employed to repair such defects shall make application and obtain permits
for such openings in the same manner as is herein provided for other
openings.

downpayment, is at a rate specified in § 924-a of the Real Property Tax
Law for each month or portion thereof until payment is received.

C:533
§ 155-39. Default.
§ 155-40. Notification.
K. If eligible owners fail to pay an installation pursuant to this installment
agreement by the end of the 15th calendar day after the payment due
date, a late charge of 5% of the overdue payment shall be added.

the program.
A. The eligible owner(s) shall be deemed to be in default of the installment
agreement upon:
(1) Nonpayment of any installment within 30 days from the payment
due date.

assessment which is levied subsequent to the signing of the
agreement by the tax district, and which is not paid prior to the
expiration of the warrant of the collecting officer.
(3) Default of the eligible owner(s) on another agreement made and
executed pursuant to this section.
B. If the eligible owner(s) defaults under this agreement, the City of
Rensselaer has the right to demand that the owner(s) pay the
outstanding balance in full, including interest and late charges. If the
eligible owner(s) fail to pay the outstanding balance in full, the City of
Rensselaer may continue the tax foreclosure proceedings.
A. Within 45 days after receiving the return of unpaid taxes or as soon
hereafter as it is practicable, the tax enforcing officer shall notify all
property owners who are potentially eligible to make installment
agreements on such delinquent taxes by first class mail.
B. The tax enforcing officer will be allowed to add $1 to the amount of the
tax lien for this mailing.
C. The failure of the tax enforcing officer to mail any notice or the failure
of the addressee to receive this notice shall not affect the validity of
taxes or interest.
D. The tax enforcing officer shall not be required to notify the eligible
property owner when an installment payment is due.

C:547
§ 159-21. Disputed fares.
In the event that there is a dispute between a taxicab operator and a
passenger with respect to a fare, the taxicab operator is permitted to

Amtrak taxicab concession (including any extension of the Amtrak
taxicab concession which is approved by the owner of the Amtrak
station or by such other person or entity with the authority to award

the restricted taxicab licenses is required by public convenience and
necessity. The number of restricted taxicab licenses will be determined
by the contract and may be changed.
B. The City Clerk shall issue said licenses upon proof that the applicant
has been awarded the Amtrak taxicab concession and the fee for the

§ 175-15. Purpose.
The purpose of this article is:
§ 175-16. Definitions.
For the purpose of this article, unless it is plainly evident from the context
that a different meaning is intended, certain terms used herein are defined
as follows:
AIR GAP SEPARATION  A physical break between a supply pipe and a
receiving vessel. The air gap shall be at least double the diameter of the
supply pipe, measured vertically above the tip rim of the vessel, and in no
case less than one inch.
APPROVED DOUBLE CHECK VALVE ASSEMBLY  An assembly of at least
two independently acting approved single check valves, including tightly
closing shutoff valves on each side of the check valve assembly and suitable
test cocks plus connections available for testing and watertightness of each
valve.
APPROVED REDUCED PRESSURE PRINCIPLE BACKFLOW PREVENTION
DEVICE (RPZ)  A device incorporating two or more single check valves
and an automatically operating differential relief valve located between the
two checks, two shutoff valves, and equipped with necessary appurtenances
for testing. The device shall operate to maintain the pressure in the zone
between the two check valves, less than the pressure on the public water
supply side of the device. At cessation of normal flow, the pressure between
the check valves shall be less than the supply pressure. In case of leakage
of either check valve, the differential relief valve shall operate to maintain
this reduced pressure by discharging to the atmosphere. When the inlet
pressure is two pounds per square inch or less, the relief valve shall open to
the atmosphere, thereby providing an air gap in the device. To be approved,
these devices must be readily accessible for maintenance and testing and
installed in a location where no part of the device will be submerged.
APPROVED SINGLE CHECK VALVE  A check valve that seats readily and
completely. It must be carefully machined to have free-moving parts and
assured watertightness. The face of the closure element and valve sear

seat tightly under all prevailing conditions of field use. Pins and bushings
shall be of bronze or other noncorrodible, nonsticking material, machined
for easy, dependable operation. The closure element (e.g., clapper) shall be
internally weighted or otherwise internally equipped to promote rapid and
positive closure in all sizes where this feature is obtainable.
APPROVED WATER SUPPLY  Any water supply approved by, or under the
public health supervision of, a public health agency of the State of New
York, County of Rensselaer, or the City of Rensselaer. In determining what
constitutes an approved water supply, the Department of Public Health of
the State of New York (herein called "State Health Department") shall have
the final judgment as to its safety and potability.
AUXILIARY WATER SUPPLY  Any water supply on or available to the
premises other than the City water supply.

§ 175-16 RENSSELAER CODE § 175-16
C:580
PREMISES  Integrated land area, including improvements thereon,
undivided by public thoroughfares or water distribution mains of the City
of Rensselaer and where all parts of the premises are operated under the
same management and for the same purpose.
PROTECTIVE DEVICE  Any of the following devices:
SERVICE CONNECTION  The terminal end of a service connection from
the City water supply at its point of delivery to the consumer. If a meter is
installed, "service connection" means the downstream end of the meter. No

§ 175-17. Inspection and provision of backflow prevention devices.
The City of Rensselaer Water Department may at any reasonable time
inspect any facility in order to determine if a hazard exists due to an actual
or potential cross-connection between the water system and any potential
source of contamination. In any case where the Commissioner deems such
hazard to exist, he may require the property owner to install an approved
backflow prevention device in every water service line to the facility for
which a potential hazard exists. Such devices shall be installed at or as
near the service connection as may be required by the Commissioner. Such
backflow preventer shall be designed and installed in accordance with all
regulations of Part 5, 1.31, of the New York State Sanitary Code, and
must be approved by the Commissioner and the New York State Health
Department prior to installations. All costs of installation and maintenance
shall be borne by the property owner.
§ 175-18. Where protection required; type of protection.
The following is a partial list of facilities that are especially likely to have
cross-connection hazards:
A. Air gap separation.
Approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device
(RPZ).
B.
C. Approved double check valve assembly.
D. Approved single check valve assembly.
A. Auxiliary water supply. Each service connection from the City water
supply for furnishing water to premises having an auxiliary water
§ 175-16 RENSSELAER CITY CHARTER § 175-18
C:581
supply shall be protected against backflow of water from the premises
in the City water supply.
(1) If the auxiliary water supply is handled in a separate piping system
with no known cross-connections, the City water supply shall be
protected by an approved double check valve assembly installed at
the service connection to the premises. When the auxiliary water
supply may be contaminated, the Commissioner may order the City
water supply protected by an air gap separation or an approved
RPZ installed at the service connection.
(2) If the auxiliary water supply is handled in a separate piping system
and cross-connections are known to exist between the City water
supply and the auxiliary water supply which cannot presently be
eliminated, the City water supply shall be protected by an approved
RPZ installed at the service connection to the premises. When the
auxiliary water supply may be contaminated, the Commissioner
may order the City water supply protected by an air gap separation
installed at the service connection.
B. Toxic or hazardous substances under pressure. At the service
connection to any premises on which any material dangerous to health
or toxic substance in toxic concentration is or may be handled under
pressure, the City water supply shall be protected by an air gap
separation. The air gap shall be located as close as practicable to the
water meter, and all piping between the water meter and receiving tank
shall be entirely visible. If these conditions cannot reasonably be met,
the City water supply shall be protected with an approved RPZ which is
acceptable to both the Commissioner and the County Health Officer.
C. Toxic or hazardous substances not under pressure. At the service
connection to any premises on which any material dangerous to health
or toxic substance in toxic concentration is not handled under pressure
but is otherwise handled in such a manner as to constitute a crossconnection,
the City water supply shall be protected by an approved
RPZ unless such cross-connection is abated to the satisfaction of the
Commissioner and approved by the County Health Officer.
D. Nonhazardous substances. At the service connection to any premises on
which a substance that would be objectionable (but not necessarily
hazardous to health) if introduced into the City water supply is handled
in such a manner as to constitute a cross-connection, the City water
supply shall be protected by an approved double check valve assembly.
E. Sewage and storm drain treatment plants and pumping stations. At the
service connection to any sewage treatment plant or sewage pumping
station, the City water supply shall be protected by an air gap
separation. The air gap shall be located as close as practicable to the
service connection, and all piping between the service connection and
receiving tank shall be entirely visible. If these conditions cannot be
reasonably met, the City water supply shall be protected with an
§ 175-18 RENSSELAER CODE § 175-18
C:582
approved RPZ, provided this alternative is acceptable to both the
Commissioner and the County Health Officer. A final decision in this
matter shall be made by the State Health Department.
F. Fire systems. At the service connection to any premises in which a fire
protection system is installed, the City water supply shall be protected
based on the water source and arrangement of supplies in accordance
with the following classifications:
(1) Class 1.
(a) Direct connection from public water mains only; no pumps,
tanks or reservoirs; no physical connections from auxiliary
water supplies; no antifreeze or other additives of any kind; all

(2) General design concepts. Projects should incorporate the following
general design concepts to the extent practicable.
(a) Sustainability.
[1] New building construction should use green building
technologies for mechanical systems, energy needs and
construction materials.
[2] The adaptive reuse of existing and historic building stock
is strongly encouraged as a sustainable development
practice.
[3] The adaptive reuse of historic buildings should use green
building technologies for mechanical systems, energy
needs and construction materials.
[4] Site development methods that conserve resources and
reduce environmental impacts are strongly encouraged.
[5] Emphasis should be placed on the use of and development
of public transportation and pedestrian systems, and the
reduction of automobile use wherever possible.

§ 179-12 RENSSELAER CODE § 179-12
C:626
[1] A full mix of uses, as permitted in the district, should be
encouraged to promote a pedestrian-friendly streetscape
environment.
[2] Residential uses should be considered in conjunction with
commercial activities to foster an active streetscape
environment, enhance the viability of businesses and
reduce traffic flows.
[3] Mixed-use development and buildings should be
promoted, with active uses, such as shops, restaurants,
and gallery spaces occupying the street level and offices
and residential units occupying upper stories.
(c) Pedestrian environment.

street presence and encourage pedestrian activity.
Streetscape improvements should include benches, bus
shelters, trash receptacles, recycling receptacles, planting
containers, lighting, wayfinding signage, and
informational kiosks.

City's moderately scaled urban form. Scale, massing and
dominant architectural elements should contribute to the
overall character of the downtown.
[2] Projects should complement the City's heritage by
preserving and incorporating dominant design elements
and characteristics that define neighborhood areas.
[3] Public buildings, structure, and spaces should be designed
and constructed to the highest standards in order to
reflect community values, inspire residents and visitors,
foster civic pride, and serve as models to future
development.
[4] Individual building elements, details, and materials should
be unified so that all components appear integral to the
whole.
§ 179-12 RENSSELAER CITY CHARTER § 179-12
C:627

build-out requirements shall be reduced to 67%, or twothirds
of the total lot frontage.
(b) Building orientation and facades.
[1] The ground floor of buildings should be encouraged to
contain public or semipublic uses, such as retail,
restaurants, or entertainment, and should have direct
entry from the street.

approach to design that supports and responds to the
surrounding urban, built, and natural environment.
(b) Historic preservation.
[1] The first option for existing historic buildings should be
their retention, restoration, and adaptive reuse.
[2] Demolition of a historic building in favor of new
construction shall only be permitted when the reuse is
determined to be unfeasible due to cost or building
condition.
[3] When building preservation is deemed impossible, every
effort should be made to retain historic facades.
[a] When a building facade is preserved, the new building
shall be designed and constructed in a manner that is
sympathetic to existing materials, organization, and
design composition.
[b] Any upward expansion of the new building should be
set back from the historic facade.
[4] Features that contribute to a historic building's
architectural character, such as fanlights, door hardware,

not subject to off-street parking requirements. In addition, all uses
permitted in this district are subject to the additional parking and
loading requirements set forth in § 179-55 of this chapter.
J. Signs. Please refer to Article IV.
A. Purpose and intent. The purpose of the Planned Development District is
to provide for the creation of a flexible zoning district to accommodate
major new development or redevelopment efforts within the City of
Rensselaer. This district provides the mechanisms necessary to ensure
compatibility among varied land uses, promote innovative and efficient
land uses, and encourage quality site planning and design practices.
The district intends to encourage a diversity of uses in a unified plan
while ensuring adequate standards relating to public health, safety and
general welfare of the public.
B. Establishment of a PDD. A Planned Development District (PDD) may be
established within any area of the City. Such PDD may be established
only if the Planning Commission and the Common Council find that the
objectives and provisions of this chapter are satisfied, and the proposed
development is full consistent with the spirit and intent of the adopted
City Comprehensive Plan.
C. Procedure. The procedure for submitting an application and receiving
approval of a PDD shall be as follows:
(1) Pre-filing conference. The applicant or representative shall meet
with the Director of Planning and Development to informally
discuss the proposed project and application procedure prior to any
formal submission.
(2) Preliminary site plan submission requirements. The owner shall
submit a preliminary site plan that shall consist of the following:
(a) Survey of the property, showing existing features of the
property including contours, buildings, structures, trees over
four inches in diameter, streets, utility easements, rights-ofway
and adjacent land uses.
(b) Proposed site plan showing building locations, occupancy and
land use areas, including any subdivision intended within the
district.
(c) Proposed traffic circulation, parking areas, pedestrian walks
and landscaping.
§ 179-20 RENSSELAER CITY CHARTER § 179-22
C:657
(d) Proposed construction sequence for buildings, parking areas
and landscaped areas.
(e) Proposed public utilities plan, including water supply,
sewerage and stormwater drainage.
(3) Preliminary site plan procedure. After informal agreement on the
suitability of the proposed project and its conformance with the
City Comprehensive Plan, the application shall submit four copies
of a preliminary site plan to the City of Rensselaer Planning
Commission for review at least 10 days prior to its regular meeting.
The Planning Commission shall prepare recommendations to the
applicant with regard to the preliminary site plan. The applicant
shall proceed in either of the following manners, as determined
appropriate by the Planning Commission.
(a) Conformance with underlying zoning district. If the proposed
development project consists of uses and densities already
permitted in the applicable zoning district, the Planning
Commission approval authorizes the applicant to prepare and
submit a final plat without the need for approval by the
Common Council of a zoning amendment. This type of
coordinated development may be used for cluster development
or design variations where building bulk, spacing, and open
space are adjusted with flexibility to the land while the use and
density limitations of the original zoning district are strictly
observed. The Planning Commission has authority to approve
this type of design adjustment under § 37 of General City Law.
(b) Nonconformance with underlying zoning district. If the
proposed development project, proposed uses, or overall
densities are not permitted in the applicable zoning district,
the amendment procedure specified in Article VIII of this
chapter shall be followed. Under such circumstances, the
Planning Commission shall transmit the application to the
Common Council for review. If the Common Council
determines the application is warranted, the Common Council
shall conduct a public hearing, as required by Article VIII to
consider a zoning map amendment to redesignate the area a
PDD. The PDD shall be governed by the specific preliminary
site plan approved by the Planning Commission, or as
specifically amended by the Common Council as condition of
its approval. If the amendment is approved, the applicant may
proceed to the final site plan. The approved preliminary site
plan shall be binding on final site plans and future development
of the project, unless amended by the same procedure.
(4) Final site plan submission requirements. The final site plan shall
conform fully with the use, density and basic design expressed by
the approved preliminary site plan. Such approved site plan shall
become part of this chapter and shall be maintained in the
§ 179-22 RENSSELAER CODE § 179-22
C:658
permanent files of both the City Clerk and the Director of Planning
and Development. The final site plan shall be filed with the City
Planning Commission in accordance with the procedures and
requirements identified in Article IV and Article VII of this chapter.
Furthermore, the final site plan shall include:
(a) Site plan showing proposed building locations and land use
areas.
(b) Traffic circulation, required parking and loading areas and
pedestrian walks.
(c) Landscaping plan, including site grading and landscape
planting and structures.
(d) Preliminary drawings of buildings to be constructed in the
current phase including floor plans, exterior elevations and
sections.
(e) Final engineering plans, including street improvements,
drainage system and public utility extension.
(f) Engineering feasibility studies for the solution of anticipated
problems that may arise due to the proposed development, as
required by the City Engineer.
(g) Offers of cession and proposed restrictive covenants.
(h) Construction sequence and time schedule for completion of
each phase for buildings, parking spaces and landscaped
areas, as applicable.
(i) Complete documentation of means for the continual
maintenance of common open space and buildings.
(j) Completed stormwater prevention pollution plan (SPPP).
(5) Final site plan procedure.
(a) Final site plan approval. If required, a public hearing shall be
held within 45 days of its submission in final form. The
Planning Commission shall approve, conditionally approve
with or without modifications, or reject the final site plan
within 45 calendar days of submission or public hearing, as
applicable. If modifications are required, the applicant shall
submit a modified final site plan. In the case of rejection, the
applicant shall either resubmit for preliminary site plan
approval, or waive rights or further consideration, thus
terminating the proposal.
(b) Building permits and filing requirements. A copy of the
approved final site plan shall be transmitted to the Building
and Zoning Administrator who shall be authorized to issue
§ 179-22 RENSSELAER CITY CHARTER § 179-22
C:659
§ 179-23. Historic Overlay District.
building permits and/or certificate of occupancy for approved
construction and uses in strict accordance with the approval
construction and uses in strict accordance with the approved
final site plan. The applicant shall also file a copy of the final
site plan in the office of the Rensselaer County Clerk within 60
calendar days of the approval, as may be required.
(c) Staging. Final site plans may be submitted for Planning
Commission approval in stages and do not have to be
submitted to cover the entire project development at any one
time. Staged final site plans shall be submitted and building
permits applied for according to a general time schedule
agreed upon by the Planning Commission during the
preliminary site plan approval process.
D. Uses permitted. Uses within an area designated as a PDD shall be
determined by the provisions of this section and the approved plan for
the proposed project. In particular:
(1) Residential dwelling units, private garages, storage spaces,
recreational and community facilities may be permitted, as
appropriate, within the PDD.
(2) Commercial, services, and nonresidential accessory uses may be
permitted where such uses are scaled to serve the residents of the
PDD and the surrounding neighborhoods, as necessary.
(3) Commercial, service, industrial and other nonresidential uses may
be permitted as principal uses, as identified through market
analysis, and when such uses are integral to and supportive of the
PDD and surrounding neighborhoods in terms of work force, design
and character, and when consistent with the City Master Plan.
E. Development area. The minimum development area to qualify for a PDD
shall be five contiguous acres of land.
F. Off-street parking. Off-street parking shall conform to the standards of
the most appropriate zoning designation or designations. The minimum
number of spaces may be reduced if adequate parking is demonstrated
or if it can be demonstrated that the PDD enables lesser parking
requirements.
A. Purpose and intent. The purpose of the Historic Overlay District (HOD)
is to preserve, maintain, and enhance the integrity of designated areas
within the City that are historically significant or contain significant
historic structures. The Historic Overlay District further:
(1) Provides a process for reviewing proposed alterations and
restorations of historically significant structures;
§ 179-22 RENSSELAER CODE § 179-23
C:660
(2) Outlines a process for ensuring new development is consistent with
the character of established historic districts and areas;
(3) Identifies a means to deter demolition, inappropriate alterations,
and neglect of historic or architecturally significant sites; and
(4) Fosters civic and community pride in local history and architectural
beauty represented in the City's historic neighborhoods and
buildings.
B. Permitted uses. All permitted and special permitted uses in the base
zoning district in which the Historic Overlay District is defined are
allowed.
C. Boundaries. The following areas are hereby incorporated into the
Historic Overlay District:
(1) Fort Crailo Neighborhood is bounded by the Hudson River to the
west, Route 20 to the north and east, and Rensselaer Avenue to the
south.
(2) Bath Neighborhood is bounded by the Hudson River to the west,
Washington Avenue to the north, Broadway to the east, and Tracy
Street to the south.
D. Required approvals. Prior to any new construction, demolition,
addition, or modification to the exterior of an existing structure located
in the Historic Overlay District, the project must be reviewed and
approved by the Planning Commission. Upon approval, the Planning
Commission will issue a certificate of appropriateness. No demolition or
building permit shall be issued until a certificate of appropriateness is
granted. The following types of projects in Historic Overlay Districts
require review and approval by the Planning Commission:
(1) Construction of a new building or accessory building.
(2) Any addition or alteration of a building which increases the square
footage of the building or substantially alters its height, size,
contour, or general form.
(3) Any change or alteration of the exterior architectural style or color
of design elements, including removal or redesign of porches,
dormers, siding, material, chimneys, structural elements, awnings,
or columns. Sole exception shall be the painting of existing exterior
elements, whereby Planning Staff shall have the power to issue a
Certificate of Appropriateness for the painting of said elements
using historic colors approved by the Planning Department.
[Amended 9-3-2014 by L.L. No. 6-2014]
(4) Addition to or removal of one or more stories or alteration of a roof
line.

C:661
(5) Landscaping which involves significant changes to grades,
including walls or fences more than three feet in height.
(6) Any other action deemed by the Planning Commission to have a
substantial effect on the character of the historic district.
E. Procedures for demolition, addition or modification.
(1) Pre-filing conference. The applicant or representative shall meet
with the Director of Planning and Development to informally
discuss the proposed project and application procedure prior to any
formal submission.
(2) Submission requirements. Three copies of the following must be
submitted to the Planning Commission for review and approval in
association with the granting of a certificate of appropriateness.
(a) Plans showing all historic elements associated with site or

apply to any application for a demolition permit for a structure that is
located in a Historic Overlay District.
(1) Withholding of approval. If the Planning Commission determines
the building or structure proposed for demolition has historic,
architectural, or cultural value, the Commission may withhold
approval of demolition for a period not to exceed 180 days, from the
date of Commission action.
(2) Purpose. The delay shall be for the purpose of providing time to
explore alternatives to demolition. The Planning Commission may
§ 179-23 RENSSELAER CODE § 179-23
C:662
direct the Director of Planning and Development to consult with
historic preservation organizations, civic groups, public agencies
and interested citizens; make recommendations for acquisition of
property by a public or private body; explore the possibility of
relocating structure; or take other reasonable efforts aimed at
preserving the structure.
(3) Demolition by neglect. The City shall require maintenance and
repair of all structures and buildings within the Historic Overlay
District to stop demolition by neglect which can jeopardize the
historic character of the neighborhood and create hazardous and
life-threatening conditions. To this end, all buildings and structures
shall be preserved against decay and deterioration to the extent
that such decay or deterioration may result in irreparable
deterioration of any exterior feature or produce a detrimental
effect upon the character of the district.
G. Review standards. Before any exterior improvements, as defined by
§ 179-23D, are made to any public or private property or public place
within a Historic Overlay District, the project must be reviewed and
approved by the Planning Commission. The following review standards
shall be considered by the Planning Commission when making a
determination on an application.
(1) General guidelines.
(a) Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible
use for a property that requires minimal alteration.
(b) The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building,
structure, or site shall not be destroyed or removed.
(c) General design, character, and scale of proposed alterations
and additions should be compatible with building and
surrounding Historic Overlay District.
(d) All buildings, structures, and sites shall be recognized as
products of their own time. Alterations that have no historical
basis and seek to create an earlier appearance shall be
discouraged.
(e) Violent contrasts of materials and colors, spectacular effects,
intense colors, or incongruity in details which result in a
disturbed appearance not consistent with the character of the
historic district shall be deemed inappropriate.
(2) Materials.
(a) The removal or alteration of any historic material or distinctive
architectural feature shall be avoided when possible.
(b) The replacement of existing materials, such as roofing, shall be
with in-kind materials to the extent practicable. Substitute
§ 179-23 RENSSELAER CITY CHARTER § 179-23
C:663
materials should be compatible with the remaining historic
context of building or structure. Replacement materials shall
not include vinyl or aluminum.
(c) The removal of wood features, such as clapboards, siding, and
decorative trim, which help to convey a building's historic
character shall be avoided when possible.
(d) Vinyl and aluminum siding shall not be considered an
appropriate preservation treatment.
(3) Architectural features.
(a) Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather
than replaced, wherever possible. In the event replacement is
necessary, the new material should match the material being
replaced in composition, design, texture, and other visual
qualities.
(b) Building style, period of construction, materials, and existing
setting shall be considered when selecting an appropriate
paint color.
(c) Repair or replacement of missing architectural features should
be based on accurate duplication of features, substantiated by
historic, physical, or pictorial evidence, rather than on
conjectural designs.
(d) Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled
craftsmanship that characterize a building, structure, or site
shall be treated with sensitivity.
(e) The number, size, location, or shape of original windows visible
from the public right-of-way should not be altered. Exterior
storm windows should duplicate the shape of the original
window.
(f) When the repair of materials and limited replacement of
deteriorated or missing parts is feasible, original windows
should not be replaced.
(4) Maintenance.
(a) The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the
gentlest means possible. Sandblasting, high-pressure water
washing and other cleaning methods that will damage the
historic building material should not be undertaken.
(b) Replace only those portions of a building that are deteriorated.
(5) Additions.
§ 179-23 RENSSELAER CODE § 179-23
C:664
(a) Additions shall be designed so there are subtle distinguishing
characteristics between the historic portion and new
alteration.
(b) Additions should never appear as old, or older, than the
original building.
(c) Rooftop additions are discouraged. If necessary, they must be
set back from the main facade so as to not be visible from the
public right-of-way.
(d) Full floor additions to the top of buildings shall be prohibited.
(e) Additions should not exceed 50% of the square footage of the
existing historic structure.
(f) The scale, form, and proportions of the existing structure
should be maintained in the addition, including roof shape,
building envelope, materials, and decorative elements.
(g) Additions should not be made to the front facade of a building.
(6) New construction.
(a) Generally, historic structures or landscapes shall not be
demolished to make room for a new construction project.
(b) Contemporary design for new construction shall not be
discouraged when it does not destroy significant historical,
architectural, or cultural material.
(c) Infill construction should be designed to be compatible with
the average height, massing, and width of surrounding
buildings. The rhythm and proportions of new facades should
reflect the characteristic rhythm of existing surrounding
buildings.
(d) Materials should be sympathetic to surrounding historic
buildings and should be a complementary color, texture, and
level of craftsmanship. Traditional materials, such as wood,
brick, and stone, are preferred.
(e) New construction should have a floor-to-floor height that is
within 10% of adjacent historic construction when the floor-tofloor
height is a consistent and character-defining feature.
(f) No historic resource shall be harmed by the construction of
new roadways or utility repairs associated with a new
construction project.
(g) New construction should provide barrier-free access under the
provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Solutions
should be compatible within the historic context.
§ 179-23 RENSSELAER CITY CHARTER § 179-23
C:665
(h) Setbacks for new construction should be within 10% of
neighboring buildings, as allowed within the underlying zoning
district.
(7) Landscaping and site features.
(a) Landscaping should be appropriate to the scale and unique
features of the Historic Overlay District.
(b) Existing characteristic features, such as retaining walls, stairs,
landscape materials, paving materials, fencing and walkways
that reflect the history and development patterns of the
neighborhood should be retained.
(c) Chain link fencing and concrete block walls should not be
installed in locations visible from the public right-of-way.
(d) Restore and reuse original landscaping materials to the extent
practicable.
(e) Preserve large mature trees and shrubs to the extent
practicable.
(8) Signage and awnings.
(a) All signage must comply with regulations identified in Article
IV.
(b) Sign sizes should be minimal to avoid obscuring architectural
details and to avoid clutter. Required signage should be kept
simple and easy to read and should reflect the character of the
business and building.

ARTICLE III
Regulations Applicable to All Zoning Districts
§ 179-24. Special use permits.
A. Purpose and intent. The purpose of this section is to provide greater
flexibility in the placement of certain kinds of uses when, because of
their unique characteristics, these uses are such that they can be
compatible with and complementary to the uses now permitted in the
zone, provided that appropriate safeguards are imposed. Additionally,
this section intends to provide the framework for adequate review and
tighter control of certain uses which have a marked effect on the
surrounding area due to their unusual design, operational
characteristics, or the amount of traffic they generate.
B. Authorization to grant or deny special uses. The special uses listed in
this chapter may be permitted, enlarged, or otherwise altered upon
authorization by the Planning Commission in accordance with the
standards and procedures set forth in this section and such additional
standards as may be set forth for such special uses elsewhere in this
chapter. The zoning variance procedure before the Zoning Board of
Appeals shall not be used to acquire authorization to enlarge, modify or
otherwise alter a special use or to amend a special use permit. Such
authorization may be granted by the Planning Commission, only. In
permitting a special use or the modification of a special use, the
Planning Commission may impose, in addition to those standards and
requirements expressly specified by the chapter, any additional
conditions the Planning Commission considers necessary to protect the
best interests of the surrounding properties or the City of Rensselaer as
a whole. These conditions include, but are not limited to, controlling the
location and number of vehicle access points, limiting the number, size
and location of signs, and required diking, fencing, screening,
landscaping or other facilities to protect adjacent or nearby property. In
the case of uses existing prior to the effective date of this chapter and
classed in this chapter as special use, any change in use, lot area or an
alteration of structure shall conform with the requirements dealing
with special uses.
C. General standards. The following general standards apply to all special
permit uses:
(1) The use shall be so designed, located and operated to ensure
protection of the public health, safety and welfare.
(2) The use shall not cause substantial injury to the economic value of
other property in the neighborhood where it is to be located.
(3) The use shall be compatible with other adjoining development and
the character of the zoning district where it is to be located.
(4) Adequate landscaping and screening shall be fully provided.
§ 179-24 RENSSELAER CITY CHARTER § 179-24
C:669
(5) Adequate off-street parking and loading shall be provided, and
ingress and egress shall be designed to cause minimum
interference with traffic on abutting streets.
(6) The use shall conform with all applicable regulations governing the
zoning district where it is to be located.

imposed on the special use permit by the particular provision
of this article authorizing the special use.

B. Registration. No person, firm, corporation or other entity shall lease,
rent, maintain, operate, use, or allow to be operated or used any
business or establishment, any part thereof which contains an adult
use, without first complying with the provisions of this section as set
forth below.
(1) In addition to any and all other necessary licenses and permits, no
form of adult use shall be allowed to operate, nor allowed to
continue to operate, until a certificate of registration is filed with
the City Clerk containing the information listed below.
C. Location.
(1) An adult use may not be operated within 1,000 feet of the following
uses:
(a) A church, synagogue or regular place of worship;

use or on the same lot or parcel of land.
(3) An adult use may not be operated in the same building, structure or
portion thereof containing another adult use.
(4) All adult uses shall be conducted in an enclosed building.
Regardless of location or distance, no one who is passing by an
enclosed building having a use governed by this section shall be
able to visually see any specified anatomical area or any specified
sexual activity by virtue of any display which depicts or shows said
area or activity. This requirement shall apply to any display
decoration, sign, window or other opening.
D. Inspections. All adult use establishments shall be subject to periodic
inspections as described further below.
(1) Prior to the commencement of any adult use business or upon any
transfer of ownership or control, the premises must be inspected
and found to be in compliance with all laws, ordinances, rules and
regulations applicable to the use and occupancy for any adult use
business specified herein.
(2) All code enforcement officials shall complete their certification that
the premise is in compliance or not in compliance within 20 days of
the inspection of the premises by such officials.

operator or agent of the owner and/or operator shall permit any
representative of the City Police Department, Rensselaer County
Sheriff's Office, New York State Police, County or State Health
Department, City Code Enforcement officials, or any other City,
county or state departments or agencies that have permitting
authority regarding the use and/or premises to inspect the
premises of an adult business for the purpose of insuring
compliance with this section at any time it is occupied or open for
business.
E. Nonconforming adult uses. Any adult use business lawfully operating
on the effective date of this section that is in violation of the location or
structural configuration requirements of this section shall be deemed a
nonconforming use. The continuation of the same use of substantially
the same character and intensity shall be allowed. The nonconforming
use shall be permitted to continue for a period not to exceed two years,
unless sooner terminated for any reason or voluntarily discontinued for
a period of 30 days or more. Such nonconforming uses shall not be
increased, enlarged, extended, or altered except that the use may be
changed to a conforming use. If two or more sexually oriented
businesses are within 500 feet of one another and otherwise in a
permissible location, the adult use business, which was first established
and continually operating at a particular location is the conforming use
and the later-established business(es) is nonconforming.
F. Violations. It shall be deemed a violation if the owner and/or operator,
an employee of the owner and/or operator or an agent of the owner and/
or operator has:

along the side or rear lot line, subject to additional regulations specified
in § 179-52.
C. Unclosed steps or stairways providing access to the first story of a
building may extend into any required setbacks. Decks and porches
shall not be permitted to extend into required setbacks.
A. Purpose. The purposes of buffers where required in this chapter are to:
maintain and protect property values; assure an acceptable degree of
transition to reduce potential adverse incompatibility between abutting
and nearby uses; provide appropriate barriers and relief from traffic,
noise, heat, glare and the spread of dust and debris; enhance the visual
and aesthetic appearance of the community.
B. Standards. Whenever a buffer is required by this chapter, it shall meet
the following standards. It shall:
§ 179-41 RENSSELAER CODE § 179-45
C:698
(1) Provide a visual barrier.
(2) Block the glare of lights.
(3) Reduce noise produced on the site to a level no higher than that
produced on conforming residential sites in the adjacent residential
neighborhood.
(4) Serve as a protective barrier by blocking physical passage to the
site, unless specific points of passage are desired.
(5) Prevent the passage of air pollution, dust and litter produced on the
site.

feet in height shall be required where lights from vehicles or
overhead illumination located within the off-street parking area
may shine directly into windows of adjacent residential buildings. A
solid fencing may be provided not less than four feet nor more than
six feet in height alongside any rear lot lines, and subject to the
approval of the Building and Zoning Administrator, in lieu of screen
planting. If the designed fence or screen planting does not properly
screen the overhead illumination from adjacent residential
buildings, then the Building and Zoning Administrator may
increase the height requirements of the fence or evergreen
screening.
(5) Approval procedure. Buffer designs shall be submitted by the
applicant and reviewed in conjunction with the building permit
application review procedure.
(6) Construction postponement. Construction of required buffers may
be delayed for up to 18 months upon approval by the Building and
Zoning Administrator when the need for the buffer is unclear.

yard, and any other yards shall be a side yard.
§ 179-49. Creation of new lot.
When a new lot is formed so as to include within its boundaries any part of
a former lot on which there is an existing building or use, the subdivision
must be carried out in such a manner as will not infringe upon any of the
provisions of this chapter, either with respect to any existing structures or
use or any proposed structures or use.
§ 179-50. Conversions.
A. Purpose. It is the intent to provide, where suitable, for conversion of
preexisting single-family dwellings which, because of oversize or other
condition, cannot reasonably be continued. In such cases, a special
permit may be granted for conversion of the existing structure to
accommodate additional families in districts where multifamily and
two-family housing are permitted either by right or by special use
permit.
B. Criteria. A special permit may be granted for the conversion of a singlefamily
dwelling to a two-family or multifamily dwelling provided that
the following are complied with:
(1) No extension to the principal structure shall be made or additional
exterior entrances created except as may be necessary for a
secondary egress in the form of an outside stairway. No

and loading spaces.
§ 179-54 RENSSELAER CITY CHARTER § 179-55
C:703
B. Applicability.
(1) In all districts, every industrial, business, recreational, residential
or other use shall provide, at the time of any change of use or when
any building or structure is erected, enlarged or increased in
capacity in the City, off-street parking for motor vehicles in
accordance with the requirements of this and other applicable
sections of these regulations, especially site plan review in
accordance with Article VII, and the Bulk and Use Tables, provided
in § 179-7 through § 179-21.
(2) Loading spaces shall be provided and maintained on the same
premises with every building or structure erected, occupied,

of worship), if fixed seating is not the primary arrangement, then
one space per 100 square feet shall be provided.
(4) In the case of a combination of uses, the total requirements for offstreet
auto parking spaces shall be the sum of the requirements for
the various uses, unless it can be proven that staggered hours of
use and/or shift employment would permit modification. Whenever
a major fraction of a space is required, a full space shall be
provided.
(5) If spaces are provided on the basis of employees or participants,
the number on the maximum shift or peak period shall be used.
(6) Unless otherwise specified, off-street parking standards are based
on square feet of all floor area, including the area of any accessory
buildings.
E. Dimensions of off-street automobile parking spaces. Off-street
automobile parking spaces shall be no smaller than nine feet by 18 feet.
Every such space shall have direct and usable driveway access to a
street or alley with minimum maneuver area between spaces as follows:

F. Shared parking. The Planning Commission encourages parking lots for
different structures or uses or for mixed-uses to be shared in any zoning
district. At the applicant's request, shared parking may be provided
subject to the following provisions:
(1) A reciprocal written agreement has been executed by all parties
concerned that assures the perpetual join use of such common
parking. A copy of this written agreement must be submitted to and
accepted by the Planning Commission, and may be forwarded to
legal counsel for review.
(2) The Planning Commission may require the applicant to provide a
parking study with information deemed necessary to its decisionmaking
on a shared parking agreement. This information may
include, but is not limited to:
(a) The type and hours of operation and parking demand for each
use;
(b) A site plan displaying shared use spaces in the lot and walking
distance to the uses sharing the lot;
(c) A description of the character of land use and parking patterns
of adjacent land uses; and
(d) An estimate of anticipated turnover in parking space use over
the course of 12 to 24 hours at the site.
(3) Parking spaces to be shared must not be reserved for individuals or
groups on a twenty-four-hour basis.
(4) Uses sharing a parking facility do not need to be contained on the
same lot, but each use shall be a maximum of 500 feet from the
closest parking space in the lot providing the shared spaces. A
waiver of the maximum allowable distance between the use and
associated shared parking may be approved by the Commission
with written justification and supporting information provided by
the applicant.
§ 179-55 RENSSELAER CITY CHARTER § 179-55
C:707
§ 179-56. Development within Flood Fringe.
(5) Uses sharing a parking facility shall provide for safe, convenient
walking between uses and parking, including safe, well marked
pedestrian crossings, signage and adequate lighting.
(6) If the conditions for shared parking become null and void and the
shared parking arrangement is discontinued, this will constitute a
violation of zoning regulations for any use approved expressly with
shared parking. The applicant must then provide written
notification of the change to the Zoning Enforcement Officer and,
within 60 days of that notice, provide a remedy satisfactory to the
Commission to provide adequate parking.
(7) Where shared parking is provided among a mix of land uses, the
Commission may allow the following at the applicant's request:
(a) Up to 30% of the parking spaces required for the predominant
use on site may be shared with other uses operating during the
same time of day and days of the week. The predominant use is
considered to be that which requires the most parking of those
sharing the parking facilities.
(b) Up to 75% of the parking spaces required for primarily evening
uses (i.e., theaters, bowling alleys, nightclubs) may be shared
with those uses that occur primarily during the day (i.e., banks
and offices).
(c) Up to 75% of the parking spaces required for uses in operation
primarily during the weekend (i.e., churches) may be shared
with uses predominantly in operation on weekdays (i.e.,
medical offices and banks).
G. Nonconforming parking and loading. No building, lot alterations, or
change of use shall be allowed which would increase the degree of
nonconformity with the off-street parking and loading regulations of
this chapter.
A. Purpose and intent. These regulations are intended to regulate and
restrict land use in areas within the City of Rensselaer, which may be
subject to severe periodic inundation in such a manner as to:
(1) Protect life and prevent or minimize property damage;
(2) Reduce public costs for flood control;
(3) Conserve the natural state of watercourses and watersheds, and
minimize the damaging effects which development has on drainage
conditions, pollution of streams and other environmental impacts
on associated water sources; and
(4) Comply with federal and state laws and regulations that address
the need for floodplain management and protection;
§ 179-55 RENSSELAER CODE § 179-56
C:708
B. Administration. The source of delineation of the Flood Fringe Boundary
shall be the one-hundred-year floodplain boundary, as determined by
the Flood Insurance Rate Map, developed by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA).
C. Proposed use.
(1) All uses within the flood fringe shall be reviewed for compliance
with standards specified herein, as certified by a registered
architect or licensed professional engineer.
(2) No use shall be permitted, including fill, dredging or excavating
activity unless the applicant has demonstrated that the proposed
use, in combination with all other existing and anticipated uses,
will not raise the water level of the one-hundred-year flood more
than one foot at any point.
D. Design. All structures shall be designed and anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse or lateral movement due to floodwater related forces.
E. Construction. Construction within the Flood Fringe is subject to the
following regulations:
(1) All construction materials and utility equipment used shall be
resistant to flood damage.
(2) Construction practices and methods shall be employed which
minimize potential flood damage.
(3) All new residential construction or substantial improvements to
residential structures shall have the lowest floor (including the
basement) elevated to two feet or above the base one-hundred-year
flood level.
(4) All new nonresidential construction or substantial improvements to
such nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor
(including basement) elevated to two feet or above the base onehundred-
year flood level or, as an alternate, be floodproofed up to
that same water level, including attendant utility and sanitary
facilities.
F. Infrastructure and drainage. Infrastructure and drainage development,
alterations or improvements are permitted subject to the following
standards:
(1) All public utilities and facilities shall be located and constructed to
minimize or eliminate potential flood damage.
(2) All water supply and sewage disposal systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate floodwater infiltration of discharges into the
floodwaters.
§ 179-56 RENSSELAER CITY CHARTER § 179-56
C:709
§ 179-57. Stormwater regulations.
§ 179-58. Miscellaneous supplementary regulations.
The purpose of these additional regulations is to improve consistency
between the Comprehensive Plan's vision and goals, and policy and
development regulations while meeting other City interests.
(3) Adequate drainage shall be provided to reduce exposure to flood
hazards.
G. Best management practices. Stormwater runoff related to development
may adversely impact public and private property, surface water
supplies, groundwater resources, drinking water, aquatic and nonaquatic
wildlife habitats, fish and other aquatic life, property values and
potential for future uses of land and water. To the extent practicable,
best management practices should be utilized during construction
activities, low-impact development practices employed during post
construction, and periodic inspections before, during and after
construction to ensure that stormwater management methods are
effective.
A. Purpose and intent. The purpose of the City of Rensselaer's stormwater
regulations is to establish minimum stormwater management

of this section may be established and maintained if their operation
is approved by the Planning Commission as being in conformance
with the standards and regulations limiting dangerous and
objectionable elements, such as dust, smoke, odor, fumes, noise or
vibration. In approving the site plan, the Planning Commission
shall decide whether the proposed use will conform to these
applicable performance standards or any additional performance
standards required by state or federal laws or which are generally
recognized performance standards for a given industry.
(2) Use subject to the performance standards procedures.
(a) All uses subject to site plan review must comply with these
performance standards.
§ 179-58 RENSSELAER CITY CHARTER § 179-59
C:711
(b) In addition, if the Building and Zoning Administrator has
reasonable grounds to believe that any other existing or
proposed use violates any of the performance standards, such
proposed use may be required to certify compliance with these
performance standards or such existing use may be cited for
violation of these regulations.
(3) Performance standards procedures.
(a) The Building and Zoning Administrator as part of the sketch
plan conference shall tentatively identify whether a proposed
use will be required to certify compliance with any of the
performance standards listed in this section. Certification may
require signing a written statement or presentation of
construction detail and a description of the specifications for
the mechanisms and techniques to be used in restricting the
emissions of any dangerous and objectionable elements. The
applicant shall also file with such plans and specifications an
affidavit acknowledging understanding and stating agreement
to conform to the same at all times. Any information which is
designated by the applicant as a trade secret and submitted
herewith will be treated as confidential under provisions of the
New York State Freedom of Information Law. During the
course of site plan review, the Planning Commission will
determine if the applicant's proposal falls within the
performance standards based upon information provided by
the applicant. The Building and Zoning Administrator can
require the applicant to show that the construction detail and a
description of the specifications for the mechanisms and
techniques is in compliance with the standards set forth below.
[1] Vibration.
[a] No vibration shall be produced which is transmitted
through the ground and is discernible without the aid
of instruments at or beyond the lot lines, nor shall any
vibrations produced exceed 0.002g peak at up to a
frequency of 50 cycles per second, measured at or
beyond the lot lines using either seismic or electronic
vibration measuring equipment.
[b] Vibrations occurring at higher than a frequency of 50
cycles per second or a periodic vibration shall not
induce accelerations exceeding 0.001 g. single
impulse periodic vibrations occurring at an average
interval greater than five minutes shall not induce
accelerations exceeding 0.01 g.

[b] Where any use adjoins a residential or mixed-use
district at any point at the district boundary, the
maximum permitted decibel levels in all octave bands
shall be reduced by six decibels from the maximum
levels set forth in Table I.
[3] Smoke. The density emission of smoke or any other
discharge into the atmosphere during normal operations
shall not exceed visible gray smoke of a shade equal to or
darker than No. 2 on the standard Ringelmann Chart. (A
Ringelmann Chart is a chart published by the United
States Bureau of Mines, which shows graduated shades of
gray for use in estimating the light-obscuring capacity of
smoke). These provisions applicable to visible gray smoke
shall also apply to visible smoke of a different color but
with an apparent equivalent capacity.
[4] Odor. No emission shall be permitted of odorous gases or
other odorous matter in such quantities as to be readily
detectable when diluted in the ratio of one volume of
odorous air emitted to four volumes of clean air. Any
process which may involve the creation or emission of any
§ 179-59 RENSSELAER CITY CHARTER § 179-59
C:713
odors shall be provided with a secondary safeguard system
so that control will be maintained if the primary safeguard
system should fail. There is hereby established, as a guide
in determining such quantities of offensive odors, in Table
III, Odor Thresholds, in Chapter 5 of the Air Pollution
Abatement Manual, Copyright 1959, by the Manufacturing
Chemical Association, Inc., Washington, D.C., as said
manual and/or table is subsequently amended.
[5] Fly ash, dust, fumes, vapors, gases and other forms of air
pollution. No emission shall be permitted which can cause
any damage to health, animals, vegetation or other forms
of property or which can cause any excessive soiling at any
point beyond the boundaries of the lot. The concentration
of such emission on or beyond any lot line shall not exceed
0.1 the maximum allowable concentration set forth in
§ 12-29 of the Board of Standards and Appeals of the New
York State Department of Labor, effective October 1, 1956,
and any subsequent standards.
[6] Electromagnetic radiation. It shall be unlawful to operate
or cause to be operated any planned or intentional source
of electromagnetic radiation which does not comply with
the current regulations of the Federal Communications
Commission regarding such sources or electromagnetic
radiation, except that, for all governmental regulations
regarding such sources of electromagnetic radiation of the
Interdepartment Radio Advisory Committee shall take
precedence over the regulations of the Federal
Communications Commission. Further, said operation in
compliance with the federal regulations shall be unlawful
if such radiation causes an abnormal degradation in
performances of other electromagnetic radiators or
electromagnetic receptors of quality and proper design
because of proximity, primary field, blanketing, spurious
reradiation, harmonic content or modulation of energy
conducted by power or telephone lines. The determination
of abnormal degradation in performance and of quality
and proper design shall be made in accordance with good
engineering practices, as defined in the latest principles
and standards of the American Institute of Radio
Engineers and the Electronic Industries Association. In
case of any conflict between the latest standards and
principles of the above groups, the following precedence
in interpretation of the standards and principles shall
apply: American Institute of Electrical Engineers; Institute
of Radio Engineers; and Electronic Industries Association.
[7] Radioactive radiation. No activities shall be permitted
which emit dangerous radioactivity at any point beyond
§ 179-59 RENSSELAER CODE § 179-59

materials, the discharge of such materials into the air
and water and the disposal of radioactive wastes shall
be in conformance with the regulations of the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission, as set forth in Title 10, Chapter 1,
Part 20, as amended, and all applicable regulations of the
State of New York.
[8] Heat. Heat emitted at any or all points shall not at any time
cause a temperature increase on any adjacent property in
excess of 5° F., whether such change is in the air or on the
ground, in a natural stream or lake or in any structure on
such adjacent property.
[9] Glare. "Dark sky" compliant lighting fixtures are required,
as defined by the following standards.
[a] Direct glare. No such direct glare shall be permitted,
with the exception that parking areas and walkways
may be illuminated by luminaries so hooded or
shielded that the maximum angle of the cone of direct
illumination shall be 60° drawn perpendicular to the
ground, and with the exception that such angle may be
increased to 90° if the luminary is less than four feet
above ground.
[b] Indirect glare. Indirect glare shall not exceed that
value which is produced by an illumination of the
reflecting surface, not to exceed 0.3 foot-candle
(maximum) and 0.1 foot-candle (average).
Deliberately induced sky-reflected glare, as by casting
a beam upward for advertising purposes, is
specifically prohibited.
[10] Liquid or solid waste. No discharge shall be permitted at
any point into a public sewer or stream or into the ground,
except in accord with standards approved by the state and
Rensselaer County Departments of Health and local
ordinances, of any materials of such nature or temperature
as can contaminate any water supply or otherwise cause
the emission of dangerous or offensive elements. There
shall be no accumulation of solid wastes conductive to the
breeding of rodents or insects.
[11] Stormwater. For all developments disturbing more than
one acre, New York State Department of Environmental
Conservation (NYSDEC) requires that municipalities
receive a copy of the stormwater pollution prevention plan
(SWPPP) prior to plan approval. Owner is required to

ARTICLE IV
Sign regulations.
§ 179-60. Intent.
The intent of these provisions is to promote and protect the public health,
safety and welfare by providing comprehensive time, place, and manner
restrictions on signage which shall include controls on size, height, quantity,
location, spacing, shape, scale, lighting, motion, design, maintenance and
appearance. Regulations apply to the physical aspects of the sign, and not
the content. More specifically, the provisions of this article are intended to
ensure that all signs and advertising features:
§ 179-61. Nonconforming signs; applicability.
A. Are functional and compatible with the aesthetic appearance of the
building they are located on, the surrounding neighborhoods and the
long term vision of the City as outlined in the Comprehensive Plan;
B. Serve to protect and enhance community appearance;
C. Protect the safety of motorists and pedestrians by reducing the
frequency and magnitude of hazards caused by obstructions and
distractions;
D. Preserve and create more attractive business and residential
environments; and
E. Are harmonious in color, material and lighting with the building to
which it relates, thereby preserving the existing neighborhood
character.
A. Upon the adoption of this chapter, any sign or advertising device which
does not conform to the provisions of this chapter in terms of location,
area, illumination, type, or height shall be considered a nonconforming
sign. In addition, no nonconforming sign may be relocated, enlarged,
replaced, redesigned, or altered in any way that increases its
nonconformity.
B. Upon the adoption of this chapter, all nonconforming signs, except
those granted a variance, shall cease and desist at the time when there
is any one or more of the following:
(1) A change in ownership of the home or business to which the sign
applies; such change must involve a change in the actual persons
owning the home or business, rather than a mere change in their
corporate status.
(2) A change in use.
(3) Destruction, damage, or disrepair of said sign to the extent that
51% of its replacement cost must be expended in its repair.
§ 179-60 RENSSELAER CITY CHARTER § 179-61
C:717
§ 179-62. General regulations.
Signs are important community features that either serve to contribute to
or diminish the character or appearances of existing structures. The goal
of these general regulations is to protect property values, create a more
attractive economic and business climate, and enhance and protect the
physical appearance of the community. As such, the regulations serve to
promote the visual cohesiveness of the streetscape and encourage signs to
be harmonious with the architecture of each building and the character of
the surrounding area.
(4) Creation of a hazard or disturbance to the health, safety and
welfare of the general public as determined by the Building and
Zoning Administrator.
C. For the purpose of these regulations, the term "sign" does not include:
(1) Memorial tablets or signs and locally designated historic markers
not exceeding two square feet in area.
(2) Signs erected and maintained pursuant to and in discharge of any
governmental function, including state or federal historic markers,
traffic control devices, or required by any law, ordinance or
governmental regulation.
(3) Flags, emblems or insignias of the United States, or organizations
of which this nation is a member.
(4) Posters, flyers, displays or other materials, intended to be
temporary, that are on the interior of windows of commercial
establishments.
(5) A design, image, or expression on the exterior of a building,
generally for the purpose of decoration or artistic expression,
including, but not limited to paintings, markings, and etchings and
does not include any on or off-site advertisement (i.e., mural).
A. No sign shall be permitted in any zoning district except in compliance
with these regulations. All new signs, unless otherwise noted, will
require a permit and are subject to the requirements of § 179-68.
B. Any sign or other advertising device with visible moving or movable
parts or with flashing, animated or intermittent illumination (except
signs indicating the time, date or weather conditions), and any sign that
contains any fluorescent paint or device, including mirrors, which has
the effect of intensifying reflected light are prohibited in all parts of the
City.
C. The Building and Zoning Administrator, as part of a sign permit
application, sign site plan, or site plan review, shall consider the
compatibility of the sign's location, color(s), lettering, size and overall
design with onsite and adjacent architecture and community character.
§ 179-61 RENSSELAER CODE § 179-62
C:718
D. LCD, LED, or other digital signs, except those displaying the time of day
or current temperature, are prohibited.
E. Signs featuring dual media, vertical louvered blinds, or mechanically
changing or movable materials are prohibited.
F. Pictorial designs, logos and trademarks shall be permitted, provided
that they are incorporated in and made a part of a permitted sign face,
and the area thereof is included in calculating the total permitted sign
face area allowed under these regulations.

(2) Do not display a current vehicle inspection sticker or license plate;
or
(3) Are not principally used as a mode of transportation for business
purposes; or
(4) Are conspicuously parked or located on a lot or public right-of-way
for 24 hours.
M. Directional signs. Any sign limited to directional messages, principally
for pedestrian or vehicular traffic, such as "one-way," "entrance" and
"exit" are prohibited. At the discretion of the Planning Commission,
exceptions may be made for public parking lots intended to service a
general commercial area rather than an individual business or shopping
plaza, as well as cases where the NYS DOT requires such signs in the
interest of mitigating potential traffic hazards. In the case of the latter,
the content of directional signs shall be limited to traffic management
and shall not contain advertising materials or logos.
N. No application for approval of signs or for a sign permit shall be
processed or permitted unless permission is granted from the property
owner.
§ 179-62 RENSSELAER CITY CHARTER § 179-62
C:719
O. The Building and Zoning Administrator shall require the proper
maintenance of all signs, and such signs, together with their supports,
shall be kept in good repair. The display surfaces shall be kept neatly
painted at all times. The Building and Zoning Administrator may order
the removal of any sign that is not maintained in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter. Painting, repainting, cleaning or repair
maintenance will not be considered an erection or alteration which
requires a permit unless a structural change is made.
P. Billboards are prohibited in all zoning districts.
Q. Any sign displayed which no longer advertises a bona fide business
conducted upon the premises shall, upon notification by the Building
and Zoning Administrator, be taken down or removed within 10 days
after such notification, and failure to so comply on the part of the owner,
occupant, agent or person having the beneficial use of any building or
premises upon which such sign may be found shall subject such person
to the penalty provided in § 179-87. In such cases where the Planning
Commission or Building and Zoning Administrator deems appropriate,
a sign may be removed in a manner approved by the Building and
Zoning Administrator. Building and Zoning Administrator may allow the
retention of signs that are an original part of the architectural fabric of
the structure, such as a date or name of building, without reduction in
the number of signs or square footage of signs under § 179-66 through
§ 179-67, depending on the district.
R. No sign shall be erected or allowed to exist so as to constitute a traffic
hazard. No sign or other advertising structure as regulated by any of
the provisions of this article shall be erected at the intersection of any
streets in such a manner as to obstruct free and clear vision; or at any
location where, by reason of position shape or color, it may interfere
with, obstruct the view or be confused with any authorized traffic sign,
signal or device or makes use of words, phrases, symbols or characters
in such a manner as to interfere with, mislead or confuse traffic.
S. Signs must conform to character of the district. In addition to the
regulations contained in this section, approval of the display of a sign in
these districts shall be granted only with consideration given to the
appearance, color, size, position, method of attachment, texture of
materials and design. In addition, the sign must conform to the
distinctive character of the district or not injuriously affect it or impair
the value to the community of those buildings having architectural or
historic worth.

the same building, each business will be allowed to have two of the
first three sign types identified below. In addition, businesses will
be permitted the sign described in Subsection A(2)(a) below, not to
exceed the maximum allowable signage area listed for each type.
Other sign types, except those noted in § 179-64 and the remainder
of this section, are expressly prohibited. Permanent window signs
shall not count against the allowable square footage or the
allowable number of signs.
(a) Wall sign. One wall sign not to exceed an area based on 1/2
square foot of sign area per linear foot of occupied building
frontage but not exceeding 60 square feet. Wall signs shall be

in width.
C. Changes or modifications. Changes and modifications to nonconforming
lots are subject to the following requirements:
(1) No change shall be permitted to any nonconforming lot which
would have the effect of increasing the density at which the
property is being used, or increasing the structure located upon
such lot, if the dimensional requirements and standards, including
parking, of the underlying zoning district are not met as a result
thereof.
(2) Any changes proposed on a nonconforming lot are subject to site

thereof mailed to the applicant. The Building and Zoning
Administrator shall then issue a building permit to the applicant if
the project conforms to all other applicable requirements.
(3) Upon disapproving an application, the Planning Commission shall
so inform the Building and Zoning Administrator, and he shall deny
a building permit to the applicant. The Planning Commission shall
also notify the applicant in writing of its decision and its reasons for
disapproval. A copy of the appropriate minutes may suffice for this
notice.
A. Termination.
(1) Such site plan approval will automatically terminate one year after
the same is granted unless a building permit has been issued and
significant work has been commenced on the project. Building
permits shall expire one year after the same is granted.

(1) No site plan drawings approved by the Planning Commission shall
be changed, modified or altered in any way until the Building and
Zoning Administrator reviews said proposed change, modification
or alteration. The property owner shall submit to the Building and
Zoning Administrator an application requesting a modification to
an approved site plan. Said application shall outline the details of
the proposed changes, the reasons for the proposed changes and
the possible impacts of the proposed changes. If the Building and
Zoning Administrator determines that a proposed change,
modification or alteration is minor, he or she shall approve, approve
with conditions, or disapprove of said change. If the Building and
Zoning Administrator determines that the proposed change,
modification or alteration of a final site plan drawing is significant,
he or she shall not take any action and shall direct the property
owners to obtain written approval from the Planning Commission.
(2) The Planning Commission may schedule and hold a public hearing
on any proposed changes to approved site plan drawings under
conditions outlined in his section. Any proposed changes to
approved site plan drawings shall be reviewed by the Planning
Commission within 30 calendar days of the receipt of a complete
application by the Building and Zoning Administrator. The Planning
Commission shall approve, approve with modifications or
disapprove the request for said changes. Failure of the Planning
Commission to act on such matter within 30 days shall constitute
conditional approval of said changes. The Planning Commission
may, however, table such request for changes to site plan drawings
if the Planning Commission feels that the applicant has not
provided sufficient information regarding the changes being
proposed.
C. Performance guaranties. With site plans that involve removal of topsoil,
grading and/or excavating, a performance bond, letter of credit or some
other form of surety acceptable to the City Attorney shall be required to
ensure that site plan work is completed. No certificate of occupancy
shall be issued until all improvements shown on the site plan drawings
are installed or a sufficient performance guaranty has been posted for
improvements not yet complete.

ARTICLE VII
Subdivision of Land
§ 179-79. Variances.
Where there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the way of
carrying out the strict letter of these regulations, the Planning Commission
shall have the power to vary or modify the application of any of the
requirements herein relating to the use, layout and platting of land for
subdivisions, so that the spirit of the regulations shall be observed, public
safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done.
§ 179-80. Plats.
A. Application; plat layouts to be filed. Whenever any subdivision of land
as hereinbefore defined is proposed to be made and before any contract
for the sale of or any offer to sell such subdivision or any part thereof is
made, the subdividing owner thereof or his agent shall apply in writing
to the Planning Commission for approval of such subdivision. He shall
first file with the Planning Commission a preliminary layout and
subsequently a formal plat as hereinafter specified, 12 copies of each.
B. Preapplication procedure. Prior to the filing of an application for
conditional approval of the preliminary layout, the subdivider may
submit general site information, a location map and a sketch plan with a
request for informal consideration and advice. This step does not
require a formal application, fee or the filing of a plat. The purpose of
pre-application procedure is to afford the subdivider an opportunity to
consult early and informally with the Planning Commission, a qualified
Engineer retained by the City, and Board of Public Service before
preparation of the preliminary layout in order to save time and money
and to make the most of opportunities for desirable development.
C. Preapplication plans and data; contents.
(1) General site information. General site information shall describe or
outline the existing conditions of the site and the proposed
development to the extent necessary to supplement the location
map and sketch plan. Information may be required on existing
covenants, land characteristics, available community facilities and
utilities and information describing the subdivision proposal, such
as the number of residential lots, typical lot width and depth,
business areas, playgrounds, parks and other public areas,
proposed protective covenants and proposed utilities and street
improvements.
(2) Sketch plan. Sketch plan on topographic survey shall show in
simple sketch form the proposed layout of streets, lots and other
features in relation to existing conditions. The sketch plan may be a
freehand pencil sketch made directly on a print of the topographic
survey. In any event the sketch plan should include either the
§ 179-79 RENSSELAER CITY CHARTER § 179-80
C:751
existing topographic data listed in Subsection E or such of these
data as the Planning Commission may require for its consideration
of the proposed sketch plan, as well as scale, North point and date.
D. Preliminary layout.
(1) Preparation, filing. On reaching conclusions regarding his general
program and objectives, the subdivider shall cause to be prepared
a preliminary layout, together with improvement plans and other
supplementary material as specified in Subsection E. Twelve copies
of the preliminary layout and required supplementary material
shall be submitted to the Planning Commission with written
application for conditional approval at least 14 working days prior
to a regularly scheduled meeting. Copies shall be referred by the
Planning Commission to a qualified engineer and Board of Public
Service for study and recommendation.
(2) Action on preliminary layout. Following review of the preliminary
layout and other material submitted therewith, and negotiations
with the subdivider on changes deemed advisable and the kind and
extent of improvements to be made by him in accordance with the
requirements of Subsections E and H, the Planning Commission
shall act thereon as submitted or as modified. The City Engineer
and the Board of Public Service shall first approve the application
and so advise the Planning Commission within 45 days after filing.
If the preliminary layout is approved, the Planning Commission
shall note its approval as "conditional approval" and state the
specific conditions of such approval, if any. If the preliminary layout
is disapproved, the Planning Commission shall state the reasons for
its disapproval.
(3) Notation of action. The action of the Planning Commission shall be
noted on two copies of the preliminary layout, to which shall be
attached referenced statements of any conditions and
requirements determined by the Planning Commission in
accordance with the regulations. One copy shall be filed in the

Administration and Enforcement
§ 179-84. Building and Zoning Administrator.
The Building and Zoning Administrator shall administer and enforce all
provisions of this chapter except where specified otherwise. The Building
and Zoning Administrator shall be assisted by such officers and employees
as may be determined by the Common Council.
A. Powers and duties. In addition to any other authority conferred by law
and within this chapter, the Building and Zoning Administrator shall
have the following powers and duties:
(1) Issuance of building permits. No building or structure shall be
erected, altered, reconstructed or enlarged until the Building and
Zoning Administrator has issued a building permit stating that the
proposed use and structure comply fully with all applicable
provisions of this chapter. In addition, no building permit shall be
issued for any building where site plan of such building is subject to
approval by the Planning Commission unless and until such
approval has been duly granted by the Planning Commission.
(2) Issuance of certificates of occupancy. No use shall be established or
land or structure occupied, nor shall any existing use of land be
changed until the Building and Zoning Administrator has issued a
certificate of occupancy stating that the use, land and structure
comply with all applicable provisions of this chapter. More
particularly, no certificate of occupancy shall be issued for any
special use of a building of land requiring special permit approval
by the Planning Commission unless and until such special permit or
site plan approval has been granted by the Planning Commission.
Every certificate of occupancy for which special permit or site plan
approval has been granted, or in connection with which a variance
has been granted by the Board of Appeals, shall contain a detailed
statement of any condition to which the same is subject, and shall
include, by attachment, a copy of such Board of Appeals decision.
(3) Issuance of notices of violation. Whenever, in the opinion of the
Building and Zoning Administrator, after proper examination and
inspection, there appears to exist a violation of any provision of this
chapter, or of any rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto, he
shall serve a written notice upon the appropriate person
responsible for such alleged violation. Such notices shall be served
in accordance with the requirements of § 179-86 herein.
(4) Issuance of stop-work orders. Whenever the Building and Zoning
Administrator has reasonable grounds to believe that work on any
building, structure or any use of land is occurring in violation of the
provisions of this chapter, not in conformity with any application
made, permit granted or other approval issued, or in an unsafe or
§ 179-84 RENSSELAER CITY CHARTER § 179-84
C:765
§ 179-85. Zoning Board of Appeals.
dangerous manner, the Building and Zoning Administrator shall
promptly notify the appropriate person responsible to suspend the
work on any such building or structure or the use of any such land.
Such persons shall forthwith suspend such activity until the stopwork
order has been rescinded. Such order and notice shall be in
writing, shall state the conditions under which the work or use may
be resumed, and shall be served upon the persons to whom it is
directed.
(5) Emergency action. If, in the opinion of the Building and Zoning
Administrator, a violation exists which requires immediate action to
avoid a direct hazard or imminent danger to the health, safety,
morals or welfare of occupants of a building or to other persons,
the Building and Zoning Administrator may direct such violation
immediately remedied or may take direct action on his own
initiative to abate the hazard or danger. Any costs incurred by such
action shall be paid for by the owner, occupant or person
responsible for the violation. The Building and Zoning
Administrator shall keep on file an affidavit stating with fairness
and accuracy the items of expense and date of execution of action
taken, and is furthermore authorized to institute a suit, if
necessary, against the person liable for such expenses, or place a
lien against property, in order to recover said costs.

Board shall consist of seven members, appointed by the Mayor for a
term of three years and subject to removal for cause after public
hearing. The Mayor shall designate the Chairman of the Board of
Appeals, while the Board of Appeals shall designate its Secretary and
shall prescribe reasonable rules for the conduct of its affairs.
B. Powers and duties. The Board of Appeals shall have all the powers and
duties prescribed by law and this chapter, which are specified below:
(1) Interpretation. On appeal from an order, requirement, decision or
determination made by an administrative official, or on request by
an official, board or agency of the City, to decide any of the
following questions:
(a) Determination of the meaning of any portion of the text of this
chapter or of any conditions or requirement specified or made
under the provisions of this chapter.
(b) Determination of the exact location of any district boundary
shown on the Zoning Map.
(2) Use variances.
§ 179-84 RENSSELAER CODE § 179-85
C:766
(a) The Zoning Board of Appeals, on appeal from the decision or
determination of the Code Enforcement Officer, shall have the
power to grant use variances, as defined herein.
(b) No such use variance shall be granted by a Board of Appeals
without a showing by the applicant that applicable zoning
regulations and restrictions have caused unnecessary
hardship. In order to prove such unnecessary hardship the
applicant shall demonstrate to the Board of Appeals that for
each and every permitted use under the zoning regulations for
the particular district where the property is located:
[1] The applicant cannot realize a reasonable return, provided
that lack of return is substantial as demonstrated by
competent financial evidence;
[2] The alleged hardship relating to the property in question is
unique, and does not apply to a substantial portion of the
district or neighborhood;
[3] The requested use variance, if granted, will not alter the
essential character of the neighborhood; and
[4] The alleged hardship has not been self-created.
(c) The Board of Appeals, in the granting of use variances, shall
grant the minimum variance that it shall deem necessary and
adequate to address the unnecessary hardship proven by the
applicant, and at the same time preserve and protect the
character of the neighborhood and the health, safety and
welfare of the community.
(3) Area variances.
(a) The Board of Appeals shall have the power, upon an appeal
from a decision or determination of the Code Enforcement
Officer, to grant area variances as defined herein.
(b) In making its determination, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall
take into consideration the benefit to the applicant if the
variance is granted, as weighed against the detriment to the
health, safety and welfare of the neighborhood or community
by such grant. In making such determination the board shall
also consider:
[1] Whether an undesirable change will be produced in the
character of the neighborhood or a detriment to nearby
properties will be created by the granting of the area
variance;
[2] Whether the benefit sought by the applicant can be
achieved by some method feasible for the applicant to
pursue, other than an area variance;
§ 179-85 RENSSELAER CITY CHARTER § 179-85
C:767
[3] Whether the requested area variance is substantial;
[4] Whether the proposed variance will have an adverse effect
or impact on the physical or environmental conditions in
the neighborhood or district; and
[5] Whether the alleged difficulty was self-created, which
consideration shall be relevant to the decision of the Board
of Appeals, but shall not necessarily preclude the granting
of the area variance.
(c) The Board of Appeals, in the granting of area variances, shall
grant the minimum variance that it shall deem necessary and
adequate and at the same time preserve and protect the
character of the neighborhood and the health, safety and
welfare of the community.
(4) Imposition of conditions. The Board of Appeals shall, in the
granting of both use variances and area variances, have the
authority to impose such reasonable conditions and restrictions as
are directly related to and incidental to the proposed use of the
property. Such conditions shall be consistent with the spirit and
intent of this chapter and shall be imposed for the purpose of
minimizing any adverse impact such variance may have on the
neighborhood or community.
C. Procedure. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall act in strict accordance
with the procedure specified by law and this chapter.
(1) Meetings. Meetings shall be held at the call of the Chairman or at
such other times as the Board of Appeals may determine. A quorum
shall consist of four members, but in order to reverse a decision of
the enforcement official or authorize a variance, an affirmative vote
of at least four members shall be required. The Board shall keep
minutes of its proceedings showing the vote of each member upon
each question, and shall keep records of its examinations and other
official actions.
(2) Application and fee. All appeals and applications made to the Board
shall be in writing, on forms prescribed by the Board, and shall be
accompanied by a fee of $40. Every appeal or application shall
refer to the specific provisions of this chapter that is involved and
shall precisely set forth either the interpretation that is claimed or
the details of the variance that is applied for and the grounds on
which it is claimed that such variance should be granted.
(3) Public notice and hearing. The Board shall fix a time and place for a
public hearing on any such appeal or application, and shall provide
notice as follows:
(a) By publishing at least 10 calendar days prior to the date
thereof a notice in the official newspaper of the City.
§ 179-85 RENSSELAER CODE § 179-85
C:768
(b) By requiring the Director of Planning and Development to give
notice at least five days prior to the date thereof the substance
of every appeal for a variance together with a notice of hearing
thereon by mailing such to the owners of all property abutting
that held by the applicant and all other owners within 500 feet,
or such additional distances as the Board of Appeals may deem
advisable, from the boundaries of the land involved in such
appeal. Compliance with this notification procedure shall be
certified to by the Director of Planning and Development.
[1] The names of owners notified shall be taken as such
appear on the last completed tax roll of the City.
[2] Provided that there shall have been substantial
compliance with these provisions, the failure to give notice
in exact conformance herewith shall not be deemed to
invalidate action taken by the Board of Appeals in
connection with granting or denying of an appeal for a

and intent of this chapter.
(7) Expiration of approval. Unless construction or use is commenced
and diligently pursued within six months of the date of the granting
of a variance, such variance shall become null and void.
(8) Strict construction. All the provisions of this chapter relating to the

expiration of the date of compliance as specified in the notice of

shall be issued by the Building and Zoning Administrator.
H. Legal action by the City for noncompliance. On reinspection following
the expiration of the date of compliance, as specified in the notice of
violation or as extended in accordance with Subsection B of this

there is still in existence, in the opinion of the Building and Zoning
Administrator, a violation of provisions of this chapter, then the Building
and Zoning Administrator shall immediately refer the matter to the City
Attorney who shall thereupon institute appropriate legal action to
restrain, prevent, enjoin, abate, remedy or remove such violation and to

before the public hearing required by law. In recommending the
adoption of any such proposed amendment, the Planning Commission
may state its reasons for such recommendation, describing any
conditions that it believes make the amendment advisable, and
specifically setting forth the manner in which, in its opinion, the

Use for the City, and be in furtherance of the purposes set forth in
§ 179-2 of this chapter. In recommending the rejection or revision of any
proposed amendment or change, the Planning Commission may
similarly state its reasons. Failure on the part of the Commission to
report its recommendations with respect to any proposed amendment
or change to the Common Council within 45 days after the date of
referral shall be deemed to be approval thereof, unless such
proceedings have theretofore been terminated.
C. Referral to County Planning Commission. The City Clerk shall promptly
transmit to the Rensselaer County Planning Commission any matters
required to be referred pursuant to the provisions of § 239-l and
