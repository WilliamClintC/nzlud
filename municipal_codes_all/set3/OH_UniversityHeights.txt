code number is 2, the chapter number is 238 (or the 38th chapter within code
2), and the section number is .02.  The code and chapter numbers appear left of
the decimal, with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the
decimal.  The section number appears to the right of the decimal.  As another
example, 408.01 indicates that the code is 4, the chapter is 408 (or the 8th
chapter within code 4), and the section number is .01.
   With this numbering system the Codified Ordinances may be expanded almost
endlessly. Codes, titles and chapters are initially even numbered, thus
reserving the use of odd numbers for future legislation.  Sections within
chapters are consecutively numbered except that penalty provisions are usually
assigned the number .99.  Newly created sections subsequent to the original
codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event
the law properly belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For
example, newly created 660.061, 660.062 and 660.063 follow 660.06 and precede
660.07 to be placed in their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at the time, or
to its inclusion in any prior code.  Sections and subsections without histories
or with the words “Adopting Ordinance” at the end thereof are or contain new
matter ordained by the Adopting Ordinance that enacts these Codified
Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance and resolution included in these Codified Ordinances. It indicates
whether a given ordinance or resolution was consolidated with another into one
section or split into two or more sections. Cross references direct the user to
subject matter reasonably related to material contained within a given chapter.

ARTICLE 4. INITIATIVE, REFERENDUM AND RECALL
   SECTION 1. Initiative. The electors of the City shall have power to propose
any ordinance or resolution, except an ordinance for the appropriation of money
or an ordinance making a tax levy, and to adopt or reject the same at the
polls, such power being known as the initiative. An initiated ordinance or
resolution may be submitted to the Clerk of the Council by petition signed by
at least five percent (5%) of the registered electors of the City, When so
submitted, the Clerk shall forthwith determine the sufficiency of the petition
and if found sufficient, the Council shall at once have the proposed ordinance
or resolution read and referred to an appropriate committee which may be a
committee of the whole. Provision shall be made for public hearings on the
proposed ordinance or resolution not later than thirty (30) days after the date
on which such ordinance or resolution was submitted to the Clerk. The Council
shall within forty (40) days after such ordinance or resolution is submitted,
take final action thereon, either enacting or rejecting the proposed ordinance
or resolution. If the Council fails or refuses to pass such proposed ordinance
or resolution or passes it in some form different from that set forth in the
petition therefor, the committee of the petitioners may require that it be
submitted to a vote of the electors either in its original form or in the
amended form by filing with the Clerk a supplemental petition signed by that
number of additional registered electors which, when taken together with those
who signed the original petition, will total at least ten percent (10%) of the
registered electors of the City, and if said supplemental petition is signed by
that number of additional registered electors which, when taken together with
those who signed the original petition, will total at least twenty percent
(20%) of the registered electors the date of the election may be fixed therein,
not less than sixty (60) days from the time of filing such supplemental
petition. Such supplemental petition shall be filed within ten (10) days after
the final action on such ordinance or resolution by the Council. The Council
shall thereupon provide, for submitting such ordinance or resolution to the
vote of the electors at the date so fixed, or at the next general election in
any year occurring more than sixty (60) days from the filing of such
supplemental petition, if no date be so fixed therein.
   SECTION 2. Referendum. The electors shall have the power to approve or
reject at the polls any ordinance or resolution passed by the Council, except
as hereinafter provided. Within thirty (30) days after the final passage by the
Council of an ordinance or resolution, a petition signed by at least ten
percent (10%) of the registered electors of the City may be filed with the
Clerk of the Council, requesting that such ordinance or resolution be either
repealed or submitted to a vote of the electors. If said petition is signed by
twenty percent (20%) or more of such registered electors, the date of the
election may be fixed therein, not less than ninety (90) days from the time of
filing thereof. When such petition is filed, the Clerk shall first ascertain
the sufficiency of the petition, and if found sufficient, the Council shall
thereupon, within thirty (30) days of the filing of such petition, reconsider
such ordinance or resolution. If upon such reconsideration the ordinance or
resolution is not repealed, the Council shall provide for submitting it to a
vote of the electors on the date so fixed, or at the first general election in
any year occurring more than ninety (90) days from the filing of such petition,
if no date be so fixed. No such ordinance or resolution shall go into effect
until approved by a majority of those voting thereon. When the Council by law
or under provisions of general ordinances, is required to pass more than one
ordinance or resolution necessary to make and pay for any public improvement,
the referendum provisions shall apply only to the first ordinance or resolution
required to be passed and not to any subsequent ordinances or resolutions
relating thereto. Ordinances providing for the annual tax levy or for
improvements petitioned by the owners of a majority of the feet front of the
property benefitted and to be specially assessed therefor, and appropriation
ordinances limited to the subject of appropriations shall not be subject to
referendum, but all other ordinances, including emergency ordinances, shall be
subject to referendum, except that emergency ordinances shall go into effect at
the time indicated therein. If, when submitted to a vote of the electors, an
emergency measure be not approved by a majority of those voting thereon, it
shall be considered repealed as regards any further action thereunder; but such
measure shall be deemed sufficient authority for payment, in accordance with
the ordinance, of any expense incurred previous to the referendum vote thereon.
   Ordinances submitted to the Council by initiative petition and passed by the
Council either with or without change, but not required to be submitted to a
vote of the electors, shall be subject to referendum in the same manner as
other ordinances.
(11-3-2009)
   SECTION 3. Recall. The electors shall have the power to remove from office
by recall election any elective officer of the City. At any time after an
elective officer has held office for six months of the term for which he was
chosen, a petition demanding his removal and the election of a successor in his
office may be filed with the Clerk of the Council. Such petition shall comply
with the provisions of Section 4 of this Article, and shall be signed by
registered electors equal in number to at least twenty-five (25%) percent of
the total number of voters casting ballots at the last preceding general
municipal election. Within ten (10) days from the date of filing such petition,
the Clerk shall determine the sufficiency thereof. If the Clerk shall find the
petition insufficient, he shall promptly certify the particulars in which the
petition is defective and deliver a copy of his certificate to the person who
filed the petition with him, and such person shall be allowed twenty (20) days
from the delivery of such copy of certificate in which to make the petition
sufficient. If the Clerk shall find the petition sufficient he shall promptly
so certify to the Council and to the officer whose removal is sought, and, if
the officer does not resign within five (5) days thereafter, the Council shall
thereupon order and fix a day for holding a recall election, not less than
thirty (30) nor more than forty (40) days from the date of the Clerk's
certificate of sufficiency. At such recall election the name of the officer
whose removal is sought shall be placed on the ballot as a candidate to succeed
himself, unless he otherwise requests in writing at least twenty (20) days
prior thereto, and the names of such other candidates for the same office shall
be placed on the ballot as shall have been nominated in accordance with Article
2 Section 1 of this Charter at least twenty (20) days prior to such recall
election. The recall election, except as it shall be limited to the offices
from which a removal is sought, shall in other respects conform to the
provisions of Article 2 Section 1 of this Charter. If at the recall election
the incumbent does not receive a plurality of the votes cast, the candidate who
does receive such a plurality shall be declared elected to succeed the
incumbent for the remainder of his term, and the incumbent shall be deemed
removed from his office when such elected successor qualifies for the office or
within ten (10) days after the recall election.
(11-6-1979)
   SECTION 4. Petitions. An initiative, referendum or recall petition may be
circulated in separate parts, but the separate parts shall be bound together
and filed as one instrument. Each part shall contain in the case of the
initiative or referendum, a full and correct copy of the title and the text of
the proposed or referred ordinance or resolution, and in the case of the
recall, the name and office of the person whose removal is sought and a
statement in not more than two hundred words of the grounds for the removal.
ARTICLE 5. THE MAYOR

administrative powers of the City shall be vested in the Mayor, directors of
departments and other administrative officers provided for in this Charter or

for the office, the Vice-Mayor shall vacate his office of councilman and shall
become Mayor to serve the unexpired term or until a successor for the unexpired
term is elected and qualified.

   The Civil Service Commission shall make necessary rules for the appointment,
promotion, transfer, lay-off, reinstatement, suspension and removal of persons
in the classified service. In the case of hiring and in the case of promotion,
the Commission shall make necessary rules with regard to eligibility lists and
with regard to certification of the number and the names of candidates from
eligibility lists and with regard to the process of selection and appointment

to age, sex, physical condition and moral character, for investigating and
keeping a record of the efficiency of the personnel in the classified service
and for requiring reports relative thereto from appointing authority, for such
other rules as may be necessary and proper for the enforcement of the merit
system and for appeals from the action of appointing authority in the case of

request, and shall make a report to the Mayor at the beginning of each fiscal
year.

manner and subject to the provisions established by this Charter for original
grants. Such grant, amendment or renewal shall be for such period of time not

exclusive.
   No consent of the owner of property abutting on any public street or ground
shall be necessary to the effectiveness of any such grant, amendment, or
renewal, unless the construction or operation of the public utility authorized
thereby is of such character as to constitute an additional burden upon such
public street or ground. All such grants, amendments or renewals shall be made
subject to the continuing right of the Council to provide reasonable
regulations for the operation of such utilities with reference to such streets
and public grounds, including the right to require such reconstruction,
relocation or discontinuance of appliances, plant or equipment used in such

compensation of all officers and employees of the City, and may require any

per cent (2%) of the annual salary of such Councilman. Persons filling
vacancies for the unexpired terms of elective officers shall receive the

other officers and employees may be fixed and changed at any time in the
discretion of the Council. All fees pertaining to any office shall be paid into

amendment shall be so submitted by the Council. The submission of any proposed
amendment to the electors shall be governed by the requirements of the
Constitution of Ohio, and, to such extent as said Constitution shall fail to
provide therefor, the Council shall determine the manner for such submission.

it shall become a part of this Charter; except that if two or more inconsistent
amendments on the same subject are submitted at the same election, only the one
of such amendments receiving the largest affirmative vote, nor less than a
majority, shall become a part of this Charter.
   SECTION 6. When Charter Takes Effect. For the purpose of nominating and
electing officers of this City and fixing the compensation of those elected in

by the electors of this City; and for all other purposes it shall be in effect
on and after the first day of January, 1942.
   SECTION 7. Saying Clause. The determination that any part of this Charter is
invalid shall not invalidate nor impair the force or effect of any other part
hereof, except to the extent that such other part is dependent for its
operation upon the part declared invalid.
   SECTION 8. Effect of Charter Upon Existing Laws and Rights. The taking
effect of this Charter shall not affect any pre-existing rights of this
municipality, nor any right or liability or pending suit of prosecution either

   (a)   A provision of these Codified Ordinances which is re-enacted or

Codified Ordinances and not a new enactment, so far as it is the same as the
prior provision.
(ORC 1.54)
   (b)   The repeal of a repealing provision of these Codified Ordinances does

Ordinances does not, except as provided in subsection (d) hereof:

(ORC 1.56)
202.06  CONFLICTS OF LAWS.
   (a)   All ordinances, resolutions, rules and regulations of the
Municipality, and all parts of the same, enacted prior to the date of the
adoption of these Codified Ordinances and inconsistent or in conflict with any
of the provisions of these Codified Ordinances, are hereby repealed, save and
except any ordinance, resolution, rule or regulation, or part of the same,
expressly excepted from repeal by the ordinance that adopts these Codified
Ordinances. No ordinance, resolution, rule or regulation, or part of the same,
of the Municipality, that is not inconsistent or in conflict with any of the
provisions of these Codified Ordinances and/or that can be reasonably
interpreted to be compatible with the provisions of these Codified Ordinances,
shall be deemed to be repealed by the adoption of these Codified Ordinances.
Such ordinances, resolutions, rules and regulations, and all parts of the same,
shall continue to be viable and enforceable by the Municipality.
   (b)   In the event of a conflict between any of the provisions of these
Codified Ordinances, or between any of the provisions of these Codified
Ordinances and a provision of any standard code adopted by the Municipality
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 731.231 or the Municipal Charter, the provision that
establishes the higher or stricter standard shall control. In the event of a
conflict between any of the provisions of these Codified Ordinances and any 
provision of State law, including rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to
State law, the State law, rule or regulation shall control if it is of a kind
required to be in conformity with State law by Article XVIII, Section 3, of the
Ohio Constitution; otherwise, the provision of these Codified Ordinances shall
control.
   (c)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (d)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to he general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (e)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
   (f)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different meetings
of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments are to
be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
(ORC 1.52)
202.07  DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting a provision of these Codified Ordinances, it is presumed
that:
      (1)   Compliance with the Constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)   The entire provision is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended.
   (b)   A provision of these Codified Ordinances is presumed to be prospective
in its operation unless it is expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If a provision of these Codified Ordinances is ambiguous, the court,
in determining the intention of Council, may consider, among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which provision was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction; and
      (6)   The administrative construction of the provision.
(ORC 1.49)
202.08  SEPARABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of these Codified Ordinances or the
application thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, the
invalidity does not affect other provisions or applications of the section or
related sections which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
application, and to this end the provisions are separable.
(ORC 1.50)
202.99  GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in these Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, the commission or performance
of such act, or the failure to commit or perform such act, as required, shall,
unless another penalty is provided, be deemed a misdemeanor of the fourth
degree and the offender shall be fined not more than two hundred fifty dollars
($250.00) or imprisoned not more than 30 days, or both, for each offense. A
separate offense shall be deemed committed each day during or on which a
violation or noncompliance occurs or continues, unless otherwise provided.

Editor's note: The State of Ohio operates on Eastern Daylight Savings Time from
2:00 a.m. of the first Sunday in April until 2:00 a.m. of the last Sunday in
October. Congress, on March 22, 1966, passed the Uniform Time Act requiring
uniform observance throughout the nation of Daylight Savings Time starting in
1967, except that a State legislature could exempt the entire state from
Daylight Savings Time or divide a state into not more than two parts, each with
a different time standard. The Ohio legislature, through inaction, has elected
to observe Eastern Daylight Savings Time throughout the State.
   On August 8, 2005, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 was enacted. This Act
changed the time change dates for Daylight Saving Time in the United States.
Beginning in 2007, the State of Ohio begins Daylight Saving Time at 2:00 a.m.
on the second Sunday in March and reverts to standard time at 2:00 a.m. on the
first Sunday in November. The Secretary of Energy will report the impact of
this change to Congress. Congress retains the right to resume the 2005 Daylight
Saving Time schedule once the Department of Energy study is complete.

212.04 CONSTRUCTION; IMPROVEMENT OR INSTALLMENT CONTRACTS.
   (a)   Compliance Required. The scheduled time, rate, amount and manner of
payments on all construction or improvement contracts or contracts
contemplating performance in installments entered into by the City shall be in
accordance with the provisions of this section.
   (b)   Method and Schedule of Payments to Contractors. The payment by the
City under its contracts shall be made in accordance with the procedure
established to this subsection for the several improvements herein included,
and as to any improvements not included in this subsection, shall be made in
the manner agreed between the City and the contractor in the contract for the
improvement or construction to be made. The method and schedule of payment are
hereinafter set forth according to the type of improvement or construction to
which they relate.
      (1)   Storm, sanitary or combination sewers. On or before the first week
of each month, the contractor shall furnish the Engineer with a statement of
the approximate estimate of the work which has been done in conformity with the
contract. When the Engineer has checked this estimate and determined the total
amount of work performed, the sum payable for such amount of work under the
contract, less 10%, shall be due the contractor after deducting all previous
estimates. Such material or partly completed work as the Engineer may find upon
the site on the day set for estimating the work will be paid for at a price
which in the judgment of the Engineer, represents the cost to the contractor
for such work or material. Ten days after the final measurements have been
made, the Engineer shall submit the final estimate in full for all work
performed, from which estimate, however, there shall be deducted 5% of the
entire amount which shall be retained for a period of four months from the date
of the final estimate.
      (2)   Water mains and appurtenances.
         A.   On or before the first week of each month the contractor shall
furnish the Engineer with a statement of the approximate estimate of the work
which has been done in conformity with the specifications. When the Engineer
has checked this estimate and determined the total amount of work performed,
the sum payable for such amount of work under the contract, less 10%, shall be
due the contractor after deducting all previous estimates. Payment for partly
completed work, and for material delivered to the site and not installed in the
work, will be paid for at a price which, in the judgment of the Engineer,
represents the cost to the contractor for such work or material.
         B.   Ten days after the final measurements have been made and after
acceptance by the Engineer and the City of Cleveland, the Engineer shall submit
the final estimate in full for all work performed, from which estimate,
however, there shall be deducted 5% of the entire amount which shall be
retained for a period of four months following the date of submission of the
final estimate. At the expiration of the four-month period, the contractor
shall refill any depressions or remove any surplus from the street and clean
and repair any part of the work under this contract. Upon the completion of
such work to the satisfaction of the Engineer, 3% of the total contract amount
shall be paid to the contractor. The remaining 2% due the contractor shall be
retained for an additional period of 20 months following the payment of the 3%,
as a guarantee upon the part of the contractor that the work will remain in
good sound condition.
         C.   If any of the work done under the contract shall, in the opinion
of the Engineer, require repairs, replacements or backfillings, the contractor
shall agree to furnish all material and do all such work at his own expense.
Should the contractor fail to do so within a reasonable time after
notification, the contract shall provide that the Engineer shall have such work
done and the cost of same paid out of the 2% guarantee fund. Should the cost
exceed this percent, the contract shall provide that the contractor agrees to
pay the amount of the excess.
      (3)   Sidewalks. On or before the first week of each month, the
contractor shall furnish the Engineer with a statement of the approximate
estimate of the work which has been done in conformity with these
specifications. When the Engineer has checked this estimate and determined the
total amount of work performed, the sum payable for such amount of work under
the contract, less 10% shall be due the contractor after deducting all previous
estimates. Such partly completed work as the Engineer may find upon the day set
for estimating work will be paid for at a price which, in the judgment of the
Engineer, represents the cost of the contractor for such work. Ten days after
the final measurements have been made, the Engineer shall submit the final
estimate in full for all work performed.
      (4)   Surface treatment of streets and repairs.
         A.   The contractor will be paid monthly for the work which, in the
opinion of the Engineer, has been completed. On or before the first week of
each month, the contractor shall furnish the Engineer with a statement of the
approximate estimate of the work which has been done in conformity with these
specifications. When the Engineer has checked this estimate and determined the
total amount of the work performed, the sum payable for such amount of work
under the contract, less 8% shall be due the contractor after deducting all
previous estimates.
         B.   Ten days after the contractor has completed all work under this
contract, the Engineer shall prepare an estimate based on all work completed,
less 4% and less all previous estimates. Such 4% shall be retained for a period
of 30 days. At the expiration of this period, the contractor shall go over the
work and shall refill any depressions, remove the surplus from the street and
clean and repair any part of work in this contract as may be ordered by the
Engineer. Upon completion of this work as required by the contract and to the
satisfaction of the Engineer, the total sum for the amount of work done under
this contract, less estimates previously paid, shall be due and payable.
      (5)   Pavement and appurtenances.
         A.   On or before the first week of each month, the contractor shall
furnish the Engineer with a statement of the approximate estimate of the work
which has been done in conformity with these specifications. When the Engineer
has checked this estimate and determined the total amount of work performed,
this amount, less 10% shall be due the contractor after deducting all previous
estimates.
         B.   Such material, or partly completed work, which conforms to
specifications as the Engineer may find when checking the work done, will be
paid for at a price which, in the judgment of the Engineer, represents the cost
to the contractor for such work.
         C.   Ten days after the contractor has completed all work under this
contract, the Engineer shall prepare an estimate based on all work completed,
less 5% and less all previous estimates. Such 5% shall be retained for a period
of four months or, if inclement weather, snow or ice interferes, until such
time as a final inspection of work can be done. At the expiration of this
period, the contractor shall go over the work and shall refill any depression,
remove the surplus from the street and clean and repair any part of the work in
this contract as may be ordered by the Engineer.
         D.   There shall be retained by the City, from the amount due upon the
final estimate, a sum of money equal in amount to fifteen cents (.15¢) per
square yard for all pavement, which amount will be retained by the City for a
three-year period.
         E.   Should the contractor make all necessary repairs, as directed, at
the expiration of the guarantee, when the amount, less any expense that the
City may have incurred, shall be returned to the contractor as full payment for
any balance due on the contract and improvement as herein provided. Should
snow, ice or mud prevent the contractor from making repairs at the expiration
of the time specified, then the guarantee sum shall remain possible to make
inspection and repair.
   (c)   Payments Not to Mean Acceptance of Work. Payments based on the
estimates mentioned in division (b) hereof shall not be taken or construed as
an acceptance by the City of any such work. The acceptance of or payment for
any work performed or materials furnished under any contract, or any possession
by the City, shall not in any way be construed as a waiver by the City of any
rights under the contract or of any right or power therein reserved to the
City, nor shall any waiver or any breach of any part, or of the whole, of any
such contract be construed as a waiver of any part thereof or of a subsequent
breach thereof.
   (d)   Attested Accounts. Any and all payments due or to become due the
contractor, and all rights of the contractor to demand and receive such
payments shall be subject to all provisions of law relating to attested
accounts of subcontractors, equipment men, material men, laborers or mechanics.
The contractor shall satisfy the just and equitable claims of all persons or
corporations who have performed labor or furnished materials or equipment for
the contractor in the execution of each such contract, the just and equitable
claims of all persons or corporations who have previously filed an attested
account of any such claims with the proper official of the City, and all bills,
costs or claims of any kind which might become a liability, lien or charge
against the City. In the event attested accounts are filed with the City, the
City may retain, out of the moneys due or to become due the contractor, a sum
sufficient to pay all such attested account claimants, and in case such
accounts are not paid or adjusted to the satisfaction of the City, the City may
retain all payments pursuant to this chapter and pursuant to the law of
attested accounts provided for by Ohio R. C. 1311.26 to 1311.37, inclusive.
   (e)   Revision of Estimates. All estimates made prior to the final estimate
shall be subject to correction at the time of final estimate and final payment.
   (f)   Final Estimate. The final estimate shall include all work of every
description done and all materials furnished by the contractor under the
contract. All questions as to estimates, measurements or the determination of
the quantity or quality of work shall be left to the discretion of the
Engineer. Labor or material furnished outside the provisions of the contract
will not be paid for unless they have been ordered by the Engineer and approved
by Council.
   (g)   Noncompliance. In case the contractor fails to comply with the terms
of the specifications or contract or fails to comply with such orders or
directions of the Engineer as are provided for in or pursuant to the contract,
the City reserves the right to withhold any estimates that may be due until the
terms, specifications, orders or directions are complied with to the
satisfaction of the Engineer.

CHAPTER 214
Credit Card Policy
214.01   Purpose.
214.02   Definitions.
214.03   Guidelines and procedures.
214.01  PURPOSE.
   In order to conduct City business in a more efficient manner, the City has
granted authority to certain employees and officials to utilize City credit
cards for certain purchases. The purpose of this policy is to comply with the
mandates of H.B. 312 and R.C. §§ 9.21 and 717.31, and to set forth guidelines
and procedures regarding the proper use of City credit cards. This policy is
not intended to replace applicable state law but is intended to comply with
current state laws and establish more efficient, clear guidelines for elected
officials and other employees using City credit cards. Utilization of a City
credit card for personal use, in an unauthorized manner, or for the purchase of
any item or service not directly related to such official's or employee's
public duty will constitute a violation of this policy, may result in
disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment, may violate
R.C. § 2913.21, and, in some instances, could constitute a crime. Accordingly,
all purchases made with a City credit card must be in accordance with these
guidelines and state law.

services on credit or to transact with the account, and any debit or gift card
account related to the receipt of grant moneys. "Credit card account" does not
include a procurement card account, gasoline or telephone credit card account,
or any other card account where merchant category codes are in place as a
system of control for use of the card account.
   (b)   "Emergency" means situations in which purchases must be made via a
credit card rather than the vendor billing the City, which occur when the
Finance Department is not open to facilitate the sign out of the credit cards
stored in the Finance Department. Intended examples of "emergency" including,
but not limited to, fire or police emergency calls requiring the purchase of
goods or services during late-night hours or over weekends.

duty in a reasonable and good faith fashion, even though the Law Department
feels that liability may technically have attached.
      (3)   In instances in which malice or purposeful or reckless misconduct
is charged, except that the employee or official will be put on notice that a
judgment arising from malicious, purposeful or reckless behavior will not be
paid by the City and, defense of such claim will cease at such time that the
Law Department determines that there is not sufficient conflicting evidence to
adequately defend against such claim. In such case, upon adequate prior notice,
the Law Department will withdraw from defense of the claim.
   (b)   It is a condition of this policy of defense and indemnification that
the employee cooperate in the fullest regard in the defense of the action. No
employee being defended pursuant to this policy will be paid for any time which
he or she is required to incur in defense of himself or herself or in assisting
the Law Department in his or her defense.
   (c)   It is a condition of this policy that Council will separately and
individually review each claim to make a determination as to the applicability
of the policy and the intended action of the City. Upon learning of a claim,

protect the interests of the City and its employees and officials. As soon as
practicable thereafter, a complete investigation of the circumstances shall be
undertaken under the direction of the Law Department and the Law Department
shall immediately upon conclusion of such investigation report all facts and
circumstances to Council along with an analysis of damages, potential
liability, settlement possibilities and costs of defense. Within a reasonable
time thereafter, Council shall issue specific directions with regard to such
case but until such directions are issued, the Law Department shall continue
with the defense of the action.

convenience and safe use of the streets and highways.
      (2)   The parade would require the diversion of so great a number of
police officers to properly police the line of movement, assembly area and
areas contiguous thereto so as to deny normal police protection to the

section of this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that
section shall be effective even though no signs are erected or in place.
(ORC 4511.12(A))
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in division (c) of this section, any operator
of a commercial motor vehicle, upon approaching a scale location established
for the purpose of determining the weight of the vehicle and its load, shall
comply with any traffic control device or the order of a peace officer
directing the vehicle to proceed to be weighed or otherwise inspected.
      (2)   Any operator of a commercial motor vehicle, upon bypassing a scale
location in accordance with division (c) of this section, shall comply with an
order of a peace officer to stop the vehicle to verify the use and operation of
an electronic clearance device.
   (c)   Any operator of a commercial motor vehicle that is equipped with an
electronic clearance device authorized by the Superintendent of the State
Highway Patrol under Ohio R.C. 4549.081 may bypass a scale location, regardless
of the instruction of a traffic control device to enter the scale facility, if
either of the following apply:
      (1)   The in-cab transponder displays a green light or other affirmative
visual signal and also sounds an affirmative audible signal;
      (2)   Any other criterion established by the Superintendent of the State

(ORC 4549.081(B))
414.02  THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All state routes are hereby designated as through highways, provided
that stop signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals shall be erected at
all intersections with such through highways by the Department of
Transportation as to highways under its jurisdiction and by local authorities
as to highways under their jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this
section.  Where two or more state routes that are through highways intersect,
and no traffic-control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall
be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local
authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section. 
Whenever the Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations.  When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his or her jurisdiction.  Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this division, he or she shall give notice, in
writing, of that proposed action to the affected local authority at least 30
days before installing or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways, or portions thereof, are hereby designated
as through highways if they are within the Municipality, if they have a
continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of the street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have stop or yield signs or traffic-
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways.  For purposes of this section, the limits of the street or highway,
or portion thereof, shall be the municipal corporation line, the physical
terminus of the street or highway, or any point on the streets or highway at
which vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or
yield to traffic on the intersecting street, provided, that in residence
districts, the Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway,
or portion thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected
residence district shall be indicated by official traffic-control devices. 
Where two or more through highways designated under this division intersect and
no traffic-control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local
authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   The Department or local authorities having jurisdiction need not erect
stop signs at intersections they find to be so constructed as to permit traffic
to safely enter a through highway without coming to a stop.  Signs shall be
erected at such intersections indicating that the operator of a vehicle shall
yield the right-of-way to or merge with all traffic proceeding on the through
highway.
   (d)   Local authorities, with reference to highways under their
jurisdiction, may designate additional through highways, and shall erect stop
signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals at all streets and highways
intersecting such through highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop
or yield intersection, and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to
the intersection.
(ORC 4511.65)
414.03  TRAFFIC CONTROL SIGNAL TERMS AND LIGHTS.
   Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic-control signals exhibiting
different colored lights, or colored lighted arrows, successively one at a time
or in combination, only the colors green, red, and yellow shall be used, except
for special pedestrian signals carrying words or symbols, and these lights
shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as follows:
   (a)   Green Indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may proceed
straight through or turn right or left, unless a sign at the place prohibits
either turn.  But vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left,
shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and pedestrians lawfully within
the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time the signal is exhibited.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in
combination with another indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only
to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or such other movement as is
permitted by other indications shown at the same time. Such vehicular traffic
shall yield the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent
crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as
provided in Section
414.05, pedestrians facing any green signal, except when the sole green signal
is a turn arrow, may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked
crosswalk.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow
signal is thereby warned that the related green movement is being terminated or
that a red indication will be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular
traffic shall not enter the intersection.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal,
unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided in Section
414.05, are thereby advised that there is insufficient time to cross the
roadway before a red indication is shown and no pedestrian shall then start to
cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal alone shall stop at a
clearly marked stop line, but if none, before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection, or if none, then before entering the
intersection and shall remain standing until an indication to proceed is shown
except as provided in divisions (c)(2) and (3) hereof.
      (2)   Unless a sign is in place prohibiting a right turn as provided in
division (c)(5) hereof, vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal may
cautiously enter the intersection to make a right turn after stopping as
required by division (c)(1) hereof. Such vehicular traffic shall yield the
right of way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other
traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   Unless a sign is in place prohibiting a left turn as provided in
division (c)(5) hereof, vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal on a one-
way street that intersects another one-way street on which traffic moves to the
left may cautiously enter the intersection to make a left turn into the one-way
street after stopping as required by division (c)(1) hereof, and yielding the
right of way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other
traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (4)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as
provided in Section
414.05, pedestrians facing a steady red signal alone shall not enter the
roadway.
      (5)   A.   Council may by ordinance, or the authorized local authority
may by rule, prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red signal at any
intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice thereof are
posted at the intersection.
         B.   At the following specified intersections, drivers of motor
vehicles shall be prohibited from making a right turn against a steady red
signal:
            1.   On Milford at Meadowbrook and Warrensville Center;
            2.   On Washington at Warrensville Center;
            3.   On Warrensville Center northbound at Washington;
            4.   On Green Road southbound at Silsby;
            5.   On Silsby eastbound at Green;
            6.   On Cedar eastbound at Fenwick; at Cedar eastbound at
Warrensville Center;

Passed 1-4-2011.)
            9.   On Cedar eastbound at Miramar, during school days at hours
prescribed by the Chief of Police.
            10.   On Miramar northbound at Cedar, during school days at hours
prescribed by the Chief of Police.
(Ord. 2001-10.  Passed 2-5-2001; Ord. 2010-83.  Passed 1-4-2011.)
   (d)   Signals; Locations Other Than Intersections: In the event an official
traffic control signal is erected and maintained at a place other than an
intersection, the provisions of this section shall be applicable except as to
those provisions which by their nature can have no application. Any stop
required shall be made at a sign or marking on the pavement indicating where
the stop shall be made, but in the absence of any such sign or marking the stop
shall be made at the signal.
(1982 Code, § 313.03)
414.04  SIGNAL TO CONTROL LANE DIRECTION OF TRAVEL.
   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
   (a)   A Steady Downward Green Arrow.  A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
   (b)   A Steady Yellow “X”. A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane over
which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is being
made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
   (c)   A Steady White Two-Way Left-Turn Arrow.  A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
   (d)   A Steady White One-Way Left-Turn Arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
   (e)   A Steady Red “X”. A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.
(ORC 4511.131)
414.05  PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   Whenever special pedestrian-control signals exhibiting the words “walk” or
“don’t walk,” or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm are in
place, these signals shall indicate the following instructions:
   (a)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
   (b)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don't
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
   (c)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian shall
not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
   (d)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate the continued
use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those signals
were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
   (e)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and shall
not be used.
(ORC 4511.14)
414.06  RESERVED.
414.07  UNAUTHORIZED SIGNS AND SIGNALS, HIDING FROM VIEW, ADVERTISING.
   (a)   No person shall place, maintain, or display upon or in view of any
highway any unauthorized sign, signal, marking, or device which purports to be,
is an imitation of, or resembles a traffic-control device or railroad sign or
signal, or which attempts to direct the movement of traffic, or hides from view
or interferes with the effectiveness of any traffic-control device or any
railroad sign or signal, and no person shall place or maintain, nor shall any
public authority permit, upon any highway any traffic sign or signal bearing
thereon any commercial advertising.  This section does not prohibit either the
erection upon private property adjacent to highways of signs giving useful
directional information and of a type that cannot be mistaken for traffic-
control devices, or the erection upon private property of traffic-control
devices by the owner of real property in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4511.211 and
4511.432.
   (b)   Every prohibited sign, signal, marking, or device is a public
nuisance, and the authority having jurisdiction over the highway may remove the

      (2)   Knowingly drive upon or over any freshly applied pavement marking
material on the surface of a roadway while the marking material is in an
undried condition, and is marked by flags, markers, signs, or other devices
intended to protect it;
      (3)   Knowingly move, damage, destroy, or otherwise improperly tamper
with a manhole cover.
(ORC 4511.17(A))
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, whoever violates
division (a)(1) or (3) of this section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third
degree.  If a violation of division (a)(1) or (3) of this section creates a
risk of physical harm to any person, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of
the first degree.  If a violation of division (a)(1) or (3) of this section
causes serious physical harm to property that is owned, leased, or controlled
by a State or local authority, the offender is guilty of a felony to be
prosecuted under appropriate State law.
414.09  UNAUTHORIZED POSSESSION OR SALE OF DEVICES.
   (a)   As used in this section, “traffic control device” means any sign,
traffic control signal or other device conforming to and placed or erected in
accordance with the manual adopted under Ohio R.C. 4511.09 by authority of a
public body or official having jurisdiction, for the purpose of regulating,
warning or guiding traffic, including signs denoting the names of streets and

for use; or
      (5)   When the traffic control device has been properly purchased from a
manufacturer for use on private property and the person possessing the device
has a sales receipt for the device or other acknowledgment of sale issued by
the manufacturer.
   (c)   This section does not preclude, and shall not be construed as
precluding, prosecution for theft in violation of Ohio R.C. 2913.02, or a
substantially similar municipal ordinance, or for receiving stolen property in
violation of Ohio R.C. 2913.51, or a substantially similar municipal ordinance.

that violation, and the agency shall issue a written warning or a citation to
the operator.
         C.   If the identity of the operator of the vehicle at the time of the
alleged violation cannot be established, the law enforcement agency may issue a
written warning to the person who owned the vehicle at the time of the alleged

section does not enter a written plea of guilty and does not waive the person’s
right to contest the citation but instead appears in person in the proper court
to answer the charge, the trier of fact cannot find beyond a reasonable doubt
that the person committed that violation unless the emergency personnel who
filed the report appears in person in the court and testifies.

   (d)   Evidence; Tests.
      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a)(1)A. of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle-related, the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn
and analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may
be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) or
(b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse, 
controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a combination
of them in the defendant's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine,
or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged violation as shown by
chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three hours of the time of
the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified in this division
regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect the two-hour time
limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the maximum period of time during
which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as described in that
section. The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, or a combination of them as described in this division when a person
submits to a blood test at the request of a law enforcement officer under Ohio
R.C. 4511.191 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a blood or
urine sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a
registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency
medical technician-paramedic, or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist  shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma.  This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens.  A person
authorized to withdraw blood under this division may refuse to withdraw blood
under this division, if in that person's opinion, the physical welfare of the
person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.  The bodily substance
withdrawn under this division (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed in accordance with
methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual possessing a valid
permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in division (d)(1)B. of this section, "Emergency medical
technician-intermediate" and "Emergency medical technician-paramedic" have the
same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, if there was at
the time the bodily substance was withdrawn a concentration of less than the
applicable concentration of alcohol specified in divisions (a)(1)B., (a)(1)C.,
(a)(1)D. and (a)(1)E. of this section or less than the applicable concentration
of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled
substance specified for a violation of division (a)(1)J. of this section, that
fact may be considered with other competent evidence in determining the guilt
or innocence of the defendant.  This division does not limit or affect a
criminal prosecution for a violation of division (b) of this section.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person's attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.  If the chemical
test was obtained pursuant to division (d)(1)B. of this section, the person
tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified technician,
chemist, or phlebotomist of the person's own choosing administer a chemical
test or tests, at the person's expense, in addition to any administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer.  If the person was under arrest as
described in Ohio R.C. 4511.191(A)(5), the arresting officer shall advise the
person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent
chemical test taken at the person’s own expense. If the person was under arrest
other than described in Ohio R.C. 4511.191(A)(5), the form to be read to the
person to be tested, as required under division (g) of this section, shall
state that the person may have an independent test performed at the person's
expense.  The failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical test by a
person shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the chemical
test or tests taken at the request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in division (d)(4)B. and C. of this section, "National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration" means the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration established as an administration of the United States
Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C. 105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including,
but not limited to, any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
division (d)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Division (d)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (d)(4)B. of this section.
   (e)   Laboratory report.
      (1)   Subject to division (e)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of division (a)(1)B.,
(a)(1)C., (a)(1)D., (a)(1)E., (a)(1)F., (a)(1)G., (a)(1)H., (a)(1)I. or (a)(1)
(J) or (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3), or (b)(4) of this section or for an equivalent
offense that is substantially equivalent to any of those divisions, a
laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a permit by the
Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this division 
that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath,
urine, or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the
information specified in this division shall be admitted as prima facie
evidence of the information and statements that the report contains. The
laboratory report shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;

notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst's or test performer's regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst's or test performer's education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any proceeding,
other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless the
prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant's attorney or, if
the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant's attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant's attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (f)   Limitation of liability.
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, any physician,
registered nurse, emergency medical technician-intermediate, emergency medical

division (g)(2) of this section.  The law enforcement agency by which the
officer is employed shall designate which of the tests shall be administered.
      (4)   Effect of death or unconsciousness.  Any person who is dead or
unconscious, or who  otherwise is in a condition rendering the person incapable
of refusal, shall be deemed to have consented as provided in division (g)(2) of
this section and the test or tests may be administered, subject to Ohio R.C.
313.12 to 313.16.
      (5)   A.   If a law enforcement officer arrests a person for a violation
of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance and if the person
if convicted would be required to be sentenced under Ohio R.C. 4511.19(G)(1)
(c), (d), or (e), the law enforcement officer shall request the person to
submit, and the person shall submit, to a chemical test or tests of the
person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine for the purpose
of determining the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of
a controlled substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood,
blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine. A law enforcement officer who makes a
request pursuant to this division that a person submit to a chemical test or
tests is not required to advise the person of the consequences of submitting
to, or refusing to submit to, the test or tests and is not required to give the
person the form described in division (g)(7) of this section, but the officer
shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that if the person refuses to
take a chemical test the officer may employ whatever reasonable means are
necessary to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person's
whole blood or blood serum or plasma. The officer shall also advise the person
at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent chemical test
taken at the person’s own expense. Divisions (g)(3) and (g)(4) of this section
apply to the administration of a chemical test or tests pursuant to this
division.
         B.   If a person refuses to submit to a chemical test upon a request
made pursuant to division (g)(5)A. of this section, the law enforcement officer
who made the request may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary to
ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole blood
or blood serum or plasma. A law enforcement officer who acts pursuant to this
division to ensure that a person submits to a chemical test of the person’s
whole blood or blood serum or plasma is immune from criminal and civil
liability based upon a claim for assault and battery or any other claim for the
acts, unless the officer so acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a
wanton or reckless manner.
(ORC 4511.191(A))
      (6)   Advice required. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of this
section, the arresting law enforcement officer shall give advice in accordance
with this division to any person under arrest for a violation of division (a)
or (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C.  4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal OVI
ordinance. The officer shall give that advice in a written form that contains
the information described in division (g)(7) of this section and shall read the
advice to the person. The form shall contain a statement that the form was
shown to the person under arrest and read to the person by the arresting
officer. One or more persons shall witness the arresting officer's reading of
the form, and the witnesses shall certify to this fact by signing the form. The
person must submit to the chemical test or tests, subsequent to the request of
the arresting officer, within two hours of the time of the alleged violation
and, if the person does not submit to the test or tests within that two-hour
time limit, the failure to submit automatically constitutes a refusal to submit
to the test or tests.
      (7)   Certification of arrest. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of
this section, if a person is under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of
this section, before the person may be requested to submit to a chemical test
or tests to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance,
metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination content of the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine, the arresting officer
shall read the following form to the person:
   "You now are under arrest for (specifically state the offense under State
law or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which the person was
arrested – operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, a drug, or a
combination of them; operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed
controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance;
operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption; or having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence).
   If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio driving
privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a fee to
have the privileges reinstated.  If you have a prior conviction of O.V.I.,
O.V.U.A.C., or operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed
controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance under
State or municipal law within the preceding 20 years, you are now under arrest
for State O.V.I., and, if you refuse to take a chemical test, you will face
increased penalties if you subsequently are convicted of the State O.V.I.
   (Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence.) If you take any chemical test
required by law and are found to be at or over the prohibited amount of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
your whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine as set by law, your
Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay
a fee to have the privileges reinstated.
   If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical test taken
at your own expense."
      (8)   Actions required by arresting officer. If the arresting law
enforcement officer does not ask a person under arrest as described in division
(g)(5) or (g)(6) of this section to submit to a chemical test or tests under
Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this section, the arresting officer shall seize the Ohio
or out-of-state driver's or commercial driver's license or permit of the person
and immediately forward it to the court in which the arrested person is to
appear on the charge. If the arrested person is not in possession of the
person's license or permit or it is not in the person's vehicle, the officer
shall order the person to surrender it to the law enforcement agency that
employs the officer within 24 hours after the arrest, and, upon the surrender,
the agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the court in
which the person is to appear on the charge. Upon receipt of the license or
permit, the court shall retain it pending the arrested person’s initial
appearance and any action taken under Ohio R.C. 4511.196.
      (9)   A.   If a law enforcement officer asks a person under arrest as
described in division (g)(5) of this section to submit to a chemical test or
tests under that division and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, or if a law enforcement
officer asks a person under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of this
section to submit to a chemical test or tests under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this
section, if the officer advises the person in accordance with this section of
the consequences of the person's refusal or submission, and if either the
person refuses to submit to the test or tests or, unless the arrest was for a
violation of division (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submits to the test or
tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense, the arresting officer shall do all of the following:
            1.   On behalf of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, notify the
person that, independent of any penalties or sanctions imposed upon the person,
the person's Ohio driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege is suspended immediately, that the suspension
will last at least until the person's initial appearance on the charge, which
will be held within five days after the date of the person's arrest or the
issuance of a citation to the person, and that the person may appeal the
suspension at the initial appearance or during the period of time ending 30
days after that initial appearance;
            2.   Seize the driver's or commercial driver's license or permit of
the person and immediately forward it to the Registrar. If the arrested person
is not in possession of the person's license or permit or it is not in the
person's vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the person is
given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the officer's
employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the
Registrar;
            3.   Verify the person's current residence and, if it differs from
that on the person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit, notify
the Registrar of the change;
            4.   Send to the Registrar, within 48 hours after the arrest of the
person, a sworn report that includes all of the following statements:
               a.   That the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that, at
the time of the arrest, the arrested person was operating a vehicle in
violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B) or a municipal OVI ordinance or for
being in physical control of a stationary vehicle in violation of Ohio R.C.
4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
               b.   That the person was arrested and charged with a violation
of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance;
               c.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
the officer asked the person to take the designated chemical test or tests,
advised the person in accordance with this section of the consequences of
submitting to, or refusing to take, the test or tests, and gave the person the
form described in division (g)(7) of this section;
               d.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
either the person refused to submit to the chemical test or tests or, unless
the arrest was for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submitted to the chemical test or
tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense;
               e.   If the person was under arrest as described in division (g)
(5) of this section and the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance
with that division, that the person was under arrest as described in that
division, that the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance with
that division, and that test results indicated a prohibited concentration of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time
of the alleged offense.
         B.   Division (g)(9)A. of this section does not apply to a person who
is arrested for a violation of division (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.194
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, who is asked by a law
enforcement officer to submit to a chemical test or tests under this section,
and who submits to the test or tests, regardless of the amount of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance that the test
results indicate is present in the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine.
      (10)   Sworn report of arresting officer.
         A.   The arresting officer shall give the officer's sworn report that
is completed under this section to the arrested person at the time of the
arrest, or the Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall send the report to the person
by regular first class mail as soon as possible after receipt of the report,
but not later than 14 days after receipt of it. An arresting officer may give
an unsworn report to the arrested person at the time of the arrest provided the
report is complete when given to the arrested person and subsequently is sworn
to by the arresting officer. As soon as possible, but not later than 48 hours
after the arrest of the person, the arresting officer shall send a copy of the
sworn report to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the
charge for which the person was arrested.
         B.   The sworn report of an arresting officer completed under this
section is prima facie proof of the information and statements that it
contains. It shall be admitted and considered as prima facie proof of the
information and statements that it contains in any appeal under Ohio R.C.
4511.197 relative to any suspension of a person's driver's or commercial
driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privilege that results from
the arrest covered by the report.

driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident operating
privilege under this section for the time described in Ohio R.C. 4511.191(B) or
(C) is effective immediately from the time at which the arresting officer
serves the notice of suspension upon the arrested person.  Any subsequent
finding that the person is not guilty of the charge that resulted in the
person's being requested to take the chemical test or tests under division (g)
(1) through (g)(5) of this section does not affect the suspension.
      (12)   Initial appearance.  If a person arrested for operating a vehicle
in violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or
(B), or any other municipal OVI ordinance, or for being in physical control of
a vehicle in violation of division (o) of this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, regardless of whether the
person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege is or is not suspended under Ohio R.C. 4511.191(B) or (C)
or Ohio R.C. Chapter 4510, the person's initial appearance on the charge
resulting from the arrest shall be held within five days of the persons' arrest
or the issuance of the citation to him or her, subject to any continuance
granted by the court pursuant to Ohio R.C. 4511.197 regarding the issues
specified in that section.

attaining the age of 17 years and the person pleads guilty to, is convicted of,
or is adjudicated in juvenile court of having committed a moving violation
during the six-month period commencing on the date on which the person is
issued the probationary driver’s license, the court with jurisdiction over the

determining whether each occupant of the motor vehicle is wearing all of the
available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device as
required by division (d) of this section, or for the sole purpose of issuing a
ticket, citation or summons if that requirement has been or is being violated,
or for causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for a
violation of that requirement.
   (g)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law

in any collision in which the licensee may be involved.  When a demand is
properly made, and the operator has the operator's driver's license on or about

person's failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed

not having obtained a driver's license.

to permit the person to register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to
transfer registration of the vehicle.

vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be

or commercial driver's license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the registrar of motor vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of

or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the

operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this division, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When the

sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to §

pursuant to §
698.02(e)(3) or Ohio R.C. 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of up
to 500 hours. The failure of an offender to complete a term of community
service imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt
under R.C. § 2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case. If the
offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of
this section or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this division, the offense is a minor

if the offender’s license was expired for more than six months at the time of
the offense, the court shall impose a class seven suspension of the offender’s
driver license, commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit,
probationary license, or nonresident operating privilege from the range
specified in Ohio R.C. 4510.02(A)(7).

with electronic monitoring under division (b)(1) or (2) of this section unless,
within 60 days of the date of sentencing, the court issues a written finding on
the record that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the
offender is required to serve the jail term imposed, the offender will not be
able to begin serving that term within the 60-day period following the date of
sentencing.
      (2)   An offender sentenced under this section to a period of house
arrest with electronic monitoring shall be permitted work release during that

section, the privileges shall be granted on the additional condition that the
offender must display restricted license plates, issued under Ohio R.C.
4503.231, on the vehicle driven subject to the privileges, except as provided
in Ohio R.C. 4503.231(B).
      (2)   A suspension of a commercial driver's license under this section
shall be concurrent with any period of suspension or disqualification under
Ohio R.C. 3123.58 or 4506.16. No person who is disqualified for life from

division (b)(2) of this section shall not be considered or used by the trier of
fact in a tort action as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence.
But, the trier of fact may determine based on evidence admitted consistent with
the Ohio Rules of Evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in
the tort action and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that
represents non-economic loss, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011, in a tort
action that could have been recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear
all of the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining
device. Evidence of that failure shall not be used as a basis for a criminal

with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.   It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant;
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor, or seller of the passenger car;
         C.   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that
the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by
some design defect in the passenger car or that the passenger car was not
crashworthy.
   (g)   Penalty.
      (1)   Whoever violates division (b)(1) of this section shall be fined

public peace, property, health and safety. The Police Chief may require the
posting of bond or other security necessary to compensate for any damage to a
roadway or road structure.
      (3)   For each such permit, the Police Chief shall charge ten dollars
($10.00), and for each hour of time or any part thereof spent by each police

or electric bicycle operator who violates any provisions of this Traffic Code
described in division (a) of this section that is applicable to bicycles or
electric bicycles may be issued a ticket, citation, or summons by a law

operator endangered the lives of bicycle riders or electric bicycle riders at
the time of the violation, the court, notwithstanding any provision of the Ohio
Revised Code to the contrary, may require the bicycle operator, electric
bicycle operator, or motor vehicle operator to take and successfully complete a

   (a)   The County Sheriff or Chief of Police, within the Sheriff’s or Chief’s
respective territorial jurisdiction, or a state highway patrol trooper, upon
notification to the Sheriff or Chief of Police of such action and of the
location of the place of storage, may order into storage any motor vehicle,
including an abandoned junk motor vehicle as defined in R.C. § 4513.63, that:
      (1)   Has come into the possession of the Sheriff, Chief of Police, or

         A.   The vehicle was involved in an accident and is subject to R.C. §
4513.66, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;

retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage
facility fails to provide the notice required under R.C. § 4513.69(B)(3), if
applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
Sheriff, Chief of Police, or a state highway patrol trooper, as applicable, to
be necessary to a criminal investigation;
            2.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger

      (3)   If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a
search of the records of the Bureau of Motor Vehicles has been conducted and
after notice has been sent to the owner or lienholder as described in this
section, and the search was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice
was sent to the motor vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or
lienholder shall pay to the place of storage a processing fee of $25, in
addition to any expenses or charges incurred in the removal and storage of the
vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of mailing of the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at public auction as provided in R.C. § 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the Sheriff or Chief of Police,
without charge to any party, shall file with the Clerk of Courts of the county
in which the place of storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with
the requirements of this section. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the
Clerk, without charge, shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and
clear of all liens and encumbrances, to the Sheriff or Chief of Police. If the
vehicle is to be disposed of to a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other
facility as provided in R.C. § 4513.62 or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, the Sheriff or Chief of Police shall execute in triplicate
an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, describing the
motor vehicle and the manner in which it was disposed of, and that all
requirements of this section have been complied with. The Sheriff or Chief of
Police shall retain the original of the affidavit for the Sheriff’s or Chief’s
records, and shall furnish two copies to the motor vehicle salvage dealer or
other facility. Upon presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the motor
vehicle salvage dealer, the Clerk of Courts, within 30 days of the
presentation, shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all
liens and encumbrances.
   (e)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the
dealer or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title
to the motor vehicle in the dealer’s or facility’s own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
Clerk of Courts.
   (f)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with this
section.
(R.C. § 4513.61)

vehicle, as defined in R.C. § 4513.63, on private property for more than 72
hours without the permission of the person having the right to the possession
of the property, or on a public street or other property open to the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway for 48 hours or longer without notification to the Police
Chief of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in that place.
         B.   For purposes of this division (g)(1), the fact that a motor
vehicle has been so left without permission or notification is prima facie
evidence of abandonment.
         C.   Nothing contained in this section and R.C. §§ 4513.60, 4513.61
and 4513.63 shall invalidate or prevent the enactment of further provisions of
municipal ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor
vehicles on streets, highways, public property or private property within the
municipality.
      (2)   Whoever violates this division (g) is guilty of a minor misdemeanor
and shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the municipality in disposing
of the abandoned junk motor vehicle, less any money accruing to the
municipality from the disposal.

adopted under R.C. § 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle.
However, if the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal
corporation has established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall
give the owner or operator oral or written notification that the owner or
operator may pay not more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the
motor vehicle. That fee may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the
towing service uses a mobile credit card processor and mobile service is not

   There shall be a resident permit parking program in the City of University
Heights to govern parking of residents' and visitor's motor vehicles on
designated city streets in restricted areas during designated times, as
follows:
   (a)   Establishment of Restricted Area.
      (1)   One or more residents or property owners of the City of University
Heights, the Chief of Police or the City Engineer may petition the City Council
to amend these ordinances in order to establish, extend, reduce or delete an
area in which parking shall be restricted to vehicles displaying valid resident
permits for that area. In order for a resident's or property owner's petition
to establish or extend a restricted area to be considered by the City Council,
it must be submitted with signatures of one or more residents of each of at
least 50% of the dwelling units located in the area in which parking
restrictions are proposed. Such an area may be any portion or all or one or
more streets, but the minimum proposed restricted area must be at least one
street block in length, and any restricted area must be bordered only by
properties the primary use of which is residential.
      (2)   Upon receipt of such a petition as specified above, the City
Council shall schedule a public hearing within 120 days and notices of such
hearing shall be sent to abutters and to those residents and property owners of
record at all addresses within 500 feet of the proposed or existing area. The
City Council shall not deny a petition because of defects in the notice
procedure required by this section, unless a resident, property owner, or
abutter has been prejudiced thereby.
      (3)   Prior to said hearing, the City Engineer and/or Chief of Police or
his or her designee shall undertake a survey and review of traffic and parking
conditions in the area of the proposed restriction and make a recommendation to
the City Council regarding the implementation of said restriction, including
any modifications to the boundaries of the area.
      (4)   In reviewing the petition, the City Engineer and/or Chief of Police
shall consider the following criteria:
         A.   Vehicular circulation and safety;
         B.   Pedestrian safety;
         C.   Lack of convenient off-street parking for residents of the area
of the proposed restriction;
         D.   Level of demand for on-street parking by non-residents of the
area of the proposed restriction, including analysis of probable displacement
of non-residential parking to adjacent area if the proposed restrictions should
be implemented;
         E.   Extent to which existing and/or alternative parking regulations
are ineffective to deal with parking problems in the area of the proposed
restriction;
      (5)   The City Council may establish a restricted area only in an area
where alternative parking restrictions, such as time limitations or parking
prohibitions, have been in effect for at least one (1) year immediately prior
to the petition. The City Council shall review the effectiveness of the
existing restrictions prior to establishment of a new restricted area.
      (6)   Following the public hearing, the City Council may adopt an
ordinance establishing or deleting one or more areas, as related to the
petition, in which parking shall be restricted to residents of the particular
restricted areas during time periods to be established by City Council.
   (b)   Issuance of Resident Parking Permits.
      (1)   Resident parking permits shall identify the restricted area to
which they apply and shall be of a design specified by the Chief of Police.
Four such permits for a restricted area shall be issued by the Chief of Police
or his or her designee to the resident of an address within the restricted area
or which is contiguous to a lot that borders said restricted area, as
established in accordance with division (a) above, and which otherwise
qualifies for issuance of a permit under this section. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the resident of a lot which is contiguous to the rear lot line of a
non-corner bordering the restricted area will not be entitled to a permit.
      (2)   Upon establishment of a restricted area by the City Council, the
City Engineer shall determine those addresses which shall be eligible to
receive resident parking permits and forward a list of such addresses to the
Chief of Police and to the Building Commissioner. The Building Commissioner
shall provide a description of the use at each address including the existing
number of dwelling units, and forward that information to the Chief of Police.
      (3)   If an application for a parking permit contains a vehicle not
registered to the permit residence, the Chief of Police or his or her designee
may request proof of residency. Acceptable proof of residency hereof will
consist of either:
         A.   A current registration certificate issued by the Ohio Bureau of
Motor Vehicles, stating the information required in division (1); or
         B.   A current registration certificate issued by the Ohio Bureau of
Motor Vehicles accompanied by a "Change of Address Form", properly completed
and stating the information required in division (1). The Police Department may
require the Bureau of Motor Vehicles "Change of Address Form" to be completed
by the applicant and left with the department for mailing directly to the
Bureau of Motor Vehicles if there is any doubt as to the authenticity of the
applicant's proof under division (3) B. The Bureau form must contain the
information required in division (1).
      (4)   The number of resident parking permits issued to a resident at an
eligible address shall be limited as follows: the maximum number of resident
parking stickers for residents at eligible address shall be four per dwelling
unit.

provision in this chapter to the contrary, no penalty shall be imposed for the
parking on any street designated as resident permit parking of any vehicle
owned and operated by a disabled veteran or handicapped person whose vehicle
bears the distinctive number plate authorized by the Ohio Bureau of Motor
Vehicles or for the parking of any vehicle used to transport a disabled veteran
or handicapped person which bears a properly displayed special parking
identification placard as authorized by the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles.
         E.   Parking permits are for the residents of the house to which they
are issued in that zone only and for visitors at that address only.
         F.   Parking permits are not valid in other residential permit zones.
         G.   Parking permits shall not be sold, leased or transferred to any
other person. Any tags so transferred are null and void.
         H.   Parking permits shall be displayed on the motor vehicle in full
view and completely readable from the exterior of the vehicle by hanging same
on the back of the inside rear view mirror.
   (c)   Exemptions. The Chief of Police or the Chief's designee may, at his or
her discretion and upon request of any resident at an eligible address, waiver
the permit parking restrictions in a restricted area for a limited period of
time.
   (d)   Other Provisions Governing Resident Sticker Parking and Visitor Permit
Parking.
      (1)   Applications for resident stickers or visitor permits shall be made
on a form prescribed by the Chief of Police or his or her designee.
      (2)   Resident permits and ordinances governing their use shall be
effective in locations and during hours established in accordance with division
(a) above. All other parking and traffic regulations and ordinances of the City
of University Heights shall remain in full force and effect and must be obeyed
by permit holders.
      (3)   Resident permits do not authorize holders to park overnight on
streets or in municipal lots.
      (4)   All permit parking shall automatically be suspended upon the
declaration of a snow emergency or any disaster in the City by the Chief of
Police or his or her designee.
      (5)   Resident permits will automatically be revoked if a motor vehicle
ceases to qualify under this ordinance, if the sticker or permit is applied to
a vehicle other than the one so designated at the time of application, or the
application for a visitor permit ceases to qualify under this section.
      (6)   Resident permits if not properly affixed or displayed on the motor
vehicle, shall be deemed not to be in effect.
      (7)   In case of lost or stolen permits, the fee for issuance of a
replacement resident permit shall be $5.00 each.
      (8)   No parking restrictions established hereunder shall be effective on

provision to any person or circumstances shall be held invalid, the validity of

another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (g)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this Municipality.
   (h)   For purposes of division (a)(2) of this section, an overt act is

   (b)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in division (b)(2) of this section,
if the period of limitation provided in division (a)(1) or (a)(3) of this
section has expired, prosecution shall be commenced for an offense of which an
element is fraud or breach of fiduciary duty within one year after discovery of
the offense either by an aggrieved person or by the aggrieved person's legal
representative who is not a party to the offense.
      (2)   If the period of limitation provided in division (a)(1) or (a)(3)
of this section has expired, prosecution for a violation of Ohio R.C. 2913.49
shall be commenced within five years after discovery of the offense either by
an aggrieved person or the aggrieved person’s legal representative who is not a
party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in division (a)(1) or (a)
(3) of this section has expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the
following offenses during the following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant

         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two

      (2)   As used in this division:
         A.   The phrase “offense is directly related to the misconduct in
office of a public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of
Ohio R.C. 101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, 102.03(F) or (H), 2921.02(A),

involving misconduct in office of a public servant, or a violation of any
municipal ordinance substantially equivalent to those Ohio Revised Code
sections listed in this division (c)(2)A.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2921.01.
   (d)   (1)   If a DNA record made in connection with the criminal
investigation of the commission of a violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03 is
determined to match another DNA record that is of an identifiable person and if
the time of the determination is later than 25 years after the offense is
committed, prosecution of that person for a violation of the section may be
commenced within five years after the determination is complete.
      (2)   If a DNA record made in connection with the criminal investigation
of the commission of a violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03 is determined to
match another DNA record that is of an identifiable person and if the time of
the determination is within 25 years after the offense is committed,
prosecution of that person for a violation of the section may be commenced
within the longer of 25 years after the offense is committed or five years
after the determination is complete.
      (3)   As used in this division, “DNA record” has the same meaning as in
R.C. § 109.573.
   (e)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs.  In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused’s accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (f)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation, or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first.  A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same.  A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation, or other process unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution.  Proof that the accused departed this
Municipality or conceals the accused’s identity or whereabouts is prima facie
evidence of the accused’s purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (i)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information, or process that commenced the prosecution
is quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information, or process are
set aside or reversed on appeal.
   (j)   The period of limitation for a violation of this Part 6 or Title XXIX
of the Ohio Revised Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability, or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under 18 years of age or of a child with a developmental disability

either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which

violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03 committed on and after July 16, 2015 and

2015 if prosecution for that violation was not barred under this section as it
existed on July 15, 2015.
(ORC 2901.13)
   (m)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
606.07  REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY; VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, a person is not
guilty of an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one division
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that division does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose
to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other divisions
of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses defined
in R.C. Title XLV.
      (3)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution of
the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense.  Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense.  Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Culpability.”  Purpose, knowledge, recklessness, or negligence, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2901.22.
      (2)   “Intoxication.”  Includes but is not limited to intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
      (3)   “Involuntary acts.”  Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during
unconsciousness or sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product
of the actor’s volition are involuntary acts.
      (4)   “Possession.”  A voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
(ORC 2901.21)
606.08  CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. When knowledge of
the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge
is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high
probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious
purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of
a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with
heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial
and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature.  A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge, or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element.  When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element.  When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
606.09  ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent,
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer,
agent, or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the
scope of the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except
that if the section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or
employees for whose conduct the organization is accountable or the
circumstances under which it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated, or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners, or by a
high managerial officer, agent, or employee acting in behalf of the
organization and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or
employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent, or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission.  This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, “organization” means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust, or other commercial or
legal entity.  “Organization” does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.
(ORC 2901.23)
606.10  PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent, or employee of an organization, as defined in Ohio
R.C. 2901.23, may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization,
if he or she acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of
the offense, and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he or she engages
in conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such
conduct, or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he or she has
direct responsibility;
      (2)   He or she has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on
the organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
or she is subject to the same penalty as if he or she had acted in his or her
own behalf.
(ORC 2901.24)
606.11  ATTEMPTS.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense, of
complicity in the commission of an offense, or of conspiracy to commit an
offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to commit the same offense in
violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned his or her effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense.  An attempt to commit aggravated murder, murder, or an offense for
which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for life is a felony of the first
degree, to be prosecuted under appropriate State law. An attempt to commit a
drug abuse offense for which the penalty is determined by the amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance involved in the drug abuse offense is
an offense of the same degree as the drug abuse offense attempted would be if
that drug abuse offense had been committed and had involved an amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance that is within the next lower range
of controlled substance amounts than was involved in the attempt. An attempt to
commit any other offense is an offense of the next lesser degree than the
offense attempted.  In the case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a

commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he or she
were a principal offender.  A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of
this section, or in terms of the principal offense.

retreat before using force in self defense, defense of another, or defense of
that person’s residence, and a person who lawfully is an occupant of that

excluding any information regarding the report containing the knowledge or
belief noted under division (f)(1) of this section, and the information may be

any liability or recrimination for a breach of privilege or confidence.

of the alleged violation.  Also, the accused person is entitled, upon further
written request, to receive copies of all recorded scientific data that result
from the measurement or weighing and that can be used by an analyst in arriving
at conclusions, findings, or opinions concerning the weight, volume, or number
of unit doses of the substance subject to the measurement or weighing.

the basis of, or involved in, the offense to determine whether the substance
contained any amount of a controlled substance if the results of the tests
indicate that the substance tested contained any controlled substance. No court

on a substance if the results of the tests do not indicate that the substance
tested contained any controlled substance. The court shall hold a hearing to

Chapter 1280 and the ability of the Building Commissioner to waive prior
citations as they relate to the revocation of rental permits if the owner/
landlord can prove, to the Building Commissioner's satisfaction, that the
property is being rented to tenants not involved in prior citations.  Notice
shall be served as set forth in Section
648.17 of the Codified Ordinances.
   (c)   The City may abate any nuisance activity as declared in this section
by responding to the activity using administrative and law enforcement actions,
and the costs of such abatement shall be assessed on the nuisance property in
the same manner as in Section
648.17 of the Codified Ordinances, and the costs shall be as set forth in
division (e) of this section. The City shall provide notice to the owner of the
nuisance property of the City's intent to assess the costs of abatement against
the owner's property at least 30 days before such costs are certified to the
County for assessment against the property, and such notice shall contain a
description of the nuisance activity that is the basis for the notice of intent
to assess the property, and the cost to abate. Notice shall be served as set
forth in Section
648.17 of the Codified Ordinances.

of Police or his designee pursuant to this section may appeal such notice by
submitting a written request for reconsideration to the Chief of Police within
30 days of the date of the notice. If the Chief of Police finds that the facts
presented do not support the declaration of a nuisance, the Chief shall rescind
the notice. Otherwise the Chief shall deny the request and refer the appeal for
hearing by the Board of Zoning Appeals. Any such appeal shall not stay any
actions by the City to abate the first or any subsequent nuisance activity. In
any such appeal, the City must show by a preponderance of the evidence that
each violation stated in the notice being appeal has occurred, and that the
declaration of the property as a nuisance property or of the intent of the City
to assess the property for abatement costs is justified.
   (e)   Costs of abatement shall be two hundred and fifty dollars ($250.00)
for the third nuisance activity and five hundred dollars ($500.00) on each
subsequent nuisance activity.
   (f)   The declaration of a nuisance property, an order to abate a nuisance,
or the assessment of costs by the City on a property, do not affect or limit
the City's right or authority to bring criminal prosecution or other legal
action against any person for violation of the City's ordinances.
   (g)   For purposes of this section, the occurrence of a nuisance activity
means that a citation has been issued, or an arrest has been made for one or
more of the offenses or activities listed in division (a) of this section.
   (h)   This section shall be attached to the application for a rental permit
issued pursuant to Section
1280.10.

672.03  DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or services is involved in a theft
offense or in a violation of Ohio R.C. 1716.14(A) involving a victim who is an
elderly person or disabled adult, or any substantially similar municipal
ordinance, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate
value of all property or services involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.02, or a series
of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate,
or complicity in violations of Ohio R.C. 1716.14(A), Ohio R.C. 2913.02,
2913.03, or 2913.04, Ohio R.C. 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2), or Ohio R.C. 2913.31 or
2913.43 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense.  When a series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02, or a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or
complicity in violations of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43 involving a victim who is
an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. The value of the property or services involved in the series of
offenses for the purpose of determining the value as required by Ohio R.C.
2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property and services involved in all
offenses in the series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.02
that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims, all of
the offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If an offender is being tried
for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation
of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Ohio R.C. 1716.14
(A), Ohio R.C. 2913.02, 2913.03, or 2913.04, Ohio R.C. 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2),
or Ohio R.C. 2913.31 or 2913.43, whether committed against one victim or more
than one victim, involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult,
or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, 
pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried
as a single offense. If an offender is being tried for the commission of a
series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to
violate, or complicity in violations of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, whether
committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving a victim who is
an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member
pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried
as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the value
of the property or services involved for the purpose of determining the value
as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property and
services involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   When a series of two or more offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.40,
2913.48, or 2921.41 is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another, all of those offenses may be
tried as a single offense.  If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the
value of the property or services involved for the purpose of determining the
value as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all
property and services involved in all of the offenses in the series of two or
more offenses.
      (4)   In prosecuting a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2) or
(b)(3) of this section, it is not necessary to separately allege and prove each
offense in the series.  Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the
offender, within a given span of time, committed one or more theft offenses or
violations of Ohio R.C. 2913.40, 2913.48, or 2921.41 in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in division (b)
(1) or (b)(3) of this section, or committed one or more theft offenses that
involve a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims or a scheme or
course of conduct as described in division (b)(2) of this section. While it is
not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series in
order to prosecute a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) of
this section, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a single offense to
prove the aggregate value of the property or services in order to meet the
requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector’s item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that either is irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort, or money, is the amount which
would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment, and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation, or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under division (c)(1) of this section, and which retains substantial utility
for its purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing
such property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under division (c)(1) or (2) of this section, and the value of services, is the
fair market value of the property or services.  As used in this section, “fair
market value” is the money consideration which a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence which may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is prima
facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest marked quotation prior to the offense, is prima facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry, or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry, or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check, or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token, or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services which may be received by the
instrument is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping, or other services for which the rate is established
by law, the duly established rate is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing, or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.

698.02  PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   Considerations in Misdemeanor Sentencing.
      (1)   A court that sentences an offender for a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of any provision of the Ohio Revised Code, or of any
municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent to a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, shall be guided
by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing. The overriding purposes
of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the
offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the
sentencing court shall consider the impact of the offense upon the victim and
the need for changing the offender's behavior, rehabilitating the defender, and
making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or the victim and
the public.
      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation
of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of a municipal ordinance
that is subject to division (b)(1) of this section shall be reasonably
calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing set
forth in division (a)(1) of this section, commensurate with and not demeaning
to the seriousness of the offender's conduct and its impact upon the victim,
and consistent with sentences imposed for similar offenses committed by similar
offenders.
      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a
violation of a municipal ordinance that is subject to division (b)(1) of this
section shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic background, gender,
or religion of the offender.
      (4)   Divisions (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section shall not apply to any
offense that is disposed of by a traffic violations bureau of any court
pursuant to Traffic Rule 13 and shall not apply to any violation of any
provision of the Ohio Revised Code that is a minor misdemeanor and that is
disposed of without a court appearance. Divisions (b)(1) to (b)(3) of this
section do not affect any penalties established by the municipality for a
violation of its ordinances that are not substantially equivalent to a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised
Code.
(ORC 2929.21)
   (b)   Misdemeanor Jail Terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in Section
666.99 or
698.03 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 or division (b)(5) or (b)
(6) of this section and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant
to law, if the sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor elects or is required to impose a jail term on the offender
pursuant to this chapter, the court shall impose a definite jail term that
shall be one of the following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than 180 days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than 90 days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than 60 days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than 30 days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under
division (b) of this section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in
intermittent confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as
provided in division (d)(2) of this section.  The court retains jurisdiction
over every offender sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at
any time, but the court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court's consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court's
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender's jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under division (b)
of this section and the court assigns the offender to a County Jail that has
established a County Jail Industry Program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the
court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be
considered for participation in the program. During the offender's term in the
County Jail, the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification
regarding the offender's participation in the County Jail Industry Program.
      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to division (b) of
this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in
which the term is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio
R.C.  307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56,
or 2947.19 and Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in division
(b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times specified in
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the Clerk of the Court may issue a certificate of judgment
against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in division (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
      (5)   If an offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation
of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(B), or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance,
also is convicted of or also pleads guilty to a specification of the type
described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1414 and if the court imposes a jail term on the
offender for the underlying offense, the court shall impose upon the offender
an additional definite jail term of not more than six months. The additional
jail term shall not be reduced pursuant to any provision of the Ohio Revised
Code. The offender shall serve the additional jail term consecutively to and
prior to the jail term imposed for the underlying offense and consecutively to
any other mandatory term imposed in relation to the offense.
      (6)   A.   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on
the offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the
offender an additional definite jail term as follows:
            1.   Subject to division (b)(6)A.2. of this section, an additional
definite jail term of not more than 60 days;
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of Ohio R.C. 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 regarding one or
more of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than 120
days.
         B.   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (b)(6)A. of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (b)(6)A. of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division shall commence on the date specified by the court, provided that
the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has served the jail
term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24,
2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and
any residential sanction imposed for the violation under division (d) of this
section or Ohio R.C. 2929.26. A sanction imposed under this division shall be
considered to be a community control sanction for purposes of division (c) or
this section or Ohio R.C. 2929.25, and all provisions of this Code and the Ohio
Revised Code that pertain to community control sanctions shall apply to a
sanction imposed under this division, except to the extent that they would by
their nature be clearly inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs
associated with a sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of
the use of the monitoring device.
      (7)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1423 that charges that
the victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at
the time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory
jail term that is a definite term of at least 30 days.
      (8)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(b), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s own motion, the court, in
the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one or more community control sanctions under division (d) or (e) of this
section for any jail days that are not mandatory jail days.
(ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Misdemeanor Community Control Sanctions.
      (1)   A.   Except as provided in Section
666.99 and
698.03 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.22 and 2929.23 or when a jail term is
required by law, in sentencing an offender for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, the sentencing court may do either of the following:
            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of one or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this
section. The court may impose any other conditions of release under a community
control sanction that the court considers appropriate. If the court imposes a
jail term upon the offender, the court may impose any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions in addition to the jail
term.
            2.   Impose a jail term under division (b) of this section from the
range of jail terms authorized under that division for the offense, suspend all
or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this section.
         B.   The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon an
offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not exceed five years.
         C.   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)
(1)A.1. of this section, the court shall state the duration of the community
control sanctions imposed and shall notify the offender that if any of the
conditions of the community control sanctions are violated the court may do any
of the following:
            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community control sanction
if the total time under all of the offender's community control sanctions does
not exceed the five- year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this section;
            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control sanction under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, but the court is not required to
impose any particular sanction or sanctions;
            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (b) of this section.
      (2)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control sanction
or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)(1)A.1.
of this section, the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender
and the period of community control for the duration of the period of community
control. Upon the motion of either party or on the court’s own motion, the
court, in the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may
modify the community control sanctions or conditions of release previously
imposed, substitute a community control sanction or condition of release for
another community control sanction or condition of release previously imposed,
or impose an additional community control sanction or condition of release.
      (3)   A.   If a court sentences an offender to any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, the court shall place the offender
under the general control and supervision of the court or of a department of
probation in the jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes of reporting
to the court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. If
the offender resides in another jurisdiction and a department of probation has
been established to serve the Municipal Court or County Court in that
jurisdiction, the sentencing court may request the Municipal Court or the
County Court to receive the offender into the general control and supervision
of that department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing
court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The
sentencing court retains jurisdiction over any offender whom it sentences for
the duration of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
         B.   The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
State without the permission of the court or the offender’s probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and ensuring
the offender's good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on
the offender.  The offender's compliance with the additional requirements also
shall be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the
offender.
      (4)   A.   If the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences the
offender to any community control sanction or combination of community control
sanctions authorized under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, and the
offender violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the public or private
person or entity that supervises or administers the program or activity that
comprises the sanction shall report the violation directly to the sentencing
court or to the department of probation or probation officer with general
control and supervision over the offender. If the public or private person or
entity reports the violation to the department of probation or probation
officer, the department or officer shall report the violation to the sentencing
court.
         B.   If an offender violates any condition of a community control
sanction, the sentencing court may impose upon the violator one or more of the
following penalties:
            1.   A longer time under the same community control sanction if the
total time under all of the community control sanctions imposed on the violator
does not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this
section;
            2.   A more restrictive community control sanction;
            3.   A combination of community control sanctions, including a jail
term.
         C.   If an offender was acting pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2925.11(B)(2)(b),
or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and in so doing violated
the conditions of a community control sanction based on a minor drug possession
offense, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2925.11, the sentencing court may consider the
offender’s conduct in seeking or obtaining medical assistance for another in
good faith or for self or may consider the offender being the subject of
another person seeking or obtaining medical assistance in accordance with that
division as a mitigating factor before imposing any of the penalties described
in division (c)(4)B. of this section.
         D.   If the court imposes a jail term upon a violator pursuant to
division (c)(4)B. of this section, the total time spent in jail for the
misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community control
sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the offense for
which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may reduce the
longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under the longer
sanction or the more restrictive sanction imposed under division (c)(4)B. of
this section by all or part of the time the violator successfully spent under
the sanction that was initially imposed.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an offender, for
a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a community control
sanction imposed pursuant to division (d), (e), or (f) of this section in an
exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time under the community
control sanction or impose a less restrictive community control sanction.
Fulfilling the conditions of a community control sanction does not relieve the
offender of a duty to make restitution under division (f) of this section.
(ORC 2929.25)
   (d)   Community Residential Sanction.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court

impose upon the offender any community residential sanction or combination of
community residential sanctions under this division (d).  Community residential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         A.   A term of up to 180 days in a halfway house or a term in a

responsibility for paying the costs of confining the offender in a jail has
entered into a contract with the halfway house for use of the facility for
misdemeanor offenders;
         B.   If the offender is an eligible offender, as defined in R.C. §
307.932, a term in a community alternative sentencing center or district
community alternative sentencing center established and operated in accordance
with that section, in the circumstances specified in that section, with one of
the conditions of the sanction being that the offender successfully complete
the portion of the sentence to be served in the center.
      (2)   A sentence to a community residential sanction under division (d)
(1)C. of this section shall be in accordance with R.C. § 307.932. In all other
cases, the court that sentences an offender to a community residential sanction
under this division (d) may do either or both of the following:
         A.   Permit the offender to serve the offender's sentence in
intermittent confinement, overnight, on weekends or at any other time or times
that will allow the offender to continue at the offender's occupation or care
for the offender's family;
         B.   Authorize the offender to be released so that the offender may
seek or maintain employment, receive education or training, receive treatment,
perform community service, or otherwise fulfill an obligation imposed by law or
by the court. A release pursuant to this division shall be only for the
duration of time that is needed to fulfill the purpose of the release and for
travel that reasonably is necessary to fulfill the purposes of release.
      (3)   The court may order that a reasonable portion of the income earned
by the offender upon a release pursuant to division (d)(2) of this section be
applied to any financial sanction imposed under division (f) of this section.
      (4)   No court shall sentence any person to a prison term for a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor, or to a jail term for a minor misdemeanor.
      (5)   If a court sentences a person who has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor to a community residential sanction as described in
division (d)(1) of this section, at the time of reception and at other times
the person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction determines to be appropriate, the person in charge of the operation of
the halfway house, community alternative sentencing center, district community
alternative sentencing center, or other place may cause the convicted offender
to be examined and tested for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis,
including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C, and other contagious
diseases. The person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction may cause a convicted offender in the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place who refuses to be tested or treated for tuberculosis,
HIV infection, hepatitis, including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C,
or another contagious disease to be tested and treated involuntarily.
      (6)   The Municipality may enter into a contract with a halfway house for
use of the halfway house to house misdemeanor offenders under a sanction
imposed under division (d)(1)A. of this section.
(ORC 2929.26)
   (e)   Nonresidential Sanction Where Jail Term is not Mandatory.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may

ordinance or a violation of Ohio R.C.  2903.13 or a substantially similar
municipal ordinance involving a person who was a family or household member at
the time of the violation, if the offender committed the offense in the
vicinity of one or more children who are not victims of the offense, and if the
offender or the victim of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian, or
person in loco parentis of one or more of those children. This division does
not limit the court in requiring that the offender obtain counseling for any
offense or in any circumstance not specified in this division.
      (2)   If the court imposes a term of community service pursuant to
division (e)(1)C. of this section, the offender may request that the court
modify the sentence to authorize the offender to make a reasonable
contribution, as determined by the court, to the general fund of the county,
municipality, or other local entity that provides funding to the court. The
court may grant the request if the offender demonstrates a change in
circumstances from the date the court imposes the sentence or that the
modification would otherwise be in the interests of justice. If the court
grants the request, the offender shall make a reasonable contribution to the
court, and the clerk of the court shall deposit that contribution into the
general fund of the county, municipality, or other local entity that provides
funding to the court. If more than one entity provides funding to the court,
the clerk shall deposit a percentage of the reasonable contribution equal to
the percentage of funding the entity provides to the court in that entity’s
general fund.
      (3)   In addition to the sanctions authorized under division (e)(1) of
this section, the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, upon an offender who is not required to serve a mandatory
jail term may impose any other sanction that is intended to discourage the
offender or other persons from committing a similar offense if the sanction is
reasonably related to the overriding purposes and principles of misdemeanor
sentencing.
      (4)   The court imposing a sentence for a minor misdemeanor may impose a
term of community service in lieu of all or part of a fine. The term of
community service imposed for a minor misdemeanor shall not exceed 30 hours.

(ORC 2929.27)
   (f)   Financial Sanctions.
      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2947.23,
the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a
minor misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or
combination of financial sanctions authorized under this division (f). If the
court in its discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial
sanctions that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not
limited to, the following:
         A.   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor or could
be disposed of by the Traffic Violations Bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the offender's crime or
any survivor of the victim, in an amount based upon the victim's economic loss.
The court may not impose restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if
the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be disposed of by the Traffic
Violations Bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13. If the court
requires restitution, the court shall order that the restitution be made to the
victim in open court or to the adult probation department that serves the
jurisdiction or the Clerk of the Court on behalf of the victim.
            2.   If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine
the amount of restitution to be paid by the offender. The court may base the
amount of restitution it orders on an amount recommended by the victim, the
offender, a presentence investigation report, estimates or receipts indicating
the cost of repairing or replacing property, and other information, provided
that the amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court decides to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
or survivor disputes the amount of restitution. If the court holds an
evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the victim or survivor has the burden to
prove by a preponderance of the evidence the amount of restitution sought from
the offender.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any
survivor of the victim against the offender.  No person may introduce evidence
of an award of restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under R.C. § 3937.18.
            4.   If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the
offender pay a surcharge, of not more than 5% of the amount of the restitution
otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and processing
restitution payments.
            5.   The victim or survivor of the victim may request that the
prosecutor in the case file a motion, or the offender may file a motion, for
modification of the payment terms of any restitution ordered. If the court
grants the motion, it may modify the payment terms as it determines
appropriate.

section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is able
to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may
collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under that

confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under
Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
      (2)   A.   If the court determines a hearing is necessary, the court may
hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay the financial
sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f) or court costs or is likely in
the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.
         B.   If the court determines that the offender is indigent and unable
to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court shall consider imposing
and may impose a term of community service under division (e)(1) of this
section in lieu of imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If the court
does not determine that the offender is indigent, the court may impose a term
of community service under division (e)(1) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this division (f) and in
addition to imposing court costs. The court may order community service for a
minor misdemeanor pursuant to division (e)(4) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this section and in addition to
imposing court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial sanction or court
costs, the court may order community service in lieu of the financial sanction
or court costs.
      (3)   A.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a county pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e),
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to the County
Treasurer. The County Treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements in the
County's General Fund. The County shall use the amounts deposited in the fund

division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.

municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under division  (d),
(e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine
offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to
the Treasurer of the municipal corporation. The Treasurer shall deposit the
reimbursements in the municipal corporation's General Fund in accordance with
division (f)(8) of this section. The municipal corporation shall use the
amounts deposited in the fund to pay the costs incurred by the municipal
corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e), or (f) of
this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders pursuant to a
sanction imposed under division (d) of this section.
         C.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)C. of this section for the costs incurred by a private provider
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section
to the provider.
      (4)   In addition to any other fine that is or may be imposed under this
division (f), the court imposing sentence upon an offender for misdemeanor
domestic violence or menacing by stalking may impose a fine of not less than
seventy dollars ($70.00) nor more than five hundred dollars ($500.00), which
shall be transmitted to the Treasurer of Ohio to be credited to the address
confidentiality program fund created by Ohio R.C. 111.48.
      (5)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this division (f)(5), a
financial sanction imposed under division (f)(1) of this section is a judgment
in favor of the State or the political subdivision that operates the court that
imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial
sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed
pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.a. of this section upon an offender is a
judgment in favor of the entity administering the community control sanction. 
A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.b.
of this section upon an offender confined in a jail or other residential
facility is a judgment in favor of the entity operating the jail or other
residential facility. A financial sanction of restitution imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)A. of this section is an order in favor of the victim of the
offender’s criminal act that can be collected through a certificate of judgment
as described in division (f)(5)B.1. of this section, through execution as
described in division (f)(5)B.2. of this section or through an order as
described in division (f)(5)B.3. of this section and the offender shall be
considered for purposes of the collection as a judgment debtor.
         B.   Once a financial sanction is imposed as a judgment or order under
this division, the victim, private provider, State, or political subdivision
may do any of the following:
            1.   Obtain from the Clerk of the court in which the judgment was
entered a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same manner and form as
a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;
            2.   Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in Ohio R.C.
2929.18(D)(1) and (D)(2)  or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
            3.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under Ohio R.C. 1321.33 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
      (6)   The civil remedies authorized under division (f)(5) of this section
for the collection of the financial sanction supplement, but do not preclude,
enforcement of the criminal sentence.
      (7)   Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (f) may designate the Clerk of the Court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The Clerk, or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:
         A.   Enter into contracts with one or more public agencies or private
vendors for the collection of amounts due under the sanction. Before entering
into a contract for the collection of amounts due from an offender pursuant to
any financial sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f), a court shall
comply with Ohio R.C. 307.86 to 307.92.
         B.   Permit payment of all or any portion of the sanction in
installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a County Court or
a Municipal Court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that the court considers just, except that the
maximum time permitted for payment shall not exceed five years. If the court is
a County Court or a Municipal Court operated by a county, the acceptance of
payments by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the policy
adopted by the Board of County Commissioners of the county pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 301.28. If the court is a Municipal Court not operated by a county, the
Clerk may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic transfer out of
public money or may charge the fee to the offender.
         C.   To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to an
offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.
      (8)   No financial sanction imposed under this division (f) shall
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.
(ORC 2929.28)
698.03  IMPOSING SENTENCE FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   (1)   Unless a mandatory jail term is required to be imposed by Ohio
R.C. 1547.99(G), 4510.14(B), or 4511.19(G), or any other provision of the
Revised Code, or any municipal ordinance, a court that imposes a sentence under
this chapter upon an offender for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor has
discretion to determine the most effective way to achieve the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section
698.02.
      (2)   Unless a specific sanction is required to be imposed or is
precluded from being imposed by the section setting forth an offense or the
penalty for an offense or by any provision of Sections
666.99 or
698.02 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.23 to 2929.28, a court that imposes a
sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor may impose on the offender any
sanction or combination of sanctions under Section
698.02(b) to (f). The court shall not impose a sentence that imposes an
unnecessary burden on local government resources.
   (b)   (1)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, the
court shall consider all of the following factors:
         A.   The nature and circumstances of the offense or offenses;
         B.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender has a history of persistent criminal
activity and that the offender's character and condition reveal a substantial
risk that the offender will commit another offense;
         C.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender's history, character, and condition
reveal a substantial risk that the offender will be a danger to others and that
the offender's conduct has been characterized by a pattern of repetitive,
compulsive, or aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to the
consequences;
         D.   Whether the victim's youth, age, disability, or other factor made
the victim particularly vulnerable to the offense or made the impact of the
offense more serious;
         E.   Whether the offender is likely to commit future crimes in
general, in addition to the circumstances described in divisions (b)(1)B. and
C. of this section;
         F.   Whether the offender has an emotional, mental, or physical
condition that is traceable to the offender’s service in the armed forces of
the United States and that was a contributing factor in the offender’s
commission of the offense or offenses;
         G.   The offender’s military service record.
      (2)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, in
addition to complying with division (b)(1) of this section, the court may
consider any other factors that are relevant to achieving the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section
698.02(a).
   (c)   Before imposing a jail term as a sentence for a misdemeanor, a court
shall consider the appropriateness of imposing a community control sanction or
a combination of community control sanctions under Section
698.02(c), (d), (e), and (f). A court may impose the longest jail term
authorized under Section
698.02(b) only upon offenders who commit the worst forms of the offense or upon
offenders whose conduct and response to prior sanctions for prior offenses
demonstrate that the imposition of the longest jail term is necessary to deter
the offender from committing a future crime.
   (d)   (1)   A sentencing court shall consider any relevant oral or written
statement made by the victim, the defendant, the defense attorney, or the
prosecuting authority regarding sentencing for a misdemeanor. This division
does not create any rights to notice other than those rights authorized by Ohio
R.C. Chapter 2930.
      (2)   At the time of sentencing for a misdemeanor or as soon as possible
after sentencing, the court shall notify the victim of the offense of the
victim's right to file an application for an award of reparations pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2743.51 to 2743.72.
(ORC 2929.22)
698.04  ORGANIZATIONAL PENALTIES.
   (a)   Regardless of the other penalties provided in Section
698.02, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.09 shall be fined by the court as follows:
      (1)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than five thousand
dollars ($5,000.00);
      (2)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than four thousand
dollars ($4,000.00);
      (3)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than three thousand

      (6)   For a misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than two
thousand dollars ($2,000.00);
      (7)   For a minor misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than
one thousand dollars ($1,000.00).
   (b)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty plainly indicates a
purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon organizations, then
such penalty shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty provided in this section.
   (c)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than that provided
in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be pursuant to the penalty
provided for violation of the section defining the offense.
   (d)   This section does not prevent the imposition of available civil
sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.09, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
section.
(ORC 2929.31)
698.05  MULTIPLE SENTENCES.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, Ohio R.C. 2929.14
(C), or Ohio R.C. 2971.03(D) or (E), a prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment shall be served concurrently with any other prison term, jail
term, or sentence of imprisonment imposed by a court of this Municipality, the
State, another state, or the United States.  Except as provided in division (b)
(2) of this section, a jail term or sentence of imprisonment for misdemeanor
shall be served concurrently with a prison term or sentence of imprisonment for
felony served in a State or Federal correctional institution.
   (b)   (1)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment for a misdemeanor shall
be served consecutively to any other prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively or when it is imposed for a misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C.
2907.322, 2921.34 or 2923.131.  When consecutive sentences are imposed for
misdemeanors under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the
consecutive terms imposed, except that the aggregate term to be served shall
not exceed 18 months.
      (2)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment imposed for a misdemeanor
violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.14, 4510.16, 4510.21, or 4511.19, or a
substantially similar municipal ordinance, shall be served consecutively to a
prison term that is imposed for a felony violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.06,
2903.07, 2903.08 or 4511.19 or a felony violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.04
involving the operation of a motor vehicle by the offender and that is served
in a State correctional institution when the trial court specifies that it is
to be served consecutively. When consecutive jail terms or sentences of
imprisonment and prison terms are imposed for one or more misdemeanors and one
or more felonies under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of
the consecutive terms imposed, and the offender shall serve all terms imposed
for a felony before serving any term imposed for a misdemeanor.

698.06  MODIFICATION OF SENTENCE.  (REPEALED)
   ( Editor's note:  Section 698.06 was repealed as part of the 2004 updating
and revision of this Code of Ordinances because substantially identical State
law (Ohio R.C. 2929.51) was repealed by the Ohio General Assembly.)
698.07  SUSPENSION OF DRIVER’S LICENSE.
   Except as otherwise provided in Ohio R.C. 4510.07 or in any other provision
of the Revised Code, whenever an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
violation of any provision of this Code of Ordinances that is substantially
similar to a provision of the Revised Code, and a court is permitted or
required to suspend a person's driver's or commercial driver's license or
permit for a violation of that provision, a court, in addition to any other
penalties authorized by law, may suspend the offender's driver's or commercial
driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privileges for the period
of time the court determines appropriate, but the period of suspension imposed
for the violation of the provision of this Code of Ordinances shall not exceed
the period of suspension that is permitted or required to be imposed for the
violation of the provision of the Revised Code to which the provision of this
Code of Ordinances is substantially similar.

standards. The applicant may be required to submit evidence of the reliability
and suitability of the equipment to be installed.
   (b)   The sensory mechanism used in connection with such devices must be
adjusted to suppress false indications of fire or intrusion, so that the
devices will not be actuated by impulses due to transient pressure change in
water pipes, short flashes of light, wind noises such as the rattling or
vibrating of doors or windows, vehicular noise adjacent to the installation, or
other forces unrelated to genuine alarms.
   (c)   All components comprising such a device must be maintained by the
owner or lessee in good repair to assure reliability of operation.

automatic protection device which is installed on such person's premises in the
City shall furnish that person with instructions as to the way the device
operates, along with maintenance instructions.
   (e)   Each alarm equipment supplier shall also furnish the Director of
Public Safety with a copy of the instructions as to the way the device
operates. If the Director of Public Safety finds such to be incomplete, unclear
or otherwise inadequate, he or she may require the alarm equipment supplier to
have the same revised to meet his or her approval and then promptly have copies
distributed to persons for whom installation of such devices are made.
   (f)   Each alarm equipment supplier that sells or leases to a person an
automatic protection device which is installed on such person's premises in the
City for which a permit is required must provide for receiving calls for
service, directly or through an agent, on a twenty-four hour basis, seven days
a week, and shall respond to such calls within eight hours of the time they are

window or, installed outside a window, may not be more than three feet in
height above grade and shall not be located further than six feet from the
front setback line or the front of the structure, nor closer than ten feet to
the street line. No more than one such sign shall be permitted upon the

designated representative, the Building Commissioner, or m accordance with such
regulations as may be promulgated by the Police Chief, his designated
representative, the Building Commissioner, and the Mayor to assure that such
signs primarily serve as warnings to persons of any danger or hazard or give
notice against trespassing and/or solicitation and/or the existence of property
security or protection systems.
   (i)   The Director of Public Safety or his designated representative, the
Building Commissioner, shall have the authority, at reasonable times and upon
oral notice, to enter upon any premises within the City, to inspect the
installation and operation of an automatic protection device or signaling
device, the purpose of which is to report an emergency to the police station.
   (j)   All equipment, the use or installation of which is subject to this
chapter, shall be maintained in good operating condition. Repairs shall be made
whenever necessary to assure proper operation.
   (k)   All equipment, the use or installation of which is subject to this
chapter, shall be equipped with an automatic five minute cut-off device which
deactivates the alarm noise within five minutes of the first noise emitted by
the alarm.
   (l)   All persons to whom permits have been issued pursuant to the
provisions of this chapter before the effective date of this section, shall
have ninety days from the effective date of this section in which to bring
equipment in compliance with division (k) hereof.
   (m)   Whenever there is a failure to properly maintain an installation or,
when the number of false alarms for any installation equals ten in any twelve-
month period, the Director of Public Safety shall serve written notice upon a
permit holder of intent to revoke his permit. Such notice shall be given not
less than seven days prior to revocation. Such notice shall state the right of
the permit holder to appeal to the Mayor. If an appeal is filed in writing, the
Mayor shall hold a hearing on the matter and render a decision on the basis of
the facts presented. The Mayor's decision shall be final. In the event no
appeal is filed, the Director of Public Safety shall cancel the permit. The
connection to the alarm console in the Division of Police shall be removed or
rendered inoperative upon cancellation of the permit.
   (n)   Any device designated to emit an alarm upon detection of smoke, fire,
or unauthorized intrusion shall constitute a nuisance if ten or more false
alarms are emitted and reported to the Division of Police in any 12-month
period. The Law Director may take appropriate civil or criminal action to abate
such nuisance.

CABLE TELEVISION RATES
814.01  REGULATION OF BASIC CABLE TELEVISION RATES.
   The City hereby adopts, by this chapter, the rate regulation rules
promulgated by the FCC pursuant to the Cable Television Consumer Protection and
Competition Act of 1992 (" 1992 Cable Act"), 47 C.F.R., Part 76, Subpart N. The
determination of the lawfulness of any cable television rate within the City's
jurisdiction will be made pursuant to these FCC rules or any successor FCC
regulations. All terms used herein have the same meaning and application as in
the FCC's cable rate regulation rules.
(1982 Code, § 765.01)  (Ord. 93-53.  Passed 12-6-1993.)
814.02  ESTABLISHMENT AND DUTIES OF CABLE REGULATORY STAFF.
   (a)   A cable regulatory staff ("the Staff") for the City will be organized
by the Mayor with the assistance, as desired, of the Cuyahoga County Mayors and
Managers Association in order to administer the regulation of basic cable
service and equipment rates pursuant to the FCC's cable rate regulations and
the 1992 Cable Act, with the aid of counsel and other consultants as may be
needed. Council may at any time delegate additional duties to the Staff.
   (b)   In all instances involving the determination of the lawfulness of a
cable television service rate or rates, the Staff will present to Council a
recommended decision based on the record. Council may adopt, amend or remand
for further review a recommended decision of the Staff. Council may also direct
the Staff at any time to investigate issues pertaining to cable rate regulation
and provide a recommended decision. Any adoption by Council of any recommended
decision by the Staff regarding the lawfulness of a cable television service
rate or rates shall be considered a final decision. The Staff shall communicate
the results of final decisions to the affected cable operators in writing.

regularly scheduled Staff business day may become a "holiday" if its offices
are closed for all or part of regular working hours due to adverse weather or
emergency conditions.
   (e)   The first day to be counted in any period of time is the day after the
event which initiates the period. For example, if comments are to be filed
within five days of a public notice issued on November 12, the deadline for
filing the comments would be November 17.
(1982 Code, § 765.03)  (Ord. 93-53.  Passed 12-6-1993.)
814.04  EFFECTIVE DATE OF RATE REGULATION FOR BASIC SERVICE AND EQUIPMENT.
   Pursuant to 47 C.F.R. Section 76.910(e)(2) and Section 76.922, the initial
date of regulation for the basic service tier shall be the date on which local
notice is given to the cable operator that the provision of the basic service
tier is subject to rate regulation. This local notice will be in the form of a
letter sent by the Staff to the cable operator.
(1982 Code, § 765.04)  (Ord. 93-53.  Passed 12-6-1993.)
814.05  INITIATION OF REVIEW OF BASIC CABLE SERVICE AND EQUIPMENT RATES.
   Pursuant to 47 C.F.R. Section 76.930(a), a cable operator shall file its
schedule of rates for the basic service tier and associated equipment with the
Staff within 30 days of receiving written notification from the Staff that the
City has been certified by the FCC to regulate rates for the basic service
tier. To comply with this provision, a cable operator must file a Form 393
regarding rates that were charged since September 1, 1993 or one year prior to
the commencement of the City's rate regulation, whichever is the shorter
period, and a second Form 393 regarding any proposed rate increases.
(1982 Code, § 765.05)  (Ord. 93-53.  Passed 12-6-1993.)
814.06  PARTICIPATION OF INTERESTED PARTIES.

newspaper of general circulation as described in Ohio R.C. 7.12.
   (b)   Pursuant to 47 C.F.R. Section 76.935, the Staff shall, within a
reasonable time of, but in any case within the twenty-one days after receiving
the cable operator's Form 393 and any related material, issue a public notice
stating that it has received this information.
   (c)   The notice will provide the address of the City or Staff office where
the operator's Form 393 and any related material will be available for public
viewing within specified times. The notice will also provide the address and
telephone number of the cable operator. The cable operator is required to
provide interested parties, upon request, with copies of the Form 393 and any
related materials filed with the Staff.
   (d)   After the Staff issues the public notice described in divisions (a)
through (c) hereof, interested parties will have five business days to file
written comments with the Staff. There is no prescribed format for these
comments.
(1982 Code, § 765.06)  (Ord. 93-53.  Passed 12-6-1993.)
814.07  STAFF AND COUNCIL REVIEW OF BASIC CABLE RATES AND EQUIPMENT COSTS.
   (a)   Pursuant to 47 C.F.R. Section 76.933(a), after a cable operator has
submitted for review its existing or past rates for the basic service tier and
associated equipment costs, or a proposed increase in these rates (including
increases in the baseline channel change that results from reductions in the
number of channels in a tier), the existing rates will remain in effect or the
proposed rates will become effective after 30 days from the date of submission;
provided, however, that the Staff may toll this thirty day deadline for an
additional time by issuing a brief written order as described in division (b)
within 30 days of the rate submission explaining that it needs additional time
to review the rates.
   (b)   Pursuant to 47 C.F.R. Section 76.933(b), if the Staff is unable to
determine, based upon the material submitted by the cable operator, that the
past, existing or proposed rates are within the FCC's permitted basic service
tier charge or actual cost of equipment as defined in 47 C.F.R. Sections
76.922 and 76.923 or if a cable operator has submitted a cost-of-service
showing pursuant to 47 C.F.R. Sections 76.937(c) and 76.924, seeking to justify
a rate above the FCC's basic service tier charge as defined in 47 C.F.R.
Sections 76.922 and 76.923, then the Staff may toll the thirty day deadline in
division (a) hereof to request and consider additional information or to
consider the comments from interested parties as follows:
      (1)   For an additional ninety days in cases not involving cost-of-
service showings, for a total of 120 days from the filing by the cable operator
of the Form 393; or
      (2)   For an additional 150 days in cases involving cost-of-service
showings, for a total of 180 days from the filing by the cable operator of the
Form 393.
   (c)   Pursuant to 47 C.F.R. Section 76.933(c), if the Staff has availed
itself of the additional ninety or 150 days permitted in division (b) hereof,

determination by Council that effective competition exists, then Council and
the Staff will then cease regulating basic cable service rates. A final
determination that there is no effective competition may be appealed to the FCC
pursuant to the FCC's rules.

      (2)   The sale, assignment or other transfer of capital stock or
partnership, membership or other equity interests in grantee by one or more of
its existing shareholders, partners, members or other equity owners so as to
create a new controlling interest in grantee;
      (3)   The issuance of additional capital stock or partnership, membership
or other equity interest by grantee so as to create a new controlling interest
in grantee; and
      (4)   The entry by the grantee into an agreement with respect to the

   The term "Controlling Interest" as used herein means majority equity
ownership of the grantee.
   (c)   Except as otherwise provided below or unless waived by grantor as
provided under Section 766.34 herein, no grantee may sell or otherwise transfer
ownership in a franchise and/or cable system prior to the substantial
completion of the initial design or initial construction of said system by
grantee. In the case of a sale of multiple systems, if the terms of the sale
require the buyer to subsequently transfer ownership of one or more such
systems to one or more third parties, such transfer shall be considered a part
of the initial transaction. The above-described holding period shall not apply
to:
      (1)   Any transfer of ownership interest in any franchise and/or cable
system which is not subject to federal income tax liability;
      (2)   Any sale required by operation of any law or any act of any agency,
any state or political subdivision or the City; or
      (3)   Any sale, assignment, or transfer, to one or more purchasers,
assignees, or transferees controlled by, controlling, or under common control
with, the seller, assignor, or transferor or its affiliate.
   (d)   In the case of any sale or transfer of ownership of any franchise and/
or cable system, the City shall have 120 days to act upon any request for
approval of such sale or transfer that contains or is accompanied by such
information as is required in accordance with Federal Communications Commission
regulations, the requirements of Sections
814.16 through
814.54 and such other reasonable information as the City, in its sole
discretion, may request. During the review period, the grantor may advise the
grantee that a public hearing is deemed necessary to evaluate any potential
adverse effect of the sale or transfer upon grantee's subscribers. In such
event grantee shall receive written notice of the hearing, and of the
opportunity to participate fully in it, as far in advance as possible, and in
no event less than 14 days prior to the start of the hearing. If the City fails
to render a final decision on the request within 120 days from receipt by the
City of all required information, such request shall be deemed granted unless
the requesting party and the City agree to an extension of trine. Such request
to transfer may be conditioned upon the performance of additional requirements
imposed upon grantee by grantor, and the payment of a nonrefundable transfer
fee of five thousand dollars ($5,000).
   (e)   Grantee shall notify Grantor in writing of any foreclosure or any
other judicial sale of all or a substantial part of the franchise property of
the grantee or upon the termination of any lease or interest covering all or a
substantial part of said franchise property. Such notification shall be
considered by grantor as notice that a change in control or ownership of the
franchise has taken place and the provisions under this section governing the
consent of grantor to such change in control or ownership shall apply.
   (f)   For the purpose of determining whether it shall consent to such
change, transfer, or acquisition of control, grantor may inquire into the
qualifications of the prospective transferee or controlling party, and grantee
shall assist grantor in any such inquiry. In seeking grantor's consent to any
change of ownership or control, grantee shall have the responsibility of
insuring that the transferee completes an application in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to grantor, which application shall include the
information required under state and federal law as well as under divisions (b)
(1) through (7) of Section
814.28 of Sections
814.16 through
814.54. An application, acceptable to the City, shall be submitted to grantor
not less than 90 days prior to the date of transfer. The transferee shall be
required to establish that it possesses the legal, technical and financial
qualifications to operate and maintain the system and comply with all franchise
requirements for the remainder of the term of the franchise. If, after
considering the legal, financial, character and technical qualities of the
applicant and determining that they are satisfactory, the grantor finds that
such transfer is acceptable, the grantor shall transfer and assign the rights
and obligations of such franchise. The consent of the grantor to such transfer
shall not be unreasonably denied.
   (g)   The consent or approval of the grantor to transfer by the grantee
shall not constitute a waiver or release of the rights of the grantor in or to
its public rights-of-way or easements and any transfer shall by its own terms
be expressly subject to the terms and conditions of Sections
814.16 through
814.54 and the franchise agreement. A sale, transfer or assignment of the
franchise may not be approved without the successor in interest becoming a
signatory to the franchise agreement.
   (h)   Any financial institution having a pledge of the grantee or its assets
for the advancement of money for the construction and/or operation of the
franchise shall have the right to notify the grantor that it or its designee
satisfactory to the grantor shall take control of and operate the cable
television system, in the event of a grantee default in its financial
obligations. Further, said financial institution shall also submit a plan for
such operation within 30 days of assuming such control that will insure
continued service and compliance with all franchise requirements during the
term the financial institution exercises control over the system. The financial
institution shall not exercise control over the system for a period exceeding
one year unless extended by the grantor in its discretion and during said
period of time it shall have the right to petition the grantor to transfer the
franchise to another grantee.

obligation of the grantee.

area. Grantee shall implement the change within sixty (60) days of written
notice of the same by grantor.

fee payments and additional commitments set forth elsewhere in Sections
814.16 through
814.54 or the franchise agreement may total more the maximum allowable
percentage of grantee's gross revenues in any 12-month period, grantee agrees
that the additional commitments are not franchise fees as defined under any
federal law, nor are they to be offset or credited against any franchise fee
payments due to the grantor, nor do they represent an increase in franchise
fees to be itemized as such on the subscriber's bill.
   (i)   Payment of the franchise fee under or the franchise agreement shall
not exempt grantee from the payment of any other license fee, tax, levy,
assessment or charge on the business, occupation, services, property or income

facility, the grantee shall, at the grantor's request, submit to the grantor a
statement describing all facilities involved, whether authorized by franchise,
permit, license or other prior right, and specifying the location of all such
facilities to the extent the grantee has possession of such information. Such
facilities shall immediately be subject to the terms of this franchise.
   (f)   Reservation of grantor streets rights. Nothing int his franchise shall
prevent the grantor or public utilities owned, maintained and/or operated by
public entities other than the grantor from constructing sewers; grading,
paving, repairing and/or altering any street; laying down, repairing or
removing water mains; or constructing or establishing any other public work or
improvement. All such work shall be done, insofar as practicable, so as not to
obstruct, injure or prevent the use and operation of grantee's cable system.
However, if any of the grantee's system interferes with the construction or
repair of any street or public improvement, including construction, repair or
removal of a sewer or water main such portion of the grantee's system shall be
removed or replaced in the manner the grantor shall reasonably direct, and
grantor shall in no event be liable for any damage to any portion of grantee's

Notwithstanding the grantee's request that any such facility remain in place,
the grantor may require the grantee to remove the facility from above the
street or modify the facility to protect the public, health, welfare, safety,
and convenience, or otherwise serve, the public interest. The grantor may
require the grantee to perform a combination of modification and removal of any
such above-ground facility. grantee shall complete such removal or modification
in accordance with a schedule set by the grantor. Until such time as grantee
removes or modifies the facility as directed by the grantor, or until the
rights to and responsibility for the facility are accepted by another person
having authority to construct and maintain such facility, grantee shall be
responsible for all necessary repairs and relocations of the facility, as well
as maintenance of the street, in the same manner and degree as if the facility
were in active use, and grantee shall retain all liability for such facility.

   (bb)   New Residential Developments. In new residential developments in
which all the electric power and telephone utilities are underground, the
following procedure shall apply with respect to access to and utilization of
underground easements:
      (1)   The developer shall be responsible for contacting and surveying all
franchised cable operators to ascertain which operators desire (or, pursuant to
the terms and provisions of Sections
814.16 through
814.54 and any franchise agreement, may be required) to provide cable service
to that development. The developer may establish a reasonable deadline to
receive cable operator responses. The final development map shall indicate the
cable operators that have agreed to serve the development.
      (2)   If one (1) or two (2) cable operators wish to provide service, they
shall be accommodated in the joint utilities trench on a nondiscriminatory
shared basis. If fewer than two operators indicate interest, the developer
shall provide conduit to accommodate two sets of cable television cables and
dedicate to the City any initially unoccupied conduit. The developer shall be
entitled to recover the cost of such initially unoccupied conduit in the event
that grantor subsequently leases or sells occupancy or use rights to any
grantee.
      (3)   The developer shall provide at least ten working days notice of the
date that utility trenches will be open to the cable operators that have agreed
to serve the development. When the trenches are open, cable operators shall
have two working days to begin the installation of their cables, and five
working days after beginning installation to complete installation.
      (4)   The final development map shall not be approved until the developer
submits evidence that:
         A.   It has notified each grantee that underground utility trenches
are to open as of an estimated date, and that each grantee will be allowed
access to such trenches, including trenches from proposed streets to individual
homes or home sites, on specified nondiscriminatory terms and conditions; and
         B.   It has received a written notification from each grantee that the
grantee intends to install its facilities during the open trench period on the
specified terms and conditions, or such other terms and conditions as are
mutually agreeable to the developer and grantee, or has received no reply from
a grantee within ten days after its notification to such grantee, in which case
the grantee will be deemed to have waived its opportunity to install its
facilities during the open trench period.
      (5)   Sharing the joint utilities trench shall be subject to compliance
with State regulatory agency and utility standards. If such compliance is not
possible, the developer shall provide a separate trench for the cable
television cables, with the entire cost shared among the participating cable
operators. With the concurrence of the developer, the affected utilities and
the cable operators, alternative Installation procedures, such as the use of
deeper trenches, may be utilized, subject to applicable law.
      (6)   Any cable operator wishing to serve an area where the trenches have
been closed shall be responsible for its own trenching or other burial
operation and associated costs and shall repair all property to the condition
which existed prior to such trenching or burial.
      (7)   In the event that more than one franchise is awarded, the City
reserves the right to require clustering of pedestals with other utilities or
franchisees.

manner as not to obstruct, injure; or prevent the free use and operation of the
poles, wires, conduits, conductors, pipes or appurtenances of the cable system.
Nothing contained herein shall relieve any person or entity from liability
arising out of the failure to exercise reasonable care to avoid interfering
with cable system facilities while performing the public works.
      (2)   If any equipment of grantee shall interfere with public works,
then, upon receipt of the 45-day notice, that part of the equipment of grantee
which interferes shall be removed or replaced by the grantee in such manner as
shall be directed by grantor so that the same shall not interfere with the
public works as reasonably determined by grantor, and grantee shall bear the
reasonable expense of such removal or replacement.

   (j)   At any time after commencement of service to subscribers, the grantor
may require where reasonable, additional tests, full or partial repeat tests,
different test procedures or tests involving a specific subscriber’s terminal.
Requests for such additional tests will be made on the basis of complaints
received or other evidence indicating any unresolved controversy or
noncompliance, and such tests shall be limited to the particular matter in
controversy. The grantor shall endeavor to so arrange its request for such
special tests so as to minimize hardship or inconvenience to grantee or the
subscriber. Failure to perform such properly requested additional tests within
30 days shall constitute a material breach of this agreement.

completion bond (herein referred to as the "Construction Completion Bond") with
a surety reasonably approved by the grantor's Law Director, in an amount equal
to 10 % of the applicable estimated construction cost. Such amount, however,

initial construction of the cable system or the upgrade or rebuild project,
when regular subscriber service is available to 75% of occupied dwelling units,

year anniversary of the initial construction of the cable system or the upgrade
or rebuild project, as the case may be, the bond may be canceled.
   (c)   Within 60 days of the ordinance adopting the franchise agreement,
grantee shall deposit with grantor a surety bond or letter of credit in the
amount of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) in a form reasonably acceptable to
the Law Director of grantor (hereinafter referred to as the "Performance
Bond"). The performance bond shall be available to insure the faithful
performance by grantee of provisions of Sections
814.16 through
814.54 and the franchise agreement, other than with respect to construction,
upgrading, of rebuilding projects covered herein, but including the obligation
to remove the above ground portion of the cable system upon revocation or
termination of the franchise as set forth herein. The performance bond shall be
maintained at $50,000 during the entire term of the franchise agreement,
regardless of withdrawals which may be made under this section. In the event of
a default by grantee in any of its obligations under this agreement, other than
completion of construction, which default is not cured within 30 days after
Notice by grantor to grantee of such default (or such longer time as is
necessary to cure, so long as grantee commences to cure within 30 days and
diligently pursues cure), grantor may levy on the Performance Bond upon
notifying grantee of the amount of such charge. grantor may also levy upon the
Performance Bond for sums due for penalties under Sections
814.33(e) and
814.40(g) herein. The rights reserved to the grantor with respect to the
performance bond are in addition to all other rights of grantor, at law or in
equity.

channels shall be made available by grantee for use by the City and its
citizens in accordance with the rules and procedures established by the City or
any lawfully designated person, group, organization or agency authorized by the
City for that purpose.
   (b)   To the extent that any access channel is not being used for the
provision of noncommercial, public, educational or governmental access
purposes, grantee shall be permitted to use such channel(s) for the provision
of other services subject to any reasonable rules established by the City
regarding such use. grantee's permitted use of any access channel made pursuant
to this section shall cease within 90 days of grantee's receipt of notice from
City that such channel will again be used for public, educational or
governmental access.
   (c)   Notwithstanding the above, grantee may accommodate a request from the
City for additional access capacity made pursuant to Section
814.46(b) by combining more than one access use on a channel provided that:
      (1)   It is technically and economically feasible for grantee to do so;
      (2)   The scheduling needs of all users of the channel can be reasonably
accommodated; and
      (3)   The access entity which requires use of the alternate channel must
be able to access the alternate channel from the site where it normally
originates playback of its programs and may not be required to transport tapes
to a remote site for playback.
   (d)   However, grantee shall provide an additional PEG channel for non-
commercial public, educational, or government broadcasts in the event that the
three (3) PEG channel provided under this Section are then fully utilized. In

provided under this Section shall be reviewed annually by grantee. Upon such
annual review, the additional PEG channel will continue to be made available to
grantor to the extent that the PEG channels provided under this agreement
(including the additional PEG channel(s)) are at least 70% fully utilized. To
the extent that such capacity requirement is not met, the additional PEG
channel shall be terminated subject to reactivation at the request of grantor
upon demonstration by grantor that the three original and any other additional
PEG channels provided under this Section are fully utilized, and to the annual
review provided herein.
   (e)   The grantee shall provide free cable transmission facilities and free
modulation equipment to introduce programming onto these transmission
facilities by linking the below listed origination points with the headend, or

the origination points for such channels.
   (f)   The grantee is responsible for all headend equipment essential to
playback of programming for PEG access use in a location and under reasonable
rules determined by grantee. Grantee shall also be responsible for the
operation and maintenance, and all equipment necessary to perform those
functions. Grantee shall also either provide a studio and equipment acceptable
to grantor for PEG access use or pay a fee in lieu of providing the same equal
to up to 1% of adjusted gross revenues (gross revenues above net of franchise
fee) as stated in the franchise agreement to be placed by grantor in a special
fund for such PEG access purposes.
   (g)   The grantor shall be responsible for the operation of access
facilities and equipment. In this regard grantor may delegate from time to time
its responsibilities to others who then shall assume the responsibility of
grantor in accordance with the grantor's delegation. The grantor will develop
reasonable rules regarding use of access facilities and equipment and determine
the needs of the City for public, educational and governmental access services.
In this regard, the grantor shall regularly coordinate with grantee for the
purpose of developing and maintaining reasonable access facilities.
   (h)   Costs of providing said facilities shall not be a credit against
payment of the franchise fee imposed under the franchise agreement.

814.44  FRANCHISE VIOLATION.
   (a)   If the grantor believes that the grantee has failed to perform any
obligation under this agreement or has failed to perform in a timely manner,
the grantor may make written demand on the grantee that it remedy the alleged
failure. Grantor may order the grantee to correct or remedy any failure or
breach within the time and in the manner and on the terms and conditions that
the grantor may establish. If the alleged failure is denied or not remedied to
the reasonable satisfaction of the grantor, the grantor may follow any
procedures set forth in this agreement.

limited to, the following:
      (1)   Failure of grantee to pay grantor sums due under the terms of this

   (d)   If grantee fails to perform in a timely manner any material obligation
required by Sections
814.16 through
814.54 or a franchise granted hereunder, following notice from the grantor and
an opportunity to cure such nonperformance, grantor may act to remedy such
violation in accordance with the following procedures:
Grantor shall notify grantee of any alleged material violation in writing by
personal delivery or registered or certified mail, and demand correction within
a reasonable time, which shall not be less than ten days in the case of the
failure of the grantee to pay any sum or other amount due the grantor under
Sections
814.16 through
814.54 or the grantee's franchise and 30 days in all other cases. If grantee
fails either to correct the violation within the time prescribed or to commence
correction of the violation within the time prescribed and thereafter
diligently pursue correction of such violation, the grantor shall then give
written notice of not less than 20 days of a public hearing to be held before
the Council. Said notice shall specify the violations alleged to have occurred.
At the public hearing, the Council shall hear and consider relevant evidence
and thereafter render findings and its decision. In the event that the Council
finds that a material violation exists and that grantee has not corrected the
same in a satisfactory manner or has not diligently commenced correction of
such violation after notice thereof from grantor and is not diligently
proceeding to fully remedy such violation, the Council may revoke the franchise
or impose any other penalty permitted by the franchise agreement and any other
legal or equitable remedy available under the franchise or applicable law.
   (e)   The grantor may assess, after providing written notice to grantee and
allowing 30 days or such other amount of time as is agreed between grantee and
grantor to cure, against the grantee monetary damages up to five hundred
dollars ($500.00) per calendar day or per incident for material system upgrade/
construction delays, and up to two hundred dollars ($200.00) per calendar day
or per incident for any other material breaches; provided that all violations
of a similar nature occurring at the same time shall be considered as one
incident. The grantor may have recourse to the performance bond for payment of
such damages including the $50.00 per day penalty for failure to respond to
grantor's request for information due grantor within the time limits as
specified in Sections
814.16 through
814.54 or the franchise agreement pursuant to Section
814.40(g) and the one hundred dollar ($100.00) or five hundred dollar ($500.00)
per day amounts for failure to timely pay the franchise fee pursuant to Section
814.33(e), which shall not be subject to but in addition to the remedies set
forth in this section. The assessment of any monetary damages shall not
constitute a waiver by the grantor of any other right or remedy it may have
under the franchise or applicable law including its right to recover from the
grantee any additional damages, losses, costs and expenses, including
attorney's and/or consultant fees that are incurred by the grantor by reason of
the breach of this agreement.
   (f)   In addition to revocation in accordance with other provisions of this
agreement, grantor may revoke this agreement and rescind all rights and
privileges associated with the franchise agreement in the following
circumstances, each of which represents a material breach of the franchise

and provisions entered into by and between the grantor and the grantee;
      (2)   If there is a pattern of noncompliance with the grantor's consumer
service standards;

hours to provide continuous and uninterrupted cable service for the entire
franchise area, not subject to force majeure as defined under Section
814.45 herein;
      (4)   If the grantee practices any fraud or deceit upon the grantor or
any subscriber; or

relief in favor of the grantee in a bankruptcy proceeding.
      Written notice of intent to consider revocation under this division shall
be served on the grantee at least 30 days prior to the date of revocation. The
grantor shall hear any persons interested in the revocation, and within 90 days
after the hearing shall determine whether to revoke the franchise and declare
that the franchise is revoked and the performance bond forfeited, or that the
breach at issue is capable of being cured by the grantee, direct the grantee to
take appropriate remedial action within the time and in the manner and under
the terms and conditions that the grantor determines are reasonable under the
circumstances.

is able to do so and shall take all steps within its power to correct such
cause(s). In correcting such cause(s), grantee shall take all reasonable steps
to do so in as expeditious a manner as possible. Grantee shall notify grantor

the date of written notice and to the satisfaction of the grantor, the grantor
may cause the work to be done and:
      (1)   The grantee shall reimburse the grantor for the reasonable costs
incurred within 30 days after receipt of an itemized list of the costs; or
      (2)   The grantor may recover the costs through the performance bond
provided by the grantee. The grantor may also seek legal and equitable relief
to enforce the provisions of this section.
   (f)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Sections

rights-of-way in which such property is located or with the use thereof by any
public utility or other cable grantee.

enforcement of such provision will impose an undue hardship on the grantee or
the subscribers. To be effective, such waiver shall be evidenced by a statement

   (b)   Grantee shall adhere to the applicable equal employment opportunity
requirements of federal, state and local regulations.
   (c)   Neither grantee, nor any person, agency, or entity shall, without the
subscriber's consent, tap or arrange for the tapping, of any cable line, signal
input device, or subscriber outlet or receiver for any purpose except routine
maintenance of the system, detection of unauthorized service, polling with
audience participating, or audience viewing surveys to support advertising
research regarding viewers where individual viewing behavior cannot be
identified.
   (d)   In the conduct of providing its services or in pursuit of any
collateral commercial enterprise resulting therefrom, grantee shall take
reasonable steps to prevent the invasion of a subscriber's or general citizen's
right of privacy as defined in the Cable Act or other personal rights through
the use of the system as such rights are delineated or defined by applicable
law. Grantee shall not, without lawful court order or other applicable valid
legal authority, utilize the system's interactive two-way equipment or
capability for unauthorized personal surveillance of any subscriber or general
citizen.
   (e)   Grantee shall not sell or otherwise make available to unaffiliated
third parties (including grantor), lists of the names and addresses of
subscribers, or any list which identifies, by name, subscriber viewing habits,
or personalized data pertaining to a subscriber's use of any of franchisee's
services without the express written consent of the subscriber to which the
personalized data pertains. For the purposes of this division, "personalized
data" shall mean the name and address of an individual subscriber directly
associated with data obtained on his or her use of specific services provided
by or through grantee. Nothing herein shall be construed to prevent, as a
normal incident of commercial enterprise, the sale of availability of
"nonpersonalized" or "aggregated data" which is not "personalized data" as
defined herein.
   (f)   No cable line, wire amplifier, converter, or other piece of equipment
owned by grantee shall be installed by grantee in the subscriber's premises,
other than in appropriate easements, without first securing any required
consent. If a subscriber requests service, permission to install upon
subscriber's property shall be presumed. Where a property owner or his
predecessor has granted an easement including a public utility easement or a
servitude to another and the servitude by its terms contemplates a use such as
grantee's intended use, grantee shall not be required to obtain the written
permission of the owner for the installation of cable television equipment.

814.51  TIME LIMITS STRICTLY CONSTRUED.
   Whenever this agreement sets forth a time for any material act to be
performed by the grantee, such time shall be deemed to be of the essence, and
any failure of the grantee to perform within the allotted time may be
considered sufficient grounds for the grantor to invoke any relevant penalty
provision of this agreement in accordance with the provisions of Section
814.44 herein or Sections
814.33(e) or
814.40(g) as applicable.
(1982 Code, § 766.36)  (Ord. 97-19.  Passed 3-18-1997.)
814.52  DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY.
   (a)   The grantor shall be vested, to the extent permitted by law, with the
power and right to regulate reasonably the exercise of the privileges permitted
by this agreement in the public interest, or to delegate that power and right,
or any part thereof, to any agent, City officer or employee or created board,
authority or commission; provided, however, that the creation of any such
board, commission or authority, or the delegation of such authority to any City
employee or agent, shall not relieve the grantor, acting through its City
Council, of its ultimate authority and responsibility as grantor hereunder and
that all final determinations required hereunder to be made by the grantor
shall be made by the City Council as provided by law.
   (b)   Grantee shall not be relieved of its obligations to comply, promptly
and completely, with any provision of this franchise by any failure of the
grantor to promptly enforce compliance with this franchise.
(1982 Code, § 766.37)  (Ord. 97-19.  Passed 3-18-1997.)
814.53  CONFLICTS.
   In the event of a conflict between any provision of Sections
814.16 through
814.54 and a franchise agreement entered pursuant to it, the provisions of
Sections
814.16 through
814.54 shall control, except as may be specifically otherwise provided in the
franchise agreement.
(1982 Code, § 766.38)  (Ord. 97-19. Passed 3-18-1997.)
814.54  SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of Sections
814.16 through
814.54 or any franchise agreement executed subject to it is held by any court
or by any federal, State or county agency of competent jurisdiction to be
invalid as conflicting with any federal or State law, rule or regulation now or
hereafter in effect, or is held by such court or agency to be modified in any
way in order to conform to the requirements of any such law, rule or
regulation, such provision shall be considered a separate, distinct, and
independent part of Sections
814.16 through
814.54 and such holding shall not affect the validity and enforceability of all
other provisions hereof, all of which shall remain in full force and effect for
the term of any franchise agreement, or renewal or renewals thereof. In the
event of such determination by a court of competent jurisdiction, the grantor
or grantee shall have the option to amend the parts of the franchise agreement
related to the affected sections. In the event that such law, rule or
regulation is subsequently repealed, rescinded, amended or otherwise changed,
so that the provision hereof which had been held invalid or modified is no
longer in conflict with such law, rule or regulation, said provision shall
thereupon return to full force and effect and shall thereafter be binding on
grantor and grantee, provided that grantor shall give grantee 60 days written
notice of such change before requiring compliance with said provision or such
longer period of time as may be reasonably required for grantee to comply with
such provision.

persons authorized to use or be present in or upon the public right-of-way. All
such facilities shall be moved by the service provider, temporarily or
permanently, as determined by the city, in accordance with applicable
provisions in the Ohio Revised Code and Ohio law, and consistent with the
established rights of any public utility under Ohio law.
   (h)   Damage to Public and Private Property. No service provider nor any
person acting on the service provider's behalf shall take any action or permit
any action to be done which may impair or damage any city property, public
right-of-way, other ways or other public or private property located in, on or
adjacent thereto.
   (i)   Restoration of Public Right-of-way, Other Ways and City Property.
      (1)   When a service provider, or any person acting on its behalf, does
any work in or affecting any public right-of-way, other ways or city property,
it shall, after the work is completed and at its own expense, promptly remove
any obstructions therefrom and restore such ways or property, within sixty (60)
days, at the city engineer's discretion, to as good a condition as existed
before the work was undertaken, unless otherwise directed by the city.
      (2)   If weather or other conditions do not permit the complete
restoration required by this section, the service provider shall temporarily
restore the affected ways or property as directed by the city. Such temporary
restoration shall be at the service provider's sole expense and the service
provider shall promptly undertake and complete the required permanent
restoration when the weather or other conditions no longer prevent such
permanent restoration.
   (j)   Duty to Provide Information.
      (1)   Within ten (10) days of a written request from the city each
service provider, with the exception of public utilities operating under a
tariff issued by the State of Ohio and regulated by the PUCO, shall furnish the
city with documentation sufficient to show that the service provider has
complied with all requirements of this chapter.
      (2)   In addition, within ten (10) days of a written request from the
city, each service provider shall make available for inspection by the city at
reasonable times all books, records, maps and other documents, maintained by
the service provider with respect to its facilities in the public right-of-way.
Public utilities operating under a tariff issued by the State of Ohio and
regulated by the PUCO and for tariff related activities will respond to the
city's request for facility information through the OUPS design ticket process,
in accordance with the Ohio Revised Code.
   (k)   Leased Capacity. A service provider shall have the right, without
prior city approval, to lease capacity or bandwidth to an unaffiliated service
provider, provided:
      (1)   The service provider shall notify the city of the lease agreement
within thirty (30) days of such lease agreement.
      (2)   The lessee has complied, to the extent applicable, with the
requirements of this chapter.
   (l)   Assignments or Transfers of Consent. Consent to occupy or use the
public right-of-way may be, directly or indirectly, assigned or disposed of by
sale, lease, merger, consolidation or other act of the service provider, by
operation of law or otherwise, without consent of the city, so long as:
      (1)   The city is notified of the proposed transfer on or before the date
of transfer; and
      (2)   The transferee shall fully comply with this chapter within sixty
(60) days of the transfer, including, but not limited to:
         A.   All information required by the application for consent to occupy
or use the public right-of-way pursuant to Section
848.02, and/or registration required by Section
848.03 of this chapter; and
         B.   Any other information reasonably required by the city.
      (3)   This section shall not apply to public utilities operating under a

   (m)   Transactions Affecting Control of Consent.  Any transactions that
singularly or collectively result in a change of twenty-five percent (25%) or
more of the ownership or ultimate working control of a service provider, of the
ownership or working control of the service provider's facility, or of control
of the capacity or bandwidth of the service provider's system, facilities or
substantial parts thereof, shall be considered an assignment or transfer
pursuant to Section
848.04(1) hereof. Transaction between affiliated entities are not exempt from
Section
848.04(1).
   (n)   Revocation of Consent. Consent granted by the city to occupy or use
the public right-of-way may be revoked, except as to public utilities operating
under a tariff issued by the State of Ohio and regulated by PUCO, for any of
the following reasons:
      (1)   Construction, reconstruction, installation, location, operation or
excavation at an unauthorized location.
      (2)   Construction, reconstruction, installation, location, operation or

way or construction permit, the city shall give the service provider written
notice of the apparent violation or non-compliance, providing a short and
concise statement of the nature and general facts of the violation or non-
compliance, and providing the service provider a reasonable period of time not
exceeding thirty (30) days to furnish evidence:
      (1)   That corrective action has been, or is being actively and
expeditiously pursued, to remedy the violation or non-compliance;
      (2)   That rebuts the alleged violations or non-compliance; and/or
      (3)   That it would be in the public interest to impose some penalty or

(Ord. 2006-55.  Passed 9-18-2006.)
848.05  LOCATION, RELOCATION AND REMOVAL OF FACILITIES.
   (a)   Location of Facilities. All facilities shall be constructed,
reconstructed, installed and located in accordance with the following terms and
conditions:
      (1)   Whenever possible according to acceptable engineering standards and
consistent with federal and state law regarding safety and other matters,
facilities shall be installed within an existing compatible underground duct or
conduit whenever excess capacity exists within such facility.
      (2)   A service provider other than a public utility operating under a
tariff issued by the State of Ohio and regulated by the PUCO with permission to
install overhead facilities shall install its facilities on pole attachments to
existing utility poles only, and then only if surplus space is available.
      (3)   Whenever the existing electric, cable, telecommunications and other
similar facilities are located underground in a public right-of-way, a service
provider with permission to occupy the same public right-of-way with the
electric, cable, telecommunications or other similar facilities, must also
locate its facilities underground.
      (4)   Except for a public utility operating under a tariff issued by the
State of Ohio and regulated by the PUCO which may require above-ground
facilities for operational reasons and overhead facilities as provided herein,
no facilities shall be located above ground in a public right-of-way without
the express written permission of the city.
      (5)   The city reserves the right to require a service provider to
provide excess capacity in the public right-of-way at the time of construction,
reconstruction, installation, location or relocation of facilities.
   (b)   Excess Capacity. To reduce excavation in the public right-of-way, it
is the city's goal to encourage service providers to share occupancy of
underground conduit as well as to construct, whenever possible, excess conduit
capacity for occupancy of future facilities in the public right-of-way.
Therefore, if a service provider is constructing underground conduit in the
public right-of-way for its own facilities, and the city reasonably determines
such construction is in an area in which other service providers would likely
construct facilities in the future, the city may require the service provider
to construct the conduit in the public right-of-way with excess capacity in the
public right-of-way, provided the service provider shall be reimbursed for the
use of the excess capacity by another service provider. The service provider
may charge a reasonable market lease rate for occupancy of the additional
conduit space as reimbursement. This requirement shall not apply where no
practical operational, engineering or safety standard would support the need
for excess capacity.
   (c)   City Owned Conduit. If the city owns or leases conduit in the path of
a service provider's proposed facilities, and provided it is technologically
feasible for the service provider's facilities to occupy the conduit owned or
leased by the city, the service provider shall be required to occupy the
conduit owned or leased by the city in order to reduce the necessity to
excavate the public right-of-way. The service provider shall pay to the city a
fee for such occupancy in accordance and to the extent permitted by Ohio R.C.
4939.05. The city and the service provider may agree to amortize the fee
through annual payments to the city.
   (d)   Relocation or Removal of Facilities. Within one hundred twenty (120)
days, or more for larger projects, following written notice from the city, and
receipt of final design plans and a construction schedule from the city, and a
signed contract agreement between the public utility and the city if
reimbursement is due from the city, a service provider shall submit design
plans and a proposed construction schedule to the city to temporarily remove,
relocate, change or alter the position of any facilities in the public right-
of-way whenever the city shall have determined that such removal, relocation,
change or alteration is reasonably necessary for:
      (1)   The construction, reconstruction, repair, maintenance or
installation of any city or other public improvement in or upon the public
right-of-way.
      (2)   The operations of the city or other governmental entity in or upon
the public right-of-way.
      (3)   With regard to the expense of such removal or relocation, the
standard for reimbursement to the service provider for such expense shall be in
accordance with state law and regulations of the PUCO.
   (e)   Removal of Unauthorized Facilities. Within thirty (30) days following
written notice from the city, any service provider or other person that owns,
controls or maintains any unauthorized system, facility or related
appurtenances in the public right-of-way shall, at its own expense, remove
those facilities or appurtenances from the public right-of-way of the city or
shall arrange to sell the system, facilities or appurtenances to the city.
After thirty (30) days have expired, the city may remove the facilities or
appurtenances from the public right-of-way at the other party's expense. A
system or facility is unauthorized and subject to removal in the following
circumstances:
      (1)   Upon revocation of the service provider's consent to occupy or use
the public right-of-way;
      (2)   If the system or facility was constructed, reconstructed,
installed, operated, located or maintained without the consent to do so, except
as otherwise provided by this chapter;
      (3)   Upon abandonment of a facility in the public right-of-way of the
city, with the exception of underground facilities abandoned in a manner
authorized and in accordance with state or federal law or regulations;
      (4)   If the system or facility was constructed, reconstructed,
installed, operated, located or maintained, or any excavation of a public
right-of-way was performed, without prior issuance of a required construction
permit, except as otherwise provided by this chapter;
      (5)   If the system or facility was constructed, reconstructed,
installed, operated, located or maintained, or any excavation of a public
right-of-way was performed, at a location not permitted pursuant to the city's
consent to occupy or use the public right-of-way or construction permit;
      (6)   If the service provider fails to comply with the registration
requirements of Section
848.03 of this chapter.
   (f)   Emergency Removal or Relocation of Facilities. The city retains the
right and privilege to cut or move any facilities, or stop work on any
construction, reconstruction, installation, operation or excavation, located in
the public right-of-way of the city, as the city may determine to be necessary,
appropriate or useful in response to any need to protect the public health,
safety or welfare; except to the extent that the city's actions would cause a
dangerous or potentially dangerous situation.

      (1)   A service provider need not obtain a construction permit or notify
the city prior to or after commencing any routine maintenance or new service
orders that do not include the construction in, or excavation or lane
obstruction of, a public right-of-way or closing of a public street.
      (2)   For routine maintenance and new service orders that require the
service provider to cause a lane obstruction in a public street for more than
eight (8) hours, the service provider shall contact the chief of police to
coordinate traffic flow in the area of the service being conducted.
   (c)   Emergency Work. In the event of the need for any unexpected repair or
emergency work, a service provider may commence such emergency response work as
required under the circumstances, provided that for emergency work that
requires excavation of a public right-of-way or lane obstruction of closing of
a public street, the service provider shall notify the city as promptly as
possible before commencing such emergency work, or as soon as possible
thereafter if advance notice is not practicable. A service provider need not
obtain a construction permit or notify the city prior to or after commencing
any emergency work.

890.05  DETERMINATION OF ALLOCATION OF TAX.
   (a)   Method of Determination. In the taxation of income which is subject to
the City income taxes if the books and records of a taxpayer conducting a
business or profession both within and without the boundaries of the City shall
disclose with reasonable accuracy what portion of its net profit is
attributable to that part of the business or profession conducted within the
boundaries of the City, then only such portion shall be considered as having a
taxable situs in the City for the purposes of Municipal income taxation. The
portion of the entire net profits of a taxpayer to be allocated as having been
derived from within the City in the absence of actual records thereof, shall be
determined as follows:
   Multiply the entire net profits by a business allocation percentage to be
determined by a three-factor formula of property, payroll, and sales, each of
which shall be given equal weight, as follows:
      (1)   The average net book value to the real and tangible personal
property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in the
City during the taxable period to the average net book value of all the real
and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or
profession during the same period, wherever situated.
      As used in the preceding paragraph, real property shall include property
rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such property shall be
determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight.
      (2)   Wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to persons employed in the business or profession for services performed
in the City to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the same
period to persons employed in the business or profession, wherever their
services are performed.
      (3)   Gross receipts of the business or profession from sales made and
services performed, during the taxable period, in the City to gross receipts of
the business or profession during the same period from sales and services,
wherever made or performed. In the event that the foregoing allocation formula
does not produce an equitable result, another basis may, under uniform
regulations, be substituted so as to produce such result.
   (b)   Sales Made in the City. As used in division (a)(3) herein "sales made
in the City" means:
      (1)   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within
the City regardless of where title passes if shipped or delivered from a stock
of goods within the City.
      (2)   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within
the City regardless of where title passes even though transported from a point
outside of the City if the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own
employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the City and the
sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
      (3)   All sales of tangible personal property which is shipped from a
place within the City to purchasers outside of the City regardless of where
title passes if the taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly
engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery
is made.
   (c)   Total Allocation. Add together the percentages determined in
accordance with divisions (a) (1), (2) and (3) herein or such of the aforesaid
percentages as are applicable to the particular taxpayer and divide the total
so obtained by the number of percentages used in deriving such total in order
to obtain the business allocation percentage referred to in division (a)
herein. A factor is applicable even though it may be allocable entirely in or
outside the City.
   (d)   Rentals. Rental income received by a taxpayer shall be included in the
computation of net profits from business activities under Section
890.03 (c), (d) and (e), only if and to the extent that the rental ownership,
management or operations of the real estate from which such rentals are
derived, whether so rented, managed or operated by a taxpayer individually or
through agents or other representatives, constitutes a business activity of the
taxpayer in whole or in part.
   Where the gross monthly rental of any and all real properties, regardless of
number and value, aggregates in excess of two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00)
per month, it shall be prima facie evidence that the rental, ownership,
management or operation of such properties is a business activity of such
taxpayer, and the net income of such rental property shall be subject to tax;
provided that in the case of commercial property, the owner shall be considered
engaged in a business activity when the rental is based on a fixed or
fluctuating percentage of gross or net sales, receipts or profits of the
lessee, whether or not such rental exceeds two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00)
per month; provided further that in the case of farm property, the owner shall
be considered engaged in a business activity when he or she shares in crops or
when the rental is based on a percentage of the gross or net receipts derived
from the farm, whether or not the gross income exceeds two hundred fifty
dollars ($250.00) per month, and provided further that the person who operates
a licensed rooming house shall be considered in business whether or not the
gross income exceeds two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per month.
   (e)   Operating Loss-Carry Forward.
      (1)   The portion of a net operating loss sustained in any taxable year
subsequent to January 1, 1976 allocable to the City may be applied against the
portion of the profit of succeeding tax years allocable to the City, until
exhausted but in no event for more than five taxable years immediately
following the year in which the loss occurred. No portion of a net operating
loss shall be carried back against net profits of any prior year.
      (2)   The portion of net operating loss sustained shall be allocated to
the City in the same manner as provided herein for allocating net profits to
the City.
      (3)   The Administrator shall Provide by rules and regulations the manner
in which such net operating loss carry forward shall be determined.

the operation of a business.

(1982 Code, § 181.06)  (Ord. 66-95.  Passed 12-27-1966.)
890.07  RETURNS.
   (a)   When Return Required to be Made. Any taxpayer who has income as herein
defined shall make and file a return on or before April 30 each year, except
taxpayers with a fiscal year or other period different from the calendar year,
in which event such return shall be due within four months from the end of such
fiscal year or period.
(Ord. 85-12.  Passed 3-4-1985.)
   (b)   Form and Content of Return. The return shall be filed with the
Administrator on a form or forms furnished by or obtainable upon request from
such Administrator, setting forth:
      (1)   The aggregate amounts of salaries, wages, commissions and other
compensation earned and gross income from business, profession or other
activity, less allowable expenses incurred in the acquisition of such gross
income earned during the preceding year and subject to such tax;
      (2)   The amount of the tax imposed by this Chapter on such earnings and

tax return. The Administrator may require a tentative return, accompanied by
payment of the amount of tax shown to be due thereon by the date the return is

stockholders or with other corporations related by stock ownership,

a division, branch, factory, office, laboratory or activity within the City
constituting a portion only of its total business, the Administrator shall
require such additional information as he or she may deem necessary to
ascertain whether net profits are properly allocated to the City. If the
Administrator finds that net profits are not properly allocated to the City by
reason of transactions with stockholders or with other corporations
related by stock ownership, interlocking directorates, or transactions with
such division, branch, factory, office, laboratory or activity or by some other
method, he or she shall make such allocation as he or she deems appropriate to
produce a fair and proper allocation of net profits to the City.

additional income and pay any additional tax due or claim a refund of tax
overpaid, subject to the requirements, limitations or both, contained in
Sections
890.17 and
890.18 hereof. Such amended return shall be on a form obtainable on request
from the Administrator. A taxpayer may not change the method of accounting or
apportionment of net profits after the due date for filing the original return.
      (2)   Within three months from the final determination of any federal tax
liability affecting the taxpayer's City tax liability, such taxpayer shall make

tax shown due thereon or make claim for refund of any overpayment.
(1982 Code, § 181.07)  (Ord.66-95.  Passed 12-27-1966.)
890.08  PAYMENT OF TAX ON FILING OF RETURNS.
   (a)   The taxpayer making a return shall, at the time of filing thereof, pay
to the Administrator the amount of taxes shown as due thereon; provided,
however, that:

indicated on the return, such overpayment (or part thereof) shall be refunded,
provided that no additional taxes or refunds of less than $1.00 shall be
collected or refunded.
(Ord. 71-88.  Passed 12-20-1971.)
   (c)   If any employer which is liable for tax obligations imposed by this

final tax returns shall be due immediately after the fundamental change. Any
successor employer shall withhold from any purchase price that the successor

successor employer shall make such withholding until such time that the
predecessor employer has paid such taxes, interest and penalties. If the
successor fails to withhold such amount, then the successor and, in a personal
manner, the successor's manager shall be jointly and severally liable for the
payment of the taxes, interest and penalty.

   (e)   (1)   Every manager is deemed to be a trustee of this Municipality in

records and federal income tax returns, or the refusal to submit to such
examination by any employer or persons subject or presumed to be subject to the
tax or by any officer, agent or employee of a person subject to the tax or
required to withhold tax or the failure of any person to comply with the

involving one or more of the following:

         B.   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section
891.12 (a).
         C.   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (f)(2)A. of this
section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period
prescribed by Section 891.12(a).
         D.   Nothing in division (f)(2) of this section nullifies or otherwise

inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
         C.   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (f)(3)A. or B. of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If
the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
      (4)   For the purposes of division (f)(1)C. of this section, receipts
from sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a
municipal corporation as follows:
         A.   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall

property shall be sitused to the City based upon the extent to which the
tangible personal property is used in the City.
      (5)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental
of real estate owned directly by the individual, or by a disregarded entity
owned by the individual, shall be subject to the City's tax only if the
property generating the net profit is located in the City or if the individual
taxpayer that receives the net profit is a resident of the City. The City shall
allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate accounting for the purpose of
calculating net profit sitused under this division to the municipal corporation
in which the property is located.
      (6)   A.   Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating
to the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported
by the real estate agent or broker shall be allocated to the City, if
applicable, based upon the ratio of the commissions the agent or broker
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate located in the City
to the commissions received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate
everywhere in the taxable year.
         B.   An individual who is a resident of the City shall report the
individual's net profit from all real estate activity on the individual's
annual tax return for the City. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such a credit is allowed under the City's income tax ordinance.

   Withholding Provisions.
   (a)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or doing
business in the City shall withhold an income tax from the qualifying wages
earned and/or received by each employee in the City. Except for qualifying
wages for which withholding is not required under Section
891.03  or division (b)(4) or (b)(6) of this section, the tax shall be withheld
at the rate, specified in Section
891.03 , of 2.5%. An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall
deduct and withhold the tax from qualifying wages on the date that the
employer, agent, or other payer directly, indirectly, or constructively pays
the qualifying wages to, or credits the qualifying wages to the benefit of, the
employee.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in division (b)(2) of this section, an
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to the Tax
Administrator of the City the greater of the income taxes deducted and withheld
or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld by the employer,
agent, or other payer according to the following schedule:
         A.   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the City in the preceding calendar year exceeded two thousand three
hundred ninety-nine dollars ($2,399), or if the total amount of taxes deducted
and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf of the City in
any month of the preceding calendar quarter exceeded two hundred dollars
($200.00).
               Payment under division (b)(1)A. of this section shall be made so
that the payment is received by the Tax Administrator not later than 15 days
after the last day of each month for which the tax was withheld.
         B.   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (b)(1)A. of this section of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the 15th day of the month following the end of each calendar
quarter.
         C.   [Intentionally Left Blank.]
      (2)   If the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required
to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying Federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other Federal statute or regulation, the
payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of
all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of the City. The payment of tax by
electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect an employer's,
agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as required under this
section.
      (3)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by Tax Administrator and City as the return required
of a non-resident employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this
chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent of
an employer, or other payer.
      (4)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold City income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
      (5)   A.   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         B.   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to remit to the City the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability for
that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer
in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to the
City income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent the
deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the
deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the City until such time as the withheld
amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:
         A.   The names, addresses, and social security numbers of all
employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for the City during the preceding calendar year;
         B.   The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such employee, the
total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         C.   The name of every other municipal corporation for which tax was
withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         D.   Any other information required for Federal income tax reporting
purposes on Internal Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with
respect to such employee;
         E.   Other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
      (9)   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold the City income tax
on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under
the employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
      (11)   The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section.

         C.   "Principal place of work" means the fixed location to which an
employee is required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary
basis. If the employee is not required to report for employment duties on a
regular and ordinary basis to a fixed location, "principal place of work" means
the worksite location in this state to which the employee is required to report

fixed location or worksite location, "principal place of work" means the
location in this state at which the employee spends the greatest number of days
in a calendar year performing services for or on behalf of the employee's
employer.
               If there is not a single municipal corporation in which the
employee spent the "greatest number of days in a calendar year" performing
services for or on behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more
municipal corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days
that is greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other
municipal corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's
qualifying wages subject to division (c)(2)A.1. of this section among those two
or more municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
               For the purposes of this division, the location at which an
employee spends a particular day shall be determined in accordance with

this section, an employer is not required to withhold City income tax on
qualifying wages paid to an employee for the performance of personal services
in the City if the employee performed such services in the City on 20 or fewer
days in a calendar year, unless one of the following conditions applies:
            1.   The employee's principal place of work is located in the City.
            2.   The employee performed services at one or more presumed
worksite locations in the City. For the purposes of this division, "presumed
worksite location" means a construction site or other temporary worksite in the
City at which the employer provides or provided services that can reasonably
be, or would have been, expected by the employer to last more than 20 days in a
calendar year. Services can "reasonably be expected by the employer to last
more than 20 days" if either of the following applies at the time the services
commence:
               a.   The nature of the services are such that it will require
more than 20 days of the services to complete the services;
               b.   The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform the services at
the location for more than 20 days.
            3.   The employee is a resident of the City and has requested that
the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages as provided in
this section.
            4.   The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure.
         B.   For the purposes of division (c)(2)A. of this section, an
employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in the
City only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on behalf
of the employer in the City than in any other municipal corporation on that
day. For the purposes of determining the amount of time an employee spent in a
particular location, the time spent performing one or more of the following
activities shall be considered to have been spent at the employee's principal
place of work:
            1.   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
            2.   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
            3.   Traveling from any location to another location in order to

            5.   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
      (3)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in another
Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception from
withholding requirements described in division (c)(2)A. of this section shall
apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described in
that division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying wages
to that municipal corporation.
      (4)   A.   Except as provided in division (c)(4)B. of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in the City exceeds the 20-day threshold, the employer shall
withhold and remit tax to the City for any subsequent days in that calendar
year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for personal
services performed in the City.
         B.   An employer required to begin withholding tax for the City under
division (c)(4)A. of this section may elect to withhold tax for the City for
the first 20 days on which the employer paid qualifying wages to the employee
for personal services performed in the City.
      (5)   If an employer's fixed location is the City and the employer
qualifies as a small employer as defined in Section 891.02, the employer shall
withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages for a
taxable year and remit that tax only to the City, regardless of the number of
days which the employee worked outside the corporate boundaries of the City.
            To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for
a taxable year, the employer will be required to provide the Tax Administrator
with the employer's Federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year.
      (6)   Divisions (c)(2)A. and (c)(4) of this section shall not apply to

return. The extended due date of the City's income tax return shall be the 15th
day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to which the

the filing of the City's income tax return.
         B.   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month

Tax Administrator on or before the date the City income tax return is due, the
Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.

filing state income tax returns under division (G) of R.C. § 5747.08, a
taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of the City's
income tax return. The extended due date of the City's income tax return shall
be the same as the extended due date of the state income tax return.
      (4)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the City, the Tax Administrator may require
taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided in this
division, including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual returns.

   (i)   If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer, the
payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. This division shall not
apply to payments required to be made under Section
891.04 (b)(1)A. or provisions for semi-monthly withholding.
   (j)   Taxes withheld for the City by an employer, the agent of an employer,
or other payer as described in Section 891.04 shall be allowed to the taxpayer

income tax return, report, or document required by the City, provided that the
generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the information
required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted by the City
or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer
filing the generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this chapter
and of the City's ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations governing the
filing of returns, reports, or documents.
   Filing via Ohio Business Gateway.
   (m)   (l)   Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect
to the taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file the City's
income tax return, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for

amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (3)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns. Extension for service in or for the armed forces.
   Extension for Service in or for the Armed Forces.

duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the City for
both an extension of time for filing of the return and an extension of time for
payment of taxes required by the City during the period of the member's or
civilian's duty service, and for 180 days thereafter. The application shall be
filed on or before the 180th day after the member's or civilian's duty
terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax Administrator
considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (o)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the 181st day after the applicant's active duty or
service terminates. The Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms as
the Tax Administrator considers appropriate. However, taxes pursuant to a
contract entered into under this division are not delinquent, and the Tax
Administrator shall not require any payments of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the City before the 181st day after the applicant's active
duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (o)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require
any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
   (p)   (1)   Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (n) and (o) of this section.
      (2)   A.   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the City in accordance with this
chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (p)(2)A. of this
section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension that the
taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this division,
"qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of the
United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces.
         B.   Taxes whose payment is extended in accordance with division (p)
(2)A. of this section are not delinquent during the extension period. Such
taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of the extension
period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax Administrator
shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in connection with those
taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any
period of extension granted under division (c)(2)A. of this section in
calculating the penally or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (q)   For each taxable year to which division (n), (o), or (p) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (o)(2) and (o)(3) of
this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the filing
status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that year.

   (r)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily

state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.

Internal Revenue Code.

consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
Federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local

(l) of this section.
      (4)   "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in R.C.
§ 4927.01.

§ 5727.01.
   (s)   (l)   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the City's
income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated Federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with the first
taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting method is
required under Federal law. The election continues to be binding for each
subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing
consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (s)(2) of this section
or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The Tax
Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election period in
effect under division (s)(l) of this section. The election to discontinue
filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (s)(l) or (s)(2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (t)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated Federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated City income tax return for that taxable year if the Tax
Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany
transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a
distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net
profits to City. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated City income
tax return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated City income tax return
for all subsequent taxable years, unless the taxpayer requests and receives
written permission from the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a
taxpayer has experienced a change in circumstances.
   (u)   A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated City income tax return in the
same manner as is required under the United States Department of Treasury

affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (v)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (v)(2), (v)(3), and
(v)(4) of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income
tax return shall compute adjusted Federal taxable income, as defined in Section
891.02, by substituting "consolidated Federal taxable income" for "Federal
taxable income" wherever "Federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated City income tax return shall
make any adjustment otherwise required under Section 891.02(c)(1) to the extent
that the item of income or deduction otherwise subject to the adjustment has
been eliminated or consolidated in the computation of consolidated Federal
taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly or
indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group's consolidated Federal taxable income for a taxable year, the
corporation filing a consolidated City income tax return shall do one of the
following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for
that taxable year:
         A.   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (r) through (y) of
this section, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-
through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused
to the City. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the entity
shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
Federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         B.   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (r) through (y) of
this section, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-
through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused
to the City. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the entity
shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated Federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly or
indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group's consolidated Federal taxable income for a taxable year, all
of the following shall apply:
         A.   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (r) through (y) of
this section, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-
through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused
to the City;
         B.   The pass-through entity shall be subject to City income taxation
as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
Federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (w)   Corporations filing a consolidated City income tax return shall make
the computations required under divisions (r) through (y) of this section by
substituting "consolidated Federal taxable income attributable to" for "net
profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (x)   Each corporation filing a consolidated City income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by the City in accordance with this chapter on the
corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any
portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated
group.
   (y)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with the City before January 1, 2016, to file a consolidated
or combined tax return with the City may continue to file consolidated or
combined tax returns in accordance with such election or agreement for taxable
years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

   (a)   Every individual taxpayer domiciled in the City who is required to and
does pay, or has acknowledged liability for, a municipal tax to another
municipality on or measured by the same income, qualifying wages, commissions,
net profits or other compensation taxable under this chapter may claim a
nonrefundable credit upon satisfactory evidence of the tax paid to the other
municipality. Subject to division (c) of this section, the credit shall not
exceed 100% of the amount obtained by multiplying the income, qualifying wages,
commissions, net profits or other compensation subject to tax in the other
municipality by the LOWER of the tax rate in such other municipality OR the
rate of 1%.
   (b)   The City shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the City who works in a joint economic development zone created under R.C. §
715.691 or a joint economic development district created under R.C. § 715.70,
715.71, or 715.72 to the same extent that it grants a credit against its tax on
income to its residents who are employed in another municipal corporation.
   (c)   If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other
municipality, then for purposes of division (a) of this section, "the income,
qualifying wages, commissions, net profits or other compensation" subject to
tax in the other municipality shall be limited to the amount computed by
dividing the tax withheld or paid to the other municipality by the tax rate for
that municipality.
   (d)   [Intentionally Left Blank.]

   (b)   (1)   Every taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for
the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars
($200.00). For the purposes of this section:
         A.   Taxes withheld for the City from qualifying wages shall be
considered as paid to the City in equal amounts on each payment date unless the
taxpayer establishes the dates on which all amounts were actually withheld, in
which case they shall be considered as paid on the dates on which the amounts
were actually withheld.
         B.   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent taxable
year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the cover in
which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic funds
transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division, "date of
the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the cover, the
earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)   Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations of
estimated taxes. A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by

date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under Section
891.05 (g) or on or before the 15th day of the fourth month after the taxpayer

fiscal year or period.
      (5)   The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
   (c)   (1)   The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the City, including
the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and withholding on or before
the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         A.   On or before the 15th day of the fourth month after the beginning
of the taxable year, 22.5% of the tax liability for the taxable year;
         B.   On or before the 15th day of the sixth month after the beginning
of the taxable year, 45% of the tax liability for the taxable year;
         C.   On or before the 15th day of the ninth month after the beginning

liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
891.18  upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (e) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         A.   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, 22.5% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         B.   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, 45% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         C.   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, 67.5% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         D.   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, 90% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penally.
   (e)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (d) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 90% of
the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by annualizing the
income received during the year up to the end of the month immediately
preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 100%
of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for the preceding
taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable year reflected a
period of 12 months and the taxpayer filed a return with the City under Section
891.05  for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the City but was not
domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that includes
the first day of the taxable year.

(Ord. 2015-42.  Passed 10-19-2015.)
891.09  REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS.
   (a)   As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in
Section
891.18 .
   (b)   Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator, in
accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax
levied by the City:

refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator within three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever
is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file with the
request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for a
refund.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (c)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
891.21 .
   (d)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (c) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:

postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (e)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in Section 891.18
(a)(4).

deposited with another municipality, is allowable by the City as a refund but
is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds.

have been deposited with the City is subject to recovery by the City. If the

a nonrefundable credit against the tax or withholding the City claims is due
with respect to such income or wages, equal to the tax or withholding paid to
the first municipality with respect to such income or wages.
   (c)   If the City's tax rate is less than the tax rate in the other
municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using the
City's tax rate. However, if the City's tax rate is greater than the tax rate
in the other municipality, the tax due in excess of the nonrefundable credit is
to be paid to the City, along with any penally and interest that accrued during
the period of nonpayment.
   (d)   Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.
(Ord. 2015-42.  Passed 10-19-2015.)
891.11  AMENDED RETURNS.
   (a)   (1)   If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return for
the City changes as a result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's Federal or
state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with the
City. The amended return shall be filed on a form required by the Tax
Administrator.
      (2)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated Federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (b)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars ($10.00) or less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's Federal or state income tax return only:
         A.   To determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,
         B.   If the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
891.12  has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (c)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division within the period prescribed by Section
891.12 (e) for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is in accordance with the dollars,
no refund need be paid by the City. A request filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's Federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed within
the time prescribed in Section 891.09.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,

income tax based upon such final determination of Federal or state tax
liability. The taxpayer shall pay any additional City income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is less than ten dollars ($10.00).

891.12  LIMITATIONS.
   (a)   (1)   A.   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
later of:
            1.   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            2.   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         B.   The time limit described in division (a)(1)A. of this section may
be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer, agent
of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the extension.
Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time limit
described in division (c) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         A.   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
891.21 . That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding,
or holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         B.   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any party
appeals from the determination of the Board of Tax Review, the 60th day after
the date on which the final determination of the Board of Tax Review is either
ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately reversed and no further
appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part, or that reversal is
available or taken.
   (b)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of 25% or more of income required to be
reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after the commission
of the offense.
   (c)   A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought within
the time limitation provided in Section 891.09.
   (d)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the City does not prejudice any
claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio Board
of Tax Appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio Board of Tax
Appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section
891.09 , with interest on that amount as provided by Section
891.09 (e).
   (e)   No civil action to recover City income tax or related penalties or
interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
(Ord. 2015-42.  Passed 10-19-2015.)
891.13  AUDITS.
   (a)   At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (b)   Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (c)   At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (d)   A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (e)   The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (f)   If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest.
(Ord. 2015-42.  Passed 10-19-2015.)
891.14  SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (a)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator has at
the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under R.C. § 5703.056.
      (2)   "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under R.C. § 5703.056 is not able to
deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the reason for non-
delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept the
assessment.
   (b)   Subject to division (c) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under R.C. § 5703.056. With
the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax Administrator
may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided in this
section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic mail.
   (c)   (1)   A.   If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under R.C. § 5703.056. If
the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known address, the
assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served. If the
ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable address, the
assessment remains appealable within 60 days after the assessment's postmark.
         B.   Once the Tax Administrator or other City official, or the
designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the assessment
is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by filing an
appeal with the local board of tax review within 60 days after the receipt of
service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator under division
(c)(1)A. of this section is prima facie evidence that delivery is complete and
that the assessment is served.
      (2)   If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
            "This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under
applicable law ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax
Administrator as shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an
appeal may be filed apply from and after that date."
            Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address,
the mailing of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the
assessment was completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the
assessment by ordinary mail and that the assessment was served.
            If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an
undeliverable address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (c)
(1)A. of this section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and
service under this division in accordance with division (d) of this section.
   (d)   (1)   A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service under
division (c) of this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of
the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent by certified
mail was not an address with which the person was associated at the time the
Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least 20%, as determined by voting rights, of
the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (d)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other City official,
or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division prevents
the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a compromise with
the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal with the local
board of tax review.
   (e)   Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (f)   Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (c)(1)B. of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (g)   Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 2015-42.  Passed 10-19-2015.)
891.15  ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (a)   As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the City that arises pursuant to City's income tax imposed in accordance
with this chapter.
   (b)   Nothing in this chapter prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the City:
      (1)   Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (c)   The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-time
agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be appealable.
   (d)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (e)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due.
(Ord. 2015-42.  Passed 10-19-2015.)
891.16  TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (a)   Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of the City as
authorized by this chapter. The Tax Administrator or a designee thereof may
furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this chapter and
other related tax information to the Internal Revenue Service, the Tax
Commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (b)   This section does not prohibit the City from publishing or disclosing
statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect to
particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 2015-42.  Passed 10-19-2015.)
891.17  FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by the City ordinance or state law to
be filed with a the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure, counsel, or advise
the preparation or presentation of such report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend, or knowingly procure,
counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment of the records upon
which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or document is based
with intent to defraud the City or the Tax Administrator.

      (5)   "Return" includes any tax return, report, reconciliation, schedule,

years beginning on or after January 1, 2016;
         B.   Income tax, estimated income tax, and withholding tax required to
be paid or remitted to the City on or after January 1, 2016.
      (2)   This section does not apply to returns required to be filed or
payments required to be made before January 1, 2016, regardless of the filing
or payment date. Returns required to be filed or payments required to be made
before January 1, 2016, but filed or paid after that date shall be subject to
the ordinances or rules and regulations, as adopted before January 1, 2016, of
the City to which the return is to be filed or the payment is to be made.
   (c)   Should any taxpayer, employer, agent of the employer, or other payer
for any reason fails, in whole or in part, to make timely and full payment or

timely with the City any return required to be filed, the following penalties

891.19  AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; VERIFICATION OF INFORMATION.
   Authority.
   (a)   Nothing in this chapter shall limit the authority of the Tax
Administrator to perform any of the following duties or functions, unless the
performance of such duties or functions is expressly limited by a provision of
the Ohio Revised Code:
      (1)   A.   Exercise all powers whatsoever of a query nature as provided
by law, including, the right to inspect books, accounts, records, memorandums,
and Federal and state income tax returns, to examine persons under oath, to
issue orders or subpoenas for the production of books, accounts, papers,
records, documents, and testimony, to take depositions, to apply to a court for
attachment proceedings as for contempt, to approve vouchers for the fees of
officers and witnesses, and to administer oaths.

exercised by the Tax Administrator only in connection with the performance of
the duties respectively assigned to the Tax Administrator under the City's
income tax ordinance;
      (2)   Appoint agents and prescribe their powers and duties;
      (3)   Confer and meet with officers of other municipal corporations and
states and officers of the United States on any matters pertaining to their
respective official duties as provided by law;
      (4)   Exercise the authority provided by law, including orders from
bankruptcy courts, relative to remitting or refunding taxes, including

computations, or orders the Tax Administrator has made.
         B.   If an appeal has been filed with the Board of Tax Review or other

      (8)   Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner
authorized by law;
      (9)   Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the withholding

may examine the books, papers, records, and Federal and state income tax
returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that
the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this chapter
for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return
was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Upon written request by
the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and Federal

the provisions of this chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator may require any person, by notice served on that person, to keep
such records as the Tax Administrator determines necessary to show whether or
not that person is liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax
levied by the City or for the withholding of such tax.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the
Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that
was or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to
affect such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any
such person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books,
papers, records, and Federal and state income tax returns in such person's
possession or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing
or examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a
person who is not an attorney.
      (4)   No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or Federal or state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.
   Identification Information.
   (c)   (1)   Nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from
requiring any person filing a tax document with the Tax Administrator to
provide identifying information, which may include the person's social security
number, Federal employer identification number, or other identification number
requested by the Tax Administrator. A person required by the Tax Administrator
to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or
upon, filing the next tax document requiring the identifying information.
      (2)   A.   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within 30 days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
891.18 , in addition to any applicable penalty described in Section
891.99 .
         B.   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under Section
891.19 (c) within 30 days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
891.18 .
         C.   The penalties provided for under divisions (c)(2)A. and B. of
this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee
with respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition
to any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
891.99  for a violation of Section
891.17  and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by
law.

transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.

received under this section. Such refusal is not subject to appeal.

subject to appeal.

City Council, but such appointees may not be employees, elected officials, or
contractors with the City at any time during their term or in the five years
(which applies only to these two appointments) immediately preceding the date

      (3)   Members of the Board of Tax Review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority by majority vote for

The decision by the legislative authority on the charges is final and not
appealable.

meet the qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall
resign immediately by operation of law.
      (5)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within 60 days of when the vacancy was created. Any
member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the Board of Tax Review shall impair the
power and authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the
Board of Tax Review.

Review due to a conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the

Review in the member's place. The appointment of such an individual shall be
subject to the same requirements and limitations as are applicable to the
appointment of the member temporarily unable to serve.

Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed.

892.01  DEFINITIONS.
   For the purposes of this chapter, words and phrases shall have the following
meanings:
   (a)   "Admission charge" means the charge made for the right or privilege to
enter into a place; provided, however, that if such charge includes the rental
of property or services, it shall be deemed to be an admission charge if so
designated, unless the charge is for rental or services and persons who do not
use such property or services are admitted free. If a lesser charge is made to
persons who do not desire to use the property or services offered, the lesser
charge shall constitute the admission charge. The designation of the charge as
a rental or service charge shall not be construed to avoid the application of
the tax if it is in effect a charge for admission, and any such equivalent of
an admission charge shall be subject to the tax hereby imposed.
   (b)   "Director" means the Director of Finance of the City.
   (c)   "Person" means any individual, receiver, assignee, firm,
copartnership, joint venture, corporation, company, joint stock company,
association, society or any group of individuals acting as a unit, whether
mutual, cooperative, fraternal, nonprofit or otherwise.
   (d)   "Place" includes, but is not restricted to, theaters, dance halls,
golf courses, amphitheaters, auditoriums, stadiums, athletic pavilions,
athletic fields, baseball and athletic parks, bowling alleys, circuses,
sideshows, swimming pools, outdoor amusement parks, and such attractions as
merry-go-rounds, ferris wheels, roller coasters and observation towers.
(1982 Code, § 183.01)  (Ord. 47-79.  Passed 9-29-1947.)
892.02  AMOUNTS TO BE LEVIED.
   There is hereby levied and imposed upon every person who pays an admission
charge to any place a tax of 3% on the amounts paid for admission to any place
including admission by season ticket or subscription.
   (a)   Such tax shall apply to every admission to any place within the
corporate limits for which a charge is made, provided the place is located
entirely within the City. When any place is located partly within and partly
without the City, Council shall estimate what portion thereof is within, and
what portion thereof is without, this City, and the tax hereby levied shall
apply only to the percentage of admissions corresponding to that portion of the
place estimated to be located within this City. If the municipality within
which the remaining portion of the place is located shall levy a similar tax
with respect to such remaining portion, Council shall make provision for the
collection of the tax due the City upon the basis of such estimate. In the
instance of the Fairmount Theater, operated by The Fairmount Amusement Company,
it is estimated that one-half of the theater is located within the City of
University Heights and one-half within the City of Shaker Heights. A similar
tax having been levied by the City of Shaker Heights, with respect to the
portion of the theater within the boundaries of that City, it is hereby
determined and provided that such City, through its duly designated officers,
shall collect, as the agent of this City, the tax hereby levied, and shall
forward to the proper officer of this City 50% of the combined tax paid by such
place, together with a copy of the combined return and other necessary data
pertaining thereto.
(Ord. 48-49.  Passed 6-21-1948.)
   (b)   A tax of 3% on the excess of the amounts paid for tickets or cards of
admission to theaters, operas and other places of amusement, if such places be
within the corporate limits, sold at newsstands, hotels and other places than
the ticket offices of such theaters, operas, or other place of amusement, over
and above the amounts representing the established price therefor at such
ticket offices. Such tax shall be returned and paid in the manner provided in
Section
892.04 by the person selling the ticket.
   (c)   A tax of 3% on the amount paid for admission to any public performance
for profit at any roof garden, cabaret or other similar entertainment in case
the charge for admission is in the form of a service charge or cover charge or
other similar charge, and such place of entertainment be within the corporate
limits.
   (d)   A tax of 3% on the amount paid as annual membership dues by every club
or organization maintaining a golf course; and a tax of 3% on greens fees paid
to golf courses either under club or private ownership.
(1982 Code, § 183.02)  (Ord. 47-79.  Passed 9-29-1947.)
892.03  EXEMPTIONS.
   No tax shall be levied under this chapter with respect to any admission all
the proceeds of which inure:
   (a)   Exclusively to the benefit of religious, educational or charitable
institutions, societies, organizations, societies or organizations for the
prevention of cruelty to children or animals or societies or organizations
conducted for the sole purpose of maintaining symphony orchestras and receiving
substantial support from voluntary contributions, or of improving any municipal
corporation, or of maintaining a cooperative or community center moving picture
theater, or swimming pool if no part of the net earnings thereof inures to the
benefit of any private stockholder or individual.
   (b)   Exclusively to the benefit of persons in the military or naval forces
of the United States, or of National Guard organizations, reserve officer
associations or posts or organizations of war veterans, or auxiliary units or
societies of any such posts or organizations, if such posts, organizations,
units or societies are organized in the State of Ohio, and if no part of their
net earnings inures to the benefit of any private stockholder or individual.
   (c)   Exclusively to the benefit of persons who have served in the military
or naval forces of the United States and are in need.
   (d)   Exclusively to the benefit of members of the police or fire
departments of any municipal corporation, or the dependents or heirs of such
members.
   (e)   Exclusively to the benefit of the general revenue fund of any
municipal corporation or exclusively to the benefit of any fund of any
municipal corporation under the control of a recreation commission. This
exemption from the tax, however, shall not be allowed in cases wherein the
admission price is $0.41 or more.
      (1)   The exemption from tax provided by this section shall, however, not
be allowed in case of admissions to wrestling matches, prize fights, or boxing,
sparring or other pugilistic matches or exhibitions, nor in the case of
admissions to any athletic games or exhibition the proceeds of which inure
wholly or partly to the benefit of any high school, academy, preparatory or
other school, in cases wherein the admission price is $0.41 or more, or wholly
or partly to the benefit of any college or university.
      (2)   Immediately after the event for which an exemption from admission
tax has been allowed, the treasurer of the institution, society, or
organization for whose benefit such event was held shall file an itemized
statement with the Director of Finance setting forth the amount of money
actually received by such treasurer, together with the expenses of promoting
and conducting such event. Such statement shall be used as a basis of
subsequent requests for exemption from admissions tax for the benefit of such
institution, society or organization and if such statement shows a
disproportionate expenditure for promoting and conducting such event, in
relation to the profits, if any, no such exemption shall thereafter be allowed
to the institution, society or organization.
      (3)   The exemption from tax provided in this section shall not be
allowed to any institution, society or organization which does not control the
sale of admissions to the event for which the exemption is requested, nor shall
any exemption be allowed where talent, services or other items are compensated
for on a percentage basis if such percentage results in a payment in excess of
the flat rate ordinarily charged for the same talent, services or other items.
(1982 Code, § 183.03)  (Ord. 47-79.  Passed 9-29-1947.)
892.04  COLLECTION OF TAX.
   (a)   Every person receiving any payment on which a tax is levied under this
chapter shall collect the amount of the tax imposed from the person making the
admission payment. The tax required to be collected under this chapter shall be
deemed to be held in trust by the person required to collect the same until
paid to the Director of Finance as herein provided. Any person required to
collect the tax imposed under this chapter who fails to do so, or having
collected the tax, fails to remit it to the Director in the manner prescribed
by this chapter, whether such failure is the result of his own act or the
result of acts or conditions beyond his control, shall be personally liable to
the City for the amount of the tax, and shall, unless the remittance be made as
herein required, be guilty of a violation of this chapter.
   (b)   The tax imposed hereunder shall be collected at the time the admission
charge is paid by the person seeking admission to any place and shall be
reported and remitted by the person receiving the tax to the Director in
monthly installments and remittances made therefor on or before the thirtieth
day of the month next succeeding the end of the monthly period in which the tax
is collected or received; provided, that the first return and remittance under
this chapter shall be made on or before the thirtieth day of November, 1947,
and shall cover the period from and including October first to and including
October thirty-first or a four or five week policy month period as the case may
be. Payment or remittance of the tax collected may be made by check, unless
payment or remittance is otherwise required by the Director, but payment by
check shall not relieve the person collecting the tax from liability for
payment and remittance of the tax to the Director unless the check is honored
and is in the full and correct amount.
   (c)   The person receiving any payment for admissions shall make out a
return upon such forms and setting forth such information as the Director may
require, showing the amount of the tax upon admissions for which he or she is
liable for the preceding monthly period, and shall sign and transmit the same
to the Director with a remittance for the amount; provided, that the Director
may in his or her discretion require verified annual returns from any person
receiving admission payments setting forth such additional information as he or
she may deem necessary to determine correctly the amount of tax collected and
payable.
   (d)   Whenever any theater, circus, show, exhibition, entertainment or
amusement makes an admission charge which is subject to the tax herein levied,
and the same is of a temporary or transitory nature, of which the Director
shall be the judge, the Director may require the report and remittance of the
admissions tax immediately upon the collection of the same, at the conclusion
of the performance or exhibition, or at the conclusion of the series of
performances or exhibitions or at such other times as the Director shall
determine. Failure to comply with any requirement of the Director to report and
remit the tax as required shall be a violation of this chapter.
   (e)   The books, records and accounts of any person collecting a tax herein
levied shall, as to admission charges and tax collections, be at all reasonable
times subject to examination and audit by the Director.
   (f)   If the tax imposed by this chapter is not paid when due, there shall
be added, as part of the tax, interest at the rate of 1% per month from the
time when the tax became due until paid.
(Ord. 47-79.  Passed 9-29-1947.)
   (g)   When a place is located partly within and partly without the City and
the municipality in which the remainder of the place is located has levied a
similar tax and when the conditions established by Section
892.02(a) have been fulfilled, Council shall determine the manner in which the
tax due this City shall be collected and may consent to the collection of such
tax by such other municipality as agent of this City. Except as to the manner
of payment of the tax, all provisions of this section shall apply as though
such place were located entirely within this city.
   (h)   In the instance of the Fairmount Theater, operated by The Fairmount
Amusement Company, consent is hereby given to the collection of the tax levied
by the City of Shaker Heights, as agent of this City. Combined returns and
payment of both taxes shall be made to the Director of Finance of the City of
Shaker Heights, who shall, promptly upon receipt of the combined return and
remittance of the combined tax, forward a copy of the combined return and the
proper proportion of the combined taxes to the Director of Finance.
(1982 Code, § 183.04)  (Ord. 48-49.  Passed 6-21-1948.)
892.05  CERTIFICATE OF REGISTRATION.
   (a)   Any person conducting or operating any place for entrance to which an
admission charge is made shall, on a form prescribed by the Director of
Finance, make application to and procure from the Director a certificate of
registration, the fee for which shall be $1.00. The certificate shall continue
valid until the thirty-first day of December of the year in which the same is
issued. The certificate of registration, or duplicate original copies thereof
to be issued by the Director without additional charge, shall be posted in a
conspicuous place in each ticket or box office where tickets of admission are
sold.
(Ord. 47-79.  Passed 9-29-1947.)
   (b)   When a place is located partly within and partly without the City and
the municipality in which the remainder of the place is located has levied a
similar tax, and is collecting the tax hereby levied as the agent of this City,
Council may consent to the issuance by such municipality of the certificate of
registration required by this section. Such certificate shall be issued and
posted as though such place were located entirely within this City; provided,
however, that only one certificate shall be required of the owners or operators
of such place.
   (c)   In the instance of the Fairmount Theater, operated by The Fairmount
Amusement Company, the consent of this City is hereby given to the issuance by
the City of Shaker Heights, in accordance with the terms of this chapter, of
the certificate of registration required by this section.
(1982 Code, § 183.05)  (Ord. 48-49.  Passed 6-21-1948.)
892.06  CERTIFICATE OF REGISTRATION FOR TEMPORARY AMUSEMENTS.
   Whenever a certificate of registration is obtained for the purpose of
operating or conducting a temporary or transitory amusement, entertainment or
exhibition by persons who are not the owners, lessees or custodians of the
building, lot or place where the amusement is to be conducted, the tax imposed
by this chapter shall be reported and remitted as provided in Section
892.04 by the owner, lessee or custodian, unless paid by the person conducting
the place. The applicant for a certificate of registration for such purpose
shall furnish with the application therefor the name and address of the owner,
lessee or custodian of the premises upon which the amusement is to be
conducted, and such owner, lessee or custodian shall be notified by the
Director of the issuance of such certificate and the joint liability for
collection and remittance of such tax.

Designation C 39-33; three such cylinders shall be used to adequately perform
the required seven-day test, and three cylinders to adequately perform the 28-
day test. The resulting compression strength must not be less than 2,500 pounds
per square inch in seven days and not less than 4,000 pounds per square inch in
28 days. Strength tests may be utilized for the purpose of checking on quality
of materials used and method of mixing. If any tests fall below the standard of
specifications set forth herein, the Commissioner may, at his or her
discretion, order the contractor to discontinue the use of any cement, sand or
stone being used in the concrete, and to supply other grades of materials which
will produce the standard strength as specified above. The costs of all such
tests shall be at the expense of the contractor.
      (2)   Excavation of subgrade shall be made to the depth necessary to
permit the required thickness of ballast and thickness of concrete for the
specified installation. The contractor shall remove all spongy material, roots,
shale, loam and earth, and all material excavated shall be removed from the
premises by the contractor. Any fill necessary to level shall meet the
specifications of this chapter and shall be compacted uniformly as may be
approved by the Commissioner or his or her inspector.
      (3)   No broken concrete may be used as a part of the bed unless the
excavation is carried deep enough to permit the use of such broken material
below the required thickness of finished concrete, as required by this chapter.
Ballast under concrete sidewalk shall have a thickness or depth after rolling
of three inches, under residential driveway aprons and that portion of the
public sidewalk crossed by such driveways of four inches, and under commercial
driveways and that portion of the public sidewalk crossed by such driveways of
six inches.
      (4)   Concrete shall be thoroughly mixed before being deposited in clean,
steel forms adequately braced to prevent distortion from the specified
dimensions. Steel forms shall be used on all straight sections of sidewalk.
Wood forms shall not be used except for single sections of five feet or less,
for special curved sections or for such special work as may require wood forms
and permission therefor is given by the Commissioner. All forms used, whether
steel or wood, shall not be permitted to become warped or twisted, shall be
subject to the approval of the Commissioner or his or her inspector, and shall
be of a size sufficient to produce an installation of the required thickness.
All forms shall be kept clean and free from defects and shall be coated with a
suitable oil before filling with concrete.
      (5)   Foundation beds shall be sprinkled immediately prior to the pouring
of the concrete, which when mixed shall be rapidly deposited in the forms; any
concrete not in final position within 30 minutes after completion of the mixing
must be discarded. Under no circumstances may concrete that has partially set
be used, and the remixing of such materials is specifically prohibited.
Concrete shall be deposited between bulkheads to a uniform thickness and to the
full depth and width of the form; any irregular or sloping surfaces shall be
avoided. Concrete after being placed or poured shall be thoroughly tamped and
consolidated so that none of the limestone appears on the surface, and it shall
be thoroughly compacted and brought to the proper pitch and grade with a
templet or straight edge.
      (6)   Immediately prior to finishing the surface, the concrete shall be
cut into slabs not longer than ten feet on any one side. Control joints,
whether hand-tooled or sawn, shall be to a depth of one-fourth the thickness of
the slab. Approved expansion joints shall be used on each side of the driveway
where it passes through the public sidewalk.
      (7)   Finishing of the work shall immediately follow the placing and
compacting of the concrete after the water sheen has disappeared from the
surface. The least amount of finishing should be done; water shall not be added
to the surface. All surfaces shall be free from depressions or inequalities.
The application of dry cement to hasten drying of the surface is specifically
prohibited.
      (8)   In rainy weather, concrete shall be protected as soon as it is
finished, and in hot or dry weather, the concrete shall be properly cured with
an approved curing compound, as per manufacturer's specifications. No concrete
shall be poured between November 15 and April 30 without applying a six-inch
straw cover or an approved blanket cover.
      (9)   Prepared strips of bitumen and fiber or mineral aggregate shall be
placed in concrete installations at intervals of at least 40 feet, and shall
also be placed at all points where the work abuts curbing or a lateral
sidewalk, and along the line of a building where the work is laid full width
from the curb to a building or other structures. Similar joints shall be placed
around all water meter covers, gas boxes, hydrants, lamp tankards or other
fixed objects projecting through the installation. All such strips shall be one
fourth of an inch in thickness, except for transverse joints when the
temperature is below  70ºF., in which event the strips shall be one-half of an
inch in thickness. The top of the strip shall be cut off flush with the top of
the concrete.
      (10)   While the above specifications are based on the use of "ready mix"
concrete, it will be permissible to mix the concrete at the site of
installation, provided an inspector is present and further provided the
concrete is mixed in a mechanical batch-type mixer operated for two minutes at
the rate of 12 to 18 revolutions per minute. Mixing by hand in a box or on a
platform is prohibited. Not more than five gallons of water shall be used per
sack of cement and all quantities of sand and aggregate shall be measured
before placing in the mixer. Proportions shall be governed by the
specifications set forth in this chapter.
      (11)   Concrete installations regulated by the requirements of this
chapter shall have the following thickness or depth when used for the following
purposes:
         A.   Public sidewalks, except that portion crossed by a driveway,
shall have a thickness of four and one-half inches, with a sand ballast of
three inches;
         B.   That portion of private residential driveways within the limits
of any public highway (commonly called driveway aprons), and including that
portion of the public sidewalk crossed by such driveways, and a private
driveway not within the limits of a public highway, shall have a thickness of
six inches with a sand ballast of four inches; and
         C.   Private commercial driveways within the limits of any public
highway, and including that portion of the public sidewalk crossed by such
driveways, shall have a thickness of eight inches or as may be required by the
Engineer, with a sand ballast of six inches. Sand ballast shall be thoroughly
tamped. The foregoing specifications are the minimum requirements, and any
installation which fails to meet such specifications will be considered as
faulty and will be condemned and required to be replaced. Determination of such
measurements shall be made after the sand ballast has been thoroughly
compressed or compacted in place.
      (12)   The contractor shall use all due precautions to protect, and shall
follow, stakes and working lines approved by the Commissioner. All work shall
be carried on and material placed so as to offer the least possible obstruction
to vehicular or pedestrian traffic. Barricades and red lights shall be
maintained by the contractor for such period as may be required.
      (13)   No water may be used from City mains by a private contractor
unless permission shall be granted and provision made for the method of
measurement and payment for water used.
      (14)   Upon completion of any work, the area adjacent thereto shall be
cleaned of all waste material, excavated dirt, etc., which the contractor shall
remove to the nearest dump.
      (15)   No truck washout and/or excess, left over, unusable concrete shall
be washed into any private or public sewer system.
(Ord. 2004-21.  Passed 6-7-2004.)
1060.08  SPECIFICATIONS FOR ASPHALTIC INSTALLATIONS.
   (a)   The base for all asphaltic installations shall be six inches in
finished depth, and such base shall be of limestone ranging from two inches to
one-half inch screen, and all loads delivered shall be of uniform mix without
segregation of sizes. This material shall be evenly spread over the rolled
subgrade, and thoroughly consolidated with a power roller of at least five tons
weight. Voids shall be filled with fine screenings after the initial rolling
and the surface sprayed with water during the final roller operation. The
finished top of the base shall be uniform in surface and shall show no loose
aggregates.
   (b)   An alternate base may be made by using portland cement concrete four
inches in depth. Such concrete shall be composed of one part cement, two and
one-half parts sand and four parts limestone. Only enough water shall be used
to provide workability of the mix and the material shall be hand-tamped in
place on the rolled subgrade. A covering of burlap or heavy paper shall be left
on for a period of at least six days before applying the two-inch asphalt
surface.
   (c)   When the base has thoroughly dried to the satisfaction of the Building
Commissioner, the two-inch asphalt wearing surface may be laid. On the
foundation, as heretofore required, there shall be laid the bituminous concrete
wearing surface, which shall consist of a mineral aggregate mixed with
bituminous cement and laid as hereinafter specified. This wearing surface shall
have a thickness of two inches after thorough compression with a roller
weighing at least five tons.
   (d)   The mineral aggregate shall consist of a mixture of broken stone and
sand to which in some cases may be added a small quantity of stone dust or
portland cement. Any sound, durable stone such as trap rock, blue limestone, or
granite, usually considered suitable for macadam surface, may be used. The
stone must be broken as nearly cubical as practicable and shall not show
distinct planes of cleavage or crystalline faces and shall not crush or split
under the roller when being consolidated in the installation. For the wearing
surface the stone shall vary in size from that passing a one and one-fourth
inch screen to that held on a one-fourth inch screen. The dust or fine
screenings shall be removed from the stone if excessive and irregular in
quantity. The sand shall be similar in character to that commonly used in sheet
asphalt mixtures. It shall be hardgrained and moderately sharp, free from loam
or other foreign material and vary in size from that passing a one-fourth inch
screen to dust passing a 200 mesh screen. There shall not be over 5% passing
the 200 mesh screen and not over 30% on the ten mesh screen. The dust which may
be added to the mixture shall be either portland cement or finely ground
limestone. Not over 4% by weight shall be added to any bituminous concrete
mixture and a screening of the combined aggregate should not be over 6% of 200
mesh material.
   (e)   The proportions of the various ingredients composing the bituminous
concrete shall be approximately three parts of stone to two parts of sand, to
which shall then be added bituminous cement sufficient so that from 7% to 10%
by weight of the mixture shall be bitumen soluble in carbon disulphide.
   (f)   The mineral aggregate shall, before mixing with the bituminous cement,
be dried and heated in driers of approved type in which the material does not
come in contact with fire or flames. The driers shall be of the revolving type,
agitating and turning the material during the process of drying. When the
aggregate is thoroughly dried and heated to a temperature from 250 degrees to
355 degrees Fahrenheit, depending upon the climatic conditions and the
bituminous cement used, it shall be immediately, before being cooled or exposed
to moisture, mixed in a box known as the "pug type" with the hot bituminous
cement, as hereinafter specified. If stone dust is used, such material shall be
introduced directly into the mixer without passing through the drier.
   (g)   The asphaltic cement used as the binding material shall be prepared
from refined oils having asphaltic base. The material shall be prepared with
asphaltic petroleum oils, to produce the required consistency. The asphalt
shall be homogeneous, free from water, and shall not foam when heated to 175
degrees Centigrade. Such asphalt shall meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Specific gravity 25ºC., not less than    1.01
      (2)   Flash point, not less than     175ºC.
      (3)   Softening point    40º - 55ºC.
      (4)   Penetration  25ºC. 100 gr. 5 sec.     80 - 90
      (5)   Loss at 163ºC. 5 hours    1% maximum
      (6)   Penetration residue, 25ºC. 100 gr. 5 sec. at least     55
      (7)   Total bitumen, at least     99.5
      (8)   Organic, insoluble    0.2 max.
   The contractor must certify in writing to the Building Commissioner or his
or her inspector, the character of the asphalt and the source of supply which
he or she contemplates using, prior to beginning the work.
   (h)   The mixture shall be spread by shoveling into place on the foundation
and leveling with heated metal rakes so that when compressed by a self-
propelled roller weighing at least five tons, it shall be two inches in
thickness with surface even and true to grade. Along the curb and around
manholes, meter boxes and other obstructions where the roller cannot reach, the
compression shall be obtained by hot iron tampers. As soon as the temperature
will permit, the mixture shall be rolled and the rolling continued lengthwise
and diagonally until all roller marks have disappeared and the surface gives
indication of no further compressibility. When a joint is necessary, the
material shall be trimmed to a rough feather edge, painted with asphaltic
cement, and the hot material then raked over the joint and thoroughly tamped
and rolled. The process of laying must be continuous throughout each day's
operation to avoid unnecessary joints or lack of cohesion between the different
batches delivered and installed.
   (i)   As soon as possible after the rolling of the mixture is finished and
while the surface is still warm and clean a coat of pure asphalt cement, heated
to a temperature of from 280 degrees to 320 degrees Fahrenheit shall be spread
over the surface and evenly distributed with rubber squeeges or roofing mops.
Only sufficient material shall be used to flush the surface voids without
leaving an excess. Immediately over this cement application a top dressing of
torpedo sand or fine gravel, free from dust, which must be thoroughly dried and
heated shall be spread and rolled into the surface. A small excess of gravel
may be left to be worn in or away by traffic.
1060.09  RESPONSIBILITY OF CONTRACTOR.
   (a)   In the construction of driveways and sidewalks the contractor shall
avoid injury to trees, hedges, fences, flagstones and all other construction
previously installed, and he or she shall employ such safeguards as may be
ordered by the Building Commissioner or his or her inspector. The contractor
shall also fill in the tree lawn at each side of the driveway with topsoil and
shall seed the same.
   (b)   No material shall be permitted on any street or sidewalk, nor shall
any mixing be permitted on any street or sidewalk. No hand mixing shall be
permitted on any kind of work on City property.
   (c)   It shall be a duty of the contractor, under the Building
Commissioner's direction, when repairing existing drives to notify all owners
that work on their drive will start at a given time. If for any good reason the
owner cannot have the work done on the day specified, it will be passed until
later, but only for a reasonable time.
1060.10  SIDEWALK PERMITS.
   (a)   Any person desiring to lay or re-lay any sandstone flagging or
concrete sidewalk, or to perform any other sidewalk work on public property in
the City, shall first apply to the Building Commissioner for a permit, which
shall be issued without cost.
   (b)   All replacements of curb or sidewalk shall be of the same material,
dimensions and quality as the original, except that the use of stone slabs less
than three feet in length is prohibited in original or replacement work. The
City may order any replacements removed which do not comply with such
requirements.
(1982 Code, § 911.10)  (Ord 47-50.  Passed 6-16-1947.)
1060.99  PENALTY.
   Whoever violates any provision of this chapter is guilty of a minor
misdemeanor for the first offense and shall be fined not more than one hundred
dollars ($100.00) for any subsequent offense, such person is guilty of a
misdemeanor of  the third degree and shall be fined not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00) or imprisoned not more than 60 days, or both, for each
offense. Each day's continued violation shall constitute a separate offense.

sketches as may be necessary to conform to the action of Council.
   (b)   (1)   Whenever any person and/or entity desires a resubdivision or a

1242.01  PURPOSES.
   (a)   There is hereby established a comprehensive zoning plan for the City,
which plan is set forth in the sections and maps that constitute this Zoning
Code. The plan is adopted for the protection and promotion of the public
health, safety, convenience, comfort, prosperity and the general welfare,
having in mind, among other things, the fact that the City is essentially a
residential community of relatively small total area, that it is not crossed by
any railroad or State or Federal highway, that it is a part of a large
metropolitan area which affords to the population of University Heights
opportunity for employment and for conveniently obtaining commercial and
industrial services, and that the City is important to this metropolitan area
as a residential community.
   (b)   The more particular purposes of this comprehensive zoning plan are to
guide the future development of the City in accordance with a comprehensive
plan for the most beneficial land use and population density; to promote the
social and economic stability of neighborhoods; to protect and conserve land
and building values; minimize conflicts in the uses of neighboring property and
bring about gradual conformity to the comprehensive plan; to reduce or avoid
the need for general traffic flow on local residential streets, especially
truck traffic; to insure adequate open space between buildings, especially for
residential occupancy; to provide a guide for public policy and action in the
economical provision of public facilities and services and for related public
needs, and a guide for private enterprise in building development, investment
and other economic activity relating to the uses of land and buildings.
   (c)   For the accomplishment of these purposes, the City is divided into
appropriate districts, and within each district land, buildings and structures
are regulated as to uses for trade, industry, residence and other purposes, as
to height, number of stories and size of buildings and structures, setback
building lines, area of yards and other open spaces, and proportion of lot that
may be occupied, and as to density of population.

1244.01  ESTABLISHMENT OF BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS.
   A Board of Zoning Appeals is hereby established as a separate administrative
board, which shall consist of five members, comprised of five electors of the
City appointed by the Mayor and approved by a majority of the members of
Council. The elector members shall not hold any other office or employment in
the City government. Current members shall serve their existing respective
terms. A new member of the Board of Zoning Appeals shall be appointed by the
Mayor promptly upon passage of this section to replace the Mayor as a member of
the Board and shall serve for a period of two years, commencing February 1,
2018. Thereafter, the terms of all elector members shall be for two years,
commencing February 1, in the respective years of their appointment. Vacancies
in such elector membership of the Board shall be filled for the remainder of
the unexpired term of the member whose place becomes vacant. The Board shall
choose from its members a chairperson, who shall serve for two years or until
his or her successor is chosen. The Clerk of Council of the City shall serve as
secretary of the Board of Zoning Appeals and shall keep such records and
journals as shall be required by rule of the Board or by ordinance. Council
shall select one of its members as of the effective date of this section and at
the organization meeting each two years to attend all meetings of the Board.
Such Councilperson shall have the right to participate in the discussions, but
shall not have a vote.
(Ord. 2017-52.  Passed 1-2-2018.)
1244.02  ORGANIZATION.
   (a)   The Board shall adopt rules and regulations for its own government and
for carrying out its duties under this Zoning Code.
   (b)   Regular meetings of the Board shall be held once a month and such
special meetings as necessary, upon call of the chairperson.
   (c)   All meetings of the Board shall be public and minutes of all meetings
shall be kept, showing the attendance of members and the vote or failure to
vote of each member on each matter of business. Such minutes shall be kept at
the office of the Board and shall be a public record.
   (d)   Attendance by members of the Board shall be in person. The presence of
three members shall constitute a quorum. The concurring vote of three members
shall be necessary to dispose of any matter before the Board.
(1982 Code, § 1105.02)  (Ord. 56-53.  Passed 10-1-1956.)
1244.03  POWERS AND DUTIES.
   The Board shall have the following powers and duties:
   (a)   Interpretation of Zoning Code Provisions. To decide any question
involving the interpretation of any provision of this Zoning Code, on appeal
from a decision of any administrative official, and further to decide matters
left in this Zoning Code to the opinion of the Board, such as what is a
suitable nonconforming use to replace a legal nonconforming use (Section
1276.02).
   (b)   Special Permits. To approve applications for special permits for any
uses for which this Zoning Code requires such permits and their approval by the
Board, subject to the following requirements and other applicable provisions of
this Zoning Code:
      (1)   The location, size and character of the proposed use is such that,
in general, it will be in harmony with the existing development of the district
in which the site is situated and will not hinder or discourage the appropriate
future development and use of land and buildings in the vicinity or impair
their value, and will not conflict with the aims and goals of the General City
Plan.
      (2)   If the proposed site is in a residence district, the proposed use
will not result in hazard to pedestrian traffic, especially to children; the
height, bulk and location of buildings and the nature, height and location of
walls and fences and the extent and character of the landscaping are such that
the development will be in harmony with residential community.
      (3)   If the location is in a business district, the size, nature and
intensity of operation, the layout of the site and its relation to its access
streets are such that vehicle traffic and pedestrian traffic will not be more
hazardous, taking into consideration turning movements, sight distances and
driveways across sidewalks; the proposed development will be in harmony with
the prevailing shopping habits, the physical and economic relationships of one
type of use to another, and the characteristic grouping of uses in business
districts; the proposed development will not be objectionable to nearby
dwellings in residence districts because of noise, fumes or flashing of lights
to a greater degree than is normal for uses in a business district. In acting
on any application for a special permit, the Board may impose any conditions
that it deems necessary to accomplish the reasonable application of the
foregoing standards and may deny such application, but only in accordance with
those standards. The City Planning Commission may adopt from time to time
additional standards for specific uses, to serve as additional guides for
approval of special permits.
(Ord. 56-53.  Passed 10-1-1956.)
   (c)   Uses Permitted Upon Special Permit.
      (1)   Special uses. The Board of Zoning Appeals may grant special permits
for any use not governed by Section
1274.01(b) provided such use otherwise fulfills the criteria set forth in
Chapter 1274 or may refer any such application to the Planning Commission
without additional charge therefor and the Board shall have specific authority
to issue special permits for public utility uses essential for service to needs
of the vicinity, but not including storage, manufacturing or repair shops or
yards either as main or accessory uses.
(Ord. 82-26.  Passed 7-6-1982; Ord. 91-26.  Passed 5-20-1991.)
      (2)   Temporary uses. On undeveloped land where neighborhood conditions
are suitable, and subject to the filing of bonds by the appellants to guarantee
compliance with the conditions of the permit, the Board may approve temporary
and conditional permits for not more than two-year periods for structures and
uses that do not conform to the regulations prescribed elsewhere in this Zoning
Code for the district in which they are located and such permits may be renewed
by the Board under the same procedure.
      (3)   Transitional uses. In any district within 150 feet of the boundary
of a less restricted district, the Board may approve any use which the Board
deems to be a suitable transitional use between the more restricted and the
less restricted district in question, provided, however, that there is no
existing occupancy between the site of the proposed use and the less restricted
district boundary line which will be seriously injured by the proposed
transitional use.
      (4)   Car parking lots. In any residence district, on land within one
hundred feet of a business district and not separated therefrom by a street or
alley, the Board may approve a car parking lot, provided that the Board first
finds that such use is necessary for the parking needs of the adjoining
business district and that such use will not create traffic hazards or be
seriously harmful to adjacent property values. Such parking lot shall comply
with all requirements of Section
1272.04, and the Board shall require such additional safeguards for the
protection of life and property of the surrounding area as the Board finds
necessary or desirable.
(1982 Code, § 1105.03)  (Ord.56-53.  Passed 10-1-1956.)
      (5)   Renewal of special use permits.
         A.   Special permits shall expire on the anniversary of issuance in
the absence of renewal thereof, in which event the penalties and provisions of
Section
1242.99 shall apply.
         B.   Upon application of the owner or occupant, all special use
permits shall be renewed annually, subject to the approval of the Board of
Zoning Appeals in conformity with the procedures in Section
1244.06, and the Board shall renew such special permit on the condition that
such use continues to conform to the conditions and the terms which gave rise
to the initial issuance and subsequent renewals of such special permit.
      (6)   Renewal fee. Fees shall be remitted with the application for
renewal of a special permit in accordance with the following fee schedule:
         A.   Residential use only: No charge.
         B.   Commercial or any other use to the extent authorized under a
special use permit shall require an inspection fee equal to fees otherwise
charged under Section
1496.07, provided, however, that such fee shall be waived or abated upon
payment of the fees required under
Chapter 1496 for the issuance of an annual certificate of occupancy.
(Ord. 86-4.  Passed 2-3-1986; Ord. 91-26.  Passed 5-20-1991.)
   (d)   Variances from Code Requirements. On appeal from a decision of the
Building Commissioner, to vary or adjust the strict application of the
requirements of this Zoning Code in the case of exceptionally irregular,
narrow, shallow or steep lots or other exceptional physical conditions, when
strict application would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship
that would deprive the owner of the reasonable use of the land or building
involved, but in no other case. In such instance, the Board shall designate
such conditions in connection therewith as will, in its opinion, protect as far
as reasonable the health, safety and values of adjoining and surrounding
property and preserve the general purposes of the City Plan.
(Ord. 56-53.  Passed 10-1-1956.)
   (e)   Appeals Specifically Referred. To review decisions and orders of the
Building Commissioner or other administrative official having authority to make

General Building Code, Fire Prevention Code, and similar ordinances, where
appeals from such decisions and orders are specifically authorized by the
applicable provisions of such Code or Ordinance.

   (a)   Creation, Purpose and Intent. The Architectural Review Board is hereby
created to review applications for new or replacement dwelling structures in
all residential zoned districts, and to review applications in all other zoning
districts when an increase in building square footage or a substantial exterior
change is proposed, to:
      (1)   Ensure that new development and redevelopment are compatible and
harmonious with the existing overall character of the City;
      (2)   Strengthen, enhance and improve the existing visual and aesthetic
character of the City; and
      (3)   Maintain a high design character of community development, and
ensure the compatibility of new development.
   (b)   Powers and Duties. The Architectural Review Board shall review plans
for new development and alterations to existing development in the following
respects:
      (1)   The design of the building - use of materials, finish grade lines,
dimensions, orientation, fenestration and proportions.
      (2)   The design of the building in conjunction with site features such
as landscaping, parking, and vehicular and pedestrian circulation for all
projects to be erected, moved, altered, remodeled or repaired; and
      (3)   The design and placement of business identification signs when
referred by the Building Commissioner.
   In undertaking this review, the Architectural Review Board may promulgate
design criteria to guide subsequent phases of development.
   (c)   Membership and Term.
      (1)   The Architectural Review Board shall consist of three registered
architects who shall be residents of the City of University Heights. If a
sufficient number of registered architects are not available, one member may be
from another related profession if the person has demonstrated an interest,
experience or knowledge in architecture, landscape architecture, urban design
or related disciplines. In the event the Building Commissioner is a registered
architect, he or she may serve as a voting member of the ARB, even if not a
resident of University Heights. The Building Commissioner shall be eligible to
participate in discussions whether he or she is a voting member or not.
      (2)   One other registered architect meeting the criteria of division (c)
(1) hereof shall be designated as an alternate to the ARB and shall review any
proposal where a member of the ARB has a conflict of interest.
      (3)   All members shall be appointed by the Mayor and approved by City
Council.
      (4)   The term of office shall be for three years, except in the case of
the first appointments, in which case the terms shall be staggered so that one

      (5)   If there is a vacancy for any reason, a newly appointed person
shall complete the unexpired term.
      (6)   All members of the Architectural Review Board shall be paid $50.00

for his or her attendance at these meetings, or for any other related time or
service to the ARB.
   (d)   Action by ARB. The Architectural Review Board shall meet as necessary.
Approval of an application submitted to the ARB shall require the affirmative
vote of not less than two members. In the event an application is not approved
by the ARB, the ARB shall clearly indicate to the applicant the reasons the
application was not approved. When proposals before the ARB are also subject to
Planning commission and/or Board of Zoning Appeals action, the ARB decision
shall serve as a recommendation. When action is taken on a proposal that is not
subject to the Board of Zoning Appeals or Planning Commission, the decision of
the ARB will be final. Any person aggrieved by a decision of the ARB may appeal
to the Board of Zoning Appeals within ten days of the decision.
   (e)   Interpretive Illustrations for Design Guidelines. The ARB may prepare
from time to time or authorize the preparation of illustrations which
demonstrate the development and design guidelines in Section
1262.12. Such illustrations may include drawings and/or photographs that depict
the guidelines. Any such illustrations shall be considered administrative
guidelines which assist in the utilization of the development and design
guidelines.
   (f)   Application.  Applicants shall complete a form as prescribed by the
Building Commissioner and approved by the Law Director. The application fee
shall be one hundred dollars ($100.00). Drawings, photographs or samples shall

subject to ARB action until approved by the ARB. Conditions of approval shall
become part of the permit documents.

CHAPTER 1251
Residential Attached District
1251.01   Definitions.
1251.02   Purpose.
1251.03   District establishment.
1251.04   Permitted uses in the RA District.
1251.05   Accessory uses in the RA District.
1251.06   Site planning and design.
1251.07   Area, yard, siting and design regulations.
1251.08   Diagrams and modifications.
1251.01  DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter, the following definitions shall apply:
   (a)   "Active uses" means those habitable spaces of a dwelling most often
used for living, eating, or cooking. These spaces encourage "eyes on the
street" and include such spaces as living rooms, offices, kitchens, or family
rooms. Non-habitable spaces, garages, hallways, corridors, bathrooms, closets,
storage, mechanical rooms, utility spaces, or similar are not considered active
uses.
   (b)   "Frontage build-out" means the portion of the principal and secondary
street frontage containing a building.
   (c)   "Interior frontage" means, for lots fronting an alley or without a
street line, the frontage of a residential attached unit where the principal
pedestrian entrance is located.
   (d)   "Principal pedestrian entrance" is the exterior door exclusive to the
dwelling unit that offers a pedestrian the most visible and direct means of
ingress and egress to a public right-of-way.
   (e)   "Principal street frontage" means the street line where the
residential attached unit's principal pedestrian entrance is located. Where a
residential attached unit has a lot line abutting a public space, that frontage
shall be regulated as a principal street frontage.
   (f)   "Residential attached building" is a building composed of two or more
residential attached units.
   (g)   "Residential attached unit" is a single-family dwelling on its own
lot, served by its own exclusive exterior pedestrian entrance, and attached to
one or more other such units by fire walls or fire separation walls.
   (h)   "Secondary street frontage" means, with respect to corner lots, all
street lines that are not the principal street frontage; also known as the
"side street frontage."
(Ord. 2019-19.  Passed 6-17-2019.)
1251.02  PURPOSE.
   Residential Attached Districts (RA) are established to set the requirements
for the form, site plan and building features of residential attached
developments. Safe sidewalks, inviting streets and compelling urban form are
essential elements of vibrant, walkable urban neighborhoods. The inherent
density of residential attached units is a key component of this vision, but
without thoughtful site planning and design, this goal will not be fully
realized. The provisions of this section are intended to make these elements
the standards for RA development in University Heights.
(Ord. 2019-19.  Passed 6-17-2019.)
1251.03  DISTRICT ESTABLISHMENT.
   The RA District is hereby established, and shall conform to the standards
and regulations hereafter set forth in this chapter.
(Ord. 2019-19.  Passed 6-17-2019.)
1251.04  PERMITTED USES IN THE RA DISTRICT.
   The following uses are principle uses permitted in the RA District provided
that all requirements of other City ordinances and this Code have been met:
   (a)   Residential attached units/buildings.
(Ord. 2019-19.  Passed 6-17-2019.)
1251.05  ACCESSORY USES IN THE RA DISTRICT.
   The following accessory uses are permitted in association with the
"permitted uses" listed above, subject to review and recommendation by the
Planning Commission and approval of City Council:
   (a)   Private garage and related parking areas;
   (b)   Circulation drives;
   (c)   Outdoor community areas;
   (d)   Trash receptacles;
   (e)   Porches, decks, patios, and rooftop terraces;
   (f)   Freestanding air conditioning machinery, aboveground components of
geothermal energy systems, emergency generators, and other similar equipment.
(Ord. 2019-19.  Passed 6-17-2019.)
1251.06  SITE PLANNING AND DESIGN.
   No building permit shall be issued for the original construction of a
residential attached unit or residential attached building without review and
recommendation of the Planning Commission and approval by City Council, which
shall seek to ensure that the development meets the spirit and intent of
Section
1251.02 by applying the standards set forth below:
   (a)   Compatibility. The development shall be visually compatible with
nearby properties with respect to such design elements as scale, height,
setbacks, orientation to existing streets, roof lines, architectural character,
materials, colors, and proportions of architectural features.
   (b)   Site Layout. Buildings, structures and landscape features shall be
arranged so as to create visual interest, promote security and personal safety,
promote safe, efficient, and comfortable pedestrian circulation, facilitate
safe and efficient vehicular circulation, conserve natural features and provide
usable common and private open space.
   (c)   Building Features. Residential attached units shall contribute to the
character of the neighborhood by drawing from the best examples of architecture
and urbanism. Residential attached units shall be designed to create active,
attractive, street frontages that promote safety and walkability using the
essential elements of traditional urban architecture.
   (d)   Circulation and Parking. Circulation and parking shall be designed to
achieve the following:
      (1)   Provide proper access for service and safety vehicles;
      (2)   Minimize conflicts between pedestrians and vehicles;
      (3)   Minimize the number of curb cuts;
      (4)   Prohibit placement of garage doors so close to sidewalks as to
impair pedestrian safety.

business and residential districts) wherein open land developments such as
parking areas and driveways would be more appropriate than building
developments;
      (2)   To provide areas for expansion of off-street parking where
presently needed, and to control the location of accessways to such parking
areas;
      (3)   To protect adjacent residential neighborhoods from traffic
congestion by setting limits, based on need, for future expansion of such
parking facilities, and by establishing protective features along lines so
defined;
      (4)   To promote the most desirable use of land in accordance with a
well-considered plan, and to stabilize and enhance property values.
   (b)   In an Automobile Parking District, land shall be used and maintained
only in accordance with the following regulations.

1272.06  OCCUPANCY OF SPECIAL CHARACTER.
   In case a proposed occupancy is of such special character that it does not
require the amount of parking space or loading space herein specified, and such
lesser or reduced need is clearly demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Board
of Zoning Appeals, the Board may approve a lesser number of parking or loading
spaces, but in so doing the Board shall take into full consideration the
probabilities of future changes in occupancy and the parking and loading needs
thereof, and how such needs will be met.

1274.01  INTENT AND PERMITTED USES.
   (a)   This chapter is established in order to permit, under special
circumstances and conditions, uses which foster the most desirable use of the
land in the City; which insure compatibility and stability with existing and
proposed adjacent uses; and which harmonize and integrate into the existing
zoning and use plans those special uses authorized under special permit
recommended by the Planning Commission as approved by Council in the U-1, U-
2 and U-4 residential districts.
   (b)   The following are hereby declared to be special uses to which this
chapter shall apply:
      (1)   Houses of worship or religious education, including churches,
temples, synagogues, religious organizations, parish houses and parochial
schools;
      (2)   Facilities for the physical, behavioral or mental health care and/
or education of children through the twelfth grade level only, including

user;
         B.   Accessible only from either Fairmount Boulevard or Belvoir Road.
      (7)   Any other use not otherwise specified or authorized in this
Planning and Zoning Code, to the extent that the requirements hereinafter set
forth can reasonably be effectuated.
   (c)   This chapter shall not apply to dwelling units used for child care or
as foster homes which are otherwise approved by the Board of Zoning Appeals in
compliance with Section
1478.01.
(Ord. 99-45.  Passed 12-20-1999.)
   (d)   A Special Use Permit for any use described in this section shall be
applied for and shall be issued on the recommendation of the Planning
Commission, subject to any reasonable conditions the Planning Commission may
impose uniformly in similar circumstances, for any permitted location, after
the applicant demonstrates to the Planning Commission by clear and convincing
evidence that the provisions of this chapter will be met and that the special
use will not impair surrounding property values or uses, vehicular parking and
pedestrian or traffic conditions, lighting glare at night, noise pollution to
others or other applicable criteria in the Planning and Zoning Code, and will
not be otherwise contrary to the public health, safety and welfare.
      (1)   The Planning Commission may hold public hearings on any such
application to the extent it deems reasonable, but not more than ninety days
after the filing of the application and after compliance with all submissions
or revisions thereof required under Section
1274.04.
      (2)   The recommendation of the Planning Commission shall be subject to
the approval of a majority of Council. A denial by the Planning Commission may
be appealed to Council by applicant's filing a written appeal within 15 days of
such denial. The appeal shall be heard by Council within 45 days of the filing
thereof.
      (3)   Upon approval by Council, a certificate of occupancy should be
issued.
(Ord. 82-26.  Passed 7-6-1982.)
   (e)   Group Homes.
      (1)   Definition of "group home".
         A.   A "group home" means a residence which is occupied by and
provides residential services to unrelated individuals who do not otherwise
qualify as a family and who have physical handicaps and/or moderate mental and/
or social limitations and who live or propose to live together and function in
the manner of a family, while monitored by State licensed professional
caregivers.
         B.   "Group home" does not include cooperative residences for any
other individuals or entities, or fraternities, sororities, social or business
lodges, or any other combination of voluntary living arrangements.
         C.   "Group home" does not include any court ordered rehabilitation or
maintenance living arrangements and/or care and/or treatment and/or
rehabilitation services for severely mentally retarded or psychotic
individuals, releasees from federal, state or county treatment or penal
institutions, juvenile offenders, drug or alcohol offenders or wards of the
court or welfare system.
      (2)   Criteria for group homes. In the event that the premises are
occupied or proposed to be occupied by persons otherwise excluded by definition
or if refusal to allow the proposed occupancy conflicts with State and Federal
law, not otherwise superseded by the University Heights Charter and ordinances
under Article XVIII Section 3 of the Ohio Constitution, then the issue of
occupancy shall further be determined only upon appeal to the Board of Zoning
Appeals which may grant a non-transferable special or conditional use permit,
if the applicant qualifies the use as a "group home", and if the following
conditions also apply:
         A.   Such site previously shall have been zoned or permitted for use
and occupancy or legally occupied by two or more families and the number of
occupants would otherwise be permitted upon the application of all other
ordinances dealing with "occupancy," (e.g.,
1478.03).
         B.   No change in the exterior appearance of the premises shall occur.
There will be no additional garage space.
         C.   Traffic or traffic congestion is not likely to increase or be
adversely affected, and
            1.   No parking in addition to the parking (
1240.20(a),
1280.03) for which the premises were designed will be available for residents
and/or staff.
            2.   No trucks will be parked outside of the premises as governed
by Section
452.18.
         D.   If the persons occupying the premises require care and attention,
there will be at least one person identified to the City on site as a caregiver
twenty-four hours, seven days a week. Such caregiver will be included in
calculating the occupancy of the premises, if there are sleeping facilities
needed or provided on the site for such caregiver.
         E.   Excluding students at John Carroll University and residents on
the Bellefaire campus, otherwise as governed by these ordinances, the total
number of units, and the housing and the total number of occupants housed and
residing in the City in space for six or more residents per housing unit
regulated by the Ohio Building Code, shall be limited to ten housing units and
60 residents, in the absence of credible evidence demonstrating a lack of
additional equivalent space legally available for the same use in each and all
abutting and contiguous municipalities.
         F.   Residences owned or occupied or operated as a group home or as a
permitted facility described in Section
1274.01(b)(2)(3)(4) or (6) shall not be permitted on any part of a lot located
within a radius of 2000 feet from any part of any lot occupied by any other
such facility.
         G.   The Board may also take into consideration walking distance to
public transportation and that such distance is reasonably likely to cause a
safety risk to aged (over seventy years), handicapped or disabled residents.
         H.   Applicant must represent that the granting of a special permit
herein is not likely to place any citizen in physical danger or jeopardy
allowing the proposed occupancy, e.g. felons on parole or release programs, who
have been convicted of violent crimes such as murder, assault, rape,
intimidation and/or hard drug addiction; or profoundly or severely mentally
retarded or known psychotic individuals who cannot function an society without
being a risk to themselves or others, or any similar demonstrable likely
danger.

whole or in part to any other portion of the lot or parcel of land occupied by
such nonconforming use at the time of the adoption (October 1, 1956) of this
Zoning Code. Further, if any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any
reason for any continuous period of more than 30 days, any subsequent use of
such land shall be in conformity to the regulations specified by this Zoning

(1982 Code, § 1125.06)  (Ord. 56-53.  Passed 10-1-1956.)
1280.07  PLANNED MULTI-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL AREAS.
   Provision is hereby made for planned residential areas as hereinafter
regulated. The regulations applying to Planned Multi-Family Residential Areas
are intended to permit flexibility in land area design, within the general
pattern of land use and population density of such districts, for the purpose
of bringing about an arrangement of buildings and open spaces that will
contribute to the desirability of living environments of the dwellings included
in such planned development with respect to daylight, sunlight, air privacy and
general amenity.
   (a)   Area Usage. Planned multi-family residential development shall occur
in accordance with a site plan approved by the Planning Commission after public
hearing, and subject to the following conditions:
      (1)   Any part of such parcel that is separated from the remainder by
public streets shall be deemed a separate lot.
      (2)   Dwellings shall be multi-family dwellings of any type, excluding
Senior Housing and Care Facilities.
      (3)   The area proposed for development shall be in one ownership or, if
in multiple ownership, the application shall be filed jointly by all the owners
of the properties included in the Planned Multi-Family Residential Area.
      (4)   The following areas are eligible for consideration for planned
multi-family residential development:
         A.   Any parcel of land having an area not less than two acres located
either in one-family or two-family residential districts which are adjacent to
a U-4, U-6, U-7, U-8 or U-9 District, or within a U-7 District.
         B.   A lot or area of less than two acres which is adjacent to and
adjoining an existing multi-family project under the same ownership may be used
for planned multi-family residential development.
   (b)   Number of Dwelling Units. The maximum number of dwelling units on each
lot in the development shall be determined by computing each type of dwelling
unit as follows:
      (1)   Multi-family dwellings at 1,000 square feet per dwelling unit.
Where the Planning Commission finds that because of the density and type of
dwelling units provided in adjacent buildings, or because of adjoining land use
relationships, or because of extraordinary transportation facilities serving
the area, unique conditions apply to the specific site, the Commission may
permit a greater number of dwelling units per acre of land, but in no such
location shall the maximum floor area ratio of building to land be more than a
one to one ratio.
      (2)   Minimum livability space for such site shall not be less than 50%
of the project area and maximum percentage of building coverage of the land
shall not exceed 35% of the project area. "Livability space" is the area of the
project site excluding the area of buildings, parking, maneuvering, driveways
and other areas devoted to vehicular circulation.
(Ord. 99-45 .  Passed 12-20-1999.)
   (c)   Criteria for Site Planning. A building or buildings proposed to be
developed for any use permitted in such district shall be arranged so as to
take advantage of any unique conditions of the site, so as to be coordinated
with adjoining building, parking and other site developments and the buildings
and facilities within the development area shall be related to each other so as
to best serve their respective functions. To accomplish such purposes and
objectives, the following criteria are to be applied:
      (1)   The minimum distance between any multi-family buildings, or parts
thereof, in a planned residential development area shall vary and be related to
the length and height of the buildings and other applicable provisions of this
Zoning Code. Such minimum distance shall be determined by the formula:
         Minimum Distance = L1 + L2 + 2(H 1 + H 2)
                                                 
                     5
         the elements of such formula being defined as follows:
   "Minimum distance" means the required minimum horizontal distance between
any wall of building (1) and the nearest wall of building (2) or the vertical
prolongation of either.
   "L1" means the length of building (1)  which for the purposes of the
formula, is defined as the length of the portion or portions of any wall or
walls of building (1) from which lines drawn perpendicular to the face of such
wall or walls will intersect any wall of building (2).
   "L2" means the length of building (2) which, for the purposes of the
formula, is defined as the length of the portion or portions of any wall or
walls of building (2) from which lines drawn perpendicular to the face of such
wall or walls will intersect any wall of building (1).
         "H1 " means the height of wall of building (1) as defined.
         "H2" means the height of wall of building (2) as defined.
   "Maximum length" any town house building shall not exceed six attached
dwelling house units in length.
      (2)   The minimum distance between any multi-family building and side or
rear lot line in a development shall vary and be related to the length and
height of the building. Such minimum distance shall be determined by the
formula:
   Minimum Distance = L + PL + 2(H)
                               
               5
         the elements of such formula being defined as follows:
   "Minimum distance" means the required minimum horizontal distance between
any wall of a building and the nearest area side or rear lot line of the
development area.
   "L" means the length of building (1) which, for the purposes of the formula
is the length of that portion or portions of any wall or walls of such building
from which lines drawn perpendicular to such wall will intersect a side or rear
lot line of the development area.
   "PL" means the length of the side or rear lot line which will be intersected
by lines drawn perpendicular from the face or faces of any wall or walls of
building (1).
   "H" means the height of wall of building as defined.
      (3)   The minimum distance, corner to corner building relationship, where
lines drawn perpendicular to a building do not intersect the adjacent building,
shall be determined by the formula:
         Minimum Distance = 2(H1 + H2)
                                 
                  5
   However, in no arrangement shall the distance between the corners of any two
buildings be less than 20 feet.
      (4)   Illustrations or visual interpretation to illustrate and clarify
the above formulas may be approved and appended to this Zoning Code from time
to time.
      (5)   Front yards.
   A.   Public street. The front yard for any building in a development
fronting on a public street shall not be less than the setback building line
established for it or as may be shown on the Building Zone Map. If no line is
established, the setback shall be not less than 40 feet.
   B.   Private street. The front yard setback for any building in a
development fronting on a private street shall be determined in accordance with
the formula set forth in division (c)(2) hereof; the nearest edge of the
pavement of such street shall be substituted for the property line in the
formula.
         C.   Private dwellings may be planned and developed at a lesser
distance from any main building entrance or from any garage entrance, than set
forth in the above for private streets if approved under the Development Plan
procedure.
      (6)   A.   Distances from main buildings to accessory buildings or uses
are set forth herein as desirable criteria to be applied in the site planning:
 
Schedule of Accessory Uses
                                             Minimum Distance
                                             From Main        From Side or Rear

public)
Recreation Areas (used for active play)      40               15
 
         B.   Retail Stores. Where planned residential area is located in, or
contiguous to a local retail or shopping center area the City Planning
Commission may permit retail stores in the development servicing the residents,
subject to approval of Council.
         C.   Location of Garages.
            1.   A private garage shall not be placed in any front yard of any
multi-family building; it may, however, be enclosed within the main building.
            2.   A community garage shall not be located in the front of any
multi-family building or opposite the wall of a multi-family building which
contains the main entrance or entrances of any such building. Such garages may
be located not less than 30 feet from any other wall of a multi-family building
unless approved otherwise on the Development Plan.
            3.   Any garage shall be located not less than ten feet from a
property line, provided, however, a wall of a garage may be located on a
property line if it is constructed of masonry, does not contain any openings
and does not have a projecting cornice, and provided further that it does not
exceed five feet in height above the average finished grade of the adjoining
property.
         D.   Parking Requirements. Each dwelling unit in a multi-family unit
shall provide one and one-half parking spaces for each dwelling unit of which
at least one parking space shall be located in a private or community garage
and one-half space may be located in an open parking area, except when
providing for golden age occupancy and/or public transportation is provided
within 500 feet of proposed building, the City Planning Commission may reduce
the parking requirements.
      (7)   The height of buildings shall be based on lot size as follows:
         Four acres or larger    100 feet in height (9-10 stories)
         Three to four acres    70 feet in height
         Two to three acres    50 feet in height
         Two acres    40 feet in height
(Ord. 71-39.  Passed 6-21-1971.)
   (d)   Development Plans. All development proposed under the planned
residential area regulations shall comply with the following provisions:
      (1)   Preliminary plan of developer A developer, before applying for a
building permit, shall submit to the Planning Commission a preliminary plan for
any land to be developed under the regulations of this section by filing five
copies thereof with the Clerk. The preliminary plan of the development shall
indicate all uses proposed for the development and shall include:
         A.   A plat and topography map of the proposed development area at a
scale of not less than twenty feet to the inch, including property lines,
easements, street rights of way, topographic contours, existing structures and
landscape features, and
         B.   Preliminary plans of the proposed development, drawn at a scale
of not less than twenty feet to the inch, designed in accordance with the
planning standards, regulations and criteria established herein and any
applicable plans that may have been adopted by the City which apply to the
subject site. The preliminary plan shall include, but shall not be limited to:
            1.   Site plan, showing the proposed location of all structures
identified by type, size, height and use; the assignment of all lands
subdivided; the location of all structures within 50 feet on properties
adjoining the proposed development;
            2.   Circulation plan; vehicular and pedestrian on-site circulation
pattern including the location and dimensions of proposed driveways and
walkways; the locations and arrangement of parking spaces and service

The preliminary plans, unless otherwise specified, shall be prepared by
professional persons qualified in the planning of land development, traffic
circulation, and building and landscape design.
      (2)   Referral for review and reports. Upon receipt of a preliminary plan
of development, the Secretary of the Planning Commission shall transmit, within
three days, one copy to the Mayor and to the chairperson of the Planning
Commission. He or she shall also submit for review and report a copy of the
preliminary plan to the Building Commissioner and to any professional
consultants retained by the City.
      (3)   Report to Council. Within 30 days after the preliminary plan has
been filed with the Secretary, the Commission shall evaluate the plan and shall
furnish to Council its report and recommendations with respect thereto. In
reviewing the preliminary development plan, the Commission shall determine
either that the preliminary plan fulfills the requirements of the established
regulations, standards and criteria which are applicable to the proposal and
any improvement plans recommended or duly approved by the City, or that the
plan does not fulfill all requirements, and thereafter it shall make a
recommendation that the preliminary plan be approved, disapproved or modified.
In any such evaluation, the Commission may find that certain established
regulations, standards or criteria of this Zoning Code are inappropriate or
inapplicable because of unusual conditions of the development area, and/or that
they have been satisfactorily fulfilled because of the imaginative quality of
the design or because of the relationship of the proposed development to the
surrounding areas.
      A copy of the preliminary plan, together with copies of the report of the
Commission, shall be filed with the Clerk of Council for submission to Council.
      (4)   Action by Council. Council within one month after receipt of such a
report by the Commission, shall either approve, disapprove or modify the
preliminary plan. Council may affirm or disapprove any report of the Commission
required by this section in the same manner as for recommendations of the
Commission. The preliminary plan and report of the Commission thereon shall be
on file in the office of the Clerk during such one-month period.
      (5)   Authority to proceed. Following approval by Council, the Clerk
shall notify the developer of such action, by registered or certified mail, and
authorize him or her to proceed with the preparation of final plans of the area
of development in accordance with the procedures and criteria set forth in this
Zoning Code and any special conditions under which this authorization to
proceed was granted.
      (6)   Final plan of development. The developer of any parcel or parcels
of land for which a preliminary plan has been approved by Council may prepare
and submit a final plan of the proposed development. Any such plan shall be
filed with the Building Commissioner, and upon payment of the appropriate fees,
shall be submitted by him or her to the Clerk of Council to be presented to
Council for final decision. The final plan of the development shall be a
detailed expansion of the preliminary plan heretofore approved by Council,
shall comply with all of the conditions which may have been imposed in the
approval of such preliminary plan, and be in accordance with the design
criteria and provisions of this Zoning Code which apply particularly to such
plan of development, and contain or be accompanied by the plans, elevations,
details and specifications for construction for the elements required for the
preliminary plan as set forth in division (d)(1) hereof. It shall also be
accompanied by:
         A.   Final form of any covenants running with the land, deed
restrictions or easements to be recorded and covenants, if any, for
maintenance;
         B.   Estimated project cost for all public and private improvements;
construction schedule;
         C.   Council may require additional drawings to supplement the above
where more information is needed or special conditions occur; and
         D.   When the final plan of development provides for partial
development of the total area for which a preliminary plan has been approved, a
final plan of development of the remainder of the area may be required to
permit evaluation of the development of the entire parcel before development in
progressive stages may be approved.
      (7)   Conditions for approval. If Council, after public hearings, finds
that a proposed final plan of development is in accordance with all the
requirements and incorporates all the conditions of approval of the preliminary
plan, Council shall approve such final plan of development.
      (8)   Building permits. If and when any proposed final plan of
development has been approved, the Building Commissioner shall be so notified
and he or she shall then issue the necessary building and other permits if it
is found to comply with the Building Code and upon payment of the required
fees.

   (a)   Findings, Purpose and Intent. By adopting this section, the City of
University Heights acknowledges the overall general increase of rental
properties and because the U-1 and U-2 Districts have special features,
characteristics, needs, issues, concerns and problems that are not prevalent in
other zoning districts. These concerns include the safety and the tranquility
of the residential neighborhood, both of which may be impaired by, among other
things, the significant increase in parking of vehicles at one- and two-family
dwellings. It is with these concerns in mind that the City now adopts this
section in an effort to help ensure safe living conditions and adequate parking
areas, as well as to avoid overcrowding in the U-1 and U-2 zoning districts.
   (b)   Permit Required.
      (1)   No owner, renter, tenant or regular occupant of any single-family
or two-family dwelling in the U-1 and U-2 zoning districts shall rent, lease or

1240.10 and/or
1472.14 (or related by blood, marriage or adoption) or can be occupied by not
more than three unrelated persons. "Regular occupancy" means the physical
presence of a person in the dwelling unit overnight for at least 15 nights in a
consecutive 30-day period.
      (3)   Any one- or two-family dwelling including those with a rentable
third floor shall be required to obtain a rental permit.

number of sleeping rooms to accommodate the proposed number of tenants, renters
or regular occupants, including the requirements under this Zoning Code and the
Building Code that are applicable.
         B.   That one off-street parking space per tenant shall be provided.
         C.   That the dwelling unit shall not contain culinary facilities
outside of the kitchen. (See Section

the owner/landlord has no delinquent property taxes or is enrolled in a payment
plan for delinquent taxes for the property listed on the rental application.
   (d)   Rental Permit Duration.  A rental permit shall be valid for the
property, for up to the number of occupants authorized in the permit for a two
year period from the date of inspection. Should the property ownership change,
the rental permit is non-transferable and a new application must be applied for
and all requirements must be met by the new owner(s). The owner or occupant is
required to notify the City Building Department whenever there is any change in
tenants, renters or regular occupants, however, such a change(s) will not
invalidate the rental permit, so long as the number of tenants, renters, or
regular occupants permitted on the leased premises does not exceed the maximum
tenancy allowed for the property.
   (e)   Appeal and Special Application for More than Three Unrelated Persons
as Tenants.
      (1)   An owner of a single-family or two-family dwelling may make a
written application to the Board of Zoning Appeals to allow occupancy of more
than three unrelated persons in a dwelling unit. In reviewing such an
application, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall consider the criteria contained
in division (c) of this section. However, no provision of this section shall be
applied in circumstances where the application of such provision would violate
the fair housing rights of the disabled as defined by applicable Federal, State
or local law.
      (2)   An applicant who has been denied a rental permit by a decision of
the Board of Zoning Appeals may seek further administrative appeal to the
Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas.
   (f)   Application Fee.  The fee charged for a rental permit shall be three
hundred dollars ($300.00) for a single-family dwelling. The fee charged for a
rental permit shall be four hundred dollars ($400.00) for both units of a two-
family dwelling. The fee charged for one-half of a two family dwelling shall be
three hundred dollars ($300.00). The fee charged for a rental permit shall be
one hundred dollars ($100.00) for a rentable third floor unit. Fees shall be
paid at the time the application for a rental permit is filed with the City and
for any renewal thereof. For every month, or portion thereof, an additional fee
of two hundred dollars ($200.00) shall be assessed to the owner(s), should the
owner(s) fail to comply with this section.
   (g)   Revocation of Rental Permit; Notice to Show Cause. In addition to any
other remedy or penalty otherwise provided in these Codified Ordinances, should
the Building Commissioner have information or other reasonable cause to find
that the holder of any rental permit or his or her tenants has been cited for
failure to be in compliance in any respect with the conditions contained in
this chapter or in Chapters
648  or
1442  on three different occasions within the duration of the rental permit,
the Building Commissioner shall issue, upon the holder thereof by residence
service, a notice to show cause to the Building Commissioner within five
calendar days thereafter why said permit should not be revoked because of
chronic violations. The Building Commissioner may revoke said rental permit
forthwith. Said permit holder may appeal said revocation to the Board of Zoning
Appeals as otherwise provided in these Codified Ordinances. The form of said
notice to show cause shall be on a form prepared by the Building Commissioner
and approved as to form by the Law Department. In determining if a rental
permit should be revoked, the Building Commissioner may consider the following:
      (1)   Submission of inaccurate or misleading information to the Building
Department to secure a rental permit.
      (2)   Failure to notify the Building Department within 30 days of any
change of information supplied in the application for the rental permit.
      (3)   Failure to correct violations discovered during inspection within
the time specified in a Notice of Violation or three violations of Chapter
1442 during the duration of the rental permit.
      (4)   Three violations of Section
648.17 during the duration of the rental permit.
      (5)   Chronic parking violations on or about the premises, including
overnight parking on public street, blocking the public sidewalk and driving or
parking on landscaped areas.
      (6)   Repeated complaints from adjacent residents that conditions exist
which are detrimental to the peace and quality of the neighborhood. The
Building Commissioner or Mayor/Safety Director shall use only such complaints
that have been investigated and verified to be valid and based on fact.
      (7)   Evidence supplied by the permit holder that the nuisance property
is being rented to tenants not involved in prior violations of Section
648.17.
      (8)   County tax rolls that demonstrate the owner/landlord is delinquent
in the payment of property taxes or failed to complete a payment plan for
delinquent taxes.
   (h)   Penalty. Whoever violates any provision of this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the first degree and shall be fined not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000) or imprisoned not more than six months, or both, for each
offense. A separate offense shall be deemed committed each day during or on
which a violation occurs or continues.

      (10)   Does not involve or require loading, unloading, receiving,
delivery, transport and/or shipping of products, merchandise or equipment. It
shall be a defense to the foregoing that a dwelling unit, within which an
otherwise lawful home occupation is conducted as provided in division (a)
hereof, may receive occasional deliveries of materials, supplies and/or office
equipment during normal business hours, defined as 8:00 a. m. to 5:00 p.m.,

that a home occupation does not conform to division (a) hereof, the owner may
appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals, as in all other appeals, together with a
registration statement in a form approved by the Director of Law.
      (1)   Zoning Board guidelines. In determining whether or not a use within
a zoned residential district should be permitted as a "home occupation", the
applicant shall first provide all information necessary or relevant for such
determination to be made with respect to the manner of conducting and the
effect which the proposed use as a "home occupation" may have upon the use for
residential or dwelling purposes on the premises and within the vicinity of the
premises. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall further consider any objections or
evidence presented by neighboring residential users.
      (2)   Board of Zoning Appeals authority on appeal. On appeal of the
owner, the Board of Zoning Appeals may issue a special permit renewable
annually for any use sought or undertaken which is not in conformity with
Sections
1240.15 and
1280.12, only after considering Chapters
1240 and
1250 and other applicable ordinances, as well as the recommendations of the
Chief of Police, Chief of Fire, Building Commissioner and Mayor, to determine
whether or not the proposed "home occupation" clearly detracts from or has a
negative impact upon the residential character of the district or creates a
safety or security risk within the immediate vicinity or inhibits or impairs
the capacity of the City to otherwise regulate professional or business
conduct.

in terms of performance objectives, so as to make adequate performance for the
use intended the test of acceptability.
   (c)   Permit to the fullest extent feasible, the use of materials and
technical methods, devices and improvements, including the use of
industrialized units which tend to reduce the cost of construction and erection
without affecting minimum requirements for the health, safety and security of

preferential treatment of types or classes of materials or products or methods
of construction.
   (d)   Encourage, so far as may be practicable, the standardization of
construction practices, methods, equipment, material and techniques, including

      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;

      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of reducing flood loss.  In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities,
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to which these regulations apply.  These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of
University Heights as identified in Section
1450.01(f), including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by
City of University Heights.
   (f)   Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard. For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:

establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City of University Heights as required by Section
1450.04(c) Subdivisions and Large Scale Developments.
      Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps
and/or studies are on file at the City Hall at 2300 Warrensville Center Road,
University Heights, Ohio.
   (g)   Abrogation and greater restrictions. These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including subdivision regulations,
zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations shall not impair any deed restriction covenant or easement but the
land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the regulations.

regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the City of University Heights, any officer or employee thereof, or the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from
reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.
   (j)   Severability. Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.

      (2)   Zones Al-30 and Zone AE. Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO. Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)   Zone AH. Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      (5)   Zone A99. Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded). Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with
contributing drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded). Areas determined to be outside the
500-year floodplain.
   (o)   “Flood Insurance Study (FIS).”  The official report in which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   “Flood Protection Elevation.”  The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE,
is the base flood elevation. In areas where no base flood elevations exist from
any authoritative source, the flood protection elevation can be historical
flood elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the
Floodplain Administrator.
   (q)   “Floodway.”  A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base
flood discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.  The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and
is usually characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity
flood waters, high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to
high erosion forces.
   (r)   “Freeboard.”  A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a
flood level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway
conditions, such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice
jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   “Historic structure.”  Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio’s inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   “Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis.”  An analysis
performed by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in
accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to
determine flood elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   “Letter of Map Change (LOMC).”  A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective flood insurance
rate maps, flood boundary and floodway maps, and flood insurance studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA).  A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective flood insurance rate map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR). A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR).  A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary and
floodway maps, or flood insurance studies.
   (v)   “Lowest floor.”  The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an “enclosure
below the lowest floor” which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area
other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance
with the applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for
enclosures below the lowest floor.
   (w)   “Manufactured home.”  A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term “manufactured home” does not include a “recreational vehicle.” For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Ohio R.C. Chapter 3733.
   (x)   “Manufactured home park.”  As specified in the Ohio Administrative
Code 3701-27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which
three or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free
of charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building,
structure, vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the
facilities of the park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual
lots are not for rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of
installation of manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home
park, even though three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the
roadways are dedicated to the local government authority.
   (y)   “National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).”  The NFIP is a federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the federal government that states if a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   “New construction.”  Structures for which the “start of construction”
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of University
Heights Flood Insurance Rate Map, December 3, 2010, and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
   (aa)   “Person.”  Includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and
local governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in Ohio R.C.
111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not limited
to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council,
institution, state college or university, community college district, technical
college district, or state community college. “Agency” does not include the
general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general’s department, or
any court.
   (bb)   “Recreational vehicle.”  A vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a
light duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent
dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or
seasonal use.
   (cc)   “Registered professional architect.”  A person registered to engage
in the practice of architecture under the provisions of Ohio R.C. 4703.01 to
4703.19.
   (dd)   “Registered professional engineer.”  A person registered as a
professional engineer under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4733.
   (ee)   “Registered professional surveyor.”  A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4733.
   (ff)   “Special flood hazard area.”  Also known as “areas of special flood
hazard,” it is the land in the floodplain subject to a 1% or greater chance of
flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency on flood insurance rate maps, flood
insurance studies, flood boundary and floodway maps and flood hazard boundary
maps as zones A, AE, AH, AO, Al -30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal
state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   “Start of construction.”  The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (hh)   “Structure.”  A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas
or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (ii)   “Substantial damage.”  Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred.
   (jj)   “Substantial improvement.”  Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure before the “start of
construction” of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have
incurred “substantial damage”, regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered “new
construction”; or
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a “historic structure,” provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
“historic structure.”
   (kk)   “Variance.”  A grant of relief from the standards of these
regulations consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   “Violation.”  The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations.
(Ord. 2010-63.  Passed 11-1-2010.)

      (5)   Development activities undertaken by a federal agency and which are
subject to Federal Executive Order 11988 - Floodplain Management.
      Any proposed action exempt from filing for a floodplain development
permit is also exempt from the standards of these regulations.
   (j)      Map maintenance activities.  To meet National Flood Insurance
Program minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA,
and to ensure that City of University Heights flood maps, studies and other
data identified in Section
1450.01(f) accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to submit new technical data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section
1450.04(c).
         B.   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with Section
1450.03(j)(1), prepared in a format required for a conditional letter of map
revision or letter of map revision, and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and
processing fees for these map revisions shall be the responsibility of the
applicant.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a conditional letter
of map revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations
but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a letter of map
revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to Section
1450.03(j)(1)A.
      (2)   Right to submit new technical data. The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of City of
University Heights, and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the City
of University Heights have been modified by annexation or the community has
assumed authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the City
of University Heights Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the City of
University Heights boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map
of the City of University Heights suitable for reproduction, clearly showing
the new corporate limits or the new area for which the City of University
Heights has assumed or relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (k)   Data use and flood map interpretation. The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When preliminary flood insurance rate maps and/or flood insurance
study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a letter of final determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a letter of final determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and /or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1450.05, Appeals and Variances.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial damage determinations.
      (1)   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including
flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc. After such a damage event, the
Floodplain Administrator shall:
         A.   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
         B.   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
         C.   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
      (2)   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
federal, state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
increased cost of compliance insurance claims.

   (i)   Assurance of flood carrying capacity.  Pursuant to the purpose and
methods of reducing flood damage stated in these regulations, the following
additional standards are adopted to assure that the reduction of the flood
carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
      (1)   Development in floodways.
         A.   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
         B.   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
            1.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1450.03(j)(l);
            2.   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
            3.   Certification that no structures are located in areas that
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
            4.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
            5.   Concurrence of the Mayor of the City of University Heights and
the Chief Executive Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed
actions.
      (2)   Development in riverine areas with base flood elevations but no
floodways.
         A.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than one foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a floodplain
development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer, demonstrating that
this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Section
1450.04(i)(1)B. items 1. and 3. through 5.
      (3)   Alterations of a watercourse.  For the purpose of these
regulations, a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks.
The extent of the banks shall be established by a field determination of the
“bankfull stage.” The field determination of “bankfull stage” shall be based on
methods presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical
Report RM-245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field
Technique or other applicable publication available from a federal, state, or
other authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a
watercourse, the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
City of University Heights specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an
agreement is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain
development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1450.03(j)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.

1450.05  APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)   Appeals/Board of Zoning Appeals.
      (1)   The City of University Heights Board of Zoning Appeals (the “BZA”)
shall hear any appeal made pursuant to these regulations at regularly scheduled
meetings.
      (2)   All meetings of the BZA shall be open to the public except that the
BZA may deliberate in executive sessions as part of quasi-judicial hearings in
accordance with law. The BZA shall keep minutes of its proceedings showing the
vote of each member upon each question and shall keep records of all official
actions. Records of the BZA shall be kept and filed in City Hall at 2300
Warrensville Center Road, University Heights, Ohio.
   (b)   Powers and duties.
      (1)   The BZA shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is
an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by the
Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of these
regulations.
      (2)   Authorize variances in accordance with Section
1450.05(d) of these regulations.
   (c)   Appeals.
      (1)   Any person affected by any notice and order, or other official
action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be granted a
hearing on the matter before the BZA provided that such person shall file,
within ten days of the date of such notice and order, or other official action,
a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for the mitigation of any
item appearing on any order of the Floodplain Administrator’s decision. Such
appeal shall be in writing, signed by the applicant, and be filed with the
Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the appeal, the Floodplain
Administrator shall transmit said notice and all pertinent information on which
the Floodplain Administrator’s decision was made to the BZA.
      (2)   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the BZA shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)   Variances. Any person believing that the use and development standards
of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The BZA shall have the power to authorize, in
specific cases, such variances from the standards of these regulations, not
inconsistent with federal regulations, as will not be contrary to the public
interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot or parcel, a literal
enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would result in unnecessary
hardship.
      (1)   Application for a variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance application shall
immediately transmit it to the BZA.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
         C.   All applications for variance shall be accompanied by a variance
application fee set in the schedule of fees adopted by the City of University
Heights.
      (2)   Notice for public hearing. Upon receipt of an application for a
variance from the Floodplain Administrator, the BZA shall hold a public hearing
at its next regularly scheduled meeting in which the notice requirements of
this Section have been fully complied with. Prior to the hearing, a notice of
such hearing shall be given in one or more newspapers of general circulation in
the community at least ten days before the date of the hearing.
      (3)   Public hearing. At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the BZA requires. In considering such variance
applications, the BZA shall consider and make findings of fact on all
evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of
these regulations and the following factors:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (4)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         E.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
         Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the BZA may attach such conditions to the granting of variances,
as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (5)   Other conditions for variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section
1450.05(d)(3)A. to K. have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the BZA, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator may present evidence or testimony in
opposition to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The BZA shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The BZA shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its decision.
The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and thereafter
issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a reasonable
time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the court. Those aggrieved by the decision of the BZA may
appeal such decision to the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas, as provided
in Ohio R.C. Chapter 2506.

         A.   Detention or retention basins or subsurface storage areas.
         B.   Retarding flow velocities by increasing friction.
         C.   Induced infiltration of increased storm water runoff into soil,
(where practical); for example, constructing special infiltration areas where
soils are suitable or providing good infiltration areas with proper emergency
overflow facilities. Soil limitations shall be determined by the current
edition of the Cuyahoga Soil and Water Conservation District Survey by the Soil
Conservation Service, USDA.
      (5)   The runoff rate from the development area shall not be greater
after development than it was before development. The applicant shall provide
calculations to the Building Commissioner, to be approved by the City Engineer,
proving no increase in the runoff rates from the 2, 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100-year
frequency storms.
      (6)   Increases in the runoff volume shall be offset by further
restricting runoff rates. Based on the increase in runoff volume, the applicant
shall determine the critical storm for the development area. The runoff rate
from the critical storm and all shorter duration storms shall be restricted to
the one-year pre-development storm runoff rate.
      (7)   The design criteria shall be applied to each watershed within the
development area.
      (8)   A paved channel for low water flow is required across all detention
basins for each point source into the basin.
      (9)   Velocity dissipation shall be placed at the outfall structures of
all detention or retention basins and along the length of any outfall channel
as necessary to provide a non-erosive flow velocity from the structure to a
watercourse.
      (10)   Storm water management detention basins and facilities may be
designed to serve the dual purpose of a sediment trap during construction and
post-construction.
      (11)   Storm sewer design for a ten-year storm using the rational method
to estimate the storm runoff rate “Q”. Use Cleveland Regional Rainfall
Intensity- Frequency-Duration Curves for this region.
      (12)   For sites which are currently developed and are scheduled to be
redeveloped, the increase between pre-developed and post-developed runoff shall
be used for critical storm and volume storage calculations.
   (f)   Complete flood routing calculations will be required to confirm that
the proposed detention basin facility meets the above criteria. As a minimum,
the flood routing calculations shall include the following information:
      (1)   Overall drainage plan of the site showing existing and proposed
grading, existing and proposed runoff flow paths and drainage facilities,
contributing areas draining to the drainage system and predominant soil types.
      (2)   Plan view, typical cross-sections and pertinent details of the
proposed detention basin and its primary and emergency outlet control
structures.
      (3)   Detention basin reservoir capacity vs. reservoir water surface
elevation calculations.
      (4)   Outlet control structure discharge vs. reservoir water surface
elevation hydraulic calculations, including the assumptions or calculations
made to determine the existing drainage system hydraulic gradient or water
surface elevation at the outlet control structure discharge point.
      (5)   Inflow-outflow hydrographs, both in tabular and graphical form for
the one-year storm, the critical storm and all storms exceeding the critical
storm. The required inflow hydrographs shall include both pre-development and
post-development conditions.
      (6)   The assumptions and/or calculations utilized in determining the
inflow hydrographs in accordance with the accepted hydrologic method.
      (7)   Hydraulic gradient calculations for the proposed storm drainage
system emptying into the detention basin based on the critical storm design
year and other storm design year frequencies as may be required by the City
Engineer.
   (g)   There are additional post-construction management requirements for
construction areas of over five acres of land as follows:
      (1)   Areas smaller then five acres shall be included when they are part
of a larger plan. The additional requirements shall be incorporated into the
permanent drainage system for the site. The detention basin must be sized to
treat water quality volume (WQV) and comply with Ohio Water Quality Standards
in O.A.C. Chapter 3745-1.
      (2)   The water quality volume shall be equivalent to the volume of
runoff from a 0.75-inch rainfall and shall be determined using the following
equation:
         WQV  =  C x P x A/12
         Where:
            WQV =  water quality volume in acre-feet
            C =  runoff coefficient appropriate for storms less than one inch
(see Table 2)
            P = 0.75-inch precipitation depth
            A = area draining into the basin in acres
 
TABLE 2
Land Use                                           Runoff Coefficient
Industrial and Commercial                          0.8
High Density Residential ( 8 dwellings/acre)       0.5
Medium Density Residential (4 to 8 dwellings/acre) 0.4
Low Density Residential (  4 dwellings/acre)      0.3
Open Space and Recreational Areas                  0.2
Where the land use will be mixed, the runoff coefficient should be calculated
using a weighted average. For example, if 60% of the contributing drainage to
the storm water treatment structure is Low Density Residential, 30% is High
Density Residential, and 10% is Open Space, the runoff coefficient is
calculated as follows (0.6) (0.3) (0.3) (0.5) + (0.1) (0.2) = 0.35.
 
      (3)   An additional volume equal to 20% of the WQV shall be incorporated
into dry basin size for sediment storage. Additional methods to assure long-
term water quality will be considered on a case by case basis.
      (4)   Whatever method is used, the system shall be designed such that the
drain time is long enough to provide treatment, but short enough to provide
storage available for successive rainfall events as described in Table 3 below.
 
TABLE 3
Target Draw Down (Drain) Times for Structural Post-Construction Treatment
Control Practices
Detention System                            Drain Time
Infiltration                                24-48 hours
Vegetated swale and filter strip            24 hours
Extended detention basin (dry basins)       48 hours
Retention basins (wet basins)*              24 hours
Constructed wetlands (above permanent pool) 24 hours
Media filtration, bioretention              40 hours
*   Provide both a permanent pool and an extended detention volume above the
permanent pool, each sized at 0.75 * WQV.
 
      (5)   For redevelopment projects (i.e., developments on previously
developed property), post- construction practices shall either ensure a 20% net
reduction of the site impervious area, provide for treatment of at least 20% of
the WQV, or a combination of the two.

(Ord. 2007-24.  Passed 5-21-2007.)
1468.08  MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR STORM WATER POLLUTION PREVENTION PLAN.
   (a)   The minimum standards set forth below are general guidelines and shall
not limit the right of the City to impose, at any time, additional, more
stringent requirements, nor shall the criteria limit the right of the approving
authority to waive, in writing, individual requirements. Erosion and sediment
control (Storm Water Pollution Prevention) practices used to satisfy the
minimum standards set forth below shall meet the specifications in the latest
edition of Rainwater and Land Development, Ohio's Standards for Stormwater
Management Land Development and Urban Stream Protection (available from Ohio
Department of Natural Resources, Division of Soil and Water Conservation) or
other local requirements, whichever is more stringent.
   (b)   Minimum Standards.  In order to control soil erosion and sediment
pollution of water resources, the owner or the person responsible for the
development area shall include these minimum practices to maintain the level of
conservation established by the following standards:
      (1)   All soil erosion and sediment control practices shall be functional
throughout all phases of earth-disturbing activity. Settling facilities,
perimeter controls, and other practices intended to trap sediment shall be
implemented as the first step of grading and within seven days from the start
of grubbing. They shall continue to function until the development area is
permanently restablized.
      (2)   Clearing and grubbing will be done in two or more phases. The first
phase will include only those locations necessary to install the perimeter soil
erosion and sediment and storm water control practices. After the perimeter
controls are in place and functioning, the remaining phase(s) of clearing and
grubbing may continue.
      (3)   Denuded areas shall have soil stabilization applied within no more
than seven days if they are to remain dormant for more than 45 days. Permanent
or temporary soil stabilization shall be applied to denuded areas within no
more than seven days after final grade is reached on any portion of the site.
      (4)   Concentrated storm water runoff from denuded areas flowing at rates
which exceed the design capacity of sediment barriers shall pass through a
sediment settling facility.
         A.   The facility's storage capacity shall be no less than 67 cubic
yards per acre of total drainage area. Trapping efficiency should be at least
75%.
         B.   Permanent storm water management ponds that are designed to trap
sediment during construction shall be designed to provide for a slow release of
sediment-laden water. Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed at the
outfall channel as necessary to provide a nonerosive flow velocity from the
structure to a watercourse.
      (5)   Sheet and rill flow runoff from denuded areas shall be diverted to
a settling pond or treated by a geotextile silt fence or other approved
sediment barrier. The total runoff flow treated by a sediment barrier shall not
exceed the design capacity for that sediment barrier.
      (6)   All storm sewer inlets which accept water runoff from the
development area shall be protected so that sediment-laden water will not enter
the storm sewer without first being filtered or otherwise treated to remove
sediment, unless the storm sewer system drains to a settling facility.
Geotextile fabric under grates is not acceptable.
      (7)   Working in or crossing streams.
         A.   Streams including bed and banks shall be restabilized immediately
after in-channel work is completed, interrupted or stopped.  To the extent
practicable, construction vehicles shall be kept out of streams. Where in-
channel work is necessary, precautions shall be taken to stabilize the work
area during construction to minimize erosion.
         B.   If a live (wet) stream must be crossed by construction vehicles
regularly during construction, a temporary stream crossing shall be provided.
Temporary stream crossings shall have hydraulic capacity and/or overflow
capability to prevent upstream flooding.
      (8)   Measures shall be taken to prevent soil and other solids and
pollutants from being transported onto surfaces where runoff is not checked by
sediment controls, or onto public roads. Minimize such tracking by installing
gravel construction entrances. Where such materials are transported onto a
public road surface, the roads shall be cleaned thoroughly at the end of each
day, or more frequently as required by the Service Director. Said materials
shall be removed from paved surfaces by shoveling or sweeping. Street washing
shall be allowed only after most sediment has been removed by shoveling or
sweeping.
      (9)   Sloughing and dumping.
         A.   No soil, rock, debris, or any other material shall be dumped or
placed into a water resource or into such proximity that it may readily slough,
slip, or erode into a water resource unless such dumping or placing is
authorized by the City Engineer, and, when applicable, the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers, for such purposes as, but not limited to, constructing bridges,
culverts, and erosion control structures.
         B.   Unstable soils prone to slipping or landsliding shall not be
graded, excavated, filled or have loads imposed upon them unless the work is
done in accordance with a qualified professional engineer's recommendations to
correct, eliminate or adequately address the problems.
      (10)   Cut and fill slopes shall be designed and constructed in a manner
which will minimize erosion. Consideration shall be given to the length and
steepness of the slope, soil type, upslope drainage area, ground water
conditions, and slope stabilization.
      (11)   Outfalls and constructed or modified channels shall be designed
and constructed to withstand the expected velocity of flow from a post
development, ten-year (or greater) frequency storm without eroding.
      (12)   A permanent vegetative cover shall be established on denuded areas
not otherwise permanently stabilized. Permanent vegetation shall not be
considered established until ground cover is achieved which, in the opinion of
the City Engineer, covers 80% or more of the soil surface and provides adequate
cover and is mature enough to control soil erosion satisfactorily and to
survive adverse weather conditions.
      (13)   A riparian zone of the minimum depth of 25 feet measured on a
flat, level line at right angles to the high water mark of the stream or
wetland shall be maintained as virgin, undisturbed area along any existing
creek, stream, waterway or wetland area. Should a virgin area not be manageable
due to proposed grade changes or other proposed site work, the City Engineer
may approve the design and installation of a landscaping plan intended to
replace the existing plant growth. The City Engineer shall be authorized to
waive the minimum 25-foot dimension in specific locations on a site where a
hardship can be shown to exist and where other acceptable, permanent means of
filtering runoff can be provided.
      (14)   All temporary erosion and sediment control practices shall be
disposed of within 30 days after final site stabilization is achieved or after
the temporary practices are no longer needed, unless otherwise authorized by
the Building Commissioner upon a written recommendation of the City Engineer.
Trapped sediment shall be permanently stabilized to prevent further erosion, or
removed from the site.
      (15)   All erosion and sediment control practices shall be designed and
constructed to minimize maintenance requirements. They shall be maintained and
repaired as needed to assure continued performance of their intended function.
Sediment and erosion controls shall be inspected by the applicant or his or her
designee once every seven  days and within 24 hours of 0.5 inch or greater
rainfall amount. A written log of these inspections must be kept by the
applicant or his or her designee. This log should indicate the date of
inspection, name of inspector, weather conditions, observations, actions taken
to correct any problems and the date action was taken. Upon a request of the
City Engineer, the owner shall submit these documents.
      (16)   During construction of underground utility lines, pipes, etc.
Trench de-watering devices shall discharge in an approved manner which will not
adversely affect water resource or off-site property.
      (17)   If the construction site is subject to Ohio EPA's National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits, a copy of all the
required inspection sheets shall be submitted to the Building Commissioner
within two working days of the date that the inspection was conducted.
(Ord. 2007-24.  Passed 5-21-2007.)
1468.09  CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   In conjunction with
Chapter 1068 “Specifications and Requirements for Sewers, Waterlines, Curbing,
Paving, and Sidewalks”, after the Building Commissioner issues a permit to
construct, the permit holder shall notify the City Engineer, who provides site
inspection, at least two working days prior to any earth-disturbing activities
in the development area.
   (b)   All permitted earth-disturbing activities shall be subject to site
inspection by the City Engineer, to determine compliance with this chapter, and
the Cuyahoga Soil and Water Conservation District. The occupancy permit
required by
Chapter 1496 may be withheld by the Building Commissioner until all
requirements are met.
   (c)   The Planning and Zoning Commission may grant a variance from the
provisions of this chapter where the applicant or permit holder can show the
compliance with all or part of such provisions is not appropriate. A variance
may be granted if the probability of off-site damage is slight because of
exceptional topographic or other physical conditions of the development area.
The issuance of a variance does not eliminate obligations to meet Ohio
Environmental Protection Agency Requirements. Requests for variances shall be
submitted in writing to the Planning Commission and shall include justification
for the granting of the variance.

to prevent the occupancy of a building, structure or premises, to require
compliance with the provisions of this Code or other applicable laws,
