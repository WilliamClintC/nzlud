A separate and independent building sewer shall be provided for every building; except that whereone building stands at the rear of another on an interior lot and no private sewer is available or canbe constructed to the rear building through an adjoining alley, court, yard or driveway, the buildingsewer from the front building may be extended to the rear building and the whole considered asone building sewer.
Existing building sewers may be used in connection with a new building only when they are found,on examination and test by the Board or its duly authorized agent, to meet all requirements of thisArticle.
The building sewer shall be tar-coated, extra heavy cast iron soil pipe conforming to ASTMSpecification A74 or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe conforming to ASTM D-3034 providing aminimum SDR of 35 and a minimum pipe stiffness of 46 at five-percent deflection (Schedule 40PVC pipe) or asbestos-cement pipe conforming to ASTM Specification C-428. Joints shall be tightand waterproof.
The size and slope of the building sewer shall be subject to the approval of the Board or its dulyauthorized agent, but in no event shall the diameter be less than four inches, nor shall the slope ofthe pipe be less than 1/4 inch per foot unless permission is granted by the Board. In any case, theslope of the pipe shall not be less than 1/8 inch per foot.
Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the building at an elevation below thebasement floor. No building sewer shall be laid parallel to and within three feet of any bearing wallwhich might thereby be weakened. The depth shall be sufficient to afford protection from frost, butin no event shall be less than three feet. The building sewer shall be laid at uniform grade and instraight alignment insofar as possible. Changes in direction shall be made only with properlycurved pipe and fittings. The ends of building sewers which are not connected to the building drainof the structure for any reason shall be sealed against infiltration by a suitable stopper, plug orother approved means.
In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer,sewage or industrial wastes carried by such drain shall be lifted by approved mechanical meansand discharged to the building sewer.
All excavations required for the installation of a building sewer shall be open trench work unlessotherwise approved by the Board. Pipelaying and backfill shall be performed in accordance withSections 3 through 6 of ASTM Specification C12, except that no backfill shall be placed until thework has been inspected by the Board.
Joints.
All joints and connections shall be made gastight and watertight. No cement joints will bepermitted. No paint, varnish or other coatings shall be permitted on the joining material untilafter the joint has been tested and approved. The transition joint between cast iron pipe andother pipe material shall be made with special adapters and joint materials approved by theBoard.
Pre-molded gasket joints for hub and plain end cast iron pipe and PVC pipe shall be usedwith a neoprene compression-type gasket which provides a positive double seal in theassembled joint. The gasket shall be a premolded, one-piece unit designed for joining thepipe and plain end soil pipe and fittings. The assembled joint shall be sealed by compressionof the gasket between the exterior surface of the spigot and the interior surface of the hub.The joint shall be assembled following the manufacturer's recommendations using acceptablelubricant and special pipe-coupling tools designed for that purpose. The plain spigot end shallbe forced into the hub itself. Lubricant shall be a bland, flax-base, nontoxic material and shallnot chemically attack the gasket material.
The connection of the building sewer into a public sewer shall be made at the location of thelateral connection provided by the Village or directly to the sanitary sewer as directed by the Boardin individual circumstances. The owner shall indemnify the Board from any loss or damage that

Inspection.
The applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify the Board when the building sewer isready for inspection and connection to the public sewer. The connection shall be made underthe supervision of the Board.
When trenches are opened for the laying of building sewer pipes, such installations shall beinspected by the Board before the pipes are covered; and the person performing such workshall notify the Board when the installation of the building sewer is completed. The covering ofa pipe before inspection is made will subject the person to whom a permit is issued topenalties under §
118-16
of this Article and the installation will not be approved for use until itis uncovered and inspected by the Board.
All excavations for building sewer installation shall be adequately guarded with barricades andlights so as to protect the public from hazard. Streets, sidewalks, parkways and other publicproperty disturbed in the course of the work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to theBoard.
When any building sewer is to serve a school, hospital or similar institution or public building or isto serve a complex of industrial or commercial buildings or which, in the opinion of the Board, willreceive sewage or industrial wastes of such volume or character that frequent maintenance of saidbuilding sewer is anticipated, then such building sewer shall be connected to the public sewerthrough a manhole. The Board shall determine if and where this type of connection to the publicsewer is required. Connections to existing manholes shall be made as directed by the Board. Ifrequired, a new manhole shall be installed in the public sewer pursuant to §
118-8D
and thebuilding sewer connection made thereto as directed by the Board.
There shall be installed an accessible cleanout on the building sewer. The cleanout shall have awatertight center sunk brass plug or its equivalent.
No public or private building, dwelling or store will be permitted to make any connectionwhatsoever to a sanitary sewer system unless the same has a soil line extended to a point abovethe roof and properly vented or otherwise vented in a manner approved by the SewerSuperintendent.
Grease traps must be installed for restaurants, hotels, buildings with commercial kitchens orwhenever the Village Board or its duly authorized agent may direct. Grease traps must be keptclean at all times at the owner's expense. The size and design of the grease trap shall beapproved by the Sewer Superintendent. Grease traps should not be preceded by garbage grinderor disposal units.

Sewer extensions, including individual building sewers from the public sewer to the property line,may be constructed by the Board under public contract if, in the opinion of the Board, the numberof properties to be served by such extension warrants its costs. Under this arrangement theproperty owner shall pay for and install the building sewer from the property line to his residenceor place of business in accordance with the requirements of §§
118-6
and
118-7
. Property ownersmay propose sewer extensions within the Village by drafting a written petition, signed by a majorityof the benefiting property owners, and filing it with the Board. The cost of such extensions may beassessed to the benefited property owners pursuant to applicable law.
If the Board does not elect to construct a sewer extension under public contract, the propertyowner, builder or developer may construct the necessary sewer extension, if such extension isapproved in accordance with the requirements of Subsection
A
. He or they must pay for the entireinstallation, including all expenses incidental thereto. Each building sewer must be installed andinspected as previously required, and the inspection fees shall be paid. Design of sewers shall beas specified in Subsection
D
. The installation of the sewer extension must be subject to periodicinspection by the Engineer, and the expenses for this inspection shall be paid for by the owner,builder or developer. The Engineer's decisions shall be final in matters of quality and methods ofconstruction. The sewer, as constructed, must pass the exfiltration test required in Subsection
E
before it is to be used.
Main line sewer design.
Main line sewer design shall be in accordance with the following provisions:
Pipe material shall be asbestos-cement conforming to ASTM Specification C-428, TypeII; or polyvinyl chloride pipe conforming to ASTM Specification D-3034.
Minimum internal pipe diameter shall be eight inches.
Joints for each type of pipe shall be designed and manufactured such that O-ring gasketsof the "slip on" type are employed.
Gaskets shall be continuous, solid neoprene and shall provide a positive compressionseal in the assembled joint such that the requirements of Subsection
E
are met.
Wye branch fittings shall be installed for connection to building sewers in accordancewith §
118-7A
.
Pipe thicknesses and field strengths shall be calculated using the following criteria:
Safety factor: 1.5.
Load factor: 1.5.
Weight of soil: 120 pounds per cubic foot.
Wheel loading: 16,000 pounds.
The transition width shall be used in conjunction with the above to compute pipe class forasbestos cement pipe. Polyvinyl chloride pipe shall have wall thicknesses equal to or greaterthan those provided by an SDR of 35.
Utilizing the above information, design shall then be made as outlined in Chapter IX of theWater Pollution Control Federation Manual of Practice No. 9, Design and Construction ofSanitary and Storm Sewers.

Exfiltration testing.
All sewer extensions shall satisfy requirements of a final exfiltration test before they will beapproved and sewage flow accepted from them by the Board. This test consists of filling thepipe with water to provide a head of at least five feet above the top of the pipe or five feetabove groundwater, whichever is higher, at the highest point of the pipeline under test, andthen measuring the loss of water from the line by the amount which must be added tomaintain the original level. In this test, the line must remain filled with water for at least 24hours prior to the taking of measurements. Exfiltration shall be measured by the drop of waterlevel in a standpipe with closed bottom end or in one of the sewer manholes available forconvenient measuring.
When a standpipe and plug arrangement is used in the upper manhole of a line under test,there must be some positive method of releasing entrapped air in the sewer prior to takingmeasurements. The test length intervals for either type of test shall be as ordered orapproved but in no event shall they exceed 1,000 feet. In the case of sewers laid on steepgrades, the length of line to be tested by exfiltration at any one time may be limited by themaximum allowable internal pressure on the pipe and joints at the lower end of the line. Thetest period wherein the measurements are taken shall not be less than two hours in eithertype of test.
The total leakage of any section tested shall not exceed the rate of 20 gallons per mile of pipeper 24 hours per inch of nominal pipe diameter. For purposes of determining the maximumallowable leakage, manholes shall be considered as sections of forty-eight-inch diameterpipe, five feet long. The equivalent leakage allowance shall be 4.5 gallons per manhole per 24hours, for forty-eight-inch diameter manholes. If leakage exceeds the specified amount, thenecessary repairs or replacements required shall be made to permanently reduce the leakageto within the specified limit, and the tests shall be repeated until the leakage requirement ismet.
Other forms of sewer testing may be permitted subject to the approval of the Engineer andNYSDEC Standards.
All sewer extensions constructed at the property owner's, builder's, or developer's expense, afterfinal approval and acceptance by the Engineer, shall become the property of the Village and shallthereafier be maintained by the Village. Said sewers shall be televised at the owner's, builder's ordeveloper's expense, and, after their acceptance by the Village, shall be guaranteed againstdefects in materials or workmanship for 12 months. The guaranty shall be in a form provided forby the Village. At the sole discretion of the Village, a completion bond or other security may bedemanded as part of the guaranty.

§ 160-6.6. Standards for wireless telecommunications towers andfacilities.
Purpose and intent.
The purpose of these standards is to establish predictable and balanced regulations for theplacement and screening of personal services antennas, towers, and accessory structures.The regulations that follow are also intended to accommodate the growth of such systemswithin the Village of Cobleskill (hereinafter referred to as "the Village"). Such regulations willfurther serve to protect the public against any adverse impacts on aesthetic resources.Additionally, the regulations will eliminate potential damage to adjacent properties from towerfailure through structural standards and setback requirements. Finally, the regulations setforth in these standards will reduce the number of towers needed to service the community bymaximizing the use of existing towers and structures.
These standards are intended to regulate the placement, construction, modification, andremoval of towers and telecommunications facilities to protect the health, safety, and welfareof the public while not unreasonably interfering with the development of the competitivewireless telecommunications marketplace in the Village. Specifically, these standards areintended to:
Regulate the location of towers and telecommunications facilities in the Village;
Protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse impacts of towers andtelecommunications facilities;
Minimize adverse visual impacts of towers and telecommunications facilities throughcareful design, placement, landscaping, and innovative camouflaging techniques;
Promote and encourage shared use/collocation of towers and antenna support structuresas a primary option rather than construction of additional single-use towers;
Promote and encourage technological designs that will either eliminate or reduce theneed to erect new tower structures to support antennas and telecommunicationsfacilities;
Secure fair and reasonable compensation to the Village and the residents of the Villagefor permitting private use of the public ways;
Avoid potential damage to property caused by towers and telecommunications facilitiesby ensuring such structures are soundly and carefully designed, constructed, modified,

Collocation requirements. All towers erected or located within the Village shall comply with thefollowing requirements:
A proposal for a tower shall not be approved unless the Planning Board finds that the antennaplanned for the proposed tower cannot be accommodated on an existing or approved toweror building within a one-mile search radius (one-half-mile search radius for towers under 120feet in height; one-quarter-mile search radius for towers under 80 feet in height) of theproposed tower due to one or more of the following reasons:
The antenna would exceed the structural capacity of the existing or approved tower orbuilding, as documented by a qualified professional engineer acceptable to the Village,and the existing or approved tower cannot be reinforced, modified, or replaced toaccommodate the planned or equivalent antenna at a reasonable cost.
The antenna would cause interference materially impacting the usability of other existingor planned antennas at the tower or building as documented by a qualified professionalengineer acceptable to the Village, and the interference cannot be prevented at areasonable cost.
Existing or approved towers and buildings within the search radius cannot accommodatethe antenna at a height necessary to function reasonably, as documented by a qualifiedprofessional engineer acceptable to the Village.
Other foreseen reasons that make collocation of the antenna upon an existing orapproved tower or building infeasible.
Any proposed tower shall be designed structurally, electrically, and in all respects toaccommodate both the applicant's antennas and comparable antennas for at least twoadditional users if the tower is over 100 feet high or for at least one additional user if the toweris over 60 feet high. Towers must be designed to allow for future rearrangement of antennasupon the tower and to accept antennas mounted at varying heights. The applicant shallsubmit to the Planning Board a letter of intent committing the applicant, and its successors ininterest, to negotiate in good faith for shared use of the proposed tower by other personalwireless service providers in the future. The issuance of a special use permit shall commit thenew tower owner and its successors in interest to:
Respond in a timely and comprehensive manner to a request for information from apotential shared-use applicant.
Negotiate in good faith concerning future requests for shared use of the new tower byother personal wireless service providers.
Allow shared use of the new tower if another personal wireless service provider agrees inwriting to pay charges.
Make no more than a reasonable charge for shared use, based on generally acceptedaccounting principles. The charge may include, but is not limited to, a pro rata share ofthe cost of the site selection, planning, project administration, land costs, site design,construction and maintenance financing, return on equity, and depreciation and all of thecosts of adapting the tower or equipment to accommodate a shared user without causingelectromagnetic interference.

§ 160-11. LIGHTING.
§ 160-11.1. Purpose.
This §
160-11
sets criteria for providing lighting in outdoor public places where safety and security areconcerns. It also provides for criteria to protect drivers and pedestrians from disabling glare fromnonvehicular light sources that might otherwise shine directly into their eyes and thereby impair safetravel and to protect neighbors from nuisance glare from poorly aimed or poorly shielded light sources.
§ 160-11.2. Standards common to all zoning districts.
Illumination.
On-site lighting shall be fully shielded and located to avoid harsh glares. All outdoor fixturesinstalled and thereafter maintained, other than those serving one- or two-family dwellings,shall comply with the criteria as specified below. All outdoor light fixtures using anincandescent lamp of no more than 150 watts are exempt from all requirements of thissection.
Fully shielded light fixtures shall be used for security purposes or to illuminate walkways,roadways and parking lots. Fully shielded fixtures or full cutoff fixtures are required. Forluminaires on poles, the pole height to spacing ratio shall be not more than 1:6 (for example,an eighteen-foot pole height and a pole-to-pole spacing of 108 feet).
Light fixtures used to illuminate flags, statues or any other objects mounted on a pole,pedestal or platform shall use a narrow cone beam of light that will not extend beyond theilluminated object.
Externally illuminated building identification signs or other signs shall use fully shielded lightfixtures.
Light trespass and glare. All light fixtures shall be designed, installed and maintained to preventlight trespass, as specified below:
Outdoor lighting, whether on private, commercial, industrial, municipal or institutional property,shall be designed, installed and maintained to avoid a disabling glare hazard to drivers orpedestrians. All reasonable measures, such as altering pole height, changing bulb type orusing full cutoff fixtures, shall be taken to prevent nuisance glare onto neighboring properties.
Outdoor light fixtures properly installed and thereafter maintained shall be directed so thatthere will be no undue direct light emissions.
The Planning Board may, as part of site plan review, require that lighting be controlled byautomatic timing devices to extinguish offending sources of glare during specified periods tomitigate glare consequences.
Glare control shall be accomplished primarily through the proper selection and application oflighting equipment. Only after those means have been exhausted shall vegetation, fences andsimilar screening methods be considered acceptable for reducing glare.
