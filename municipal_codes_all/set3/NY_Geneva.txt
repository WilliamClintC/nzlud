The New York State Defense Emergency Act, in Section 29-a thereof,
authorizes political subdivisions of the state to provide for the continuity
of their governments in the event of an actual or imminent attack upon
the United States by an enemy or foreign nation. The General Municipal
Law, in § 60 thereof, authorized political subdivisions to provide for the
continuity of their governments in the event of other public disasters,
catastrophes or emergencies. Based on the authority contained in such
laws, this chapter is adopted so that on such occasions the government
of the City of Geneva, New York may continue to function properly and
efficiently under emergency circumstances.

As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:

weapons or processes.

powers and duties of a public office in the event the office is vacant or at
such times as it lacks administration due to the death, absence or disability
of the incumbent officer, where such authorization is provided pursuant to
the provisions of any general, special or local law other than this chapter.
EMERGENCY INTERIM SUCCESSOR  A person designated pursuant to
this chapter for possible temporary succession to the powers and duties, but
not the office, of a city officer in the event that neither such officer nor any
duly authorized deputy is able, due to death, absence from the city, or other
physical, mental or legal reasons, to perform the powers and duties of the
office.
PUBLIC DISASTER  A disaster, catastrophe or emergency, actual or
imminent, of such unusual proportions or extent that a substantial number
of the residents of the city of Geneva either sustain injury, become ill, are

result of injury, disease or exposure, or the property of a substantial number
of such residents is imperiled, damaged or destroyed, and it is necessary
and essential in the interest of public safety, health and welfare that the
continuity of the government of the City of Geneva be assured in order that
it be enabled to function properly and efficiently and to exercise its essential
powers in meeting emergency conditions. Such disasters, catastrophes and
emergencies may include, but shall not be limited to, conflagrations,
explosions, earthquakes or other convulsions of nature, floods, tidal waves,
pestilence, riots, insurrections, storms, prolonged failure of electric power
or essential transportation services, or any incident or occurrence which
causes or threatens to cause danger to life, health or property from
exposure to noxious materials or radiation.

interim successors.
A. Mayor and City Manager. Within 30 days following the effective date of
this chapter, and thereafter within 30 days after first entering upon the

duly authorized deputy, designate such number of emergency interim
successors to the powers and duties of his office and specify their rank
in order of succession after any duly authorized deputy so that there
will be not less than three duly authorized deputies or emergency
interim successors, or combination thereof, to perform the powers and
duties of the office.
B. Review of designations. The Mayor and City Manager shall from time to
time review and, as necessary, promptly revise the designations of
emergency interim successors to ensure that at all times there are at
least three duly authorized deputies or emergency interim successors,
or combination thereof, for their respective offices.
C. Qualifications. Any person may be designated to serve as an emergency
interim successor, notwithstanding any other provision of law to the
contrary, so long as the person designated possesses the qualifications
prescribed by § 3 of the Public Officers Law and is a resident of the city.

emergency interim successor shall hold that designation at the pleasure
of the designator, and such a designation shall remain effective until

successor.

Manager, or duly authorized deputy of each office, if any, are unable, due
to death, absence from the city or other physical, mental or legal reasons,
to perform the powers and duties of the office, the emergency interim
successor of such officer highest in rank in order of succession who is able
to perform the powers and duties of the office shall, except for the power
and duty to discharge or replace duly authorized deputies and emergency
interim successors of such officer, perform the powers and duties of such
officer. An emergency interim successor shall perform such powers and
duties only until such time as the lawful incumbent officer or his duly
authorized deputy, if any, resumes the office or undertakes the performance
of the powers and duties of the office, as the case may be, or until, where an
actual vacancy exists, a successor is duly elected or appointed to fill such
vacancy and qualifies as provided by law.
§ 14-5. Recording and publication of designations.
The name and address and rank in order of succession of each duly
authorized deputy and emergency interim successor shall be filed with
the City Clerk, and each designation, replacement or change in order of
succession of any emergency interim successor shall become effective when
the designator files with such Clerk the successor's name, address and rank
in order of succession. Such Clerk shall keep an up-to-date file of all such
data regarding duly authorized deputies and emergency interim successors
and the same shall be open to public inspection. The Clerk shall notify in
writing each designated person of the filing of his name as an emergency
interim successor and his rank in order of succession and also shall notify
in writing any person previously designated who is replaced or whose place
in order of succession is changed.
§ 14-6. Qualification for taking office.
At the time of their designation, or as soon thereafter as possible,
emergency interim successors shall take such oath and do such other
things, if any, as may be required to qualify them to perform the powers and
duties of the office to which they may succeed.
§ 14-7. Quorum and voter requirements.
In the event of an attack or a public disaster, the presiding officer of
the Common Council, or his duly authorized deputy or emergency interim
successor performing his powers and duties, may suspend quorum
requirement for the Council. If quorum requirements are suspended, any
local law, ordinance, resolution or other action requiring enactment,
adoption or approval by an affirmative vote of a specified proportion of
members may be enacted, adopted or approved by the affirmative vote of
the specified proportion of those voting thereon.

life of the systems and improvements as determined by EIC, acting on
behalf of the Municipality.
C. The rate of interest for the Secured Amount shall be fixed by the
Financing Party in conjunction with EIC, acting on behalf of the
Municipality, as provided in the Finance Agreement.
A. Upon the making of the loan pursuant to the Finance Agreement, the
Secured Amount shall become a special Benefit Assessment Lien on the
Benefited Property in favor of the Municipality. The amount of the
Benefit Assessment Lien shall be the Secured Amount. Evidence of the
Benefit Assessment Lien shall be recorded by EIC, on behalf of the
Municipality, in the land records for properties in the Municipality. Such
recording shall be exempt from any charge, mortgage recording tax or
other fee in the same manner as if recorded by the Municipality. The
Benefit Assessment Lien shall not be foreclosed upon by or otherwise
enforced by the Municipality.
B. The Finance Agreement shall provide for the repayment of the Secured
Amount in installments made at least annually, as provided in a
schedule attached to the Benefit Assessment Lien (the "Annual
Installment Amount"). The Annual Installment Amount shall be levied
by EIC, on behalf of the Municipality, on the Benefited Property in the
same manner as levies for municipal charges, shall become a lien on the
Benefited Property as of the first day of January of the fiscal year for
which levied (the "Annual Installment Lien") and shall remain a lien
until paid. The creation or any recording of the Annual Installment Lien
shall be exempt from any charge, mortgage recording tax or other fee
in the same manner as if recorded by the Municipality. Payment to the
Financing Party shall be considered payment for this purpose. Such
payment shall partly or wholly discharge the Annual Installment Lien.

as may be provided in the Finance Agreement. Any additional Financing
Charges imposed by the Financing Party pursuant to the Finance
Agreement shall increase the Annual Installment Amount and the
Annual Installment Lien for the year in which such overdue payments
were first due.
C. The Benefit Assessment Lien shall be reduced annually by the amount
of each Annual Installment Lien when each Annual Installment Lien
becomes a lien. Each Annual Installment Lien shall be subordinate to all
Municipal Liens, whether created by § 902 of the RPTL or by any other
State or local law. No portion of a Secured Amount shall be recovered
by the Municipality, EIC, or an assignee upon foreclosure, sale or other
disposition of the Benefited Property unless and until all Municipal
Liens are fully discharged. Each Annual Installment Lien, however,

Authority may establish.
§ 140-18.1. Severability.
If any clause, sentence, paragraph, section, or part of this article shall
be adjudged by any court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such
judgment shall not affect, impair or invalidate the remainder thereof, but
shall be confined in its operation to the clause, sentence, paragraph,
shall have priority over all Nonmunicipal Liens, irrespective of when
created, except as otherwise required by law.
D. Neither the Benefit Assessment Lien nor any Annual Installment Lien
shall be extinguished or accelerated in the event of a default or
bankruptcy of the Benefited Property Owner. Each Annual Installment
Amount shall be considered a charge upon the Benefited Property and
shall be collected by EIC, on behalf of the Municipality, at the same time
and in the same manner as real property taxes or municipal charges.
Each Annual Installment Lien shall remain a lien until paid. Amounts
collected in respect of an Annual Installment Lien shall be remitted to
EIC, on behalf of the Municipality, or the Financing Party, as may be
provided in the Finance Agreement.
E. EIC shall act as the Municipality's agent in collection of the Annual
Installment Amounts. If any Benefited Property Owner fails to pay an
Annual Installment Amount, the Financing Party may redeem the
Benefited Property by paying the amount of all unpaid Municipal Liens
thereon, and thereafter shall have the right to collect any amounts in
respect of an Annual Installment Lien by foreclosure or any other
remedy available at law. Any foreclosure shall not affect any subsequent
Annual Installment Liens.
F. EIC, on behalf of the Municipality, may sell or assign for consideration
any and all Benefit Assessment Liens and Annual Installment Liens to
Financing Parties that provide financing to Qualified Properties
pursuant to Finance Agreements. The Financing Parties may sell or
assign for consideration any and all Benefit Assessment Liens and
Annual Installment Liens received from EIC, on behalf of the
Municipality, subject to certain conditions provided in the
administration agreement between EIC and the Financing Party. The
assignee or assignees of such Benefit Assessment Liens and Annual
Installment Liens shall have and possess the same powers and rights at
law or in equity as the Municipality would have had if the Benefit
Assessment Lien and the Annual Installment Liens had not been
assigned with regard to the precedence and priority of such lien, the
accrual of interest and the fees and expenses of collection.

Community Choice Aggregation Program
[Adopted 3-7-2018 by L.L. No. 1-2018]
§ 140-19. Legislative findings; intent and purpose; authority.
§ 140-20. Definitions.
For purposes of this article, and unless otherwise expressly stated or unless
the context otherwise requires, the terms in this article shall have the
A. It is the policy of both the City of Geneva ("Municipality") and the State
of New York to reduce costs and provide price certainty for the purpose
of consumer protection and economic development, to expand access
and opportunities for consumers in retail energy markets, as well as to
promote the sustainability and resilience of energy systems through the
proliferation of renewable energy, energy efficiency, and distributed
energy resources (DER, as defined below). Among the initiatives that
may advance these objectives in New York is Community Choice
Aggregation ("CCA"), a policy that empowers local governments to
determine the source of electricity and/or natural gas supply on behalf
of its residents and small businesses, reflecting local resources,
priorities, and challenges. Energy delivery remains the responsibility of
the distribution utility.
B. This article establishes the authority for the City of Geneva, in
connection with the implementation a CCA program, to acquire utility
data, to select, through competitive solicitation, energy suppliers on
behalf of default consumers within the jurisdictional boundaries of the
City of Geneva and to maximize value for participating consumers
through enhanced services related to DER. The municipality may
choose to collaborate with other local governments to form an
intermunicipal program. As a result, consumers will have the
opportunity to lower and stabilize their energy costs, to spur local clean
energy innovation and investment, and to reduce their environmental
impact; thereby, fulfilling the purposes of this article and fulfilling an
important public purpose.
C. The City of Geneva is authorized to implement this Community Choice
Aggregation Program pursuant to § 10(1)(ii)(a)(12) of the New York
Municipal Home Rule Law; and consistent with State of New York
Public Service Commission Case No. 14-M-0224, Proceeding on Motion
of the Commission to Enable Community Choice Aggregation Programs
(issued April 21, 2016) as may be amended, including subsequent
orders of the Public Service Commission issued in connection with or
related to Case No. 14-M-0224, to the extent that orders related to Case
No. 14-M-0224 enable actions by the municipality.
D. This article shall be known and may be cited as the "Community Choice
Aggregation Program Law of the City of Geneva."

Director of Public Works of the city shall forthwith cause such building
materials and construction equipment to be removed from the premises and

(c) To add allegations related to or arising out of the subject
matter set forth or attempted to be set forth in the charge; or

jurisdictional purposes, such amendments shall relate back to
the date the original charge was first filed.
(2) The charging party may amend a charge to include allegations of
retaliation which arose after the filing of the original charge. Such
amendment must be filed within 180 days after the occurrence of
the retaliation, and prior to the Director's issuance of findings of
fact and determination with respect to the original charge. Such
amendments may be made at any time during the investigation of
the original charge so long as the Director will have adequate time
to investigate the additional allegations and the parties will have
adequate time to present the Director with evidence concerning
the additional allegations before the issuance of findings of fact and
a determination.
(3) When a charge is amended to add or substitute a respondent, the
Director shall serve upon the new respondent:
(a) The amended charge;

§ 158-17 FAIR HOUSING § 158-17
158:133
procedural rights and obligations under this chapter. The Director
shall promptly make an investigation of the charge.
(2) The investigation shall be directed to ascertain the facts
concerning the unfair practice alleged in the charge and shall be
conducted in an objective and impartial manner.
(3) During the investigation, the Director shall consider any statement
of position or evidence with respect to the allegations of the charge
which the charging party or the respondent wishes to submit,
including the respondent's answer to the charge. The Director shall
have authority to sign and issue subpoenas requiring the
attendance and testimony of witnesses, the production of evidence
including but not limited to books, records, correspondence or
documents in the possession or under the control of the person
subpoenaed, and access to evidence for the purpose of examination
and copying, and conduct discovery procedures which may include
the taking of interrogatories and oral depositions.
(4) The Director may require a fact-finding conference or participation
in another process with the respondent and any of respondent's
agents and witnesses and charging party during the investigation
in order to define the issues, determine which elements are
undisputed, resolve those issues which can be resolved, and afford
an opportunity to discuss or negotiate settlement. Parties may have
their legal counsel present if desired.
(5) Witnesses summoned by a subpoena under this chapter shall be
entitled to the same witness and mileage fees as witnesses in

chapter:
(1) A respondent may file with the Director an answer to the charge no
later than 20 days after receiving notice of the charge.
(2) The Director shall commence investigation of the charge within 30
days after the filing of the charge. An investigation must be
completed within 100 days, except under special circumstances
which must be documented and conveyed to the parties. If the
Director is unable to complete the investigation within 100 days
after the filing of the charge, the Director shall notify the charging
party and the respondent of the reasons therefor. The Director shall
make final administrative disposition of a charge within one year of
the date of filing of the charge, unless it is impracticable to do so. If
the Director is unable to make a final administrative disposition
§ 158-17 GENEVA CODE § 158-17
158:134
within one year of the filing of the charge, the Director shall notify
the charging party and the respondent of the reasons therefor.
(3) If the Director determines that it is necessary to carry out the
purposes of this chapter, the Director may, in writing, request the
City Attorney to seek prompt judicial action for temporary or
preliminary relief to enjoin any unfair real estate practice pending
final disposition of a charge.
F. Conciliation and investigative reports.
(1) During the period beginning with the filing of such complaint and
ending with the filing of a charge or a dismissal by the Director, the
Director shall, to the extent feasible, engage in conciliation with
respect to such complaint.
(a) A conciliation agreement arising out of such conciliation shall
be an agreement between the respondent and the complainant
and shall be subject to approval by the Director.
(b) A conciliation agreement may provide for binding arbitration
of the dispute arising from the complaint. Any such arbitration
that results from a conciliation agreement may award
appropriate relief, including monetary relief.
(c) Each conciliation agreement shall be made public unless the
complainant and respondent otherwise agree and the Director
determines that disclosure is not required to further the
purposes of this title.
(d) Failure to comply with conciliation agreement. Whenever the
Director has reasonable cause to believe that a respondent has
breached a conciliation agreement, the Director shall refer the
matter to the City Attorney with a recommendation that a civil
action be filed for the enforcement of such agreement.
(e) Prohibitions and requirements with respect to disclosure of
information.
[1] Nothing that transpires during the conciliation process,
whether successful or unsuccessful, may be publicly
disclosed or used in subsequent proceedings.
[2] Notwithstanding Subsection F(1)(e)[1], the Director shall
make available to the aggrieved person and the
respondent, at any time, upon request following
completion of the Director's investigation, information
derived from an investigation and any final investigative
report relating to that investigation.
(2) At the end of each investigation under this section, the Director
shall prepare a final investigative report containing:
§ 158-17 FAIR HOUSING § 158-17
158:135
(a) The names and dates of contacts with witnesses;
(b) A summary and the dates of correspondence and other
contacts with the aggrieved person and the respondent;
(c) A summary description of other pertinent records;
(d) A summary of witness statements; and
(e) Answers to interrogatories.
(3) A final report under this subsection may be amended if additional
evidence is later discovered.
G. Findings of fact and determination of reasonable cause or no
reasonable cause.
(1) The results of the investigation shall be reduced to written findings
of fact and a determination shall be made by the Director that there
is or is not reasonable cause for believing that an unfair practice
has been or is being committed, which determination shall also be
in writing and issued with the written findings of fact.
(2) The findings of fact and determination shall be mailed promptly to
the respondent and charging party.
(3) Once issued to the parties, the Director's findings of fact,
determination, and order may not be amended or withdrawn except
upon the agreement of the parties or in response to an order by the
Board after an appeal taken pursuant to § 158-17H(2), provided,
that the Director may correct clerical mistakes or errors arising
from oversight or omission upon the request from a party or upon
the Director's own discretion.
H. Determination of no reasonable cause; appeal from and dismissal.
(1) If the Director determines that no reasonable cause exists to
believe that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred or is
about to occur, the Director shall promptly dismiss the complaint.
The Director shall make public disclosure of each such dismissal.
(2) If a determination is made that there is no reasonable cause for
believing an unfair practice under this chapter has been
committed, the charging party shall have the right to appeal such
determination to the Board within 30 days of the date the
determination is signed by the Director by filing a written
statement of appeal with the Board. The Board shall promptly
deliver a copy of the statement to the Director and respondent and
shall promptly consider and act upon such appeal by either
affirming the Director's determination or remanding it to the
Director with appropriate instructions. In the event no appeal is
taken or such appeal results in affirmance or if the Board has not
decided the appeal within the 60 days allotted, the determination of
§ 158-17 GENEVA CODE § 158-17
158:136
the Director shall be final and the charge deemed dismissed. Any
party aggrieved by the final dismissal may appeal the order on the
record to an appropriate court.
I. Determination of reasonable cause; conciliation and settlement.
(1) If a determination is made that reasonable cause exists to believe
that an unfair practice has occurred, the Director shall endeavor to
eliminate the unfair practice by conference, conciliation and
persuasion. Conditions of settlement may include (but are not
limited to) the elimination of the unfair practice, rent refunds or
credits, reinstatement to tenancy, affirmative recruiting or
advertising measures, payment of actual damages, damages for
loss of the right to be free from discrimination in real estate
transactions, attorney's fees or such other remedies that will
effectuate the purposes of this chapter, including action which
could be ordered by a court. In charges alleging an unfair real
estate practice, filed under this chapter, the Director may also
require payment of a civil penalty, as set forth in § 158-20.
(2) Any settlement or conciliation agreement shall be an agreement
between the charging party and the respondent and shall be
subject to the approval of the Director. An order shall then be
entered by the Director setting forth the terms of the agreement.
Copies of such order shall be delivered to all affected parties.
(3) If conciliation is not successful and no agreement can be reached,
the Director shall issue a written finding to that effect and furnish a
copy of the finding to the charging party and to the respondent.
Such a finding:
(a) Shall consist of a short and plain statement of the facts upon
which the Director has found reasonable cause to believe that
a discriminatory housing practice has occurred or is about to
occur;
(b) Shall be based on the final investigative report; and
(c) Need not be limited to the facts or grounds alleged in the
complaint filed under § 158-17A; and

respondent.
(4) Upon issuance of the finding, the Director shall promptly cause to
be delivered the entire investigatory file, including the charge and
any and all findings made, to the Board for further proceedings and
hearing under this chapter pursuant to § 158-18.
(5) If the Director determines that the matter involves the legality of
any State or local zoning or other land use law or local law, the
§ 158-17 FAIR HOUSING § 158-17
158:137
§ 158-18. Administrative procedure: complaint and hearing.
Director shall immediately refer the matter to the City Attorney for
appropriate action, instead of issuing a charge.
A. Following submission of the investigatory file to the Board, the Director
shall prepare a complaint against such respondent relating to the
charge and facts discovered during the investigation thereof and
prosecute the same in the name and on behalf of the Commission and
the City at a hearing therefor before the Board sitting alone or with a
Hearing Examiner as provided in this chapter and to appear for and
represent the interests of the Commission and the City at all
subsequent proceedings.
B. The complaint shall be served on the respondent, in the usual manner
provided by law for service of complaints and filed with the Board. A
copy of such complaint shall be furnished the charging party.

shall file its answer with the Board and serve a copy of the same on the
Director.
D. Upon the filing of the complaint, the Board shall promptly establish a
date for the hearing of such complaint and give notice thereof to the
Director, the City Attorney, the complainant, and respondent, and shall
thereafter hold a public hearing on the complaint, which hearing shall
commence no earlier than 90 days nor later than 120 days from the
filing of the complaint, unless otherwise ordered by the Board.
E. After the filing of a complaint with the Board, it may be amended only
with the permission of the Board, which permission shall be granted
when justice will be served thereby and all parties are allowed time to
prepare their case with respect to additional or expanded charges
which they did not and could not have reasonably foreseen would be in
issue at the hearing.
F. The hearing shall be conducted by the Board and/or a hearing examiner
appointed by the Board from a list approved by the Commission, sitting
alone or with the Board. Such hearings shall be conducted in
accordance with written rules and procedures consistent with this
chapter.
G. If a Hearing Examiner is appointed, it shall be done within 30 days after
notice of the date of hearing from the Board.

appear in person, be represented by counsel, present evidence, crossexamine
witnesses, and obtain the issuance of subpoenas. Any
aggrieved person may intervene as a party in the proceeding. The
Federal Rules of Evidence shall apply to the presentation of evidence in
such hearing as they would in a civil action in a U.S. District Court.

together with a brief statement of the reasons therefor.
C. In the event the Board (or a majority of the panel composed of the
Examiner and Board), determines that a respondent has committed an
unfair practice under this chapter, the Board (or panel majority) may
order the respondent to take such affirmative action or provide for such
relief as is deemed necessary to correct the practice, effectuate the
purpose of this chapter, and secure compliance therewith, including but
not limited to rent refund, or credit, reinstatement to tenancy,
affirmative recruiting and advertising measures, attorney's fees or to
take such other action as in the judgment of the Board (or panel
majority) will effectuate the purposes of this chapter. The Board (or
panel majority) may grant any relief that could be ordered by a court,
including actual damages, damages for loss of the right to be free from
discrimination in real estate transactions, injunctive or equitable relief,
any other appropriate remedy set forth in the Federal Fair Housing

by the Board (or panel majority) in a decision rendered under § 158-19
by a court of competent jurisdiction in a proceeding filed under
§ 158-22.
B. The penalty assessed against a respondent shall not exceed the
following amount:
(1) Ten thousand dollars if the respondent has not been determined to
have committed any prior unfair real estate practice;
(2) Twenty-five thousand dollars if the respondent has been
determined to have committed one other unfair real estate practice
during the five-year period ending on the date of the filing of this
charge; or
(3) Fifty thousand dollars if the respondent has been determined to
have committed two or more unfair real estate practices during the
seven-year period ending on the date of the filing of this charge;
except that if acts constituting the unfair real estate practice that is
the subject of the charge are committed by the same natural person
who has been previously determined to have committed acts
constituting an unfair real estate practice, then the penalties set
forth in Subsection B(2) and (3) of this section may be imposed
without regard to the period of time within which those prior acts
occurred.
A. In any case in which a final order of the Director or of the Board
directed to the City, or to any department, division, board or agency
thereof, is not complied with, a copy of the order shall be transmitted to

practices.
§ 158-23. Enforcement by private persons.
A. Following the issuance of a finding of unsuccessful conciliation, any
charging party on whose behalf the reasonable cause finding was made,

elect to have the claims on which reasonable cause was found decided
in a civil action under this section in lieu of an administrative hearing
under §§ 158-18 and 158-19. This election must be made not later than
20 days after issuance of the finding of unsuccessful conciliation. The
person making such election shall give notice of doing so to the Director
and to all other charging parties and respondents to whom the charge
relates.
B. If an election is made under Subsection A of this section, the City
Attorney shall commence, within 30 days after the election is made, a
civil action in the appropriate court to decide on the claim.
C. Any aggrieved person may intervene as of right in the civil action.
D. In a civil action under this section, if the court finds that an unfair real
estate practice has occurred or is about to occur, the court may grant
any relief, including but not limited to actual damages, injunctive or
equitable relief, and any other appropriate remedy set forth in the
Federal Fair Housing Amendments Act (P.L. 100-430). The court may
also assess a civil penalty as set forth in § 158-20. If monetary relief is
sought for the benefit of a person who could have intervened under
Subsection C of this section, but who did not intervene in the civil
action, the court shall not award such relief if that person has not
complied with discovery orders entered by the court.
E. In any proceeding under this section, the court may award attorney fees
and costs to the prevailing party. Attorney fees and costs may be
assessed against a person who intervenes by filing a notice of
independent appearance in the civil action only to the extent that the
intervening participation was frivolous or vexatious, or was for the
purpose of harassment.
A. Any person who claims to have been injured by an unfair real estate
practice, or who believes that he or she will be injured by an unfair real
estate practice that is about to occur, may commence a civil action in
the appropriate court of jurisdiction not later than one year after the
occurrence or the termination of an alleged unfair real estate practice,
whichever occurs last, to obtain appropriate relief with respect to such
unfair real estate practice.
B. The computation of such one-year period shall not include any time
during which an administrative proceeding under this chapter was
pending with respect to a complaint or charge under this chapter
§ 158-22 FAIR HOUSING § 158-23
158:141

It is unlawful for any person to willfully engage in an unfair practice
under this chapter or willfully resist, prevent, impede or interfere with the
Director, the Board, the City Attorney, or in the performance of their duties
under this chapter, or to fail, refuse, or neglect to comply with any lawful
order of the Director, the Board, or the City.
§ 158-25. Construction with other laws.
Nothing in this chapter shall invalidate or restrict any right or remedy of
any charging party or respondent under state or federal law nor preclude
alleging an unfair real estate practice based on the same facts or
occurrences.
C. A complaint may be filed under this section whether or not an
administrative charge has been filed under § 158-17A, and without
regard to the status of such charge, but if the Department or the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development has obtained a prefinding
or post-finding settlement or conciliation agreement with the
consent of the charging party, no action may be filed under this section
with respect to the alleged unfair real estate practice which forms the
basis for such complaint, except for the purpose of enforcing the terms
of such agreement.
D. No civil action may be commenced under this section with respect to an
alleged unfair real estate practice which forms the basis of a complaint
if a hearing on the record has been commenced by the Fair Housing
Board.
E. In a civil action under this section, if the court finds that an unfair real
estate practice has occurred or is about to occur, the court may grant as
relief, as it deems appropriate, any permanent or temporary injunction,
temporary restraining order, or other order, including an order
enjoining the defendant from engaging in such practice or ordering
such affirmative action as may be appropriate. The court may also
award actual damages, including damages for humiliation and mental
suffering, and any other appropriate remedy set forth in the Federal
Fair Housing Amendments Act (P.L. 100-430). The court may also allow
reasonable attorney's fees and costs to the prevailing party.
F. Relief granted under this section shall not affect any contract, sale,
encumbrance, or lease consummated before the granting of such relief
and involving a bona fide purchaser, encumbrancer, or tenant, without
actual notice of the filing of a charge or civil action under this chapter.
G. Upon timely application, the City Attorney may intervene in such civil
action, if the City Attorney certifies that the case is of general public
importance, and may obtain such relief as would be available in an
action brought under § 158-22.

cooperative agreement with the New York State Division of Human Rights
or with other agencies concerned with the enforcement of laws against
discrimination.
§ 158-27. Application to pending charges and complaints.

or review structural design, specifications and plans for the
construction and shall certify that the design and methods of
construction are in accordance with accepted standards of
practice to make the structure watertight, with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with
structural components having the capability of resisting
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of
buoyancy.
(b) A licensed professional engineer or licensed land surveyor
shall certify the specific elevation (in relation to mean sea
level) to which the structure is floodproofed.
§ 177-14 FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION § 177-14
177:161
§ 177-15. Floodways.
Located within areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as
floodways (see definition, § 177-4). The floodway is an extremely hazardous
area due to high-velocity floodwaters carrying debris and posing additional
threats from potential erosion forces. When floodway data is available for
a particular site as provided by §§ 177-6 and 177-12B, all encroachments,
including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other
development, are prohibited within the limits of the floodway unless a
technical evaluation demonstrates that such encroachments shall not result
in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood
discharge.
§ 177-16. Appeals Board.
(3) The local administrator shall maintain on record a copy of all such
certificates noted in this section.
C. Construction standards for areas of special flood hazard without base
flood elevations. New construction or substantial improvements of
structures, including manufactured homes, shall have the lowest floor,
including basement, elevated to or above the base flood elevation as
may be determined in § 177-12B or two feet above the highest adjacent
grade where no elevation data is available.
(1) New construction or substantial improvements of structures,
including manufactured homes, shall have the lowest floor
(including basement) elevated to at least two feet above the highest
adjacent grade next to the proposed foundation of the structure.
(2) Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to
flooding shall be designed to automatically (without human
intervention) allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters for the
purpose of equalizing hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls.
Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a
licensed professional engineer or a licensed architect or meet the
following criteria:
(a) A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area
subject to flooding shall be provided.
(b) The bottom of all such openings shall be no higher than one
foot above the lowest adjacent finished grade.
(c) Openings may be equipped with louvers, valves, screens or
other coverings or devices, provided that they permit the
automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.
A. The Zoning Board of Appeals as established by the City of Geneva shall
hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the
requirements of this chapter.
§ 177-14 GENEVA CODE § 177-16
177:162
B. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall hear and decide appeals when it is
alleged that there is an error in any requirement, decision or
determination made by the local administrator in the enforcement or
administration of this chapter.
C. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Zoning Board of Appeals may
appeal such decision to the Supreme Court pursuant to Article 78 of the
Civil Practice Law and Rules.
D. In passing upon such applications, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall
consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards
specified in other sections of this chapter and:
(1) The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
(2) The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage.
(3) The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
(4) The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community.
(5) The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
(6) The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which
are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
(7) The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development.
(8) The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Plan
and Floodplain Management Program of that area.
(9) The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles.
(10) The costs to local governments and the dangers associated with
conducting search and rescue operations during periods of
flooding.
(11) The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
(12) The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including search and rescue operations and
maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities, such as
sewer, gas, electrical and water systems and streets and bridges.
E. Upon consideration of the factors of Subsection D and the purposes of
this chapter, the Zoning Board of Appeals may attach such conditions to
§ 177-16 FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION § 177-16
177:163
§ 177-17. Conditions for variances.
the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes
of this chapter.
F. The local administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions,
including technical information, and report any variances to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency upon request.
A. Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of 1/2 acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures
constructed below the base flood level, provided that § 177-16D(1)
through (12) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond the 1/2 acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
B. Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or
restoration of structures and contributing structures listed on the
National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic
Places without regard to the contributing structures procedures set
forth in the remainder of this section.
C. Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and
substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the
conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided that:
(1) The criteria of Subsections A, D, E and F of this section are met.
(2) The structure or other development is protected by methods that
minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no
additional threat to public safety.
D. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
E. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is
the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
F. Variances shall only be issued upon receiving written justification of:
(1) A showing of good and sufficient cause.
(2) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant.
(3) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety or
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or
victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or
ordinances.

the same fee, file the same application and secure the same
permit for each temporary food service establishment operated
and for each period of time the temporary food service
establishment operates during the calendar year. [Amended
by Ord. No. 82-17, eff. 4-7-1982]
(c) The health officer, before issuing a permit shall cause an
inspection to be made of the food service establishment and at
least annually thereafter and shall cause additional inspections
to be made as he deems necessary for the proper enforcement
of this chapter.
(d) One copy of the inspection report shall be given by the health
officer or his authorized representative to the manager or

establishment and shall furnish copies on demand, or permit
copying of any or all records of food purchased.
(2) Suspension of permits.
(a) Permits may be suspended temporarily by the health authority
for failure of the holder to comply with the requirements of this
chapter.
(b) Whenever a permit holder or operator has failed to comply

permit is, upon service of the notice, immediately suspended
and that an opportunity for a hearing will be provided if a
written request for a hearing is filed with the health authority
by the permit holder within five days of the service of said
notice.
(c) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this chapter, whenever
the health authority finds insanitary or other conditions in the
operation of a food service establishment, food processing
establishment, retail meat, fish, grocery store or supermarket
which, in his judgment, constitutes a substantial hazard to the
public health, he may without warning, notice or hearing, issue
a written notice to the permit holder or operator citing such
conditions, specifying the corrective action to be taken, and
specifying the time period within which such action shall be
taken; and, if deemed necessary, such order shall state that the
permit is immediately suspended, and all food service
operations are to be immediately discontinued. Any person to
whom such an order is issued shall comply immediately
therewith, but upon written petition filed within five days of the
service of said notice to the health authority, shall be afforded a
hearing as soon as possible.
(3) Reinstatement of suspended permits. Any person whose permit has
been suspended may, at any time, make application for a
reinspection for the purpose of reinstatement of the permit. Upon
receipt of a written request, including a statement signed by the
applicant that in his opinion the conditions causing suspension of
the permit have been corrected, the health authority shall make a
reinspection. If the applicant is complying with the requirements of
this chapter, the permit may be reinstated.
(4) Revocation of permits. For serious or repeated violations of any of
the requirements of this chapter, or for interference with the health
authority in the performance of his duties, the permit may be
permanently revoked after an opportunity for a hearing has been
provided by the health authority. Prior to such action, the health
authority shall notify the permit holder in writing, stating the
reasons for which the permit is subject to revocation and advising
§ 180-3 FOOD SERVICE AND FOOD PROCESSING § 180-3
180:167

five-day period. A permit may be suspended for cause pending its
revocation or a hearing relative thereto.
(5) Hearings. The hearings provided for in this section shall be
conducted by the health authority at a time and place designated

shall make a finding and shall sustain, modify, or rescind any
official notice or order considered in the hearing. A written report
of the hearing decision shall be furnished to the permit holder by
the health authority.
B. Inspection of food service and food processing establishments.
(1) Access to establishments. The health authority or his
representative, after proper identification, shall be permitted to

(3) Issuance of notices. Whenever the health authority makes an
inspection of a food service establishment, food processing
establishment, retail meat, fish, grocery store or supermarket and
discovers that any of the requirements of § 180-3 through § 180-915
of this chapter have been violated, he shall notify the permit holder
or operator of such violations by means of an inspection report
form or other written notice.
C. Examination and condemnation of food. Food may be examined or
sampled by the health authority as often as may be necessary to
determine freedom from adulteration or misbranding. The health
authority may, upon written notice to the owner or person in charge,
place a hold order on any food which he determines or has probable
cause to believe to be unwholesome or otherwise adulterated or
misbranded. Under a hold order, food shall be permitted to be suitably
stored. It shall be unlawful for any person to remove or alter a hold
order, notice or tag placed on food by the health authority, and neither

180:168
such food nor the container thereof shall be relabeled, repacked,
reprocessed, altered, disposed of or destroyed without permission of
the health authority, except on order by a court of competent
jurisdiction. After the owner or person in charge has had a hearing and
on the basis of evidence produced at such hearing, or on the basis of his
examination in the event a written request for a hearing is not received
within 10 days, the health authority may vacate the hold order, or may
by written order direct the owner or person in charge of the food which
was placed under the hold order to denature or destroy such food or
to bring it into compliance with the provisions of this chapter, provided
that such order of the health authority to denature or destroy such food
or bring it into compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall
be stayed if the order is appealed to a court of competent jurisdiction
within three days.
D. Food service and food processing establishments outside jurisdiction of
the health authority. Food from food service and food processing
establishments outside the jurisdiction of the health authority of the
city may be sold within the city if such food service and food processing
establishments conform to the provisions of this chapter or to
substantially equivalent provisions. To determine the extent of
compliance with such provisions, the health authority may accept
reports from responsible authorities in other jurisdictions where such
food service and food processing establishments are located.
E. Plan review of future construction. When a food service or food
processing establishment is hereafter constructed or extensively
remodeled, or when an existing structure is converted for use as a food
service or food processing establishment, properly prepared plans and
specifications for such construction, remodeling or alteration, showing
layout, arrangement, including water supply and sewage disposal
systems, and construction materials of work areas, and the location,
size and type of fixed equipment and facilities, shall be submitted to the
health authority for approval before such work is begun.
F. Procedure when infection is suspected. When the health authority has
reasonable cause to suspect possibility of disease transmission from
any food service establishment, food processing establishment, retail
meat, fish, grocery store or supermarket employee, the health authority
shall secure a morbidity history of the suspected employee, or make
such other investigation as may be indicated, and take appropriate
action. The health authority may require any or all of the following
measures:
(1) The immediate exclusion of the employee from all food service
establishments, food processing establishments, retail meat, fish,
grocery stores and supermarkets.
(2) The immediate closure of the food service establishment, food
processing establishment, retail meat, fish, grocery store or

construction of a sewer or water laterals or mains, the number of
semiannual installments in which said assessment may be made
payable shall not exceed 60. If bonds are issued to finance all or part of
such improvement such assessments shall bear the same rate of
interest as such bonds. Otherwise the City Council shall at their
discretion fix the rate of interest on such installments to be computed
from the date of confirmation; which semiannual installment payments
with accrued interest thereon shall be collected in the same manner as
city taxes during the months of January and May in each year, and every
installment with accrued interest shall be a lien upon the real estate
and upon all the property against which the same was assessed as in
the case of other taxes and assessments.

§ 227-8. Multichannel service providers seeking relief from this
chapter.
A. Multichannel service providers who are exempted from complying with
the provisions of this chapter are as follows:
(1) An MCS provider who is exempted from this chapter as a result of
federal or state law, including a specific rule or regulation of the
FCC or the PSC;
(2) An MCS provider who is exempted from this chapter as a result of
an applicable FCC ruling; or
(3) An MCS provider who is exempted from this chapter as a result of
an applicable judicial ruling, from which all subsequent permissible
appeals have been exhausted or concluded.
B. It is expressly understood that an exempted MCS provider remains
exempted only as long as it meets one or more of the criteria of this
particular section.
C. If exempted in accordance with any of the preceding, a qualified MCS
provider is exempt only from this chapter and not any other locally
enforceable ordinance, law, code or regulation. Consequently, such an
exempted MCS provider shall abide by, and comply with, any other
applicable city, state or federal laws, rules and regulations, including
any applicable federal or state consumer protection or customer or
subscriber service laws, rules and regulations.
A. Any MCS provider affected by this chapter may file a written petition, at
any time, with the City Council seeking relief from one or more
provisions of this chapter. An MCS provider may specifically request
exemption or relief from, or delay in implementation (but as to the
petitioning MCS provider only), of one or more provisions of this
chapter. Also, the MCS provider may request that a specific provision of
the chapter apply to such MCS provider for a specified or limited length
of time or duration. The petition shall set forth the relief requested and
the basis thereof with such supporting information and material as may
be applicable and deemed necessary by the City Council.
B. Any request submitted in accordance with this section that does not
contain a clearly articulated explanation or rationale for each item or
matter being requested, individually, shall be deemed incomplete and
returned to the petitioner without action.
C. In order to receive relief from one or more of the provisions of this
chapter, an MCS provider must satisfactorily demonstrate to the City
Council that at least one of the following facts exist:
(1) The provision and/or requirement is expressly prohibited by federal
law, the FCC, or state law, rule or regulation, including any specific
rule or regulation of the PSC;
§ 227-7 MULTICHANNEL SERVICE PROVIDERS § 227-8
227:217
(2) Where applicable, that the provision in question materially affects,
and is in substantial conflict with an expressed right that is
specifically noted in an existing franchise, other agreement, license
or permit (but only for the term of the existing franchise, other
agreement, license or permit). This provision covers situations
where an MCS provider classified as a cable operator seeks, and is
granted, modification of an existing franchise, other agreement,
license or permit under Section 625 of the Cable Act (codified at 47
USC 545);
(3) That compliance with a particular provision and/or requirement
will be commercially impracticable for an MCS provider;
(4) That one or more time frames listed in this chapter are either
impossible to meet, or are impracticable to meet;
(5) That the MCS provider has its own policy which the City Council
deems comparable to, or in excess of, any provision and/or
requirement from which the MCS provider seeks relief; or
(6) That the health, safety and welfare interests of the city and the
public otherwise warrant the granting of such relief.
D. The City Council shall be the sole determiner of whether an MCS policy
is comparable to, or exceeds, a similar provision in this chapter.
E. As an alternative to seeking an exemption or requesting relief, an MCS
provider may petition for clarification concerning the precise intent and
effect that one or more provisions or sections of this chapter have on
the petitioning MCS provider.
F. In those instances where the City Council grants an exemption or relief
to a franchised MCS provider, or deems a franchised MCS provider's
operational policy to be comparable to a chapter provision, then the
franchise, other agreement, license or permit (initial, existing or
renewal) shall be amended within 60 days to reflect the exact extent of
such exemption and/or relief.
G. It should be specifically noted that the benefit of such exemption, relief,
clarification or comparable policy extends only to the MCS provider
granted such exemption, relief, clarification or comparable policy.
Consequently, in the case of a transfer, assignment or sale of the
system, the proposed transferee, assignee or buyer may, if required by
the City Council, be required to petition separately for such relief,
clarification, exemption or comparable policy substitution. For
purposes of clarification, this shall mean that unlike certain other
amendments to the franchise, other agreement, license or permit as
may be required by law, there shall be no automatic transfer of any
exemption, relief, clarification or comparable policy to a transferee of a
franchise, other agreement, license or permit, or a new owner of a
multichannel system.

§ 227-9. Failure of City Council to enforce this chapter.
An MCS provider shall not be excused from complying with any of the
requirements of this chapter, or any subsequently adopted amendments to
this chapter, by any failure of the City Council on any one or more occasions
to seek, or insist upon, prompt compliance with such requirements or
provisions.
§ 227-10. Multichannel service providers subject to present and
future regulations.
§ 227-11. Repeal of prior inconsistent resolutions, ordinances and
local laws.
H. Any MCS provider who requests relief or exemption from any portion of
this chapter may be required to reimburse the city for the actual,
verifiable cost of processing and analyzing such request, including but
not limited to a request for a comparable policy substitution.
A. Any MCS provider, its assignee or transferee shall be subject to, and
expected to comply with, all applicable ordinances and/or resolutions
now or hereafter adopted and in effect within the city, including this
chapter, to the extent that said MCS provider has not received an
exemption or relief from said ordinance(s) and/or resolution(s).
B. Any MCS provider, and its assignee or transferee, shall be subject to,
and expected to comply with, all federal and state laws and with all
rules and regulations issued by all applicable regulatory agencies
(including, where applicable, the FCC and the PSC) now or hereafter in
existence. However, if the city amends this chapter, and the amendment
of the chapter would have the effect of either unilaterally requiring the
investment of substantial new capital for equipment by the MCS
provider, or unilaterally changing the process for default and/or
revocation of an MCS provider's franchise, other agreement, license or
permit, then such amendment of this chapter shall have no effect on the
affected MCS provider until the expiration of the franchise agreement,
other agreement, license or permit.
C. Any MCS provider, its assignee or transferee shall be subject to all
lawful exercise of the city's police power, without limitation of any kind,
other than as may be limited by applicable state or federal law.
D. With respect to future ordinances and/or resolutions noted in this
section, nothing contained herein shall prevent an MCS provider from
exercising any and all of its administrative and legal rights in order to
challenge the constitutionality, applicability and enforceability of said
future ordinances and/or resolutions.
A. Except as provided in Subsection B of this section, any prior resolution,
ordinance or local law, which in part, or in whole, is directly

regulations or laws.
§ 227-13. Resolution of conflicts between this chapter and a
subsequent franchise agreement.
inconsistent with this chapter is hereby repealed to the extent of the
inconsistency.
B. Subsection A of this section is not intended to repeal, and does not have
the effect of repealing, any current franchising ordinance or franchise,
other agreement, license or permit that presently exists between the
city and an MCS provider.
A. In any case of an actual inconsistency between any provision or section
of this chapter, and any provision or section of a federal or state rule,
regulation or law, then the federal or state rule, regulation or law
(including any specific and applicable rule or regulation of the PSC)
shall not only supersede the effect of the chapter, but also control in any
local application, unless such federal or state rule, regulation or law
(including any specific and applicable rule or regulation of the PSC)
does not preempt, supersede or make invalid the inconsistency.
B. Subsection A of this section specifically includes any situation wherein
an applicable federal or state judicial decision creates an actual
inconsistency with any provision or section of this chapter. In such a
situation, the federal or state judicial decision shall not only supersede
the effect of the chapter, but also control in any local application, unless
such federal or state judicial decision does not preempt, supersede or
make invalid the inconsistency.
A. Where there is a conflict (actual or apparent) between this chapter and
a subsequent franchise, other agreement, license or permit, the chapter
shall control and prevail, unless judicially determined invalid,
unenforceable or unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction,
or unless the provisions of Subsection B of this section apply to the MCS
provider and its franchise, other agreement, license or permit.
B. Where a franchised MCS provider receives an exemption, relief or
clarification from one or more provisions or sections of this chapter, or
has one or more of its policies deemed comparable to a provision
contained in this chapter, the franchise, other agreement, license or
permit shall specifically note such exemption, relief, clarification or
comparable policy. As a result, to the extent that such an exemption,
relief, clarification or comparable policy is both contained in a
franchise, other agreement, license or permit, and is inconsistent with a
provision contained in this chapter, then the specifically noted
exemption, relief, clarification or comparable policy language contained
in the franchise, other agreement, license or permit shall control, but
only to the extent noted in the franchise, other agreement, license or
permit.

§ 227-14. Penalties for offenses; assessed charges or fines.
§ 227-15. Effect of technical violation of chapter or franchise
agreement.
Notwithstanding the provisions contained in § 227-14 of this chapter, an
MCS provider shall not be subject to penalties, fines, forfeitures or (where
applicable) revocation of a franchise, other agreement, license or permit
for a so-called "technical" violation of this chapter or (where applicable)
a technical breach of a franchise, other agreement, license or permit.
For purposes of this chapter, technical violations or breaches include the
following:
C. Notwithstanding Subsection B of this section, any grant of exemption,
relief, clarification or comparable policy shall be for the sole benefit of
the owner and operator of the multichannel system as of the date of the
grant of exemption, relief, clarification or comparable policy.
Specifically, such grant shall not be automatically transferred along
with any approved transfer or change in ownership or change in control
of a franchise, other agreement, license or permit. Any transfer of
exemption, relief, clarification or comparable policy shall always
require a separate act of approval by City Council.
A. To the extent permitted by state and local law, including applicable
provisions of the PSC regulations, the City Council reserves the
authority to institute a penalties schedule for violations of this chapter.
Where appropriate and/or applicable, violations of this chapter shall be
handled in the manner prescribed by either local or state law, including
any applicable provision of the PSC.
B. In instances where fines are applicable for a breach or violation of this
chapter or a franchise, other agreement, license or permit, as set forth
in the section of this chapter entitled "Fines," then such assessed fines
shall operate as a separate and independent remedy for the city.
C. Notwithstanding the other provisions in this section, an MCS provider
shall not be subject to such provisions in instances of force majeure (as
outlined elsewhere in this chapter), and/or for a technical violation of
the chapter, or where applicable, a technical breach of a franchise,
other agreement, license or permit (as outlined in this chapter).
D. Notwithstanding the other provisions in this section, a franchised MCS
provider shall be subject to possible default and/or revocation for cause
as set forth in this chapter.
A. Instances, or in matters, where a violation of this chapter or, where
applicable, a franchise, other agreement, license or permit by an MCS
provider was a good faith error that resulted in no or diminimus
negative impact on the residents or subscribers within the city or on the
city itself; or

§ 227-18. Indemnity.
B. Instances or circumstances that existed and were reasonably beyond
the control of an MCS provider, including force majeure situations, and
prevented an MCS provider from complying with this chapter, or where
applicable the franchise, other agreement, license or permit.
A. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this chapter, an MCS provider
shall not be held in violation, integral or material breach, default or
noncompliance of this chapter or a franchise, other agreement, license
or permit, nor suffer any enforcement or penalty relating thereto,
including, where applicable, termination, cancellation or revocation of
a franchise, other agreement, license or permit and/or license, where
such violation, breach, default or noncompliance occurred and/or was
caused by a natural disaster such as an earthquake, flood, tidal wave,
hurricane or similar devastating act of nature, or any other event that is
reasonably beyond an MCS provider's ability to anticipate and control
that is of a devastating nature or effect. Force majeure also covers
strikes, riots, wars and armed insurrections, as well as work delays
caused by waiting for utility providers to service or monitor their own
utility poles on which an MCS provider's cable and/or equipment is
attached.
B. Notwithstanding Subsection A of this section and even in the case of a
force majeure situation, a customer or subscriber may be entitled to a
refund or credit if the customer or subscriber sustains a multichannel
service outage for a period of time that is in excess of those permitted
under the provisions of this chapter.
A. Both the City Council and each MCS provider shall provide the other
party with the name and address of the contact designated to receive
notices, filings, reports, records, documents and other correspondence.
All notices shall be delivered to each party's contact by certified mail,
return receipt requested, personal service with a signed receipt of
delivery or overnight with receipt verification. All other filings, reports,
records, documents and other correspondence may be delivered by any
permissible means, including, but not limited to, facsimile transmission
("faxing"), personal service, overnight mail or package delivery, so long
as proof of delivery is obtained. The delivery of all notices, reports,
records and other correspondence shall be deemed to have occurred at
the time of receipt, unless otherwise designated by state law.
B. If the MCS provider is required to maintain a franchise, other
agreement, license or permit, then the designation of such contact
person for notice and notification purposes may be contained within a
franchise, other agreement, license or permit.
§ 227-15 GENEVA CODE § 227-18

§ 227-19. Liability insurance.
A. To the extent permitted by federal and/or state law, including any
applicable provisions of the PSC, an MCS provider shall at all times
defend, indemnify, protect, save harmless and exempt the city, the City
Council, the Manager, their officers, agents, servants and employees
from any and all penalty, damage or charges arising out of claims, suits,
demands, causes of action or award of damages, whether compensatory
or punitive, or expenses arising therefrom, either at law or in equity,
which might be claimed now or in the future, which may arise out of, or
be caused by, the construction, erection, location, products
performance, operation, maintenance, repair, installation, replacement,
removal or restoration of the multichannel system within the city by a
negligent act or omission of an MCS provider, its agents or employees,
contractors, subcontractors, independent contractors or implied or
authorized representatives. With respect to the penalties, fines or
charges referenced herein, reasonable attorneys' fees, consultants' fees
and expert witness fees are included as those costs which may be
recovered by the city.
B. The city, the City Council and the Manager specifically reserve the right
to retain counsel of their own choice, at their own expense.
C. If an MCS provider obtains counsel for the city, the City Council and/or
the Manager, then any one of them shall have the right to approve
counsel. However, neither the city, the City Council nor the Manager
shall unreasonably withhold its approval of counsel.
D. With respect to an MCS provider's own defense of such actions noted in
this section, it is understood that such MCS provider reserves the right
to select and retain, without the city, the City Council or Manager's
approval, counsel of the MCS provider's choice, at such MCS provider's
expense.
A. An MCS provider shall secure and maintain, for as long as it provides
multichannel service to subscribers, public liability, property damage
insurance and umbrella coverage in at least the following amounts:
(1) Public liability: $1,000,000 per person/per occurrence.
(2) Property damage: $1,000,000 per any one claim.
(3) Umbrella liability: $3,000,000.
B. An MCS provider's public and personal liability and property damage
insurance policy shall specifically include the city, the City Council and
the Manager as additional named insureds.
C. The public and personal liability and property damage insurance policy
shall be issued by an agent or representative of an insurance company
licensed to do business in the state, and which has one of the three
highest or best ratings from the Alfred M. Best Company.

227:223
§ 227-20. Performance and construction/completion bonds.
D. The public liability and property damage insurance policy shall contain
an endorsement obligating the insurance company to furnish the City
Council with at least 30 days' written notice in advance of the
cancellation of the insurance.
E. Renewal or replacement policies or certificates shall be delivered to the
City Council at least 15 days before the expiration of the insurance
which such policies are to renew or replace.
F. Before an MCS provider provides multichannel service to subscribers,
the MCS provider shall deliver the policies or certificates representing
the insurance to the City Council, and each policy or certificate
delivered shall be accompanied by evidence of payment of the full
premium thereon.
G. If the state permits an MCS provider to self-insure, then the MCS
provider may exercise its right to self-insure, so as long as the minimum
amounts of insurance coverage outlined in this section are met and
maintained for the entire period that the affected MCS provider is selfinsured
and the MCS provider can demonstrate to the satisfaction of
the City Council that it has the reasonable financial ability to pay up to
the maximum amount per category.
A. An MCS provider shall furnish to the City Clerk a performance bond or
security bond executed by a surety licensed to do business in this state
in an amount totaling at least $25,000. The purpose of the performance
bond is to ensure performance of any requirements required by and
under this chapter on an MCS provider, or imposed on an MCS provider
by virtue of its franchise, other agreement, license or permit. Further,
the purpose is to guarantee that should the MCS provider not fulfill any
obligations imposed by this chapter, or where applicable, a franchise
other agreement, license or permit, then the surety will make whole any
monetary losses or damages incurred by the city, up to the monetary
limits of the bond or other security. If the city draws on a performance
bond or cash deposit as a result of an MCS provider's failure to timely
discharge its obligations, then the MCS provider shall be required to
replenish the performance bond or security to the minimal level
required by the City Council within 30 days.
B. In addition to the performance bond referenced in Subsection A of this
section, an MCS provider shall furnish to the city a construction/
completion bond prior to the time it commences any construction,
upgrade, rebuild or repair/maintenance project that has a capital
construction cost or outlay exceeding $100,000 in value. The amount of
the bond shall equal at least 75% of the projected capital construction
cost or outlay.
C. The construction/completion bond or security bond shall specifically
guarantee that an MCS provider will timely abide by its construction,

upgrade, rebuild or repair/maintenance schedule for the multichannel
system and/or any timetable for technical and service improvements or
additions to the multichannel system as may be committed to, or agreed
upon, from time to time, by the City Council and MCS provider.
D. If the City Council draws on a performance or completion bond or cash
deposit as a result of an MCS provider's failure to timely discharge its
obligations, or failure to construct and activate the multichannel
system, or failure to complete a multichannel system upgrade or rebuild
or repair or maintain the system as required, then the MCS provider
shall be required to replenish the completion and performance bond or
security bond to the minimum level required by the City Council within
30 days.
E. The performance bond or security bond shall be in force at all times,
unless relief is granted or a reduction schedule is detailed in a separate
agreement, executed between the MCS provider and the City Council.
F. In lieu of a performance bond and/or a construction/completion bond,
the City Council may accept a written guarantee of an MCS provider
pledging the full faith and credit of the affected MCS provider should
there be a breach in a material franchise, other agreement, license or
permit term, or failure to meet any construction schedule.
A. Notwithstanding the insurance and bonding requirement contained
elsewhere in this chapter, an MCS provider shall obtain and maintain
any other types of insurance and bonds, including but not limited to
workers' compensation insurance and automobile liability insurance,
that are mandated by either federal or state law, including any
applicable provision of the PSC.
B. Where applicable and required such MCS providers shall maintain such
insurance and/or bonds in at least the minimal amounts, and according
to the minimal terms and provisions mandated by either the federal or
state law, including any applicable provision of the PSC.
A. To the extent required by federal and/or state law, including any
applicable rule or regulation of the PSC, an MCS provider must
maintain open records and reports that are subject to public inspection
by:
(1) Persons who are not customers or subscribers of the multichannel
system.
(2) Customers or subscribers of the multichannel system.
(3) The City Council or other city officials, or the designee of such.
§ 227-20 MULTICHANNEL SERVICE PROVIDERS § 227-22
227:225
§ 227-23. Retention and submission of reports and records.
B. Though not exhaustive, an MCS provider shall maintain a public
inspection file which includes, among other records:
(1) Ownership records.
(2) (Where applicable) a list of broadcast stations that are carried on
the multichannel system as a result of federally imposed must carry
requirements.
(3) Commercial records for children's programming.
(4) Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) data.
(5) Testing data and records, pursuant to the FCC's rules.
(6) Any records or information required by the PSC.
C. Moreover, though not required by federal law, and if not prohibited by
state law, including any applicable rule or regulation of the PSC, the
City Council nevertheless requires as a matter of public policy that the
MCS provider maintain the following additional records in its public
inspection file:
(1) A current rate card detailing both rates for cable services and
charges for installation, remotes, converters and the like, plus any
administrative or charges or fees.
(2) A copy of the current complaint resolution policy.
(3) A copy of the current disconnection policy, including both voluntary
and involuntary disconnections.
(4) A copy of the current policy regarding the issuance of credits or
rebates for loss of service.
(5) A copy of the current policy regarding the handling, and return, of
subscriber deposits.
A. Notwithstanding any requirements contained elsewhere in this chapter,
an MCS provider shall maintain and retain such records and reports as
are necessary for the city to determine compliance with the obligations
imposed on it by this chapter, and to determine the MCS provider's
legal, technical, financial and character qualifications.
B. On or before January 1 of each year after the effective date of this
chapter, an MCS provider shall submit to the City Council a list of files,
reports, records, data or other information that the MCS provider
periodically, customarily and/or regularly files with the FCC, or another
federal or state agency. For any other report that an MCS provider files
with any other federal or state agency, and that has a direct impact on
the operation of the MCS provider's multichannel system, then the MCS
§ 227-22 GENEVA CODE § 227-23
227:226
provider shall notify the City Council of such filing within 15 days of
said filing.
C. Said notice shall inform the City Council of the nature and scope of the
filing, as well as the recipient of the filing (i.e., the name, address,
department, division and phone number of the recipient).
D. As part of any performance or compliance evaluation, or for any
legitimate matter related to the administration and enforcement of an
MCS provider franchise, agreement, license or permit, the City Council
may specifically request and require that it be provided with any or all
listed reports, records, data or other information that were originally
filed with the FCC, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or
any other federal or state agency. However, unless specifically
authorized by the state, an MCS provider shall not be required to
provide the City Council with any state or federal tax returns, or any
documents (inclusive of all above-referenced categories) that are
exempted under state or federal privacy laws, including any applicable
provision of the PSC, and Section 631 of the Cable Act (codified at 47
USC 551).
E. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding Subsection
D, the city reserves the right to require, as deemed necessary for the
administration and enforcement of this chapter, or a franchise, other
agreement, license or permit, that a franchisee or other MCS provider
provide the city with copies of all applications, reports, documents,
correspondence, pleadings and petitions of any kind whatsoever that
relate to or have an effect on the system, the franchisee or the
franchising authority that are submitted by or on behalf of the
franchisee or other MCS provider, to the FCC or any other federal or
state regulatory agencies or courts having jurisdiction with respect to
any matters that affect the construction, operation or regulation of a
cable television system or other multichannel service system, or that
affect the services provided by such a system, where such addresses
issues which affect the operation of the franchisee's or other MCS
provider's system within the city. Said information shall be provided in a
timely and expeditious manner, as may be required by this chapter or a
franchise agreement or other agreement, license or permit, or lawful
operating authority.
F. Copies of such responses, decisions or any other communications from
the regulatory agencies or courts to a franchisee or other MCS provider
or its agent, including franchisee's or other MCS provider's corporate
parent, attorney or consultants, relative to its multichannel system in
the city, or the operation of the system within the city, shall likewise be
filed with the city immediately on the filing or receipt of such, but in no
case later than 30 days after the filing or receipt.
G. In addition to the requirements noted in the preceding subsections of
this section, an MCS provider shall timely submit those reports,

true and complete copies of any records needed for the diligent
administration and enforcement of this chapter and/or the franchise,
other agreement, license or permit on three days' written notice and
request, unless the retention of such records is specifically exempted by
the City Council, or the time for review of such records is extended by
the city.
C. The city shall have the right to hire, at its own expense, an independent
certified public accountant, or other business or financial expert, to
review the books and records of an MCS provider. If, after a financial
audit, it is determined that the MCS provider has underpaid amounts
owed to the city by any amount, then the city may require the MCS
provider to reimburse the city for the actual cost of the audit. Absent
fraud, any such audit by an independent certified public accountant
shall be binding on all parties concerned.

§ 227-25. Applicability of state consumer sales practices laws.17
In addition to any and all requirements of this chapter, each and every MCS

§ 227-26. Billing practices.18
D. A false entry into the books and/or records of an MCS provider, made by
an MCS provider or any employee or contractor of the MCS provider, of
a material fact or amount, shall constitute a material violation of this
chapter and, at the discretion of City Council, subject the MCS provider
to termination and revocation of its franchise, other agreement, license
or permit, and any and all damages and penalties, both civil and
criminal, as permitted under law. However, an erroneous entry, made in

E. An MCS provider shall keep at the local office complete and accurate
books and records of the key aspects of the multichannel system's
operation for at least the preceding three years in such a manner that

operation of the system, including financial matters. Notwithstanding
the preceding, no MCS provider shall be required to provide
information that is by law specifically deemed confidential or
proprietary.
F. To the extent permitted by applicable state and federal law, the city
shall not use any information provided by an MCS provider in a manner

another MCS provider, or that would reasonably be deemed place the
provider at a competitive disadvantage.

after the effective date of such changes, until the cancellation or
reduction of service, shall be determined in accordance with the rates

§ 227-28. Subscriber deposits.
B. Unless preempted by PSC rules, force majeure situations do not relieve
an MCS provider from providing credits or refunds for service outages
that exceed the standards set forth in this chapter.
C. In the case of a charge for unsolicited service to the extent permitted by
PSC rules, an MCS provider shall provide a subscriber with an
adjustment or billing credit on the next available monthly bill or
periodic invoice for service. Moreover, in such a case, an MCS provider
shall not consider a subscriber delinquent for failure to pay for any
unsolicited service.
A. A franchisee or other MCS provider may require refundable deposits in
circumstances consistent with reasonable business practices and
applicable state law, including where such deposits are necessary to
protect equipment or to ensure payment where there is reasonable
evidence of a risk of nonpayment.
B. Upon termination of service for any reason, subscribers will be entitled
to receive a refund of any deposit within 30 days of the termination or
cancellation of service, subject to:
(1) An offset or credit for all outstanding obligations of the subscriber
to the franchisee or other MCS provider, including outstanding
service charges.
(2) Return of all equipment provided by the franchisee or other MCS
provider in connection with the services received by the subscriber
in suitable condition, normal wear and tear excepted.
C. A franchisee or other MCS provider that collects deposits shall place all
deposits in a separate account and shall account for the collective
amounts of deposits separately. At no time shall there be a comingling
or mixing of deposit money with any other money received.
D. If the account for deposits is an interest-bearing account, all interest
earned shall be paid to the subscriber either annually or upon
termination of service, whichever occurs earlier.
E. In no circumstances shall an MCS provider be permitted to use any
deposits for working capital, or allow any deposits to be used for
working capital, or for any purpose whatsoever other than for the
intended purpose of serving as security against loss of amounts owed or
loss or unreasonable damage to equipment belonging to the franchisee
or other MCS provider.
F. All deposits for equipment shall be returned, with interest if applicable
under this chapter, within 30 days of the cancellation or termination of
service, provided the equipment is returned in good working order,
normal wear and tear excepted.

§ 227-29. Policy with respect to billing disputes and/or contested
charges.20
G. All deposits intended to secure payment for service shall be returned
within 30 days of the cancellation or termination of service, provided
there is no outstanding amount owed to the MCS provider.
H. Failure to meet the requirements of this section may result in the
imposition of fines in an amount set forth in the section titled "Fines."
A. In those instances in which a subscriber contests the actual amount of a
bill for service or other charges, or a periodic invoice for such, or the
imposition of charge for a particular multichannel service or technical
service request, such as installation or upgrade of service, or the
amount of an administrative fee and/or late charge, such subscriber
shall make the MCS provider aware (either in writing, or by verified
verbal communication) of such contested amount prior to the
multichannel service being disconnected.
B. No subscriber shall have service disconnected, and no MCS provider
shall disconnect such service, during the period in which the contest of
a rate or charge is unresolved. However, if the matter is resolved in
favor of the MCS provider, the MCS provider may immediately
disconnect the service if the subscriber has not paid the amount owed.
C. An MCS provider shall not consider a subscriber delinquent for failure
to pay a charge for unsolicited service during the period the amount or
charge is contested.
D. In light of the provisions contained in this section, an MCS provider
shall make available an escrow account for subscribers with billing
disputes and shall place all contested amounts in said escrow account.
E. In those instances where a subscriber has notified an MCS provider of a
particular billing dispute, the subscriber may deposit, or request that
MCS provider deposit or place the full amount contested into the
escrow account set forth in the preceding subsection until the matter is
either administratively or judicially resolved. In cases of multiple billing
disputes, then the subscriber must deposit the full amount of each
contested charge into an MCS provider escrow account, or request that
the MCS provider do so.
F. Where, prior to disconnection, a subscriber deposits the full amount of
the contested charge into an MCS provider escrow account, the MCS
provider may not then disconnect the subscriber during the pendency
of the billing dispute. Moreover, after the subscriber deposits the full
amount of the contested charge into the escrow account, the subscriber
shall not be liable for any further administrative fees and/or late
charges that could be connected with the particular contested charge in
20.See § 227-6A for purpose of asterisk.

equipment.21
question until the matter is resolved and then only if the matter is
resolved in favor of the MCS provider.
G. Where the subscriber preserves his or her right to continued service by
placing the full amount of the contested charge in an escrow account,
the subscriber may thereafter subscribe to additional multichannel
services, such as premium or pay-per-view events, so long as the
subscriber adheres to any and all MCS provider-imposed rules, so long
as such rules are applicable to subscribers in general.
H. Upon formal resolution of the billing dispute, the money in the escrow
account, together with interest, if applicable, shall promptly be
distributed to the individual parties in the amount noted by any
settlement agreement, or administrative or judicial order or finding.
I. These above-described provisions shall be in addition and supplemental
to any provisions contained in the MCS provider's complaint/inquiry
resolution policy.
A. In order to facilitate the needs of the local customers or subscribers, an
MCS provider subject to the provisions of this section shall maintain a
customer or subscriber service office which is:
(1) Located within the corporate boundaries of the city, or no further
than two miles outside the city limits.
(2) Accessible to the physically and ambulatory-impaired.
(3) Adequately staffed during business hours to handle both the walkin
and telephonic traffic of customers or subscribers.
B. The local service office shall be open at least 40 hours per week,
exclusive of holidays.

an MCS provider subject to the provisions of this section shall be
required to provide staffed office hours either two evenings a week until
7:00 p.m., or four hours on Saturday, if not prohibited by rule or
regulation of the PSC. No MCS provider shall be required to keep the
office open and staffed both on evenings and on Saturday.
D. The local service office shall have an adequate staff that is trained and
knowledgeable in order to handle the vast majority of customer or
subscriber inquiries, specifically including, but not limited to: billing
inquiries, refunds, credit, service outages, equipment service and
repair, payment of bills and other charges, and inquiries from disabled
or physically-impaired customer or subscribers.

E. An MCS provider subject to the provisions of this section may install, at
the local service office, an after hours depository in order to collect
invoice payments, and receive written requests for service
appointments, including installations, connections, disconnections and
complaints after scheduled office hours.
F. An MCS provider subject to the provisions of this section may install an
automated (audio or video) customer or subscriber assistance device
which can handle various types of customer or subscriber inquiries, so
long as the caller has the option and ability to speak with a live
representative of the MCS provider at all times during which the office
is, or is required to be open and staffed.
G. Where not prohibited by the PSC, an MCS provider subject to the
provisions of this section may install an interactive customer or
subscriber assistance device or contract service which is capable of
handling various types of customer or subscriber inquiries.
H. If permitted by the PSC, an MCS provider subject to the provisions of
this section may contract with another business or commercial
establishment for the sole or primary purpose of collecting subscriber
payments and distributing MCS provider permissible, and where
applicable authorized, promotional, billing and/or subscriber
information and literature.
I. An MCS provider subject to the provisions of this section shall maintain
at least one tollfree and/or local telephone number to accommodate
both normal business inquiries, including requests for installation of
service and changes in levels or categories or types of service, to
facilitate calls concerning the repair of equipment, service outages and
the extended interruption of service. During any hours that the
customer or subscriber service office is open, the MCS provider must
have, or make available, in-house personnel to address a customer or
subscriber's inquiries. During other hours, a telephone may be manned
by an automatic answering device, provided that the use of an
answering device or answering service results in an initial phone
response by the MCS provider within 90 minutes of the receipt of the
call, in order to at least determine the extent of the outage, interruption
or other customer or subscriber-related concern.
J. An MCS provider subject to the provisions of this section shall have
adequate staff and/or extension lines (except during special marketing
promotion periods, peak billing cycles, and service outages) in order to
handle all calls and inquiries directed to the general information
number, in accordance with this chapter.
K. An MCS provider subject to the provisions of this section shall at all
times have sufficient technical and repair staff to operate and maintain
the system in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, including
the provisions regarding the repair and restoration of service, as well as
all applicable state and federal rules and regulations.

§ 227-31. Preferential or discriminatory practices prohibited.22
§ 227-32. Restoration of a subscriber's property.23
L. An MCS provider subject to the provisions of this section shall at all
times have sufficient repair equipment and replacement parts to repair
and restore service in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
A. An MCS provider shall not, as to rules, regulations, rates, charges,
provision of service or use of an MCS provider's facilities and
equipment, make, allow or grant any undue preference or advantage to
any person, nor subject any person to prejudice or disadvantage, on the
basis of age, race, creed, color, sex, national origin, handicap, religious
affiliation or location of residence.
B. Consistent with Section 621(a)(3) of the Cable Act [codified at 47 USC
541(a)(3)], MCS providers classified as cable operators shall not deny
cable service, or the extension of cable service, to any group of
potential residential cable subscribers based on the income of the
residents of the local area in which such group resides.
C. Subsection A of this section does not prohibit an MCS provider from
denying service based on the location of residence, if that residence is
outside the parameters for line extension as may be detailed in a
franchise, other agreement, license or permit (if applicable).
D. Subsection A of this section also does not prohibit an MCS provider
from denying service to a subscriber who is delinquent in the payment
of any periodic service, or special service bill, so long as the
requirements for billing disputes and disconnection have been satisfied
in accordance with this chapter.
E. Subsection A of this section also does not prohibit an MCS provider
from making agreements or entering into multichannel service
agreements with multiple dwelling unit owners (including hotel, motel
and mobile park owners) to provide multichannel service under a bulk
billing or other type of arrangement, subject to applicable federal and
state law and rule.
A. If at any time an MCS provider, in furtherance of its right to construct,
operate and maintain a multichannel system, shall disturb the yard,
residence or other real or personal property of a subscriber, such MCS
provider shall ensure that the subscriber's yard, residence or other
personal property is returned, replaced and/or restored to a condition
comparable to that which existed prior to the commencement of the
work.

227:235
§ 227-33. Service inquiries, requests, complaints and response
times.24
B. The costs associated with both the disturbance and the return,
replacement and/or restoration shall be borne by the MCS provider.
This subsection also requires the MCS provider to reimburse a
subscriber or private property owner for any actual physical damage
caused by an MCS provider, its subcontractor or its independent
contractor, in connection with the disturbance of a subscriber or private
property owner's property.
A. Except in cases of force majeure, or an appointment scheduled with the
mutual consent of a subscriber, an MCS provider classified as a cable
operator, and any MCS provider not exempted from compliance with
this section by federal law or rule, shall respond to the service inquiries,
requests and complaints of subscribers within such MCS provider's
normal business or service hours, and within the time schedules
detailed in Subsections D through G of this section. The MCS provider
shall be considered in compliance with this section if the standards of
service outlined in Subsections D through G are met or exceeded at
least 98% of the time as measured over any three consecutive calendar
months. Conversely, the MCS provider shall be considered in
noncompliance, except for force majeure situations or mutually agreed
upon scheduled appointments, if the standards of service outlined in
Subsections D through G of this section are not met or exceeded at least
98% of the time over any three consecutive calendar months.
B. For extenuating circumstances in which an MCS provider cannot meet
the response and service restoration requirements noted in Subsections
D through G of this section, such MCS provider shall comply with and
submit all documentation of progress towards restoration, as required
by the provisions of this chapter, and any applicable rules of the PSC.
C. Moreover, except in emergency situations, an MCS provider shall
inform the subscriber that there is a choice as to whether the service
call is scheduled for the morning (8:00 a.m. to 12:00 noon), afternoon
(12:00 noon to 4:00 p.m.), or evening (4:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. or later)
hours. If the service call has to be canceled or rescheduled by the MCS
provider, then the MCS provider shall make every effort to notify the
customer or subscriber as soon as possible prior to the date and time of
the appointment, and shall reschedule the service call for a time
convenient to the customer or subscriber, within the MCS provider's
normal working hours, and if desired by the subscriber, within 24 hours
of the canceled appointment, so long as the appointment is for a normal
workday.
D. In the case of a report or complaint of a loss of service, such being
defined as a "blank" or "no picture" situation on either the lowest level
of service or all levels of service, the MCS provider shall treat such
24.See § 227-6A for purpose of asterisk.
§ 227-32 GENEVA CODE § 227-33
227:236
§ 227-34. Payment delinquency; late charges; termination of
service.25
report as a top priority and respond before starting any other job or
function, except for a critical job that would jeopardize the functioning
of the remaining portion of the system. In no case shall the response be
later than six hours after the time the report or complaint is received,
so long as it is received during a normal workday and four hours prior
to the end of the workday. The MCS provider shall make its best effort
to restore service as quickly as is possible, but in no event later than
the soonest possible time, including when such a report or complaint
is received after normal working hours. In the event of an after hours
report or complaint of a loss of service from two or more subscribers
from within the same portion of the system within the city, the MCS
provider shall respond to and make its best effort to restore service
within two hours of the time the report or complaint was received, or
in extenuating circumstances, as quickly as is possible. At no time shall
an MCS provider's staff that responds to a report or complaint of a loss
of service leave the problem until service is restored, where it is found
that a loss of service has occurred.
E. In the case of a loss of service or a blank or no-picture situation of any
given level of subscription or billing or service (except for pay-per-view
events), an MCS provider shall respond to, and make repairs as are
necessary to return and restore the multichannel service within 24
hours from the time the MCS provider first received notification of the
service interruption blank or no-picture situation.
F. In the case of a signal or service interruption or a diminution of service
as defined in § 227-4 of this chapter, an MCS provider shall make its
best efforts to respond and remedy the problem the same day, but in no
case later than one working day from the time the MCS provider first
received notification of the signal or service interruption or diminution
of service.
G. In the case of a defective, improperly or nonoperating piece of
equipment, an MCS provider shall make its best efforts to respond and
remedy the problem the same day, but in no case shall the response be
later than one working day from the time the MCS provider first
received notification. Moreover, the MCS provider shall complete
repairs as are necessary to correct the problem within 36 hours from
the time the MCS provider first received notification of the defective,
improperly or nonoperating piece of equipment.
H. In the case of a dispute concerning the precise time that the MCS
provider received notification, or the precise circumstances
surrounding the MCS provider receiving notification, or whether
notification was received at all, the City Council reserves the right and
authority to dispositively settle such a dispute.
25.See § 227-6A for purpose of asterisk.
§ 227-33 MULTICHANNEL SERVICE PROVIDERS § 227-34
227:237
A. To the extent permitted by state law, including any applicable rule of
the PSC, a subscriber shall not be considered delinquent in payment
until at least the following have occurred:
(1) Thirty-five days have elapsed from the postmarked date of the bill
to the subscriber.
(2) Service for the first thirty-day period billed for has been delivered.
(3) Payment for said thirty-day period has not been received by an
MCS provider.
B. Before disconnection of a subscriber's multichannel service takes place,
either physically or electronically, the following must occur:
(1) The subscriber must in fact be delinquent in payment for
multichannel service as defined by this chapter; and
(2) At least 24 hours have elapsed after a separate written notice of
impending disconnection has been delivered upon the subscriber
or deposited at his or her residence; or
(3) At least 72 hours have elapsed after the mailing a separate written
notice of impending disconnection to the subscriber as determined
by the postmark; or
(4) At least 24 hours have elapsed after the subscriber has either
signed for or refused to accept a separate written notice of
impending disconnection.
C. The written notice of disconnection must expressly and clearly state:
(1) The amount that is owed by the subscriber to an MCS provider.
(2) The minimum amount required to be paid to avoid disconnection.
(3) The date and place where such payment must be made.
D. Disconnection of service must occur both on a normal service day and
within normal business hours of an MCS provider, unless the subscriber
is given the opportunity to pay the full amount of the past due account
in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
E. An MCS provider who physically retrieves its equipment from a
subscriber, including but not limited to converters, remote control units
and digital audio tuners, must do so within both a normal service day
and normal service hours of an MCS provider, unless otherwise agreed
to by the subscriber.
F. Where an MCS provider imposes an administrative fee for a payment
delinquency it shall nevertheless be treated as a late charge, and may
not be any more than the state or PSC allows for late charges, if the
state or PSC has a provision covering the maximum permitted late
charges. If the state or PSC is silent on such a late charge, then the
§ 227-34 GENEVA CODE § 227-34
227:238
§ 227-35. Voluntary disconnections, including requests for
downgrades.26
maximum permitted late charge and/or administrative fee shall be a
simple 12% of the payment delinquency.
G. To the extent permitted by state law, including any applicable PSC rule
or regulation, a subscriber shall not be considered delinquent in such
case where he or she has notified the MCS provider of a billing dispute
and/or contested charge prior to disconnection, and the subscriber has
allowed the full amount of the contested charge to be placed in an MCS
provider's escrow account by the MCS provider, or made the
appropriate deposit into the MCS provider's escrow account. Moreover,
if a late charge and/or administrative charge is assessed prior to
notification of the contested charge, or is in fact the contested charge,
then such late charge and/or administrative fee may not be greater than
the state permitted maximum, or a simple 12% if there is no stateimposed
or PSC-imposed maximum.
H. Receipt of a bad check or other negotiable instrument from a
subscriber, in response to a written notice of disconnection, does not
constitute payment, and the affected MCS provider need not give the
subscriber further notice prior to disconnecting multichannel service.
I. An MCS provider may add a reasonable connection charge to the
subscriber's bill if the applicable provisions of this chapter, and any
applicable PSC regulation, are followed.
J. Any refund due a subscriber after a disconnection pursuant to this
section shall be made within 60 days of the disconnection for
nonpayment.
A. At any time, a subscriber may request that a particular service, level of
service, service tier, menu-driven program or service, premium
channel, informational service, or the entire multichannel service be
disconnected with no penalty of any kind whatsoever.
B. Unless prohibited by the Cable Act or state law, including any
applicable rule or regulations of the PSC, a subscriber may request a
downgrade from a particular level of service to a lower or less
comprehensive or expensive level of service. To the extent that a
subscriber requests a downgrade from an MCS provider classified as a
cable operator, then such MCS provider shall follow the rules and
regulations of the PSC, so long as such are not inconsistent with
applicable federal law. In the event there are no PSC rules governing
such, there shall be no charge for downgrading disconnecting service,
unless the city's authority to enforce this subsection is preempted or
prohibited by federal law or rule.
26.See § 227-6A for purpose of asterisk.
§ 227-34 MULTICHANNEL SERVICE PROVIDERS § 227-35
227:239
§ 227-36. Nonprohibitive access policy.27
C. A subscriber's obligation to pay for any service for which he or she has
requested disconnection or a downgrade shall cease within 72 hours
from the date of the request.
D. For a service, level of service, service tier, a la carte or menu-driven
service, premium channel, informational service or other
communications service which is voluntarily disconnected, a subscriber
shall pay only a pro-rata share of the monthly rate for such service, level
of service, service tier, a la carte or menu-driven service, premium
channel, informational service or other communications service, for the
month in which the request was made, based upon the number of days
of that month prior to the request. In other words, the subscriber shall
not be required to pay for, nor shall he or she be billed for service, that
was delivered more than 72 hours after the date of the request.
E. If, however, an MCS provider's equipment is, or has been damaged by a
subscriber prior to such disconnection, then the MCS provider may
charge the subscriber the entire actual cost of such damage, but no
more than the actual replacement cost to the MCS provider, provided
that the MCS provider notifies the subscriber of the damage at the time
of the disconnection or downgrade. A subscriber shall not be required
to pay for equipment failure if the circumstances fall within the normal
wear and tear or acts of nature guidelines established in this chapter, or
if the procedures in this subsection are not followed.
F. Once a one-time airing of a program or event starts, such as a pay-perview
event, which was affirmatively ordered by the subscriber, but only
if it was affirmatively ordered, should the customer or subscriber then
request a cancellation, the MCS provider may collect the full advertised
or quoted rate.
G. Any refund due a subscriber after a voluntary disconnection and/or
downgrade shall be made within 60 days after such disconnection or
downgrade.
H. In no event will this section be viewed as abridging the rights and
remedies afforded the subscriber by the complaint/inquiry resolution
process outlined in this chapter.
A. Except for normal sales and sales retention efforts, no MCS provider
shall engage in any activity or practice which is designed to prohibit or
inhibit, or has the effect of inhibiting or prohibiting, a subscriber from:
(1) Switching from one MCS provider to another MCS provider;
(2) Disconnecting from one MCS provider in order to connect and
receive multichannel service from another MCS provider; or

§ 227-37. Specific state-imposed rules for MCS providers classified
as cable operators.
(3) Simultaneously receiving multichannel service from more than one
MCS provider.
B. No MCS provider shall engage in any activity or practice which has the
effect of acting as a penalty or disincentive for a subscriber:
(1) Switching from one MCS provider to another MCS provider;
(2) Disconnecting from one MCS provider in order to connect and
receive multichannel service from another MCS provider; or
(3) Simultaneously receiving multichannel service from more than one
MCS provider.
C. With respect to Subsection B of this section, the following practices are
prohibited, unless the MCS provider can justify the need, cost and/or
rationale to the city to the city's satisfaction:
(1) Consistent with the Cable Act and any PSC rules, disconnection
and/or downgrade charges that are in excess of the actual,
verifiable costs incurred by the affected MCS provider in
connection with the disconnection and/or downgrade;
(2) The imposition of a disconnection and/or downgrade charge or
premium that is unrelated to the actual, verifiable costs incurred by
the affected MCS provider in connection with the disconnection
and/or downgrade;
(3) The imposition on the subscriber by the affected MCS provider of a
discriminatory or punitive return charge for the return of
equipment beyond the actual replacement cost to that MCS
provider; or
(4) The requirement that a subscriber enter into a service contract
which imposes penalties or cost-prohibitive charges, if the contract
is canceled in order to receive service from another MCS provider.
A. Multichannel service providers shall be expected to comply with, and
abide by, any and all applicable state-imposed rules and regulations, as
well as any applicable rules and regulations of the PSC.
B. Though not exhaustive, MCS providers subject to this section shall
comply with, and abide by, the following:
(1) Provision of the drop and basic or the lowest level of service at no
cost to all city-owned and/or occupied buildings or offices as
requested by the city, any school or educational institution within
the MCS provider's service area in the city, provided that service is
available within a reasonable distance from the school or
institution requesting service, such being defined as not requiring

(3) Annual submission of the required annual notice that informs
subscribers of:
(a) Procedures needed to file or make a complaint and request
rebates, credits or refunds;
(b) Federally required subscriber privacy notification; and
(c) The address and phone number of the appropriate division or
department of the PSC; and
(4) Keeping a log or record, for two years, of all complaints received
regarding, but not limited to, the quality of service, rates,

other matters of subscriber dissatisfaction, including treatment by
subscribers.
A. The city is hereby granted the authority to do all things necessary and
permissible to supervise, inspect and regulate the construction,
operation and maintenance of multichannel systems, franchised or
otherwise, that are subject to this chapter in whole or in part, and to
implement procedures for the filing and resolution of complaints, unless
otherwise prohibited by federal or state law.
B. The responsibility for such supervision, inspection and regulation is
retained by the City Council, which is empowered, among other things,
to adjust, settle or compromise any controversy arising from the
operations of any franchisee or other MCS provider, either on behalf of
the city or any subscriber, in accordance with the best interests of the
public and the city; provided, however, that any person aggrieved by a
decision of the city may appeal the matter for hearing and a
determination, in accordance with this chapter.

traditionally used in normal landscaping and yard maintenance would
not damage the drop.
E. For existing multichannel systems, the provisions of Subsection C of
this section shall apply only at the time a scheduled upgrade or rebuild
of the MCS provider's multichannel system is actually commenced and
in progress. For newly served areas, the provisions of Subsection C of
this section shall apply at the time of initial construction and/or
installation.
F. For an MCS provider operating a multichannel system in the city at the
date of adoption of this chapter, the MCS provider shall be required to
bring all service drops into compliance with the requirements of this
section within 24 months from the date of adoption of this chapter.
G. In instances where either electrical or telephone utilities install wire or
cable aerially, the MCS provider may construct its multichannel system
aerially, unless otherwise required by state law; provided, however, that
all minimum separations between facilities as required by applicable
code, rule or regulation must at all times be complied with, and there
shall at no time be a conflict with or any contact between the MCS
provider's wires and cable or other equipment and facilities and those
of a utility.
§ 227-46 GENEVA CODE § 227-50
227:248
§ 227-51. Policy with respect to safety requirements.
A. In order to verify that an MCS provider constructs and maintains the
multichannel system in the manner required by this chapter, and
applicable state and federal rules and regulations, including all state
and federally required testing and inspection of the system, as well as
the required preventive maintenance program and safety-related
inspections required by this chapter, including any tests and
inspections required by the PSC, the city reserves the right to inspect
all facets of an MCS provider's construction, placement, operation and
maintenance of the system.
B. The city also reserves the right to require the delivery to the city, or its
designee, of any or all records and documents related to such tests and
inspections for purposes of review, as may be deemed necessary to
administer and enforce compliance with this chapter and any franchise,
other agreement, license or permit.
C. The city shall pay for all of its costs associated with such inspections or
reviews, except for those circumstances occasioned by an MCS
provider's refusal to provide the requested information necessary for
the administration and enforcement of this chapter and any franchise,
other agreement, license or permit, or that is occasioned by the failure
to construct, install, maintain, repair, rebuild or upgrade in the manner
specified and required by this chapter, or where applicable, a franchise,
other agreement, license or permit. In such instances, the MCS
provider shall pay for such costs incurred by the city that are caused by
the MCS provider's refusal or failure to supply necessary information,
or the failure to abide by the rules subsequent to city notices or
directives.
A. The city requires that any MCS provider's construction, operation and
maintenance of the multichannel system meet certain threshold safety
levels which are designed to protect the public and lessen the likelihood
of interruption of multichannel service.
B. Consequently, at a minimum, an MCS provider shall, at all times and
without exception, except for situations involving matters of force
majeure, comply with the following safety and safety-related
requirements:
(1) Emergency alert override activation in the manner set forth in this
chapter.

emergency; standby power.
(5) Comply with, and abide by, any and all construction, safety,
electrical, health and fire codes, as specified in this chapter or
other applicable city codes or ordinances.
A. In order that subscribers may be alerted in the event of an impending,
imminent or actual natural or other disaster or emergency, all MCS
providers shall ensure that the multichannel system providing
multichannel service to all, or any part, of the city is designed,
constructed and installed with the equipment that will permit an
authorized official or designee of the city to override the audio portion
of all channels, by touch-tone phone (or functional equivalent) from any
location.
B. In addition to any other requirements listed in this section, an MCS
provider shall:
(1) Designate a channel which will be used for disaster/emergency
broadcasts of both audio and video, though this channel need not
be solely used for emergency broadcasts, and may in fact be used
for any lawful purpose.
(2) Inform subscribers of the designated emergency channel on a
periodic basis, not less than once a day.
(3) Maintain all-channel video blanking capability to facilitate the
needs of hearing and sight-impaired customer or subscribers.

alert override system.
(6) Develop a plan, with the city's concurrence, to provide continuity of
multichannel service, and response to service calls, in the event of
an emergency.
C. As one method of providing continuity of multichannel services in the
event of a failure of commercial electrical power, for any reason
whatsoever, including but not limited to a natural or other disaster or
emergency, an MCS provider shall, unless exempted by the city, install
and diligently maintain automatically activated standby or backup
power to power all active line electronics (e.g., amplifiers) for at least
two hours and all trunk and feeder cable, and additionally install and
diligently maintain an automatically activated standby generator at all
headends, hubs and receive sites associated with the distribution of
cable service to, and throughout, the city that are owned or under the
control of the MCS provider or any affiliate or parent organization.

227:250
§ 227-53. Implementation of a preventative maintenance program.
A. It shall be the duty of an MCS provider to devise and implement a
preventative maintenance program for the multichannel system in
order to ensure that there is no material degradation of the operation or
performance of the multichannel system that would affect the citizens'
health, safety and welfare, or negatively affect the quality or reliability
of multichannel services provided throughout the city.
B. Before the MCS provider implements such a preventive maintenance
program, it shall provide a copy of such program to the city for its
review and approval. The city shall specifically have the right and
authority to establish the minimum acceptable standards for the
preventive maintenance program.
C. Although not exhaustive, the following areas and standards shall at a

D. Thirty days after each calendar quarter, an MCS provider subject to this
section shall notify the city of the preventive maintenance information
available for that calendar quarter, and that such information is
available for inspection, examination and review by the city.
A. The franchisee or other MCS provider shall at all times and without
exception conduct all of its construction, installation, repair and
maintenance activities in accordance with the fire and safety
regulations of the city, and all local, state and federal safety regulations,
and shall at all times, without limitation or exception, adhere to
regulations governing the security of facilities as promulgated by the
city.
B. The codes referred in the preceding subsection are standard and
customary to the multichannel service industry and include, but are not
limited to, electrical, construction, fire, safety, health, building and
zoning codes.
C. To provide for the maximum protection of the health and safety of
persons and property in the city, the intent of this section is to require
100% compliance with the National Electrical Safety Code (NESC) and
the National Electrical Code and other applicable electrical building
and fire codes, rules and regulations at all times, subject only to force
majeure exceptions. For clarifications, this is intended to mean that the
city adopts a policy of zero tolerance of safety-related violations
associated with any multichannel system in the city.
D. It shall be the responsibility and obligation of any franchisee or other
MCS provider to immediately by phone, and the next day in writing for
purposes of the city's records, report to the city any violation of safety
codes that are identified and are not able to be remedied, or are not

remedied, within 24 hours of their identification, so as enable the city
to take any needed precautions to alert or otherwise protect persons
and property in the city.
E. It shall further be the immediate and primary responsibility of the
affected or transgressing MCS provider to place appropriate and
effective warning signs and protective devices or barriers at the site of
any such safety violations that create an imminent danger or threat, as
in the reasonable determination of the city may be needed and directed
by the city.
F. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the section in this chapter
entitled "Fines," there shall be no fines or other penalty applied or
assessed against a franchisee or other MCS provider for safety-related
violations that are voluntarily and of its own accord and volition
reported to the city in accordance with the previous Subsection D,
provided that the first report of a situation not in compliance with this
section that the city receives is that of the franchisee or other service
provider whose facilities are not in compliance with the required safety
codes and this chapter.
A. This section is applicable to any lawfully operating, but unfranchised,
MCS provider that does not remit a franchise fee payment to the city. It
is also applicable to any MCS provider whose franchise has been ruled
unconstitutional, unenforceable or otherwise invalid by a court of
competent jurisdiction. Further, this section also is applicable to a
franchised MCS provider who has had its franchise fees ruled
unconstitutional, unenforceable or invalid by a court of competent
jurisdiction.
B. Where not specifically prohibited by federal or state law, and as an
alternative to and in lieu of the imposition of a franchise fee as set forth
in this chapter, the city may impose an alternative user charge and
require remittance of such by an affected MCS provider to help in
recouping the cost of administering, monitoring and enforcing
compliance with a franchise agreement, other agreement, license or
permit, and applicable law and regulation, and for the cost of the
maintenance of the public property and rights-of-way occupied by the
multichannel system.
C. The alternative user charge shall be based on the estimated cost of the
time of city staff required to administer, monitor and enforce
compliance by the MCS provider, and the cost of maintaining the public
property and rights-of-way occupied by the multichannel system.
However, in no event shall the alternative user charge exceed the
maximum amount that would have been permitted to be imposed as a
franchise fee for the payment and reporting period.
§ 227-54 GENEVA CODE § 227-55
227:254
§ 227-56. Franchise required; exception.
D. An alternative user charge is adopted in order to recover the cost
incurred by the city in administering, monitoring and enforcing the
MCS provider's compliance with the franchise or other agreement or
permit, and applicable law, rule, regulation and code, and the cost of
maintaining the public property and rights-of-way occupied by the
multichannel system. However, an affected MCS provider and the city
may agree to an alternative charge that is based on either a flat
percentage of gross revenue or a given dollar amount, so long as that
charge does not exceed the maximum amount that would have been
permitted to be imposed as a franchise fee for the payment and
reporting period at the time of the exercise of this option.
E. It is expressly understood that a franchise fee and an alternative user
charge will not be imposed on the same MCS provider at the same time,
for the same period, unless otherwise mutually agreed to.
F. Should the alternative user charge ever exceed the maximum amount
that would have been permitted to be imposed as a franchise fee, then
the alternative user charge shall be reduced to an amount not greater
than the maximum amount that would have been permitted to be
imposed as a franchise fee, and any overpayment shall promptly be
returned to the MCS provider upon request.
G. The alternative user charge assessed shall be payable to the city
quarterly on a calendar year basis.
H. In the event that the alternative user charge is based on a percentage of
revenue, to assist the city in determining the accuracy and
completeness of the alternative user charge payments, the MCS
provider shall file with the city a complete, detailed, accurate statement
of all realized revenues attributable to and occasioned by the operation
of the system and the grant of the franchise, or other agreement,
license or permit within the city, for the period for which the payment is
required, whether received by the franchisee or other MCS provider
directly, or any parent, affiliate or subsidiary. The statement shall be
certified by a certified public accountant or a qualified officer of the
MCS provider or its parent with respect to the statement's accuracy
and completeness.
I. The alternative user charge payment shall be made to the city not later
than 60 days after the end of each calendar year quarter.
J. The MCS provider shall also provide annually, within 90 days after the
end of the MCS provider's fiscal year, a report certified by a certified
public accountant or an officer of the MCS provider or its parent,
verifying all earned gross revenues.

under state law (including any applicable rule or regulation of the PSC),
or not required to do so under the Cable Act.
B. Consistent with the Cable Act, no franchise, other agreement, license or
permit shall be required for either the city, or any local or municipal
authority affiliated with the city, to own a multichannel system or
operate as an MCS provider in the city.
A. Consistent with Section 621(a)(1) of the Cable Act (codified at 47 USC
541), the City Council may award one or more nonexclusive
multichannel service franchises or other agreements, licenses or
permits within its geographical limits.
B. No franchise or other agreement, license or permit granting authority
to construct and operate a multichannel system shall be exclusive.
C. An MCS provider's application shall be evaluated and approved or
disapproved as part of a public proceeding and hearing which affords
due process to the city, the applicant and the public, and which is in
accordance with applicable federal or state laws, including any
applicable rules of the PSC.
D. Within 90 days after the effective date of a franchise or other
agreement, license or permit a franchisee or other MCS provider shall
proceed with due diligence and its best efforts to obtain, at its own
costs, all necessary permits, licenses and authorizations which are
required for the conduct of its business in the city, including, but not
limited to, any private easement agreements, any business licenses,
utility joint-use or attachment agreements, microwave carrier licenses,
and any other permits, licenses and authorizations needed to lawfully
operate a multichannel system within the city.
E. A franchisee or other MCS provider shall have in its possession such
permits, easements, agreements and licenses prior to the
commencement of its multichannel system operations.
A. An MCS provider subject to the city's franchising, licensing or
permitting authority may not lay or use any cable (whether coaxial,
fiber or a functional equivalent) until the franchise or other agreement,
license or permit is fully executed and is in effect, including approval by
the PSC as may be applicable.
§ 227-56 GENEVA CODE § 227-58
227:256
B. A franchise, other agreement, license or permit shall be sufficiently
detailed so to clearly delineate the rights, duties and obligations of the
parties concerned.
C. As permitted, and as may be applicable to a particular class or type of
MCS provider, a franchise, other agreement, license or permit shall, at
a minimum, contain and address the following matters, as well as any
requirements in accordance with Part 591 of the PSC's Rules, or other
rules of the PSC as may be applicable at any time:
(1) A detailed definition of "gross revenue" in order to determine what

or in the interest of the city and its residents, subject to applicable state
and federal law and rule.
A. Upon an award of a franchise, other agreement, license or permit, in
accordance with the terms of such franchise, other agreement, license
or permit, an MCS provider required to obtain a franchise, other
agreement, license or permit may construct, erect, install, maintain,
operate, maintain, repair, replace, remove or restore a multichannel
system within the geographical limits set forth in the franchise, other
agreement, license or permit.
B. The multichannel system may be located in, upon, along, across, over
and under the streets, rights-of-way, easements and public ways of the
city.
C. Any MCS provider shall be responsible for obtaining any required
easements for private property (including privately owned utility or
street light poles).
D. An MCS provider, through a separate pole or utility easement
agreement with an affected utility, may locate the multichannel system
on, or within, the property of such utility company. This provision
specifically includes, but is not limited to, MCS providers classified as
cable operators.
A. The term of an initial MCS franchise, other agreement, license or
permit shall be no more than 10 years from the date that a franchise,
other agreement, license or permit is approved by the City Council, and
is executed by an authorized individual of the city and the affected MCS
provider and is approved by the PSC, absent the demonstration of the
need for a longer term for financial reasons.
B. The term of a renewal franchise, other agreement, license or permit
shall be for a period not less than 3 1/2 years, nor more than as
permitted by the PSC, from the date that a franchise, other agreement,
license or permit renewal agreement is both approved by the City
Council, and executed by both the Manager and the affected MCS
provider, and is approved by the PSC. In the event the PSC does not
establish a maximum term for a renewal, such maximum term shall be
no more than 10 years, absent the demonstration of the need for a
longer term for financial reasons.
A. Any franchisee, or other MCS provider, shall make service available to
all residences, dwellings, businesses or establishments on all public
streets and roads throughout the city. There shall not at any time, after
§ 227-58 GENEVA CODE § 227-61
227:258
§ 227-62. Initial and renewal application for franchise; application
fee.
completion of the initial construction of the system, be any residence,
dwelling, business or establishment situated on or adjacent to any
public street or road that is not capable of receiving multichannel
service without the need for a line extension, as the term "line
extension" is defined in § 227-4 of this chapter. The primary test for
exception to the requirements of this section shall be a test of
commercial impracticability, as defined under the federal Uniform
Commercial Code.
B. If the city increases the required service area by adding or
incorporating additional land areas, through annexation or any other
lawful means, the franchisee or other MCS provider shall extend
multichannel service to the new locations within 180 days of a written
request from city, at no cost to the city.
C. Notwithstanding Subsection A of this section, the cost for any line
extensions, if permitted to be passed through to subscribers
incrementally, shall not be apportioned only to those subscribers served
by the instant line extension, but shall be apportioned among all
subscribers in the city.
D. Any applicant for an initial franchise, other agreement, license or
permit, or the renewal of such, shall submit to the city a plan to provide
service to all domiciles and businesses in the city as a part of the
application, request or proposal. Such plan shall be subject to the
approval of the city.
E. Further, while such approval may not unreasonably be withheld, any
plan for community-wide or universal service requiring more than one
year from the start of construction, rebuild or upgrade, or the request
for renewal of a franchise, other agreement, license or permit, must be
accompanied by a detailed explanation of the reasons for the needed
additional time, as well as a date specific by which service is proposed
to be available throughout the community.
A. For MCS providers classified as cable operators, the City Council shall
follow all applicable rules of the PSC with respect to the submission and
processing of initial and renewal applications for a franchise, other
agreement, license or permit.
B. For other MCS providers, the City Council may develop rules with
respect to the submission and processing of initial applications for a
franchise, other agreement, license or permit. Such rules and
regulations shall primarily be aimed at determining the legal, financial,
technical and character qualifications of the applicant for a franchise,
other agreement, license or permit, as well as other matters deemed of
importance that are not prohibited by applicable federal law.
§ 227-61 MULTICHANNEL SERVICE PROVIDERS § 227-62
227:259
§ 227-63. Franchise fees.
C. Unless prohibited by the state or the PSC, an applicant for an initial
franchise, other agreement, license or permit shall pay an initial
application fee which shall be no greater than the administrative and
consulting costs associated with analyzing, evaluating and processing
an initial application for a franchise, other agreement, license or
permit. The total application fee must be paid, unless waived by the City
Council.
D. The applicant shall submit to the city, simultaneously with the
application or request, a check in the amount of $15,000. If the cost of
analyzing, evaluating and processing the application is less than the
application fee the city shall return the unexpended amount. However,
if the cost of analyzing, evaluating and processing the application is
greater than the amount of the application fee, due to the actions, lack
of action or lack of cooperation of the applicant, the franchise, other
agreement, license or permit shall not be issued or granted until
reimbursement of all costs incurred by the city as a result of the
application are received.
E. In the event that the total actual cost of processing the application, in
accordance with Subsection C of this section, is less that $15,000, the
city shall promptly return any unused portion to the applicant upon
conclusion of the process.
A. Any MCS provider, specifically including but not necessarily limited to
any MCS provider classified as a cable operator, that is granted a
franchise, other agreement, license or permit, or a franchise renewal,
or renewal of an other agreement, license or permit, after the date this
chapter becomes effective shall, if permitted by federal law or rule, pay
to the city a sum equal to 5% of the annual gross revenue of such MCS
provider. Such amount is intended in part to compensate the city for the
MCS provider's private, profit-making use and occupancy of the public
property and rights-of-way and to recompense the city for the cost of
maintaining the public property and rights-of-way occupied by the
multichannel system.
B. The City Council recognizes that, with respect to MCS providers
classified as cable operators, those MCS providers may have to remit an
annual fee to the PSC. Therefore, to the extent that the remittance of
the PSC annual fee, when computed together with any franchise fee
paid by the MCS provider, or collected from other and remitted by the
MCS provider, or that is owed, is greater than 5% of the cable
operator's annual gross revenues, the payment of the PSC annual fee
shall be deducted from and credited as an offset against any franchise
fee actually paid to the city by the MCS provider, provided that the MCS
provider has not elected merely to collect the fee from others, including
subscribers, and remit the amount collected to the PSC.
§ 227-62 GENEVA CODE § 227-63
227:260
C. If the FCC, Congress or any other governmental entity with authority to
establish the maximum allowable franchise fee ever allows franchising
authorities to increase the franchise fee beyond 5% of gross revenue,
then the city shall have the authority to increase the franchise fee to the
maximum percentage and/or amount allowable.
D. An MCS provider subject to the collection and remittance of a franchise
fee, or its functional equivalent under an other agreement, a permit or a
license, shall, automatically and without further notification, pass
through to subscribers the amount of any decrease in the franchise fee
that is attributable to or calculated on subscriber revenues, in the next
monthly bill or periodic invoice, so that the bill or invoice reflects the
decrease in the franchise fee on subscriber revenues.
E. An MCS provider that is subject to the remittance of a franchise fee, or
its functional equivalent, shall file with the city, within 45 days after the
expiration of each of the MCS providers' fiscal quarters, a detailed
financial and revenue report and statement clearly showing the
franchise fee or functional equivalent due for the preceding quarter,
together with the basis of the calculations thereof. Such statement shall
be certified by a certified public accountant or officer of the MCS
provider attesting to the accuracy, completeness and veracity of the
revenue figures. Such report and statement shall be in the form and
format determined necessary by the City Council, or its designee, to
reasonably ascertain the accuracy and completeness of the total
remittance, as well as the accuracy and completeness of all types,
categories and sources of revenue, individually. Further, said report and
statement shall show all revenue from whatever source, that is directly
or indirectly derived from, or caused to be derived from, or that is
attributable to the operation of the multichannel system or the
provision of any service by or using the multichannel system. The
revenue shall, at least, be reported by service category, type and level,
individually, showing appropriate computations and individual and
incremental rates for all sources, levels, tiers, clusters and types of
service, and other revenue sources by kind and type.
F. Remittance of the quarterly portion of the franchise fee, or its
functional equivalent, shall be rendered to the city at the time the
financial and revenue statement is filed.
G. In the event that remittance is not made by the due date, then such
franchised MCS provider may be declared in default of the franchise,
other agreement, license or permit, and should the amount owed
remain unremitted for an additional 60 days after the date of
notification of nonremittance or late remittance, then the franchise,
other agreement, license or permit may be revoked, terminated or
canceled as noted elsewhere in this chapter.
H. The city reserves the right to audit a franchised MCS provider's books,
if the City Council deems it necessary. If such audit discovers an underremittance
of the franchise fee or its functional equivalent of greater
§ 227-63 MULTICHANNEL SERVICE PROVIDERS § 227-63
227:261
than 2% of the actual amount owed, then the MCS provider shall
reimburse the city for the cost of such audit, unless such cost is waived
by the City Council. It is specifically understood that the right of audit
and recomputation of any, and all, amounts remitted under a franchise,
other agreement, license or permit fee shall always be accorded to the
City Council.
I. If an audit, or other research, discovers that the franchise fee or its
functional equivalent has been either under-remitted or not remitted
for a period exceeding six months from the original due date
notwithstanding Subsection G of this section, then the City Council may
seek full recovery of the under-remitted or not remitted fees, plus
interest not to exceed 15% per year, or if greater than 15% the
maximum allowable under state law.
J. All annual reports due and pertaining to the remittance of the franchise
fee, or its functional equivalent, will be certified by an officer of the
MCS provider or its parent, and will be provided in the form, format and
detail applicable to quarterly reports under Subsection E of this
section. Such MCS provider shall maintain records used in the
preparation of said reports, to be produced in their totality upon
request or demand by the City Council.
K. No acceptance of any remittance shall be construed as a release of, or
an accord, or satisfaction of, any claim that the city might have for
further or additional sums payable under the terms of this chapter or a
franchise, other agreement, license or permit, or for any other
performance or obligation of a franchised MCS provider hereunder.
L. Payments of compensation made by a franchised MCS provider to the
city, or remittances of amounts collected, pursuant to the provisions of
this chapter, shall be considered in addition to, and exclusive of, any
and all authorized taxes, business license fees, other fees, other levies
or assessments presently in effect or subsequently adopted.
M. A franchise fee or its functional equivalent shall not include any items
excluded by Section 622(g)(2)(D) of the Cable Act [codified at 47 USC
542(g)(2)(D)].
N. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the authority of the
city to require the payment, or the collection and remittance, of a fee or
other assessment of any kind, on any person (other than a franchised
MCS provider, or an MCS provider operating under another form of
agreement or a license or permit) with respect to multichannel service
or other programming or communications service provided by such
person over a multichannel system, for which charges are assessed to
subscribers, but not received by a franchised MCS provider. For
purposes of illustration only, this subsection shall include the
situation(s) where a provider of a particular service directly bills a
subscriber, or the MCS provider acts as collection agent for a provider
of a particular service who directly bills a subscriber(s), or where a
§ 227-63 GENEVA CODE § 227-63
227:262
person leases a channel for commercial use and sells advertising or
goods on that channel, and receives the money directly or through a
third party.
O. For any twelve-month period, the fees paid by or remitted by any person
who provides any such multichannel service pursuant to Subsection N
of this section shall not exceed 5% of such person's gross revenue
derived in such period from the operation of the multichannel system in
the city, including the provision of service over the system, or such
higher percentage as may be authorized by the FCC, Congress or other
governmental entity with authority to increase the percentage or
amount of such fees.
P. If, at any time, the highest court of the nation or the highest court of the
state invalidates, voids or rules as unconstitutional or unenforceable
the concept of franchise fees, then the City Council may impose an
alternative user charge on the franchised MCS provider, as provided in
this chapter.
Q. In light of Subsection P of this section, in the event the applicable
provision of the franchise, other agreement, license or permit were to
be ruled unconstitutional or unenforceable, so that the city's source of
recompense for the cost of administering this chapter and any franchise
agreement, other agreement, license or permit, and the cost of
maintaining the public property and rights-of-way, and the right to
require fair and reasonable compensation for the private, profit-making
use and occupancy of the public property and rights-of-way may be
protected, the MCS operator providing service under a franchise, other
agreement, license or permit may be required to pay to the city a fee
using a different method and manner for the computation and collection
of the fee as provided for in this chapter.
R. Subject to federal law, and notwithstanding anything preceding in this
section, nothing shall limit the authority of the city to assess and impose
a franchise fee, or its functional equivalent, on any portion, category or
type of revenue, or to exempt any portion, category or type of revenue
from inclusion in the computational base used to calculate the franchise
fee or its functional equivalent, so long as such is done in a
nondiscriminatory and competitively neutral manner with respect to
competitive MCS providers in the city.
S. Notwithstanding anything in this section, in the event an MCS provider
does not pay the franchise fee itself, but instead, if permitted by federal
law or rule, chooses to pass the franchise fee through to subscribers,
incrementally and in addition to the amount owed for service, so that
the effect is that the franchise fee is paid by the subscribers and not the
MCS provider, and is merely collected and remitted by the MCS
provider, then in such an instance the MCS provider shall not be
permitted to deduct the franchise fee from what is owed for property
taxes, or any other taxes or money, due the city.
§ 227-63 MULTICHANNEL SERVICE PROVIDERS § 227-63
227:263
§ 227-64. Rent.
§ 227-65. Assignment, transfer or sale of franchise.
T. Pursuant to Section 253(c) of the 1996 Telecommunications Act, the
city deems it appropriate to reserve the right to assess, impose and
collect rent from an MCS provider occupying and using the publicly
owned and/or maintained rights-of-way and other city-owned and/or
maintained property, and to assess, impose and collect rent from a
franchisee or other MCS provider for the private, profit-making use of
the public property and rights-of-way in the city.
A. In the event franchise fees as historically assessed and calculated are at
any time deemed unconstitutional or otherwise unenforceable, and
unless specifically prohibited by federal or state law, the city reserves
the right to require payment of rent by an MCS provider for the private,
profit-making use of the public property and rights-of-way, subject to
any statutory limitations or requirements set by state or federal law.
B. As regards service providers of like or similar kinds or nature, the city
shall at all times assure that the imposition of rent is on a
nondiscriminatory and competitively neutral manner.
C. The amount of the rent shall be based upon and shall not exceed the fair
market value of the town's property and public rights-of-way, or that
portion of the town's property and public rights-of-way used and
occupied by the MCS provider, as determined by the town's Assessor, or
another qualified individual as may be designated by the city.
D. The assessment shall be based upon either the fair market value of like
or similar property adjacent to the town's property or public rights-ofway
that are used and occupied by that portion of the MCS provider's
system serving that portion of the city, or the average fair market value
of commercially zoned property within the city as determined by
ascertaining the average or mean value for the preceding three years,
whichever is less.
E. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this section, the city may
negotiate with an MCS provider for the in-kind provision of services or
other valuable consideration in lieu of all or a portion of the amount that
would otherwise be required to be paid as cash. However, the city is not
obligated to grant this option to any MCS provider, so long as it applies
this authority in a manner among like or similar service providers that
is nondiscriminatory and competitively neutral with respect to the value
received by the city.
A. There shall be no assignment of an MCS provider's franchise, other
agreement, license or permit in whole, or in part, without the prior
express written approval and consent of the City Council.
§ 227-63 GENEVA CODE § 227-65
227:264
§ 227-66. Default of franchise or other agreement; revocation,
termination or cancellation.
B. Any assignment without such prior written consent shall constitute a
default of such franchise, other agreement, license or permit, which
may, at the discretion and in the judgment of City Council, subject a
franchised MCS provider's franchise, other agreement, license or
permit to revocation.
C. An MCS provider classified as a cable operator shall have its franchise,
other agreement, license or permit assigned, transferred or sold only in
accordance with the Cable Act, FCC rules, state law and PSC rules and
regulations, as applicable.
D. For all MCS providers subject to this section, including those classified
as cable operators, the franchise, other agreement, license or permit
shall be assigned, transferred or sold only after the City Council
determines that the proposed transferee can meet all obligations
imposed by the existing franchise agreement, other agreement, license
or permit, and that there are no outstanding uncured violations of the
franchise, other agreement, license or permit, or of this chapter, and
that all money that is owed the city has been paid in full.
A. With respect to franchised MCS providers classified as cable operators,
or other MCS providers operating under another form of agreement, a
license or a permit, the City Council shall follow the rules and
procedures adopted by the state, including those of the PSC,
concerning the default, termination, revocation, alteration or
suspension of a cable franchise, or other agreement, license or permit,
in addition to the payment of fines and the imposition of penalties, if not
impermissible under applicable law. In the absence of such rules and
procedures by the state, including the PSC, MCS providers classified as
cable operators, or other MCS providers operating under another form
of agreement, a license or a permit, shall be subject to the rules and
procedures noted in Subsections C through L of this section.
B. For other franchised MCS providers, to the extent permitted by state
law, the City Council adopts the rules and procedures (noted in
Subsections C through L of this section) concerning the default,
revocation, termination or cancellation of an MCS franchise, other
agreement, license or permit.
C. When any event, act or omission on the part of an MCS provider occurs
which represents a violation of a provision of this chapter or its
franchise, other agreement, license or permit, or compromises the
corporate character, or legal, financial or technical ability, integrity
and/or stability of the multichannel system or the MCS provider to such
a degree that the interests of the customer or subscribers are
substantively affected in a negative manner, then such violation,
breach, event, act or omission shall be considered a material breach of
this chapter, or any franchise, other agreement, license or permit as
§ 227-65 MULTICHANNEL SERVICE PROVIDERS § 227-66
227:265
may be applicable. Under such circumstances, the city shall notify the
affected MCS provider, in writing, of the specific breach or violation,
and direct such MCS provider to remedy the breach or violation in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
(1) For illustrative purposes only, the violations, breaches, events, acts
and omissions include, but are not limited to: bankruptcy,
insolvency, failure to pay taxes or pay or remit franchise fees or the
functional equivalent (including an alternative user charge in lieu
of the franchise fee or its functional equivalent, if applicable),
failure to receive written City Council approval for an assignment
or transfer of the franchise, other agreement, license or permit, or
failure to abide by the terms and conditions of the franchise, other
agreement, license or permit, or the provisions of this chapter,
including those involving matters of customer service, consumer
protection and safety and safety-related requirements.
D. Where an MCS provider satisfactorily corrects any of the enumerated
conditions to the satisfaction of the city within 60 days, then the
procedure intended under this section shall cease, and in no event shall
the enumerated condition be weighed against such MCS provider in
any subsequent performance review under the terms of the franchise,
other agreement, license or permit. However, to protect the health and
safety of the public, at the discretion of City Council, violations of
safety-related requirements may be required to be corrected,
eliminated or otherwise cured in less than 60 days.
E. A copy of the notice of material breach shall be mailed to the surety on
the performance bond, unless otherwise directed by state law.
F. Within 75 days after such written notice is mailed to an MCS provider,
the City Council shall conduct a public hearing on the matter, unless
state law requires a different procedure, in which event the state
procedure shall control.
G. The City Council shall provide written notice to the affected MCS
provider, and to the surety, of the time and place of said public hearing
in a manner consistent with either state law or approved by the City
Council.
H. At the time of the hearing, the affected MCS provider may present
information on the current status of the alleged breach of the franchise,
other agreement, license or permit. If the situation has been resolved,
or steps are being taken to resolve the situation, then the franchised
MCS provider shall present the information at the hearing.
I. If the affected MCS provider fails to attend the hearing, and has not
requested a continuance of the hearing, then such MCS provider shall
be deemed to have waived its right to a further continuation of the
matter, and may be declared in default of the franchise, other
agreement, license or permit.
§ 227-66 GENEVA CODE § 227-66
227:266
§ 227-67. Performance evaluations.
J. After the public hearing, the City Council may determine the MCS
provider to be in compliance and dismiss the matter, or may determine
that the MCS provider has cured any noncompliance and thereby
dismiss the matter. However, the City Council may determine that a
chapter violation exists and remains uncured, or that a violation of the
franchise, other agreement, license or permit has been committed and
remains uncured. Consequently, upon a finding that the MCS provider
violated a material chapter provision, or failed to cure an outstanding
violation of this chapter or of the franchise, other agreement, license or
permit, the City Council may direct the affected franchised MCS
provider to take corrective action within a specified period of time, or
may declare such franchised MCS provider in default of the franchise,
other agreement, license or permit, and thereafter may revoke,
terminate or cancel the franchise, other agreement, license or permit,
unless the franchised MCS provider presents sufficient mitigating
circumstances.
K. If the City Council directs corrective action to take place within a
specified period of time or declares such franchised MCS provider in
default of the franchise, other agreement, license or permit, then that
declaration shall be reduced to writing, and the notice of corrective
action or default shall be mailed to such franchised MCS provider, and
surety, within 21 days of the City Council's action.
L. If within 60 days, the affected franchised MCS provider, or surety, does
not take significant action to rectify the breach, or submit a plan
detailing how the affected MCS provider will eliminate the breach,
including the proposed time frame for such cure, then the City Council
may revoke such MCS provider's franchise, other agreement, license or
permit, and shall notify the affected franchised MCS provider and
surety forthwith, unless there are mitigating circumstances.
A. The City Council reserves the right to design a performance evaluation
procedure which periodically monitors compliance of MCS providers
with the terms and conditions of both this chapter and any applicable
franchise, other agreement, license or permit. Moreover, the City
Council may periodically review and determine whether an MCS
provider's financial, technical, legal and character qualifications, and
its record of meeting community and subscriber needs, as particularly
relate, but are not limited, to matters of customer service practices,
continue to meet the needs of the community, and to determine if the
operational, maintenance and performance levels needed to ensure the
uninterrupted and acceptable provision of multichannel services are
adequate to meet the needs and reasonable desires of the community.
Such performance evaluations may be conducted at least every three
years during the term of any franchise, other agreement, license or
permit, or more frequently if deemed necessary and appropriate due to
§ 227-66 MULTICHANNEL SERVICE PROVIDERS § 227-67
227:267
§ 227-68. Rates and charges.
§ 227-69. Interconnection.
complaints or repeated or multiple violations of this chapter or the
franchise, other agreement, license or permit.
B. If, as a result of the evaluation, the City Council determines that the
franchised MCS provider has not complied with a provision of this
chapter, or its franchise, other agreement, license or permit, then the
City Council shall give the franchised MCS provider an opportunity
either to correct or remedy the area of noncompliance, or submit
documentation or supporting data that resolves or explains the area of
noncompliance to the satisfaction of the city.
C. If the franchised MCS provider fails to correct or resolve an area of
noncompliance in a timely manner, or provide an acceptable
explanation in a timely manner, then such failure may be treated as a
material violation of this chapter or the franchise, other agreement,
license or permit, as is appropriate.
A. To the extent permitted by federal law, including applicable FCC rules
and regulations, and state law, including applicable PSC rules and
regulations, the City Council is authorized to, and may choose to,
regulate the rates for basic multichannel service, which includes basic
cable service and those charges (such as converter rental outlet fees)
associated with the provision of multichannel service. In the event that
the City Council chooses to regulate rates for basic service, the City
Council shall follow any, and all, applicable FCC and PSC rules,
regulations and procedures concerning rate regulation.
B. Consistent with federal law, before the City Council exercises its right
to impose, approve or deny the rates and charges for multichannel
service, the City Council must conduct a public hearing in which to
allow an affected MCS provider, or any other interested party, an
opportunity to express its views concerning said proposed rate
regulation.
C. Consistent with federal law, if the City Council requires a refund with
respect to a particular subscriber rate or charge, then if the MCS
provider actually paid the franchise fee and did not merely collect and
remit the franchise fee to the city, the MCS provider is eligible for a
corresponding reduction in and/or rebate of a portion of the franchise
fee, or functional equivalent, that was paid by the MCS provider for the
period applicable to the refund.
A. Each and every MCS provider required to provide PEG access channels
in the city shall be required to interconnect its multichannel system
(through any permissible means) to any other MCS provider's system
operating within the city, for the purpose of allowing public, educational
or governmental access programming to be provided to all subscribers
§ 227-67 GENEVA CODE § 227-69

§ 227-70. Periodic regulatory review by City Council.
§ 227-71. Miscellaneous provisions; tampering and unauthorized
reception of certain services.
throughout the city, regardless of which MCS provider provides
multichannel service to a particular subscriber.
B. To the extent that another MCS provider provides public, educational or
governmental access programming to the other MCS provider's system,
then the other MCS provider shall, in whatever way practicable,
promptly notify its subscribers that another MCS provider is providing
the particular educational or governmental access programming.
A. Between 210 and 30 days prior to the fourth and eighth anniversary
dates of the effective date of this chapter, the City Council shall conduct
a review and examination of this entire MCS provider chapter.
B. In conducting such a review and examination of the MCS provider
chapter, the City Council shall consider, among other things, the
following:
(1) Whether one or more provisions have been superseded, clarified or
modified by federal or state law (including PSC rule or regulation).
(2) Whether one or more provisions have been superseded, clarified or
modified by a subsequent binding judicial decision.
(3) Whether one or more provisions are unnecessary or ineffective in
light of emerging and evolving technologies.
(4) Whether new or different trends relating to MCS providers warrant
or necessitate additional safeguards for customer or subscribers
and/or subscribers.
(5) Whether the economic and customer or subscriber forces
associated with competition have lessened the need for one or
more provisions.
C. If after such a periodic review and examination of the MCS provider
chapter the City Council determines that one or more provisions of the
MCS provider chapter should be amended, repealed, revised, clarified
or deleted, then the City Council may take whatever measures
necessary (to the extent permitted by law) in order to accomplish same.
It is noted that where warranted and the best interests of the city, the
City Council may repeal the entire MCS provider chapter.
D. Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsection A and C of this section,
the City Council may at any time, and in any manner (to the extent
permitted by federal, state or local law), amend, add, repeal and/or
delete one or more provisions of this chapter.
§ 227-69 MULTICHANNEL SERVICE PROVIDERS § 227-71
227:269
§ 227-72. Fines.
A. Consistent with the Cable Act, no person shall intercept or receive, or
assist in intercepting or receiving, any communications service offered
over a multichannel system, unless specifically authorized to do so by
an MCS provider, or as may be specifically authorized by law.
B. For the purpose of this section, the term "assist in intercepting or
receiving" shall include the manufacture or distribution of equipment
intended by the manufacturer or distributor (as the case may be) for the
unauthorized reception of multichannel service as referenced in
Subsection A of this section.
C. Without securing permission from an MCS provider, or making payment
to an MCS provider, then no person shall be authorized to make any
connection, whether physically, electrically, acoustically, inductively or
otherwise, with any part of an authorized or franchised multichannel
system for the purpose of receiving or intercepting or assisting others
to receive or intercept any cable service provided lawfully by the MCS
provider.
D. Any and all MCS providers are encouraged to work with the City
Council in developing and implementing a plan designed to control and
eliminate the unauthorized reception of certain multichannel services
within the city.
A. In addition to all other rights and powers vested in and possessed by the
city, the city specifically reserves the right to impose fines for violations
of this chapter or any franchise, other agreement, license or permit
granted under and pursuant to the chapter, or for the violation or
breach of any federal, state or local law, rule or regulation, in the event
such failure has not been remedied pursuant to procedures set forth in
this chapter.
B. Upon acceptance of a franchise agreement or other agreement, license
or permit, or the renewal of any franchise agreement or other
agreement, license or permit, a franchisee or other MCS provider shall
indicate that it clearly understands that a failure to comply with any
time and performance-related requirements, or any breach of a term or
condition of such franchise, other agreement, license or permit or of
this chapter, or of any federal, state or local law, rule, regulation or code
as set forth any agreement or this chapter, may result in the imposition
of fines as set forth in this section.
C. Absent good and just cause and the provision of evidence of good faith
efforts to comply, the failure to comply with any time and performancerelated
requirement stipulated in the franchise agreement or other
agreement, license or permit, or this chapter, may result in the
imposition of fines as set forth in this section. Fines shall continue to
accrue, including during any appeals process, until such time as the
payment of fines is received by the city, or is otherwise waived by the
§ 227-71 GENEVA CODE § 227-72
227:270
city. Failure to pay fines within the time provided shall be a material
violation of this chapter, and the franchise agreement or other
agreement, license or permit, and shall be cause to proceed against
either a letter of credit or bond or other surety or guaranty as provided
by the franchisee or other MCS provider. It shall also constitute cause
to pursue revocation of the franchise or other agreement, license or
permit. The franchisee or other MCS provider shall be charged, and
shall pay to the city, the following amounts in fines for the violations
listed:
(1) For failure to complete any system construction, reconstruction or
upgrade, pursuant to the franchise agreement or other agreement

§ 227-72 GENEVA CODE § 227-72
227:272
§ 227-73. Notice of failure to comply.
franchisee or other MCS provider that a violation exists, each day that a
violation continues shall constitute and be deemed a separate violation
and may be treated as a separate violation.
E. In the event of an appeal arising out of the enforcement of this section,
or in the event of litigation arising out of a dispute regarding the
enforceability of any action taken by the city under this section, during
the course of such proceeding the franchisee or other MCS provider
shall not be excused from the prompt and timely payment of fines as set
forth in this section. The amount of the fines in such an instance shall be
placed in an escrow account by the city, pending the resolution and
decision of the adjudicating entity.
F. Notwithstanding anything in this section, or any other section of this
chapter, a franchisee or other MCS provider may not use the payment
of fines or penalties as may be permitted and assessed to evade or avoid
compliance with this chapter or any section of this chapter. An attempt
to do so shall subject the franchisee or other MCS provider to
termination and loss of the franchise or other agreement, license or
permit or other operating authority.
A. The city shall provide notice and opportunity to cure for the failure to
comply with a time or performance-related requirement, or breach of a
term or condition of an MCS franchise or other agreement, license or
permit, or of this chapter, or of any federal, state or local law, rule,
regulation or code which the city deems sufficient to warrant the
assessment and imposition of fines.
B. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding subsection,
or any other subsection of this section, for situations involving
violations of safety and safety-related codes and requirements where
such are deemed to create an imminent threat or danger to lives or
property within the city, and for which the MCS provider has previously
been notified of a situation(s) involving noncompliance with the same or
similar situations, or aspects of safety and safety-related codes and
requirements, the MCS provider shall be notified, but may not be
granted an opportunity to remedy or cure prior to the imposition of
fines. Rather fines may be assessed and imposed immediately, on a peroccurrence,
per-day basis, until the violation(s) is eliminated.
C. Notice and the opportunity to cure shall be provided to the affected
MCS provider in writing, and shall be sent by certified U.S. Mail, return
receipt requested, to the franchisee's or other MCS provider's local
place of business. The amount of time given the franchisee or other
MCS provider to cure any time or performance requirement, or breach
of a term or condition of a MCS provider franchise or other agreement
or permit, violation of this chapter, or violation of any federal, state or
local law, rule or regulation shall be at the discretion of the city, but in
no event less than 48 hours, unless otherwise agreed to between the
§ 227-72 MULTICHANNEL SERVICE PROVIDERS § 227-73
227:273
city and the franchisee or other MCS provider, or as set forth in
Subsection B of this section. Notwithstanding the preceding, or
anything else in this section or this chapter, in the event of a situation
in violation of the safety-related requirements of this chapter that
endangers or has the reasonable possibility of endangering the health
or safety of individuals or property, the forty-eight-hour cure period
may be lessened and, in fact, a cure may be required the same day,
depending on the seriousness of the matter as a factor of the threat
created to the public.
D. The city may, in its reasonable discretion, grant extensions of time to a
franchisee or other MCS provider to cure or remedy, where
extraordinary circumstances not precipitated by the franchisee or other
MCS provider warrant an extension.
E. Notwithstanding any notice an opportunity cure requirements of the
applicable federal or state law, the issuance of two or more notices to
cure for the same or similar time or performance-related requirement,
or breach of a term or condition of a franchise or other agreement or
permit, or violation of this chapter, or violation of any federal, state or
local law, rule, regulation or code within any 12 consecutive month
period, shall relieve the city of any obligation to provide further notice
and opportunity to cure for subsequent failures to meet any time or
performance-related requirements, or breaches of terms or conditions
of such franchise or other agreement, license or permit, violations of
this chapter, or violations of any federal, state or local law, rule,
regulation or code. Evidence of subsequent failures as set forth in this
subsection shall be admissible as evidence in a hearing before the City
Council on the assessment of fines, provided that the city has provided
such evidence to the franchisee or other MCS provider at least 10 days
prior to the hearing and the MCS provider has an opportunity to be
heard at the hearing.
F. A notice of intent to assess fines. Fines may be issued concurrently with
a notice to cure. If a notice of intent to assess fines is issued
concurrently with a notice to cure, fines, if assessed, will accrue
commencing with the expiration of the time allowed for an opportunity
to cure as set forth in the notice. The notice of intent to assess fines
shall state the reason for the assessment and imposition, and shall
inform the franchisee or other MCS provider that fines will be assessed
from the date of the notice, or the end of the time allowed for an
opportunity to cure, whichever is later.
G. If the franchisee or other MCS provider desires to appeal the city's
assessment of fines, it must file a written notice of appeal with the City
Clerk, delivered by certified U.S. Mail, within 10 days of the receipt of
the notice of intent to assess fines. The City Clerk shall then place the
issue of the assessment of fines before the City Council.
H. The city shall then have served upon the affected MCS provider a
written notice of the date, time and place of the meeting, at least 30
§ 227-73 GENEVA CODE § 227-73
227:274
days prior to the day of the meeting of the City Council at which the
matter will be heard.
I. Public notice shall be given of the meeting and the issue that is to be
considered by the City Council. If the franchisee or other MCS provider
fails to appeal the city's assessment of fines within the time required by
this section, the city's decision to assess fines shall be final.
J. The City Council shall, at the date, time and place designated for the
hearing, hear and consider issues from the city and the MCS provider
and make a determination regarding the alleged violation of this
chapter or any franchise, other agreement, license or permit.
(1) The City Council shall hear and consider the matter, including
hearing any person interested in the matter wishing to be heard,
and review and consider any relevant evidence. After affording the
MCS provider required rights of due process to be heard, to
present relevant evidence and witnesses and to question any
witnesses, the City Council shall determine whether or not there
was committed a breach or violation of a time or performancerelated
requirement, or a breach of a term or condition of the MCS
provider's franchise or other agreement, license or permit, or of
this chapter, or of any federal, state or local law, rule, regulation or
code.
(2) The franchisee or other MCS provider may, at its own expense,
make a transcript of any such hearing, or share the costs of
obtaining a transcript of such hearing equally with the city if the
city has a transcript made.
(3) Within 30 days following the completion and close of the hearing,
the City Council shall issue a written decision as regards to
whether any failure to comply with any time or performancerelated
requirement, or breach of a term or condition of the
franchise or other agreement, license or permit, or of this chapter,
or of any federal, state or local law, rule, regulation or code
occurred, based upon the record of the proceeding, stating with
particularity the reasons for such decision. A copy of the Council's
decision shall be provided to the franchisee or other MCS provider.
(4) Should the City Council find that no breach, violation or failure to
comply or perform occurred or, except for situations addressed in
Subsection B of this section, that the franchisee or other MCS
provider remedied the failure prior to the end of the period allowed
for cure, or that the franchisee or other MCS provider instituted
substantial actions to remedy the failure to comply or perform after
having been provided written notice, and actively and expeditiously
started and undertook substantial efforts to complete such remedy,
or that fines are not warranted or applicable in the instant
situation, all of which shall be determined at the sole discretion of
§ 227-73 MULTICHANNEL SERVICE PROVIDERS § 227-73
227:275
§ 227-74. Complaint procedures.
the City Council, the proceedings shall be terminated and no
penalty shall be imposed.
(5) The City Council shall be required to base its decision on a
preponderance of the evidence from the record established during
the City Council's hearing. If the City Council determines that any
time or performance-related requirement or breach of a term or
condition of the franchise or other agreement, license or permit, or
of this chapter, or of any federal, state or local law, rule, regulation
or code was the fault of the MCS provider, and was within its
control, subsequent to the required notice and opportunity to cure
and due process requirements of this chapter, the City Council may
affirm the assessment and imposition of fines. The City Council's
decision to affirm the city's assessment of fines shall be final and no
other remedies, administrative or otherwise, nor any procedures
for such, are provided under this chapter.
(6) Prior to imposing any penalty or sanction against the MCS provider
for failure to perform any of its obligations under this chapter or its
franchise agreement or other agreement or permit, other than fines
or termination, the city shall provide the franchisee or other MCS
provider notice and opportunity to cure such failure in accordance
with the following procedures in Subsection J(7) and (8) of this
section.
(7) The city shall provide the franchisee or other MCS provider with
written notice specifying the nature of the failure, breach or
violation. The franchisee or other MCS provider shall have a period
of 48 hours following the receipt of such notice to cure or satisfy
the alleged failure, breach or violation, with the exception of
situations addressed in Subsection B of this section.
(8) In the event the city concludes that the franchisee or other MCS
provider has failed to comply with any of its obligations under this
chapter or the franchise agreement or other agreement, license or
permit, and further, that the MCS provider has not remedied such
failure, breach or violation within the period allowed after
receiving written notice of such, the city may impose whatever
penalties or other sanctions are provided for under this chapter or
the franchisee's or other MCS provider's franchise agreement or
other agreement or permit.
A. The city is hereby granted the authority to do all things necessary and
permissible to supervise, inspect and regulate the construction,
operation, repair and maintenance of multichannel systems operating
within the city, whether franchised or otherwise, that are permitted to
and do operate under this chapter in whole or in part, and to implement
procedures for the filing and resolution of complaints.

§ 232-6. Use of decibel meters.
The Chief of Police of the City of Geneva has deemed it appropriate and
in the best interest of the city to reduce and/or mitigate noise problems
and complaints in the community, to supplement the provisions contained
herein by the establishment of acceptable standards of decibel readings for
ambient noise. These standards reflect community needs for such standards
taking into consideration such issues as surrounding circumstances, place,
time of day, and the like and are set forth hereinbelow:
A. Definitions. For the purpose of these standards, the following
definitions shall apply:
AMBIENT NOISE  The background average noise level within an
area, exclusive of any extraneous sounds.
A-WEIGHTED SOUND LEVEL  The sound pressure level measured
with a meter using an A-weighted frequency response as prescribed by
the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), or its successor. Aweighting
is used to approximate the average human ear's response to
a range of sound frequencies.
CLASS A (RESIDENTIAL) LAND  Lands residentially zoned and used
primarily for sleeping purposes by people. Such lands shall include
those contained in the R1, R2 and MR zoning districts.
CLASS B (COMMERCIAL) LAND  Lands where people are likely to
communicate with one another by speech. Class B shall include public
lands and zoning districts designated as B1 and B2.
§ 232-3 NOISE § 232-6
232:317
CLASS C (INDUSTRIAL) LAND  Lands intended primarily for heavy
commercial or industrial use, and shall include those lands in zoning
districts F and F1.
CONTINUOUS SOUND  Any sound that is not an impulsive sound.
DAYTIME  From 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m.
DBA  The abbreviation for A-weighted sound level in decibels.
FAST RESPONSE  The characteristic of a sound level meter which
allows for accurate measurement of impulsive sounds such as horn
blasts, explosive sounds, firearm discharges or passing vehicles.
IMPULSIVE SOUND  A sound characterized by excursions of the
sound pressure which exceed the ambient sound, by six or more
decibels, but last two seconds or less.
INDUSTRIAL OPERATION  The production, fabrication and storage
of man-made goods, and the production, transformation and storage of
energy in all forms.
MAXIMUM SOUND LEVEL  The recorded or noted maximum RMS
(room-mean-square) sound pressure level noted using an instrument
which meets the requirements of the chapter. Maximum impulsive
sound level shall be measured using the fast response setting.
Maximum continuous sound level shall be measured using the slow
response setting.
REAL PROPERTY BOUNDARY  An imaginary line exterior to any
structure, along the ground surface, which separates the real property
owned by one person from that owned by another person, and the
vertical extension of such line.
RECEIVING LAND  The property line of the real property where the
sound is being heard, and where appropriate level restrictions apply.
In the case of any apartment, townhouse or condominium, the point-ofmeasurement
is within the affected unit.
SOUND LEVEL  The quantity, in decibels, measured using an
instrument satisfying the requirements of ANSI SI.4-1983. Sound level
is the frequency-weighted (see "A-weighting") sound pressure level
obtained with fast or slow response.
SOUND LEVEL METER  An instrument designed to detect and
measure sound pressure levels and display this information in decibels,
in an analog or digital form. An instrument meeting the requirements
of this code shall conform to the requirements of ANSI SI.4-1983, Type
1 or Type 2.
B. Maximum permissible sound levels by receiving land use. Any noise
source that produces sound in excess of those levels set forth in Table I,
as measured at, or within the property boundary of the receiving land
use, shall constitute a violation of this section.

C. In the event the background noise (ambient) level for a given
receiving land use exceeds the standards above, the following
maximum sound levels, measured using the criteria above, shall
apply:
(1) Any continuous sound which exceeds the
ambient by 10 dB(A) or more.
(2) Any impulsive sound which exceeds the ambient
by 20 dB(A) or more, with the above adjustment
applied.
D. The above table shall not apply to noise emanating from an
industrial operation, which noise shall be subject to the
following limits:

condition of permit issuance.
(2) Noise:
(a) Noise shall be measured with a
sound level meter having an Aweighted
filter constructed in
accordance with specifications
of the American National
Standards Institute (ANSI).
Measurements are to be made
at any point as indicated in
Table II following.
(b) Impact noise shall be assured
using the fast response of the
sound level meter. Impact
noises are intermittent sounds
such as from a punch press or
drop forge hammer.
Measurements are to be made
at any point as indicated in
Table II.
(c) Between the hours of 7:00 p.m.
and 7:00 a.m. the permissible
sound levels in a residential
district shall be reduced by five
decibels for continuous and by
10 decibels for impact noises.
(d) The following sources of noise
are exempt:
[1] Transportation
vehicles not
under the

Public Nuisances
[Adopted 4-1-1992 by Ord. No. 92-6]
§ 236-1. Legislative findings.
The City Council finds that public nuisances exist in the City of Geneva in
the operation of certain establishments and the use of property in flagrant
violation of the penal laws relating to controlled substances, dangerous
drugs, all of which substantially and seriously interfere with the interest of
the public in the quality of life and total community environment, commerce
in the city, property values and the public health, safety and welfare. The
City Council further finds that the continued occurrence of such activities
and violations is detrimental to the health, safety and welfare of the City
of Geneva and of the business thereof and the visitors thereto. It is the
purpose of this chapter to authorize and empower the Chief of Police to
impose sanctions and penalties for such public nuisances, and such powers
may be exercised either in conjunction with, or apart from, the powers
contained in other laws without prejudice to the use of procedures and
remedies available under such other laws. The Council further finds that the
sanctions and penalties imposed by the Chief pursuant to this law constitute
an additional and appropriate method of law enforcement in response to
the proliferation of the above described public nuisances. The sanctions and
penalties are reasonable and necessary in order to protect the health and
safety of the people of the City and to promote the general welfare.
§ 236-2. Public nuisance defined.
For purposes of this section, a public nuisance is declared to exist where:
A. An arrest for a violation of any provision of Article 220 and 221 of the
New York State Penal Law has been made within 60 days prior to the
issuance of notice pursuant to this section, where said arrest has been
predicated on events, circumstances or activities occurring on the
premises;
B. A violation of Article 220 or 221 which has resulted in a criminal
conviction to Article 220 or 221 within the twenty-four-month period of
time prior to the arrest required in Subsection A above where said
conviction has been predicated on events, circumstances or activities
occurring on the premises;
C. Discovery by any law enforcement agency, or duly authorized agent
thereof, of a quantity and quality of a drug or substance on the
premises, the amount of which would subject an individual, if
prosecuted, to a conviction of Article 220 or 221 of the Penal Law, which
discovery has not lead to an arrest or conviction within the twenty-fourmonth
period of time prior to the arrest required in Subsection A above;

Sewer Extensions
§ 277-28. Sanitary sewer extension standards.
All extensions to the sanitary sewer system owned and maintained by
the City shall be properly designed in accordance with the Recommended
Standards of Sewer Works, as adopted by the Great Lakes-Upper
Mississippi River Board of State Sanitary Engineers and in strict
conformance with all requirements of the New York State Department of
Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC). Plans and specifications for sewer
extensions shall be submitted to, and approval obtained from, the Director
of Public Works and NYSDEC before construction may proceed. The design
of sewers must anticipate and allow for flows from all possible future
extensions or developments within the immediate drainage area.
§ 277-29. Construction of sewer extensions; assessment of cost.
Sewer extensions may be constructed by the City under public contract,
by City forces, if, in the opinion of City Council, the number of properties
to be served by such extension warrants its costs. Property owners will
be assessed the full costs of constructing an eight-inch sanitary sewer for
the width of their property. Property owners may propose sewer extensions
within City limits by drafting a written petition, signed by a majority of
the benefiting property owners, and filing it with the City Clerk. The City
Council has the right to order sewer extensions where deemed necessary
for the health of the community and assess charges against property
owners.
§ 277-30. Construction of sewer extension by owner or developer.
§ 277-31. Sewer design and specifications.
Sewer design shall be in accordance with § 277-28 and the following
provisions:
A. If the City does not elect to construct a sewer extension under public
contract, the property owner, builder or developer may construct the
necessary sewer extension, if approved by the City Council. He or they
must pay for the entire installation, including all expenses incidental
thereto. Each building sewer installed must be installed and inspected
as previously required, and the inspection fees shall be paid.
B. Design of sewers shall be as specified in §§ 277-28 and 277-31. The
installation of the sewer extension must be subject to full-time
inspection by the City Engineer, the Director of Public Works or his
appointee, and the expenses for this inspection shall be paid for by the
owner, builder or developer. The Director of Public Works' decisions
shall be final in matters of quality and methods of construction. The
sewer, as constructed, must pass the leakage test required in § 277-32
before it is to be used.
§ 277-28 RAILROADS § 277-31
268:369
§ 277-32. Leakage test before approval.
All sewers shall be tested for leakage prior to being placed in service. The
leakage shall be determined by exfiltration, infiltration or low-pressure air.
The testing method shall be as directed by the Engineer or Director of
A. Pipe shall be ductile iron conforming to ASTM C151 and/or polyvinyl
chloride (PVC) conforming to ASTM D3034 with a minimum pipe
stiffness of 46 psi at a maximum deflection of 5% and a standard
dimension ratio (SDR) of 35 or less.
B. Ductile iron pipe joints shall be push-on or mechanical conforming to
ASTM C111.
C. Polyvinyl chloride pipe shall be joined with push-on or mechanical joints
conforming to ASTM C111.
D. Joints of any of these types of pipe shall be made in accordance with the
manufacturer's published recommendations.
E. Ductile iron and PVC pipe shall be installed and backfilled in
accordance with ASTM 2321. Polyvinyl chloride pipe deflection shall be
checked by pulling a deflection gauge through completed pipelines by
hand.
F. Manholes shall be constructed with a poured three-thousand-psi
concrete base, steel-troweled concrete or mortar inverts and precast
four-foot diameter concrete manhole barrel sections and a tapered top
section as specified by ASTM C0478, or cement brick or block solid. The
manhole frame and cover shall be the standard design of the City and
shall be set with no less than two courses of brick underneath to allow
for later adjustment in elevation.
Pipe Diameter
(inches) Trench Width
8 3' - 3"
10 3' - 6"
12 3' - 9"
G. If the trench widths are found, during field inspection, to exceed the
limits in the above table, the sewer pipe shall be encased with a
minimum of six inches of concrete. Pipe shall be firmly and evenly
bedded on a minimum of three inches of No. 2 crushed stone (NYSDOT
Specification). Pipe thickness and field strength shall be calculated on
the following criteria:
Safety factor 1.5
Load factor 1.7

Public Works. If the line fails the test, the contractor shall explore for and
repair the cause of the excessive leakage. After repairs have been made,
the line shall be retested. This procedure shall be repeated until the pipe
complies.
A. Exfiltration testing. Exfiltration tests shall be made by filling a section
of pipeline with water and measuring the quantity of leakage. The head
of water at the beginning of the test shall be at least two feet above the
highest pipe within the section being tested. Should groundwater be
present within the section being tested, the head of water for the test
shall be two feet above the level of the groundwater. Should the
requirement of two feet of water above the highest pipe subject any
joint at the lower end of the test section to a differential head greater
than 11.5 feet, another method of testing shall be employed.
B. Infiltration testing. Infiltration tests will be allowed only when the
groundwater level is two feet or more above the highest pipe of the
section being tested. The quantity of water leaking into each section of
pipeline shall be measured by a calibrated weir constructed at the
outlet of the section being tested.
C. Allowable leakage.
(1) The allowable leakage (exfiltration or infiltration) shall not exceed
the following in gallons per 24 hours per inch of diameter per 1,000
feet of pipe.
Type of Pipe Leakage
Ductile iron, mechanical or push-on joints 10
Polyvinyl chloride, thermal plastic or
fiberglass with rubber joints
10
Polyvinyl chloride, thermal plastic or
fiberglass with solvent-cemented joints
0
(2) Regardless of the above allowable leakage, any spurting leaks
detected shall be completely and permanently stopped.
D. Manhole testing. Each manhole shall be tested by either exfiltration or
infiltration. A manhole will be acceptable if the leakage does not exceed
an allowable of one gallon per vertical foot of depth for 24 hours.
Regardless of the allowable leakage, any leaks detected shall be
permanently stopped. An exfiltration test may be performed prior to or
after backfilling. The test shall be made by filling the manhole with
water and observing the level for a minimum of eight hours. Infiltration
tests shall be performed when the groundwater level is above the joint
of the top section of a precast manhole.
E. Air testing.
(1) Air testing shall not be performed until the backfilling has been
completed. Low-pressure air tests shall conform to ASTM C828
§ 277-32 RAILROADS § 277-32
268:371
§ 277-33. Maintenance and ownership assumed by City after final
approval.
All sewer extensions constructed at the property owner's, builder's or
developer's expense, after final approval and acceptance by the City
Engineer or Director of Public Works, shall become the property of the City
and shall thereafter be maintained by the City.
§ 277-34. Sewer permit required before issuance of building permit.
No builder or developer shall be issued a building permit for a new dwelling
or structure requiring sanitary facilities within the City until a sewer permit
has been received from the Department of Public Works, and all new
developments shall be provided with an approved system of sanitary
sewers.
except as specified herein and shall not be limited to type or size of
pipe. All sections of pipelines shall be cleaned and flushed prior to
testing.
(2) The air test shall be based on the average holding pressure of
three-psi gauge, a drop from 3.5 to 2.5 psi, within the period of time
allowed for the size of pipe and the length of the test section. The
time allowed for the one-psi drop in pressure, measured in seconds,
will be computed by the Engineer/Director of Public Works and will
be based on the limits of ASTM C828. When groundwater is
present, the average test pressure of three psig shall be above any
back pressure due to the groundwater level. The maximum
pressure allowed under any condition in air testing shall be 10 psig.
The maximum groundwater level for air testing is 13 feet above the
top of the pipe.
(3) The equipment required for air testing shall be furnished by the
contractor and shall include the necessary compressor, valves and
gauges to allow for the monitoring of the pressure, release of
pressure and a separable test gauge. The test gauge shall be sized
to allow for the measuring of the one-psig loss allowed during the
test period and shall be on a separate line to the test section.

imposed on the Department on account thereof under Section 309 of
the National Act, or any liability for civil or criminal penalties.
A. Information and data on a user obtained from reports, questionnaires,
permit applications, permits and monitoring programs and from
inspections shall be available to the public or other governmental
agency without restriction unless the user specifically requests and is
able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Director or Chief Operator
at the time the information is submitted that the release of such
information would divulge information, processes or methods of
production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the user.
B. When requested by the person furnishing a report, the portions of a
report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not
be made available for inspection by the public but shall be made
available upon written request to governmental agencies for uses

Surcharge Due to Extra-Strength Wastes
§ 277-61. Imposition of surcharge.
Any user who discharges pollutants in excess of concentrations in § 277-42
or § 277-43 of this chapter may be subject to a surcharge. This surcharge
may be in addition to any other fees, charges, sewer rents, fines or taxes
provided by law. The Director or Chief Operator of the POTW may impose
mass limitations on pollutants discharged in excess of concentrations listed
in § 277-42 or § 277-43. Surcharges will be assessed based on
concentrations and treatment costs as determined by the Director or Chief
Operator of the POTW.
§ 277-62. Volume determination.
In applying the surcharge formulae, the Director or Chief Operator may
represent flow discharged into the sewer system by:
§ 277-63. Determination of pollutant concentration.
The pollutant concentration of any wastewater shall be determined from
the analysis of representative samples taken prior to discharge into the City
sewers, taken by representatives of the Director or Chief Operator. The
intent of any sampling procedure is to establish the pollutant concentration
in the wastewater discharge during an average or typical working day.
This concentration may be derived according to the best judgment of the
Director or Chief Operator.
§ 277-64. Dispute of pollutant concentration.
In the event that the pollutant concentration of the waste discharged from
a premises to a public sewer as determined under § 277-63 of this chapter
A. The amount of water supplied to the premises as shown on the water
meter, or water records if the premises are metered;
B. The volume of wastewater discharged into the sewer system as
determined by the measurements and samples taken at a monitoring

various factors which must be considered on a new sampling and flow
measurement program.
C. The consultant or agency of recognized professional standing employed
by the user shall conduct a resampling and reanalysis program, under
the direction of the Director or Chief Operator, for at least two twentyfour-
hour periods.
D. The results of the resampling and the reanalysis shall be considered to
be the current analysis of the wastes discharged to the sewer system
and shall be used for determining the acceptability of the sampling and
analysis results in question. The new results may be used in place of the
results in question or in addition to other data collected by the
Department for determining the industrial waste surcharge, and/or
compliance with this chapter.
E. Cost of sampling, analysis and flow measurement for regular
monitoring purposes will be charged to the industry. Such activities,

(5) where the user can demonstrate that:
(1) It did not know or have reason to know that its discharge, along or
in conjunction with a discharge or discharges from other sources,
would cause pass-through or interference; and
(2) Local limit.
(a) A local limit designed to prevent pass-through and/or
interference, as the case may be, was developed in accordance
with 40 CFR 403.5(c) for each pollutant in the user's discharge
that caused pass-through or interference, and the user was in
compliance with each such local limit directly prior to and
during the pass-through or interference; or
§ 277-69 RAILROADS § 277-69
268:395
(b) If a local limit designed to prevent pass-through and/or
interference, as the case may be, has not been developed in
accordance with 40 CFR 403.5(c) for the pollutant(s) that
caused the pass-through or interference, the user's discharge
directly prior to and during the pass-through or interference
did not change substantially the nature or constituents from
the user's prior discharge activity when the POTW was
regularly in compliance with the POTW's NPDES permit
requirements and, in the case of interference, applicable
requirements for sewage sludge use or disposal.
N. Nothing contained in this § 277-69 shall prevent, abridge and/or

notice and an opportunity for a hearing can be provided, the Director or
Chief Operator may, without prior hearing, order such user by notice, in
writing wherever practicable or in such other form as in the Director's
or Chief Operator's judgment will reasonably notify such person whose
practices are intended to be proscribed, to discontinue, abate or
alleviate such condition or activity, or where the giving of notice is
impracticable, in the event of a user's failures to comply voluntarily
with an emergency order, the Director or Chief Operator may take all
appropriate action to abate the violating condition. As promptly as
possible thereafter, not to exceed 15 days, the Director or Chief
Operator shall provide the user an opportunity to be heard in
accordance with the provisions of Article X of this chapter.
B. The Director or Chief Operator, acting upon the belief that an
emergency exists, shall be indemnified against any personal liability
that may arise in the performance of his duties to protect the public
health, safety or welfare, or preserve the public sewer system.
A. Introduction. The enforcement response plan is an outline of the
procedures to be followed to ensure compliance by industrial users with
the City of Geneva's Sewer Use Ordinance, and the United States
Environmental Protection Agency's and New York State's pretreatment
regulations. The enforcement response plan is divided into four
§ 277-71 GENEVA CODE § 277-75
268:398
sections. Subsection B describes procedures to review and update the
list of industrial users, to track and screen compliance monitoring
data and to schedule sampling and inspection of significant industrial
users (SIU). Subsection C describes the type of enforcement action the
City will take in response to anticipated industrial user violations and
contains the enforcement response guide. Subsection D describes the
enforcement options in detail. Subsection E will contain standard forms
and letters to be used to implement the enforcement response plan.
B. Administrative procedures.
(1) Personnel. The Public Works Director is responsible for the overall
implementation of the pretreatment regulations and the
enforcement response plan. The WWTF Chief Operator is
responsible for the day-to-day implementation of the pretreatment
program and enforcement response plan. The Public Works
Director will annually evaluate the WWTF's staff ability to
implement the program and provide the necessary level of funding
and personnel to accomplish the requirements of the pretreatment
program.
(2) Industrial user inventory.
(a) The general pretreatment regulations require the periodic
updating of the industrial users contributing to the Geneva
WWTF.
(b) Every five years a complete industrial user survey shall be
done. At least annually the industrial user list shall be updated.
New industrial users must file an industrial residual waste
questionnaire and an industrial chemical survey before
commencing discharge to the system.
(c) The WWTF Chief Operator shall oversee the industrial user
survey. The survey shall be comprehensive and complete. The
telephone book, Chamber of Commerce listing, local business
directory and inspection of commercial areas shall be used to
update the master list. The master list shall include all
businesses in the service area. The master list shall be
surveyed to determine what industries are dry processes or
wet processes. All industries that discharge to the POTW shall
be sent an industrial chemical survey and an industrial residual
waste questionnaire to be completed and returned. All
completed forms shall be reviewed to determine if they should
be classified as a categorical or a significant industrial user.
(d) Annually the industrial user list shall be reviewed to determine
if new industrial users have entered the system. This review
will be based on building permits, and records from the
Planning Commission and Building and Code Enforcement
Department. The Public Works Director will forward to the
WWTF Chief Operator a copy of all industrial permits issued
§ 277-75 RAILROADS § 277-75
268:399
for new connection to the sewer system. The Planning and
Zoning Commission sends minutes of all meetings to the Public
Works Director. The Public Works Director will forward any
minutes to the WWTF Chief Operator that involve new
industrial activity.
(e) The Building and Code Enforcement Department forward all
cases of Sewer Use Ordinance violations to the Public Works
Director, who will forward any pertinent information to the
WWTF Chief Operator.
(f) Before new industrial users can commence discharge, they
must have completed an industrial chemical survey and an
industrial residual waste questionnaire. The Public Works
Director and WWTF Chief Operator will review the forms and
determine if the industrial user will be a categorical industry or
an SIU. If the user is determined to be either, he or she must
have valid discharge permit as required by the Sewer Use
Ordinance.
(3) Compliance monitoring.
(a) Significant industries, as defined in the Sewer Use Ordinance,
are required to conduct self-monitoring and submit selfmonitoring
reports in accordance with their industrial user
discharge permit. The frequency of self-monitoring is
determined by past history of compliance, discharge volume
and the possibility for pass-through, interference or danger to
POTW works. The United States EPA Pretreatment Compliance
Monitoring and Enforcement (PCME) Guidance (July 1986)
document will be used as a guide for self-monitoring frequency.
Ultimately the self-monitoring program must meet the
requirements and intent of the general pretreatment
regulations and be effective and timely in determining
compliance with categorical and local discharge limits.
(b) The WWTF Chief Operator must schedule at least one
inspection and one sampling of an SIU annually. The sampling
must be for both categorical and local limits. The sampling, at
a minimum, must develop data that is admissible in a court of
law. The sampling and testing procedures must conform to
United States EPA standard practices. The PCME guidance
document will be used as a reference for the sampling.
(4) Screening data.
(a) The City will monitor all industrial sampling reports for
pretreatment compliance. Any instance of noncompliance,
including nondischarge violations, will require an enforcement
response as outlined in Subsection C.
C. Enforcement response.
§ 277-75 GENEVA CODE § 277-75
268:400
(1) Determining enforcement response. The key element of this
enforcement response plan is the Enforcement Guide (Table 1.1 -
1.5). This guide is a matrix which describes violations and indicates
the range of appropriate enforcement options. These options are:
notice of violation, administrative fines, administrative orders, civil
litigation, criminal prosecution, termination of sewer service and
supplemental enforcement responses. Subsection D will fully
describe the options. The response guide offers several levels of
enforcement responses for each type of violation. In deciding what
level of response is appropriate, the past history of the industrial
user, severity of the violation, duration of the violation, the effect of
the violation on the POTW and the environment, the intent or
negligence of the industrial user and the overall attitude of the
industrial user should be considered. Typically for minor violations,
notices of violations are issued. If the industrial user does not
return to compliance within the specified time frame, the
enforcement response escalates until the industrial user is back in
compliance. The criteria for determining the appropriate
enforcement response are discussed in detail:
(a) Severity of the violation. Notices of violations (NOV) are used
for isolated instances of noncompliance, but any violation, no
matter how minor, must be addressed. The EPA recommends
an industrial user that has a significant noncompliance
violation, as that term is defined in § 277-2, be issued an
enforceable order, i.e., administrative order, that requires a
return to compliance by a specific date.
(b) Duration of violation. Violations that extend over long periods
of time should subject the industrial user to escalated
enforcement actions. If the industrial user fails to comply with
the administrative order, then additional fines may be applied.
If the violations are causing harm to the POTW or the receiving
stream, then civil action or service termination should be
considered.
(c) Effect on POTW or receiving stream. If any violation causes
upsets, interference or pass-through of the POTW to the
receiving stream, it should be dealt with a severe and swift
response. At a minimum the industrial user should be issued an
administrative order with a fine. If the violation resulted in
fines by the EPA or NYSDEC to the City, the industrial user
should be responsible for the fines. If the violation resulted in
increased treatment costs or harm to process equipment or
treatment works, the industrial user should be responsible for
the increased costs.
(d) Past history of the user. The past history of compliance of the
industry should be considered when considering what level of
enforcement is appropriate. An industrial user with a good
compliance history may be given the least severe, and an
§ 277-75 RAILROADS § 277-75
268:401
industrial user with a poor compliance history may be given a
more severe enforcement response for the same violation.
(e) Attitude and good faith of user. The attitude and good faith of
the industrial user in correcting its noncompliance should be
taken into consideration when determining the enforcement
response, but a good attitude cannot eliminate the need for
some type of enforcement response.
(2) Personnel responsibilities for enforcement response. The City
Manager, the Public Works Director and the WWTF enforcement
guide clearly define what actions are to be taken by the City. The
City Manager, Director of Public Works and the Chief Operator are
the three City personnel involved in enforcement responses. By
having responsibilities explicitly spelled out, responses to
noncompliance will be swift and consistent. The general rule is that
the Chief Operator will issue notices of violations and
administrative orders. The Public Works Director will have the
authority to issue administrative orders with fines and show-cause
orders. The City Manager will have the authority to issue showcause
orders, initiate civil action, initiate criminal investigation and
terminate service.
(3) Enforcement response guide. The enforcement response guide
(Table 1.1 - 1.5) will be used to determine the enforcement options
for industrial user noncompliance. The option selected should be
based on the criteria set forth in Subsection C(1). The following are
abbreviations and terms used in the enforcement response guide:
AO  Administrative Order
CM  City Manager
CO  WWTF Chief Operator
Civil action  Civil litigation against the IU seeking equitable
relief, monetary penalties and actual damages
Criminal
investigation
 Pursuing punitive measures against an
individual and/or organization through a court
of law
Fine  Monetary penalty assessed by City
IU  Industrial user
NOV  Notice of violation
PWD  Public Works Director
SNC  Significant noncompliance
§ 277-75 GENEVA CODE § 277-75
268:402
Show cause  Formal meeting requiring the IU to appear and
demonstrate why the City should not take a
proposed enforcement action or continue with
an implemented action against it. The meeting
may also serve as a forum to discuss corrective
actions and compliance schedules.

Time Frames for Responses
A. All violations will be identified and documented within
five days of receiving compliance information.
B. Initial enforcement responses [involving contact with
the industrial user and requesting information on
corrective and preventative action(s)] will occur within
15 days of violation detection.
C. Follow-up actions for continuing or reoccurring
violations will be taken within 60 days of the initial
enforcement response. For all continuing violations, the
response will include a compliance schedule.
D. Violations which threaten health, property or
environmental quality are considered emergencies and
will receive immediate responses such as halting the
discharge or terminating service.
E. All violations meeting the criteria for significant
noncompliance will be addressed with an enforceable
order within 30 days of the identification of significant
noncompliance.
D. Enforcement response options. Subsection C and the enforcement
response guide (Table 1.1-1.5) will be used to determine the
appropriate enforcement response. This section provides in detail the
§ 277-75 GENEVA CODE § 277-75
268:408
seven enforcement response options outlined in Subsection C and the
enforcement response guide. The seven enforcement responses are
notice of violation, administrative fines, administrative orders, civil
litigation, criminal prosecution, termination of sewer service and
supplemental enforcement responses.
(1) Notice of violation.
(a) A notice of violation (NOV) is a letter to an industrial user
informing the industrial user of noncompliance with the Sewer
Use Ordinance, industrial discharge permit or pretreatment
regulations. It is used for nonsignificant violations. In the case
of significant noncompliance, an NOV may be issued as a
precursor to more severe enforcement action.
(b) The City will issue an NOV to any industrial user that violates
any of its permit limits (categorical or local limits). The NOV
will be issued for isolated and insignificant violations, failure to
submit monitoring reports, or other minor violations of the
Sewer Use Ordinance as stated in the enforcement response
guide. The NOV shall be issued within five days of detection of
a violation. The NOV will follow the standard form set forth in
Subsection E. The NOV will be hand delivered or sent via
certified mail to the industrial user. Copies of the NOV shall be
sent to the Public Works Director and placed in the industrial
user file.
(2) Administrative orders. Administrative orders (AOs) are
enforcement documents which direct industrial users to undertake
or to cease specified activities. Administrative orders are
recommended as the formal response to significant noncompliance.
Administrative orders may incorporate compliance schedules and
administrative fines. The four types of administrative orders that
are authorized by the Sewer Use Ordinance are: show-cause
orders, consent orders, cease-and-desist orders and compliance
orders.
(a) Show-cause orders. A show-cause order directs the industrial
user to appear before the Chief Operator, Public Works
Director or City Manager, explain its noncompliance, and show
cause why more severe enforcement actions against the user
should not go forward. The hearing can be either formal or
informal, but the hearings should be carefully documented.
The outcome of most show-cause hearings will be a consent
order or compliance order and an administrative fine.
(b) Consent orders.
[1] A consent order is an agreement between the City and the
industrial user that sets forth compliance schedules,
remedial actions and any administrative fines. The consent
order is negotiated by the industrial user and the City. The
§ 277-75 RAILROADS § 277-75
268:409
industrial user does not need to admit the noncompliance
in the text of the order, but the consent order prohibits
future violations and provides for corrective action on the
part of the industrial user.
[2] In determining the terms of the consent order, the City
may take extenuating circumstances into consideration.
The consent order should address every identified
deficiency in the user's compliance status at the time of
the order.
(c) Cease-and-desist orders. A cease-and-desist order orders an
industrial user in noncompliance to cease noncomplying
discharges immediately or to terminate its discharge
completely. A cease-and-desist order will be used in instances
where the industrial user's discharge could cause pass-through
or interference, or otherwise create an emergency situation.
The order should be delivered in person or by certified mail.
(d) Compliance orders. A compliance order directs the user to
achieve or restore compliance by a date specified in the order.
A compliance order does not need to be negotiated with the
industry. Compliance orders are typically used when
construction, process changes or modification of management
practices need to be undertaken. Compliance orders set
specific dates by which specified actions are to be completed.
If the specific deadlines are not met, then further enforcement
responses are initiated or specified series of penalties are
automatically set forth. Typically fines are associated with
compliance orders.
(3) Administrative fines.
(a) The Sewer Use Ordinance confers the authority to the City
Manager and the Public Works Director to assess
administrative fines on industrial users for instances of
noncompliance. The ordinance sets the administrative fines not
to exceed $20,000 per violation. Administrative fines may be
assessed prior to or subsequent to a hearing. The imposition of
fines is subject to review as provided in § 277-69 upon petition
of a user.
(b) The following schedule should be used as guidance for
assessing administrative fines:
Unpermitted discharge $5,000 for first offense;
$10,000 for second offense;
$20,000 for third offense
Failure to renew permit $1,000 for first offense;
$5,000 for second offense;
$10,000 for third offense
§ 277-75 GENEVA CODE § 277-75
268:410
Noncompliance with permit
limits
$1,000 for first offense;
$5,000 for second offense;
$10,000 for third offense
After one year of compliance
fine is reset to $1,000.
Significant noncompliance
(defined in § 277-2)
Up to $20,000 for each
offense
Reporting violation $1,000 for first offense;
$5,000 for second offense;
$10,000 for third offense
After one year of compliance
fine is reset to $1,000.
Failure to report spills $5,000 for first offense;
$10,000 for second offense;
$20,000 for third offense
Failure to monitor $5,000 for first offense;
$10,000 for second offense;
$20,000 for third offense
(c) The fines listed are for guidance only and do not list all possible
instances of penalties that could be incurred. If a fine is to be
assessed it should reflect the magnitude of the violation, the
intent of the industrial user and the past history of the
industrial user.
(4) Civil litigation. The Sewer Use Ordinance allows the City to assess
civil penalties of up to $20,000 per day for each violation by
industrial users of the pretreatment standards, the Sewer Use
Ordinance or their industrial user permit conditions. Civil litigation
is an appropriate enforcement response when enforcement efforts
based on cooperation with the industrial user have not resulted in a
return to compliance. Civil litigation might also be pursued in
emergency conditions where injunctive relief is necessary or to
impose civil penalties and recover losses incurred due to the
noncompliance. The different types of civil litigation are detailed
below. They include consent decrees, injunctions and civil penalties
and cost recovery. Litigation need not be limited to one type; a
single case may include all three types.
(a) Consent decrees. Consent decrees are agreements between
the City and the industrial user. For a consent decree to be
binding it must be signed by the City, the industrial user and
the judge. Consent decrees normally include a schedule for
return to compliance and a stipulated civil penalty. Consent
decrees are similar to consent orders, but the industrial user
acknowledges the noncompliance.
§ 277-75 RAILROADS § 277-75
268:411
(b) Injunctions. Injunctions will be used if an industrial user
refuses to comply with a previously issued cease-and-desist
order. Injunctive relief should be pursued if delays involved in
filing a suit would result in harm to the POTW or the
environment.
(c) Civil penalties and cost recovery. Civil litigation may be
necessary to recover costs associated with noncompliance and
to impose civil penalties. The City should seek to recover all
costs associated with an industrial user's noncompliance. The
costs include legal fees, increased treatment costs, fines
assessed against the City by the EPA or NYSDEC and the cost
incurred in enforcement response actions.
(5) Criminal prosecution. The Sewer Use Ordinance permits the City to
pursue criminal prosecution of individuals or organizations for
violations of the Sewer Use Ordinance. Criminal offenses are
defined as either felonies or misdemeanors. Felonies are the more
serious charges and are characterized by the Clean Water Act as
knowing violations of the Clean Water Act and knowing
endangerment of human health. Knowing violations are punishable
by fines up to $50,000 per day of violation, imprisonment of up to
15 years, or both. Fines and prison sentences under the Clean
Water Act are doubled for a second offense. Federal law defines
misdemeanors as offenses other than felonies. Misdemeanors are
punishable by fines of up to $1,000,000 or imprisonment for less
than one year. Misdemeanor offenses include tampering with
monitoring equipment, falsifying self-monitoring reports and failing
to report noncomplying discharges. Criminal prosecution would
normally be pursued when there is evidence of criminal intent,
willfulness, negligence and/or bad faith shown by the industrial
user. Criminal prosecution is the most severe enforcement
response at the City's disposal. The City Manager and the City
Attorney will decide whether criminal prosecution is pursued. The
EPA guidance document, Guidance for Developing Control
Authority Enforcement Response Plans, September 1989, should
be used as a reference.
(6) Termination of sewer service.
(a) The Sewer Use Ordinance allows the City to terminate an
industrial user's right to discharge when previous enforcement
responses have not returned the industrial user to compliance
or a discharge is causing interference, pass-through or damage
to human health, the environment or the POTW. The
enforcement response guide (Table 1.1 - 1.5) details the
instances when termination of service shall be used as an
enforcement tool.
§ 277-75 GENEVA CODE § 277-75
268:412
(b) Termination of service can be accomplished through ceaseand-
desist orders or injunctions. In the most severe case, the
service may have to be physically broken or a plug installed.
(7) Supplemental enforcement responses.
(a) The City is required by the general pretreatment regulations
[40 CFR 403.8(f)(2)(vii)] to annually publish in the designated
official newspaper a list of industrial users that have had
significant violations during the past 12 months. More frequent
publication of violations can be used to deter industrial users
from committing pretreatment violations.
(b) The following may be of assistance in returning an industrial
user to compliance: Issue short-term permits to industrial
users that are in noncompliance. An industrial user that has
infrequent violations of permit limits may be required to
increase monitoring frequency to help ensure compliance. The
Regional Engineer from the NYSDEC can be requested to
assist in enforcement activities. Make the industrial user
aware of what effects the violations have on the POTW, the
environment and human health.
E. Standard forms. (For forms please consult the City Clerk's office or the
Department of Public Works.)
F. Any user of the POTW aggrieved by any action taken by the Director or
Chief Operator pursuant to this section may seek review of such action
by filing a petition with the Sewer Complaint Review Board. A copy of
the petition shall be filed with the City Manager, who shall schedule a
hearing before the Sewer Complaint Review Board and notify the user
of the time and place of the hearing, which shall be at least 15 days
after filing the petition. The hearing proceedings shall be governed by

the amount so determined. For like cause and within the same period, a
refund may be so made on the initiative of the City Comptroller. However, no
refund shall be made of a tax or penalty paid pursuant to a determination of

judgment obtained in any such action shall be paid to the City Comptroller.

rate of tax enacted later than said date, as the case may be, but
only to the extent that all such sales and use taxes paid on such
sale or use under the aggregate statewide and local taxes imposed
under Article 28 and by authority of Article 29 exceeded an amount

provisions of this article, even though it be judicially determined that the
tax collected is invalidly required to be filed, that shall be due from the
operator and payable to the City Comptroller on the date limited for the
filing of the return for such period, without regard to whether a return is

City Comptroller. Such determination shall be final and shall be complied
with within 15 days after the giving of notices thereof. In lieu of such bond,
securities approved by the City Comptroller or cash in such amount as he
may prescribe may be deposited, which shall be kept in the custody of the

apply them to any tax and/or interest or penalties due, and for that purpose,

amended returns to be filed within 20 days after notice and to contain
the information specified in the notice.

if necessary, the tax may be estimated on the basis of external indexes
such as the number of rooms, location, scale of rents, comparable rents,
type of accommodations and service, number of employees and/or other
factors. Notice of such determination shall be given to the person liable

Comptroller shall give notice of his determination to the person against
whom the tax is assessed. The determination of the City Comptroller shall
be reviewable for error, illegality or unconstitutionality or any other reason
whatsoever by proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and

in such amount as a Justice of the Supreme Court shall approve, to the effect
that if such proceedings are dismissed or the tax confirmed, the petitioner
will pay all costs and charges which may accrue in the prosecution of the
proceeding or, at the option of the applicant, such undertaking filed with the
City Comptroller may be in a sum sufficient to cover the taxes, penalties and
interest thereon stated in such determination, plus the costs and charges
which may accrue against it in the prosecution of the proceedings, in which
event the applicant shall not be required to deposit such taxes, penalties
and interest as a condition precedent to the application.

Comptroller for such refund shall be made within one year from the
payment thereof. Whenever a refund is made by the City Comptroller,
he shall state his reason therefor in writing. Such application may
be made by the occupant, operator or other person who has actually
paid the tax. Such application may also be made by an operator who
has collected and paid over such tax to the City Comptroller, provided
that the application is made within one year of the payment by the
occupant to the operator, but no actual refund of moneys shall be made
to such operator until he shall first establish to the satisfaction of the
City Comptroller, under such regulations as the City Comptroller may
prescribe, that he has repaid to the occupant the amount for which the
application for refund is made. The City Comptroller may, in lieu of any
refund required to be made, allow credit therefor on payments due from
the applicant.
B. An application for a refund or credit made as herein provided shall be
deemed an application for a revision of any tax, penalty or interest
complained of, and the City Comptroller may receive evidence with
respect thereto. After making his determination, the City Comptroller
shall give notice thereof to the applicant who shall be entitled to review
such determination by a proceeding pursuant to Article 78 of the Civil
Practice Law and Rules, provided that such proceeding is instituted
within 30 days after the giving of the notice of such determination, and
provided that a final determination of tax due was not previously made.
Such a proceeding shall not be instituted unless an undertaking is filed
with the City Comptroller in such amount and with such sureties as a
Justice of the Supreme Court shall approve, to the effect that if such
proceedings be dismissed or the tax confirmed, the petitioner will pay
all costs and charges which may accrue in the prosecution of such
proceeding.
C. A person shall not be entitled to a revision, refund or credit under this
article of a tax, interest or penalty which had been determined to be due
pursuant to the provisions of this section where he has a hearing or an
opportunity for a hearing, as provided in said section, or has failed to
avail himself of the remedies therein provided. No refund or credit shall
be made of a tax, interest or penalty paid after a determination by the
City Comptroller made pursuant to § 318-53 of this article unless it is
found that such determination was erroneous, illegal or
unconstitutional or otherwise improper by the City Comptroller after a
hearing or of his own motion or in a proceeding under Article 78 of the
Civil Practice Law and Rules, pursuant to the provisions of said section,
in which event a refund or credit without interest shall be made of the
tax, interest or penalty found to have been overpaid.

imposed by this article as therein provided, the Corporation Counsel
shall, upon the request of the Comptroller, bring an action to enforce
the payment of the same. If, however, the Comptroller believes that any
such operator, occupant or other person subject to the provisions of this
article is about to cease business, leave the state or remove or dissipate
assets, or for any other similar reason he deems it necessary in order to
prevent revenues under this article, he may declare such tax or penalty
to be immediately due and payable and may issue a warrant
immediately.
B. As an additional or alternate remedy, where the tax upon rents included
in a return is not paid at the time of filing such return or an assessment
of tax made is not paid within 10 days from the date of the notice of
such assessment or where the Comptroller believes that any operator,
occupant or other person subject to the provisions of this article is
about to cease business, leave the state or remove or dissipate assets,
or for any other similar reason he deems it necessary in order to protect
revenues under this article, he may issue a warrant directed to a
constable of the City Court of the City of Geneva commanding him to
levy upon and sell the real and personal property of the operator or
occupant or other person liable for the tax which may be found within
the City for the payment of the amount thereof, with any penalties and
interest and the cost of executing the warrant, and to return such
warrant to the Comptroller and to pay to him the money collected by
virtue thereof within 60 days after the receipt of such warrant. The
constable shall, within five days after the receipt of the warrant, file
with the Clerk a copy thereof, and thereupon such Clerk shall enter in
the judgment docket the name of the person mentioned in the warrant
and the amount of the tax, penalties and interest for which the warrant

entitled to the same fees which he may collect in the same manner. In
the discretion of the Comptroller, a warrant of like terms, force and
effect may be issued and directed to any officer or employee of the
City, and in the execution thereof such officer or employee shall have
all the powers conferred by law upon constables but shall be entitled
to no fee or compensation in excess of the actual expenses paid in the
performance of such duty. If a warrant is returned not satisfied in full,
the Comptroller may, from time to time, issue new warrants and shall
also have the same remedies to enforce the amount due thereunder as
if the City had recovered judgment therefor and execution thereon had
been returned unsatisfied.
A. Make, adopt and amend rules and regulations appropriate to the
carrying out of this article and the purposes thereof.

C. Request information from the Tax Commission of the State of New York
or the Treasury Department of the United States relative to any person
and to afford information to such Tax Commission or such Treasury
Department relative to any person, any other provision of this article to

City Comptroller.

by a qualified expert may be substituted, as appropriate. (Trees severely
damaged by storms or certain trees under utility wires or other obstructions
where other pruning practices are impractical may be exempted from this
rule as the determination of the Director of Public Works with consultation
with the City Arborist.)
§ 327-12. Pruning and corner clearance. [Amended 5-1-2019 by
Ord. No. 3-2019]
Every owner of any tree overhanging any street or right-of-way within the

severely obstruct the light from street lamps or obstruct the view of any
intersection, and so that the lowest branches are at least 13 feet above
the street surface and at least eight feet above the sidewalk surface. Said
owners shall remove all dead, diseased or dangerous trees, or broken or
decayed limbs which constitute a menace to public safety. The City shall
have the right to prune any tree on private property which interferes
with the proper illumination by street lamps, or interferes with visibility
of any traffic control device or sign or sight triangle at intersections. Tree
limbs that grow near high voltage lines shall be maintained clear of such
conductors by the electric utility in compliance with applicable franchise
agreements. The utility tree pruning policy must be reviewed by the utility
and the Director of Public Works prior to any pruning by the utility.
§ 327-13. Removal of stumps.
All stumps of street and park trees shall be removed at least six inches
below the surface.
§ 327-14. Protection of trees.
In order to maintain the overall urban forest, all reasonable efforts shall be

endangered. Removed trees shall be replaced, insofar as possible, on a onefor-
one basis within one year. Location, species and planting technique shall
be determined by the committee. Street trees shall be protected as much
as possible from damage during construction, sidewalk repair, utilities work
above and below ground and other similar activities. The zone of protection
of its nature is injurious to electric power lines, gas lines, water lines
or other public utilities; or is affected by any injurious fungus, insect or
other pest. This section does not prohibit the planting of street trees by
adjacent property owners, provided that the selection and location of
said trees be in accordance with §§ 327-7 through 327-9 of this article.

§ 327-15. Risk management policy.
The City of Geneva has an active policy to maintain the safety of public
lands from potentially hazardous trees. The city will endeavor to eliminate,
in a timely fashion, any tree deemed hazardous. When available fiscal,
equipment or human resources limit the ability of the city to remove highrisk
trees, priority shall be placed on trees deemed to carry the highest
risk. The standard for rating the level of hazard of a particular tree will be
the International Society of Arboriculture's twelve-point hazard evaluation
system. The Director of Public Works will administer this program and have
final judgment in all matters concerning the mitigation measures taken for
any tree deemed hazardous.
§ 327-16. Interference with City Shade Tree Committee.
It shall be unlawful for any person to prevent, delay or interfere with the
Geneva Shade Tree Committee, or any of its agents, while engaging in and
around the planting, cultivating, mulching, pruning, spraying or removing
of any street tree or park tree, as authorized in this article.
§ 327-17. Arborist's license and bond.
It shall be unlawful for any person or firm to engage in the occupation of

results in destruction or removal of a tree, the guilty party shall replace that
tree with a tree of equivalent value and species, or otherwise be subject to
provisions of § 327-19, hereby appended.
§ 327-19. Penalties for offenses.

off shall forfeit all payments made and the water shall not be turned on
again until all unpaid rents and charges are paid, together with a charge

applied for.
B. All persons desiring a water supply from the City shall employ a regular
licensed plumber to do the work. When the work is completed to the

will be considered as the agent of said owner while employed in the
§ 341-2 GENEVA CODE § 341-3
314:608
prosecution of the work of introducing water into the said premises,
and will not be recognized in any sense the agent of the Department of
Public Works or the City. Neither will the Department of Public Works
nor the City hold itself responsible for the acts of the said plumber.
B. The Department of Public Works will determine the size of the taps to
be inserted in any water main and the form and size of curb box to be
used under any application and permit, and will furnish such taps and
curb boxes at the expense of the applicant, to be paid for upon making
the application.
C. The work of inserting taps, tees or braces and connections in any water
main shall be done only by persons employed by the Department of
Public Works or by a competent plumber having a permit in writing
from the Superintendent to make such connections.
D. Owners desiring to introduce a water service pipe into their premises
will be required to extend said service at right angles with the main
pipe to the inside of the curbline of the street, at which point a metallic
curb cock and curb box shall be placed, of such form and construction
as shall be approved by the Department of Public Works. The top of said
curb box shall be placed on the grade of the sidewalk of the street, and
shall be kept at all times in perfect order and repair.
E. In cases where the curb boxes and street washers are set in flagging or
pavement of the sidewalk, the stones are to be neatly and accurately
cut, and top of the boxes set even with the surface of the pavement or
flagging; and in all other cases flush with the surface of the sidewalk.
F. Owners desiring to introduce water into any premises along or in front
of which water mains have not been laid must make application
therefor to the Department of Public Works.
G. The owner receiving a permit for the introduction of a water service
into his premises and the plumber doing the work will be required to
cause said service to be placed not less than four feet below the surface
of the earth at any point between the water main in the street and the
inside of the foundation wall of the building into which the water
service is introduced.
H. No water pipe which is to operate as a water main shall be laid in the
same trench with a sewer, either public or private, and no water service
pipe shall be laid in the same trench with a lateral sewer under any
circumstances.
I. The owner of the property, into which water is introduced by a service
pipe, will be required to maintain in perfect order and repair, at his own
expense, the said service pipe and its fixtures and appurtenances,
including all fixtures therein provided for delivering or supplying water
for any purpose and, in case said service and fixtures are not so kept in
perfect repair, the Department of Public Works may cut off the supply of
water therefrom without notice and collect the expenses incurred
§ 341-3 TANKS, UNDERGROUND § 341-3
314:609
against the premises, to be collected with the first bill of supply for
water that shall become due against said premises.
J. Specifications of service pipe.
(1) All service pipes from the water main to the curb box, up to and
including one inch bore, shall be of copper pipe of suitable quality
and strength or lead or tin lined lead pipe. Said lead pipe is to be of
the quality, strength and weight known as AAA and shall meet the
following minimum specifications:
1/2 inch, 3 lbs. per foot, 1 inch exterior diameter
5/8 inch, 3 1/2 lbs. per foot, 1.10 inch exterior diameter
3/4 inch, 4 7/8 lbs. per foot, 1.33 inch exterior diameter
1 inch, 6 lbs. per foot, 1.60 inch exterior diameter
(2) The said lead or copper service pipe shall have an excess of length
of not less than six inches above the length required to connect the
tap in the main and the curb cock, so as to produce a slack, the
greater part of which shall occur near the tap.
K. Just inside the basement wall of a building, into which the service pipe
extends, a stop and waste cock shall be conveniently located and
arranged so that the water may be drawn back and all the pipes within
the building emptied through said stop and waste by opening the
faucets at the highest point therein and allowing the air to enter said
pipes.
L. Water will be turned on to premises only after the plumber has
completed the work, as required by the rules. The curb cock controlling
any service shall not be left open by the plumber or any other person,
after connecting said service with street main, or after making any new
extension in unoccupied premises, so that the water may be supplied to
said premises, by said service, without a written permit from the
Superintendent. But in cases where the work is simple extension or
additional attachment in premises where the water is then in use, and
when a permit has been duly obtained for same, then the plumber may
leave the water on the premises and the owner will be charged for the
additional use from the date of the application.
M. In all cases where range or steam boilers are supplied with water, it is
understood and agreed that the Department of Public Works and the
City will not be liable for any damage which may result to any person or
premises from shutting off the water from any water main or service for
any purpose whatever, even in cases where no notice is given; but it is
the intention of the department when practicable to give suitable notice
of such shutting off to the consumer, and no deduction from water bills
will be made in consequence thereof.
N. Permission will not be granted to supply two or more buildings fronting
on the same street from a single tap, unless the service shall be divided
§ 341-3 GENEVA CODE § 341-3
314:610
at the curb and a separate service extended therefrom, controlled by
a separate curb cock for each service. In case only one of several
buildings occupies the frontage of a single lot and others are located in
the rear of the said front building, then permission may be granted to
supply all of the said buildings from one service, where the owner shall
pay for all the water used.
O. In case a double house or other building fronting on any street is to be
supplied with water, a separate service to each from the curb, and
controlled by a separate curb cock, will be required. But said double
house or building may be supplied by a single service where the owner
shall pay for the water used.
P. When water shall be supplied to more than one party through a single
tap, the bill for the water supply will be made to the owner of the
premises, and in case of nonpayment, the water may be shut off,
notwithstanding one or more of the parties may have paid their
proportion to such owner or to any other party.
Q. Whenever two or more parties are supplied with the same service pipe,
the failure of any one of the number to pay the water rates when due or
comply with any rule, shall authorize the Department of Public Works to
turn the water off from said pipe until rates, terms and conditions are
complied with.
R. It is understood and agreed that the Department of Public Works, their
agents and assistants, may enter the premises of any water-taker, at
any reasonable time, to examine the pipes and fixtures, the quantity of
water used and the manner of its use, and in case of fraudulent
representation on the part of any water-taker, or unnecessary waste of
water, the payment will be forfeited and the supply cut off.
S. In case of making repairs or constructing new work, the City and the
Department of Public Works reserve the right to shut off the water from
any consumer without notice and keep it shut off as long as may be
necessary.
T. The City and the Department of Public Works reserve the right to limit
the amount of water furnished to any consumer, should circumstances
seem to warrant such action, although no limit may be stated in the
application or permit for such use; or the Department of Public Works
may entirely cut off the use for any manufacturing purposes, or any use
for supplying power at any time, by giving reasonable notice to the
consumer of such intended action.
U. Unless said property has a fire suppression system wholly dependent
upon the public water source, the Director of Public works shall order
water service disconnected to any property ordered vacated and unfit
for human habitation by the Geneva Municipal Court or other court of
competent jurisdiction; said service not to be restored until the order is
lifted by the same court and upon payment of a reconnection fee of $25,

Masons and contractors shall not take water without a builder's permit
for every separate job, and any party suffering others to get water from
his premises, without first exhibiting a permit, will be held strictly liable.
When any person desires to use the City water at any premises for building
purposes of any description, the owner of such premises, or his agent
having such premises in charge, must, before using City water for such
purposes, make a regular application at the office of the Department of
Public Works for permission therefor, and agree to pay such rates
established therefor.
§ 341-6. Special uses.
No person shall use the City water for flushing sewers, settling earth
in ditches, or purposes of a like nature, without permission from the
Department of Public Works and paying for the same in advance.

as well as any outstanding water rates, sewer rents, and other
applicable fees. [Added 3-7-2012 by Ord. No. 2-2012]
A. Any consumer wishing to discontinue the use of water supplied from
the water works must give notice thereof at the office of the
Department of Public Works, and he will be charged for the use until
such notice is given.
B. Whenever water has been turned off by the Department of Public Works
for nonpayment of rents, or for purpose of repair or construction, or for
any other necessary or proper reason, no person will be permitted to
turn it on again who is not duly authorized to do so by the Department
of Public Works. And when water is turned off for nonpayment of rents
or for violation of any one rule or regulation contained herein or of the
Department of Public Works, it shall not be turned on again until the
party in default shall pay all water rents or other charges due and the
amount of $150 as a penalty for the discontinuance and restoration of
service. [Amended 8-7-2002 by Ord. No. 4-2002; 1-9-2013 by Ord.
No. 1-2013]

be exposed ready for tapping.
H. Printed forms of the notices required by the foregoing rules will be
furnished to the plumbers on application to the Superintendent of
Public Works.
A. All meter rates will be based on three months' consumption and,

and the water shall be turned off on account of nonpayment, no application
for water service for such premises shall be granted by the Department of
Public Works, notwithstanding that the said premises shall have changed
ownership in any way, until such sums shall have been paid in full to the

ARTICLE III
Lakefront District Planned Unit Development
[Added 5-6-1987 by Ord. No. 87-10]
§ 350-8. Intent; objectives; procedures; definitions.
A. Intent. The intent of this planned unit development (PUD) provision is
to encourage a greater degree of flexibility for development and to
provide a variety of residential and nonresidential activities in a
planned, controlled environment in a manner blending all land uses into
a functionally and aesthetically complementary whole. A planned unit
development proposal may contain both individual building sites and
common property which are proposed for development as an integrated
land use unit. A mix of light manufacturing/research development and
commercial uses may be included to provide employment opportunities
and enhancements to the tax base. Retail and service uses may be
included to provide for shopping needs.
(1) This article recognizes that while the standard zoning function (use
and bulk) and the subdivision function (platting and design) are
appropriate for the regulation of land use in areas or
neighborhoods that are already substantially developed, these
controls represent a type of preregulation, regulatory rigidity and
uniformity which may be inimical to the techniques of land
development contained in the planned unit development concept. A
rigid set of space requirements along with bulk and use
specifications would frustrate the application of this concept. Thus,
where PUD techniques are deemed appropriate through the
rezoning of land to a planned unit development district by the City
Council, the use and dimensional specifications elsewhere in the
codes of the City of Geneva are replaced by an approval process in
which an approved PUD plan becomes the basis for continuing land
use controls.
(2) As presented in this article, the planned unit development concept
is subdivided into two types of districts: a planned residential
development (PRD) and a planned commercial development (PCD),
each of which is subject to specific development requirements and
limitations. For purposes of interpretation, the term "planned unit
development" or "PUD" can be taken to mean planned residential
development or planned commercial development, as appropriate.
(3) While public lands in the Lakefront District do not qualify for
regulation under this article, it is the intent of the City that the site
planning criteria and guidelines which constitute the substance of
this article apply to any and all development on public lands in the
Lakefront Zoning District.
(4) This article is augmented and supplemented by Article IV,
Appearance Code for Lakefront Zoning District, which sets
standards and offers guidelines for architectural and site-related
§ 350-8 WIRES AND POLES § 350-8
346:667
aspects of appearance for development in both private parcels
and public lands within the Lakefront District as shown in the
attached Lakefront District Zoning Master Plan.62 The criteria of
the Appearance Code are applicable to the site plan review process
inherent in this article.
B. Objectives. To implement the intent of the planned unit development
provision, the following objectives must be met:
(1) A maximum choice in the types of environment, occupancy tenure
(e.g., cooperative, individual, condominium, or leasing), types of
housing, lot sizes and community facilities available to persons at
all economic levels.
(2) Provision of usable open space and recreation areas and
convenience in location of retail sales and service areas.
(3) A development pattern which preserves trees, enhances important
vistas and views, outstanding natural topography and geographic
features, and prevents soil erosion.
(4) A creative use of land and related physical development which
allows an orderly transition of land from rural areas.
(5) An efficient use of land resulting in smaller networks of utilities and
streets.
(6) A development pattern in harmony with the objectives of this
chapter.
(7) A more desirable environment than would be possible through the
strict application of other articles of this chapter.
(8) A mixture of land uses to enhance job creation and retention,
increase of tax base, and variety of settings.
C. Procedures overview.
(1) The classification of a property as a planned unit development
(PUD) requires the undertaking of a two-step process involving the
approval of both the Planning Board and the City Council.
(2) In the first step, the Planning Board responds initially to the
applicant's submission of a conceptual sketch plan and a general
outline that discusses the contemplated development for the PUD.
The Planning Board ensures compliance with the general
requirements of this article and directs the preparation of the
project plan narrative and graphic documentation.
(3) Upon approval of the concept sketch plan, the second step involves
application for the establishment of a planned unit development
62.Editor's Note: The Lakefront District Zoning Master Plan is on file in the City offices.
§ 350-8 GENEVA CODE § 350-8
346:668
district. This step is governed by the City Council and requires
a public hearing. In the case where the Planning Board files an
unfavorable advisory report with the City Council, the applicant
may request a separate review by the City Council.
(4) Subsequent to these first two approvals classifying the PUD, the
site plan review process requires that the applicant prepare
detailed preliminary and final site development plans which
conform to any conditions of approval established in the approval
of the initial concept sketch. All interpretation of land use
regulations related to the proposed PUD shall be determined by the
Planning Board.
D. District boundary definition.
(1) It is the intent of this article that planned unit development apply
only to the Lakefront Zoning District as delineated on the Official
Zoning Map63 of the City of Geneva.
(2) Modifications to the Lakefront Zoning District may be subsequently
determined and established by City Council.
(3) Generally, the boundaries of the Lakefront Zoning District are as
follows: Beginning at the point of intersection of the shoreline of
Seneca Lake and the Conrail right-of-way east of Hamilton Street,
north to the intersection of Linden and Washington Streets, east to
Exchange Street, north to Franklyn Street, east to the Conrail
right-of-way, north and east along the Conrail right-of-way to the
Ontario County line, south along the county line to a point 1,000
feet off shore in Seneca Lake, and thence along a line generally
1,000 feet from the high water mark to the point of beginning.
E. Master Plan. All references in this article to an official master plan
pertain to the attached Lakefront District Zoning Master Plan dated
March 27, 1987, which defines the permitted uses on a parcel-by-parcel
basis.64

land, exclusive of areas to be dedicated to the City for public
purposes and with the exception of parcels L-1, L-2, L-3, L-4 and
L-6 as shown in the Lakefront Zoning District Master Plan. Where
the applicant can demonstrate that the characteristics of his
holdings will meet the objectives of this section, the City Council
may consider projects with less acreage.
(2) All development parcels eligible for classification to PUD status are
shown on the Lakefront Zoning District Master Plan. A PUD district
may be enlarged to include other contiguous areas regardless of
their size. Such areas, if separated by a public or private right-of-
§ 350-8 WIRES AND POLES § 350-9
346:671
way, may be considered contiguous if in the opinion of the City
Council the continuity of development of the original PUD district
is maintained.
B. Ownership. The tract of land for a PUD may be owned, leased or
controlled either by a single person or corporation or by a group of
individuals or corporations. An application must be filed by the owner,
or jointly by the owners, of all property included in the project. In the
case of multiple ownership, the approved PUD plan is binding on all
owners.
C. Permitted uses. This subsection sets forth the uses approved for a
planned unit development. Such uses include and shall be limited to the
following, according to type of district:
(1) Planned residential development (PRD).

and uses accessory thereto, solely in conjunction with the
planned unit development.
(g) Under special authorization by the Planning Board, and
consistent with the objectives of this article, the following
retail sales and service uses may be allowed in a PRD:
[1] Convenience store.
[2] Drugstore.
[3] Laundromat.
(2) Planned commercial development (PCD).
(a) Retail sales and service uses.
(b) Business and professional offices.
(c) Light manufacturing.
§ 350-9 GENEVA CODE § 350-9
346:672
(d) Research and development facilities.
(e) Municipal uses.
(f) Educational uses.
(g) Marinas, marine services (not including boat storage), and
water-related recreation and commercial uses.
(h) Common public or private open space, park or recreation
areas, including walkways, sitting areas, courtyards and
plazas, arcades, shelters and similar recreational uses.
(i) Accessory uses on the same parcel with, and customarily
incidental to, any of the foregoing land uses, including offstreet
parking and loading areas, garages for commercial
vehicles, and storage areas for trash and refuse.
D. Mix of uses. The mix of permissible uses, scale of any such use, density
and general design standards shall be determined by the Planning
Board in its review of the project plan and pursuant to the provisions
set forth in this article.
E. Area limitations. Within the planned unit development, the following
percentage of the gross land area shall be devoted to specific uses:
(1) In a planned residential development, a maximum of 30% for all
residential uses, including all principal and accessory structures
but excluding any open space and recreation uses as defined in this
article and the space devoted to streets and required off-street
parking lots within the parcel.
(2) In a planned commercial development, a maximum of 70% for retail
sales and service, business offices, light manufacturing, research
facilities or a combination thereof. Said maximum shall include all
principal and accessory structures, and the parking and service
areas exclusively servicing such facilities within the parcel.
(a) On certain nonresidential development parcels shown on the
Lakefront Zoning District Master Plan, a minimum floor area to
gross lot area ratio shall be established by the Planning Board.
Such a minimum ratio will be calculated by the Board on the
basis of the applicant's proposed mix of uses as they relate to
parking and open space requirements and other general
requirements of this article.
[1] The following chart will be useful in calculating maximum
building coverage on a development site as it relates to
variable parking space requirements per 1,000 square feet
net floor area (refer to Subsection H of this section which
lists required parking according to type of land use) and as
it relates to various building scenarios in number of stories
(refer to height limitations in this article). Divide the
§ 350-9 WIRES AND POLES § 350-9
346:673
appropriate factor in the chart into the gross land area in
square feet to find the number of thousands of square feet
of allowable gross floor area, then divide by the number of
stories to find the actual building footprint square footage.
[2] In cases where parking requirements are related to
number of employees, the applicant must determine the
number of employees per 1,000 square feet net floor area
and convert to the appropriate parking count.

public open space and recreational uses as defined in this article.
This area shall exclude all streets, roads, and required parking
spaces within the parcel.
F. Density. This subsection pertains to the density of development of
residential land uses in the planned residential development. The base
residential unit density within the parcel shall be eight dwelling units
per acre in the case of single-family attached dwellings and 12 dwelling
§ 350-9 GENEVA CODE § 350-9
346:674
units per acre in the case of multifamily development. The maximum
average unit density should not exceed 10.8 dwelling units per acre.
To encourage development which meets the objectives of this article,
densities beyond the base density shall be permitted when additional
recreational improvements, open space, architectural character and
siting considerations are included in the project plan by the developer.
(See Appendix A.)
(1) The mix of residential units among single-family attached dwellings
and apartment buildings shall be determined by the Planning
Board, but no single type of residential use shall comprise more
than 65% of the total residential units.
(2) Additional requirements that apply to single-family attached
dwellings:
(a) There shall be no continuous group of more than eight dwelling
units or of more than 200 feet in total length.

shall be designed so that a single-family building is no closer
than 20 feet to any other single-family building and 50 feet to
any nonresidential buildings. A multifamily building may be no
closer than 40 feet to any single-family dwelling unit or other
multifamily unit and no closer than 50 feet to any
nonresidential building.
(b) Nonresidential. Front, rear and side yards for nonresidential
uses shall be designed so that a building is no closer than 40
feet to any other nonresidential building and 50 feet to any
residential building. For purposes of interpretation, a structure
which contains both residential and nonresidential uses shall
comply with nonresidential requirements.
(c) Accessory structures shall be no closer than 10 feet to the
principal structure with which they are associated and no
closer than 20 feet to any other principal structure and five
feet to any other accessory structure.
(2) Distance from parcel boundaries, streets and other paved areas.
The minimum distance between any point on a building and a
parcel boundary, a dedicated street right-of-way, private driveway
or parking lot shall not be less than 20 feet or the height of the
building, whichever is greater, in a residential district and 20 feet
or 1/2 the height of the building, whichever is greater, in a
nonresidential district.

loading areas for the various permitted uses in planned unit
development districts shall be provided as follows:
(1) Planned residential development.
(a) Single-family attached dwellings: 1.5 spaces per dwelling,
including one space in the driveway of each dwelling unit. In
addition to required off-street parking, all single-family
attached dwelling units shall be provided with a garage of
sufficient dimension to accommodate a single automobile.
(b) Multifamily: one space per efficiency or one-bedroom unit; 1.2
spaces per two-bedroom unit; and 1.5 spaces per threebedroom
unit. Carport and garage parking may be provided for
multifamily residential units on the basis of one space per
dwelling unit.
(c) Community center: one space per 200 square feet net floor
area.
(2) Planned commercial development.
(a) Retail sales and services: two spaces per 1,000 square feet net
floor area on site and one space per 1,000 square feet net floor

346:693
D. Application for preliminary site development plan approval. The site
plan review provided for is pursuant to the City Code and Charter
requirements. Preliminary site plan approval is a detailed submission
relatively near to construction. It would be advisable for the applicant
to have several information sessions with the Planning Board during the
preparation of these plans, analogous to pre-preliminary proceedings
encountered in subdivision review, so as to minimize the potential
conflicts that might arise upon the formal submission of application for
preliminary approval.
(1) Application for preliminary site plan approval shall be to the
Planning Board and shall be accompanied by the following
information prepared by a licensed engineer, architect and/or
landscape architect:
(a) An area map showing the applicant's entire holding, that
portion of the applicant's property under consideration, and all
properties, subdivisions, streets, and easements within 500
feet of the applicant's property.

(2) Planning Board review. The Planning Board's review of a
preliminary site plan shall include, but not be limited to, the
following considerations:
(a) Adequacy and arrangements of pedestrian traffic access and
circulation, including intersections, road widths,
channelization structures and traffic controls.
(b) Adequacy and arrangement of pedestrian traffic access and
circulation, including separation of pedestrian from vehicular
traffic, walkway structures, control of intersections with
vehicular traffic, and pedestrian convenience.
(c) Location, arrangement, appearance and sufficiency of offstreet
parking and loading.
(d) Location, arrangement, size and design of buildings, lighting

(l) Conformance with other specific charges of the City Council
which may have been stated in the zoning resolution.
(3) Referrals to other agencies. The Planning Board shall refer the
application for preliminary site plan approval to the Ontario County
Planning Agency within 30 days of receipt of application. The
Planning Board may call upon any other public or private
consultants that it feels are necessary to provide a sound review of
the proposal.
(4) Action on preliminary site plan application.
(a) Within 90 days of the receipt of the application for the
preliminary site plan approval, the Planning Board shall act on
it. The Planning Board may schedule a public hearing thereon
within 45 days of receipt of the application. If no decision is
made or public hearing scheduled within said forty-five-day
period, the preliminary site plan shall be considered
conditionally approved. Such time limits may be extended by
mutual consent of the applicant and Planning Board or as may
be required to provide for compliance with the State
Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA). The Planning
Board's action shall be in the form of a written statement to the
applicant stating whether or not the preliminary site plan is
conditionally approved. A copy of the appropriate minutes of
the Planning Board shall be a sufficient report.
(b) The Planning Board's statement may include conditions that
certain revisions be incorporated in the final site plan. Such
conditions shall be limited, however, to siting and dimensional
details within general use areas and shall not significantly alter
the PUD plan as it was approved in the previous sketch plan
review proceedings.
§ 350-10 GENEVA CODE § 350-10
346:696
(c) If the preliminary site plan is disapproved, the Planning
Board's statement shall contain the reasons for such findings.
In such a case the Planning Board may recommend further
study of the site plan and resubmission after it has been
revised or redesigned.
(d) No modification of existing stream channels, filling of lands
with a moderate to high susceptibility to flooding, grading or
removal of vegetation in areas with moderate to high
susceptibility to erosion, or excavation for and construction of
site improvements shall begin until the developer has received
preliminary site plan approval. Failure to comply shall be
construed as a violation of this chapter, and, where necessary,
final site plan approval may require the modification or
removal of site improvements.
(5) Request for changes in PUD zoning plan. If in the site plan
development it becomes apparent that certain elements of the PUD
plan, as it has been approved at the sketch plan stage, are
unfeasible and in need of significant modification, the applicant
shall then present his solution to the Planning Board as his
preliminary site plan in accordance with the above procedures. The
Planning Board shall then determine whether or not the modified
plan is still in keeping with the intent of the zoning resolution. If a
negative decision is reached, the site plan shall be considered as
disapproved. The developer may then, if he wishes, produce
another site plan in conformance with the recommended
modifications. If an affirmative decision is reached, the Planning
Board shall notify the City Council stating all of the particulars of
the matter and its reasons for feeling the project should be
continued as modified.
E. Application for final detailed site plan approval.
(1) General. After receiving conditional approval from the Planning
Board on a preliminary site plan, and approval for all necessary
permits and curb cuts from state and county officials, the applicant
may prepare his final detailed site plan and submit it to the
Planning Board for final approval, except that if no more than 12
months have elapsed between the time of the Planning Board's
report on the preliminary site plan and if the Planning Board finds
that conditions have changed significantly in the interim, the
Planning Board may require a resubmission of the preliminary site
plan for further review and possible revision prior to accepting the
proposed final site plan for review.
(2) Conformance. The final detailed site plan shall conform
substantially to the preliminary site plan that has received
preliminary site plan approval. It should incorporate any revisions
or other features that may have been required at the preliminary
§ 350-10 WIRES AND POLES § 350-10
346:697
review. All such compliances shall be clearly indicated by the
applicant on the appropriate submission.
(3) Final site plan contents. In addition to the requirement for
preliminary site plan approval, an application for final site plan
approval shall also contain:
(a) The final site plan at a scale of one inch equals 50 feet. Where
more than one sheet is required to show the entire
development, a key map shall be provided.
(b) The lines of existing and proposed streets and sidewalks
immediately adjoining and within the PUD.
(c) The names of existing and proposed streets.
(d) Typical cross sections of proposed streets and sidewalks.
(e) Profiles of proposed streets at suitable vertical scale showing
finished grades in relation to existing ground elevation.
(f) Layouts of proposed lots, including lot numbers and proposed
numbering system for buildings.
(g) The location and size of any existing and proposed sewers
(stormwater and/or sanitary), water mains, and pipes on the
property or into which any connection is proposed.
(h) Provisions for water supply and sewage disposal and evidence
that such provisions have received approval of the Department
of Health.
(i) Locations of survey monuments.
(j) A complete grading and drainage plan showing all existing and
proposed contours and elevations and the complete storm
drainage plan.
(k) A planting plan indicating locations, varieties, and minimum
sizes of trees to be planted and of existing trees to be
preserved. Existing wooded areas need not be itemized but
should be generally described.
(l) Brief specifications, or reference to City standards, for all
public facilities to be constructed or installed within the PUD.
(4) Documentation. The applicant shall prepare and submit all
documentation consistent with SEQRA guidelines and regulations,
as required by the Planning Board.
(5) Action of the final detailed site plan application. Within 45 days of
the receipt of the application for final site plan approval, the
Planning Board shall render a decision to the applicant. If no
§ 350-10 GENEVA CODE § 350-10
346:698
§ 350-11. Other regulations applicable to planned unit
developments.
decision is made within the time period, the final site plan shall be
considered approved.
(a) Upon approving an application, the Planning Board shall
endorse its approval on a copy of the final site plan and shall
forward it to the Building Inspector, who shall then issue a
building permit to the applicant if the project conforms to all
other applicable requirements.
(b) Upon disapproving an application, the Planning Board shall so
inform the Building Inspector. The Planning Board shall also
notify the applicant and the City Council in writing of its
decision and its reasons for disapproval. A copy of the
appropriate minutes may suffice for this notice.
(6) Staging. If the applicant wishes to stage the PUD development,
then he may submit only those stages he wishes to develop for site
plan approval in accordance with his staging plan. Any plan which
requires more than 24 months to be completed shall be required to
be staged and a staging plan must be developed. It is the intent of
this article that individual stages of the PUD will have an integrity
of use in their own right so that if for any reason the entire PUD
would not be completed, those portions of the PUD already
constructed will be an asset to the community by themselves.
Staging plans must take account of this objective, and developers
proposing individual stages that deviate significantly from the
overall character of the PUD should present convincing evidence
that such a stage is in keeping with this section.
A. Regulation after initial construction and occupancy.
(1) For the purposes of regulating development and use of property
after initial construction and occupancy, any changes other than
use changes shall be processed as a special permit request to the
Planning Board. Properties lying in planned unit development
districts are unique and shall be so considered by the Planning
Board when evaluating these requests, and maintenance of the
intent and function of the planned unit shall be of primary
importance.
(2) All changes in floor area of a principal or accessory structure will
require a building permit.
B. Site plan review. Site plan review under the provisions of this article
shall suffice for Planning Board review of subdivisions under the City
Subdivision Regulations,67 subject to the following conditions:
67.Editor's Note: See Ch. 310, Subdivision of Land.
§ 350-10 WIRES AND POLES § 350-11
346:699
(1) The applicant shall prepare sets of subdivision plats suitable for
filing with the office of the Ontario County Clerk in addition to
those drawings required above.
(2) The applicant shall plat the entire development as a subdivision;
however, planned unit developments being developed in stages
may be platted and filed in the same stages.
(3) Final site plan approval under this article shall constitute final plat
approval under the City Subdivision Regulations and provisions of
the City Law.
C. District amendments and modifications.
(1) Modifications. Except as otherwise may be provided by the
Planning Board, all land use activities situated within and in
existence on the effective date of a final site plan approval or
developed in accordance with an approved project plan as provided
herein shall be subject to the issuance of a project plan amendment
by the Planning Board in the event of the following:
(a) Change in or location of enumerated land uses.
(b) Demolition of a principal structure, except where mandated by
the building official in the interest of public safety.
(c) Establishment of new streets or other public/common areas.
(d) Any changes which may otherwise be regulated by the
adoption of controls made specifically applicable to such
district, either at its inception or subsequently.
(2) District amendments and miscellaneous modifications. Except as
otherwise provided, any modification not addressed above shall be
reviewed and approved by the Planning Board prior to the issuance
of permits for construction.

§ 350-14. Site planning and design.
A. Relationship of buildings to sites.
(1) The site shall be planned to accomplish a desirable transition from
buildings to the lake and to the streetscape and to provide for
adequate planting, safe pedestrian movement, and parking areas.
§ 350-13 WIRES AND POLES § 350-14
346:703
(2) Site planning in which setbacks and yards are in excess of zoning
restrictions is encouraged to provide an interesting relationship
between buildings.
(3) Parking areas shall be treated with decorative elements, building
wall extensions, plantings, berms, or other innovative means to
minimize views from public walkways, streets, drives and park
areas.
(4) Without restricting the permissible limits of the applicable zoning
district, the height and scale of each building shall be compatible
with its site and existing (or anticipated) adjoining buildings.
(5) Buildings should be sited to capitalize on views of the lake while at
the same time preserving visual access to the lake from Routes 5
and 20 as much as practicable.
(6) Building siting should consider building massing with respect to
the existing skyline of the City as viewed from the lake and from the
opposite shore.
(7) Newly installed utility services, and service revisions necessitated
by exterior alterations, shall be underground.
B. Relationship of buildings and site to adjoining area.
(1) Adjacent buildings of significantly different architectural styles
should be made compatible by such means as screens, sight breaks,
and plant materials.
(2) Attractive landscape transition to adjoining properties should be
provided.
(3) Harmony in texture, lines, and masses is required. Monotonous
repetition of forms and materials shall be avoided.
C. Landscape and site treatment. Landscape elements included in these
criteria consist of all forms of planting and vegetation, ground forms,
rock groupings, water patterns, and all visible construction except
buildings and utilitarian structures.
(1) Where natural or existing topographic patterns contribute to
beauty and utility of a development, they shall be preserved and
developed. Modification to topography is encouraged where it
contributes to attractive spatial and architectural composition.
(2) Grades of walks, parking spaces, terraces, and other paved areas
shall provide an inviting and stable appearance for walking and,
where seating is provided, for sitting.
(3) Landscape planting shall be provided to enhance architectural
features, strengthen vistas and important axes, and provide shade.
Spectacular effects shall be reserved for special focal points.
§ 350-14 GENEVA CODE § 350-14
346:704
(4) Unity of site design shall be achieved by repetition of certain plant
varieties and forms, paving materials, and site furniture, and by
correlation with adjacent developments.
(5) Plant material shall be selected for interest in its structure, texture,

detrimental and harmful impacts and effects within the City of
Geneva, and particularly on residential neighborhoods and
community business areas. Such impacts and effects include but
are not limited to decreased property values; creation of traffic
and/or parking problems due to the attraction of transients;
potential increases in criminal activities; loss of business by nonadult-

uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious impacts and effects
identified above which may result from the location and operation
of such establishments.

limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative
materials, including sexually explicit or sexually oriented materials,
nor is it the purpose or intent of this section to restrict or deny
access by adults to sexually explicit or sexually oriented materials,
activities, performances or depictions protected by the First
Amendment to the United States Constitution, or to deny access by
distributors and/or exhibitors of sexually explicit or sexually
oriented materials or entertainment to their intended market.
However, it is also not the purpose or intent of this section to
condone or legitimize the display or distribution of obscene
materials.
B. Such a use may not be established except in accordance with the
provisions of the City of Geneva Municipal Code, and subject to the
following conditions and criteria, which shall be in addition to and
supplementary to those matters which the Planning Board is to

those matters which the Zoning Board of Appeals is to consider in
reviewing a special use permit application under § 350-53 of this
chapter.

specified above shall be made in a straight line, without regard to
intervening structures or objects, from the nearest portion of the
building or structure used or operated for such a use to the nearest
property line or boundary of an affected use, as listed in Subsection
D(1) through (6) above, provided that for purposes of Subsection E
above, the distance between any two adult use establishments shall be
measured in a straight line, without regard to intervening structures or
objects, between the closest exterior walls of the structures in which
each such use is located.
H. All such uses:
(1) Shall be conducted in an enclosed building.
(2) Shall be conducted in such a manner that, regardless of location or
distance, no one who is passing by or who is at any point outside of
the enclosed building occupied by such a use shall be able to

years after such date of enactment, except that existing signs on the
property of a legal nonconforming use may be continued if they
conform to signs in the district where such use is permitted.
B. Any undeveloped lot in a subdivision which was not properly approved
by the Planning Board and/or not filed in the office of the County Clerk

land with minor improvements is discontinued or the active operation of
substantially all the nonconforming uses in any building or other
structure is discontinued, such land or building or other structure shall
thereafter be used only for a conforming use. Intent to resume active
operation shall not affect the foregoing. The provisions of this
subsection shall not apply if such discontinuance of active operations is
directly caused by war, strike or other labor difficulties, a governmental
program of materials rationing, or the construction of a duly authorized
improvement project by a governmental body or a public utility

Ord. No. 88-2; amended 6-5-1995 by Ord. No. 7-95]
A. Legislative findings; purpose. The City Council hereby finds that
inappropriate or poor quality design in the exterior appearance of
buildings or land development adversely affects the desirability of the
immediate area and neighboring areas, impairs the stability and value
of both improved and unimproved real property, retards the most
appropriate development, and creates an improper relationship
between the taxable value of real property in such areas and the cost of
municipal services provided therefor. It is the purpose of this section to
prevent these and other harmful effects of such exterior appearance of
buildings and development and thus to promote and protect the health,
safety, morals and general welfare of the community.
B. The Planning Board of the City of Geneva (hereinafter referred to as the
"Board") is hereby authorized to act as the Architectural Review
Committee of the City of Geneva.
C. The Planning Board shall review all applications for building permits
and/or site plans in the following categories:
(1) All applications for the construction, reconstruction or exterior
alteration of any commercial, industrial or multiple-dwelling
building or structure.
(2) Applications for new residential structures and/or subdivisions filed
with the Planning Board.
(3) Plans for exterior alterations or additions to residential,
commercial or industrial structures or facilities requiring a
building permit, for which the cost is estimated to be in excess of
$5,000.
(4) All site development applications submitted to the Planning Board.
(5) Petitions for special permit uses, when architectural review advice
on such a petition is requested by the Zoning Board of Appeals.
(6) Any building permit applications or proposals which in the opinion
of the enforcement officer violate the spirit and intent of
Subsection A. In the event that such a referral is made, the
enforcement officer shall issue a specific written finding as to why
he or she believes this to be the case.
D. Applications must be accompanied by plans showing all elevations of
new structures, as well as any affected elevations in the case of new
additions or alterations. When required by the enforcement officer or
by the Board, a site plan shall be submitted showing both existing and
proposed contours at five-foot intervals, all existing trees with a trunk
diameter of four inches or more at a height six feet above ground level,
§ 350-45 GENEVA CODE § 350-45
346:756
and whether such trees shall remain or be removed, and/or other
topographical features.
E. Procedures.
(1) Approval of any application referred to the Board shall be by a vote
of at least a majority of the members.
(2) In considering an application, the Board shall take into account
natural features of the site and surroundings, the exterior design
and appearance of existing structures, and the character of the
district and its particular suitability for particular purposes, with a
view to conserving the values of property and encouraging the
most appropriate use of the land.
(3) The Board may approve any application referred to it upon finding,
in writing, that the building or structure for which the permit was
requested, if erected or altered in accordance with the submitted
plan, would be in harmony with the purpose of this section, would
not be visually offensive or inappropriate by reason of poor quality
of exterior design, excessive similarity or striking dissimilarity in
relation to the site or its surroundings, would not mar the
appearance of the area, would not be detrimental to the character
of the neighborhood, would not prevent the most appropriate
development and utilization of the site or of the adjacent lands and
would not adversely affect the functioning, economic stability,
prosperity, health, safety and general welfare of the entire
community.
(4) In approving any application, the Board may impose appropriate
conditions and safeguards designed to prevent the harmful effects
set forth in Subsection E(3).
(5) The Board may disapprove any application, provided that the Board
has afforded the applicant an opportunity to confer upon
suggestions for change of the plan, and provided that the Board
finds and states, in writing, that the structure for which the permit
was requested would, if erected as indicated, provoke one or more
of the harmful effects set forth in Subsection E(3).
F. Standards. The Board shall apply the following standards in the course
of its review:
(1) Architectural style is not restricted. Evaluation of the appearance
of a project shall be based on the quality of its design and
relationship to its surroundings.
(2) The height, width, and general proportions of a building should
conform generally to other buildings in the district. Ratio of wall
surface to openings, and the ratio of width and height of windows
and doors, should also be consistent with the district. The scale and
massing of a structure shall be a primary consideration.
§ 350-45 WIRES AND POLES § 350-45
346:757
(3) Materials shall have good architectural character and shall be
selected for harmony of the building with the adjoining buildings.
Materials shall be selected for suitability to the type of building and
the design in which they are used. Buildings shall have the same
materials, or those that are architecturally harmonious, used for all
building walls and other exterior building elements wholly or partly
visible from public ways. Materials shall be of a durable quality. In
any design in which the structural frame is exposed to view, the
structural materials shall be compatible within the design and
harmonious with their surroundings.
(4) Building components, such as windows, doors, eaves and parapets,
shall have good proportions and relationships to one another.
(5) Colors shall be harmonious and shall use only compatible accents.
(6) Mechanical equipment or other utility hardware on the roof,
ground or buildings shall be screened from public view with
materials harmonious with the building, or they shall be located so
as not to be visible from any public ways.
(7) Exterior lighting shall be considered as part of the architectural
concept. Fixtures, standards and all exposed accessories shall be
harmonious with the building design.
(8) Refuse and waste removal areas, service yards, storage yards and
exterior work areas shall be screened from view from public ways,
using materials harmonious with the building.
(9) Monotony of design in single- or multiple-building projects shall be
avoided. Variation of detail, form and siting shall be used to provide
visual interest. In multiple-building projects, variable siting of
individual buildings may be used to prevent a monotonous
appearance.
(10) Signs. Every sign shall have good scale and proportion in its design
and in its visual relationship to buildings and the surroundings.
Every sign shall be designed as an integral architectural element of
the building and site to which it principally relates.
(11) The pattern of placement, proportions and materials of windows
and doors shall be considered. Metal or plastic frame windows are
generally unacceptable unless they are anodized or painted.
Shutters should be sized to match windows.
(12) The use of natural materials is to be favored. Imitation or synthetic
materials, such as aluminum or vinyl siding, imitation brick or
stone, or plastic, will generally be deemed inappropriate. Wood or
asphalt shingles are appropriate. Roll roofing, built-up tar and
gravel, plastic or fiberglass roofing materials are not appropriate,
unless utilized on flat roofs that are not visible from public ways.
§ 350-45 GENEVA CODE § 350-45
346:758
§ 350-46. Issuance of building permit.
(13) Where fences are to be used, they are to be of wood, stone, iron or
plant materials. Chain link or similar metal fences, concrete block,
plastic, fiberglass or plywood fences will generally be deemed
inappropriate.
(14) Exposed foundation walls should be of stone-faced or exposed
aggregate concrete and should be as inconspicuous as possible.
(15) Utility lines should be underground whenever possible, and entry
fixtures should be located away from high-use areas and main
entrances or screened in an approved manner. All lighting should
be appropriate to the building and its surroundings in terms of
style, scale and intensity of illumination.
A. The enforcement officer shall examine or cause to be examined all
applications for permits and the plans, specifications and documents
filed therewith. He shall approve or disapprove the application within a
reasonable time and subject to all other requirements and procedures
of this chapter and any other ordinance, local law, rule or regulation of
the City.
B. Upon approval of the application and upon receipt of the legal fees
therefor, he shall issue a building permit to the applicant upon the form
prescribed to him and shall affix his signature or cause his signature to
be affixed thereto.
C. Upon approval of the application, both sets of plans and specifications
shall be endorsed with the word "Approved." One set of such approved
plans and specifications shall be retained in the files of the enforcement
officer and the other set shall be returned to the applicant together with
the building permit and shall be kept at the building site open to
inspection by the enforcement officer or his authorized representative
at all reasonable times. The building permit shall be posted upon the
premises in a conspicuous place so as to be visible from the street
throughout the period of construction.
D. If the application, together with the plans, specifications and other
documents filed therewith, describes proposed work which does not
conform to all of the requirements of the applicable building and zoning
regulations, the enforcement officer shall disapprove the same and
shall return the plans and specifications to the applicant. Upon the
request of the applicant, the enforcement officer shall cause such a
refusal, together with the reasons therefor, to be transmitted to the
applicant in writing.

mortgage or upon said building becoming vacant, no two-family
dwelling, no mixed occupancy containing two or more families and

Inspector certifying that said dwelling conforms to the
§ 350-50 WIRES AND POLES § 350-51
346:763
requirements of the City of Geneva Minimum Housing and/or

Inspector in his discretion may issue a certificate of occupancy
with conditions where:
[1] The subject dwelling is in compliance with this chapter;
[2] The subject dwelling is near substantial compliance with
the codes, ordinances and rules; and
[3] The work required to bring the dwelling into full
compliance is not essential to making the building
habitable.
(b) Temporary certificate of occupancy. Upon request of the owner
or his certified agent, the Building Inspector may, in his
discretion, issue a temporary certificate of occupancy provided
there is full compliance with this chapter and such temporary

property.
(4) No change shall be made in the use or type of occupancy of an
existing building unless a certificate of occupancy shall have been
issued by the enforcement officer.
(5) Certificates of occupancy shall be applied for coincident with the
application for a building permit, and no building permit shall be
issued until application shall have been made for a certificate of
occupancy.
C. Issuance of certificate of occupancy.

been completed in accordance with the applicable building and
zoning laws, ordinances and regulations, and also in accordance
with the application, plans and specifications filed in connection
with the issuance of the building permit, the enforcement officer
shall issue a certificate of occupancy upon the form provided by
him. If it is found that the proposed work has not been properly
completed, the enforcement officer shall refuse to issue a
certificate of occupancy and shall order the work completed in
conformity with the building permit and in conformity with the
applicable building and zoning regulations.
§ 350-51 GENEVA CODE § 350-51
346:764
(2) The certificate of occupancy shall certify that the work has been
completed and that the proposed use and occupancy are in
conformity with the provisions of the applicable building laws,
ordinances and regulations and shall specify the use or uses and
the extent thereof to which the building or structure or its several
parts may be put, except that such certificate of occupancy shall
not be considered as certification of location of lot boundaries or
property division lines.
D. Temporary certificate of occupancy. Upon request, the enforcement
officer may issue a temporary certificate of occupancy for a building or
structure, or part thereof, before the entire work covered by the
building permit shall have been completed provided such portions as
have been completed may be occupied safely without endangering life
or the public welfare.
E. Tests. Whenever there are reasonable grounds to believe that any
material, construction, or equipment or the location of a building or
structure does not conform to the requirements of the applicable
building laws, ordinances or regulations, the enforcement officer may
require the same to be subjected to tests and measurements in order to
furnish proof of such compliance prior to the issuance of a certificate of
occupancy.
F. Fee. The fee for the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for residential
property shall be consistent with the inspection fees established in
§ 202-79 and shall be paid to the enforcement officer prior to issuance.
The fee for the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for nonresidential
property shall be $25 and shall be paid prior to issuance. If the property
contains both residential and nonresidential occupancies, the charge
shall be the sum of two fees. If the certificate of occupancy is issued in
conjunction with a building permit for new construction work, there
shall be no fee in addition to that charged for the building permit.

§ 350-59. Powers and duties of Commission.
A. Creation of Commission. In order to execute the purposes declared in
this article, there is hereby created a commission to be called the
"Historic Districts and Structures Commission."
B. Membership of the Commission.
(1) The Historic Districts and Structures Commission shall consist of
seven members whose residences are located in the City of Geneva.
They shall be appointed by the City Council of the City of Geneva
for terms of office of three years, provided that two of the initial
members shall be appointed for one year, two for two years and
three for three years, and subsequently members shall be
appointed for terms of three years as terms expire. Members of the
Commission may be reappointed after their terms expire. The
terms of office of the members shall begin as of the date of passage
of this article.
(2) Before making said appointments, the City Council shall request
the Board of Directors of the Geneva Historical Society for
recommendations. In no event is the City Council required to
accept any recommendations so made to it. A vacancy occurring in
the membership of the Commission for any cause shall be filled by a
person appointed by the City Council for the unexpired term. The
members of the Commission shall serve without compensation.
A. The Commission, in reviewing applications for certificates of
appropriateness, shall consider the appropriateness of proposed
exterior features of buildings, structures and appurtenant fixtures,
location on the lot and removal or demolition of any building or
structure under authority of said Commission, where such exterior
features, buildings, structures and appurtenances are subject to public
view from a public street or way. All plans, elevations and other
information deemed necessary by the Commission to determine the
appropriateness of the exterior features or buildings in question shall
be made available to it by the applicant. In reviewing the plans, the
Commission shall give consideration to:
(1) Historical architectural value and significance of the structure and
its relationship to the historic value of the surrounding area;
(2) The general compatibility of exterior design, arrangement, texture
and materials proposed to be used; and
(3) Any other factor, including aesthetic, which it deems pertinent.
B. The Commission shall pass only on exterior features of a structure and
will not consider interior arrangements, nor shall it disapprove
applications except in regard to considerations as set forth in the
previous subsection.
§ 350-58 WIRES AND POLES § 350-59
346:773
§ 350-60. Procedures and rules of Commission.
C. It is also the intent of this article that the Commission shall be lenient in
its judgment of plans for new construction or for alteration, repair or
demolition of structures of little historic value, except when such
construction, alteration, repair or demolition would seriously impair the
historic value and character of surrounding structures or the
surrounding area. It is not the intent of this article to limit new
construction, alteration or repair to any one period of architectural
style, but rather to preserve an aesthetic whole.
D. Nothing contained in this article shall be construed to prevent the
ordinary maintenance or repair of any exterior architectural feature in
either the historic districts or on designated structures of historic and
architectural importance which does not involve a change in design,
material, color or the outward appearance thereof.
E. The Commission shall have the power to call in experts to aid in its
deliberations and may ask the Council for appropriations for such
services.
F. The Commission shall have the power to issue a certificate of approval
if it approves of the plans submitted to it for its review. The
Superintendent of Building and Zoning shall not issue a building permit
until such certificate of approval has been issued by the Commission.
A. The Historic Districts and Structures Commission shall elect from its
membership annually a Chairman and Vice-Chairman from its own
number.
B. The Chairman shall preside over the Commission and shall have the
right to vote. The Vice-Chairman shall, in cases of absence or disability
of the Chairman, perform the duties of the Chairman.
C. All Commission members shall have voting rights. The Commission may
adopt rules and regulations not inconsistent with the provisions of this
article.
D. The Commission shall adopt rules which shall provide for the time and
place of holding regular meetings. It shall provide for the calling of
special meetings by the Chairman or by at least three members of the
Commission.
E. At least four members of the Commission shall constitute a quorum for
the transaction of its business.
F. All meetings of the Commission shall be open to the public, and any
person or his duly constituted representative shall be entitled to appear
and be heard on any matter before the Commission before it reaches its
decision.
§ 350-59 GENEVA CODE § 350-60
346:774
§ 350-61. Procedure for review of plans.
G. The Commission shall be furnished with a secretary by the City who
shall keep a record of all resolutions, proceedings and actions of the
Commission. This shall constitute a record which shall be open to public
view. The concurring affirmative vote of four members shall constitute
approval of plans before it for review or for the adoption of any
resolution, motion or other action of the Commission.
A. Application for a building permit to construct, alter, repair, move or
demolish any structure in the historic districts or one of the specific
historic buildings and structures shall be made to the Superintendent of
Building and Zoning. The application shall state whether the property is
in an historic district or listed as an historic designated structure in
§ 350-56B. Plans shall be submitted showing the structure in question
and also showing its relation to adjacent structures.
B. Upon the filing of such application, the Superintendent of Building and
Zoning shall immediately notify the Historic Districts and Structures
Commission of the receipt of such application and shall transmit it
together with accompanying plans and other information to the
Commission unless it pertains solely to the interior of the structure.
C. The Historic Districts and Structures Commission shall meet within 15
days after notification by the Superintendent of Building and Zoning of
the filing, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon by the applicant and
Commission, and shall review the plans according to the duties and
powers specified herein. In reviewing the plans, the Commission may
confer with the applicant for the building permit.
D. The Commission shall approve or disapprove such plans and, if
approved, shall issue a certificate of approval, which is to be signed by
the Chairman, attached to the application for a building permit and
immediately transmitted to the Superintendent of Building and Zoning.
The Chairman shall also stamp all prints submitted to the Commission
signifying its approval.
E. If the Commission disapproves of such plans, it shall state its reasons
for doing so and shall transmit a record of such action and reasons
therefor in writing to the Superintendent of Building and Zoning and to
the applicant. The Commission may advise what it thinks proper if it
disapproves of the plans submitted. The applicant, if he so desires, may
make modification to his plans and shall have the right to resubmit his
application at any time after so doing.
F. The failure of the Historic Districts and Structures Commission to
approve or disapprove of such plans within 45 days from the date of
application for the building permit, unless otherwise mutually agreed
upon by the applicant and Commission, shall be deemed to constitute
approval, and the Superintendent of Building and Zoning shall proceed
to process the application without regard to a certificate of approval.
§ 350-60 WIRES AND POLES § 350-61
346:775
§ 350-62. Appeals.
Any person or persons jointly or severally aggrieved by a decision of the
Historic Districts and Structures Commission which shall result in the
failure of the Superintendent of Building and Zoning to issue a building
permit shall have the right to appeal to the Zoning Board of Appeals for a
variance as provided by this chapter and seek such other remedies as may
be provided for by this chapter or general law.

swimming pool is a ladder, or a device that must be removed when
the pool is not in use or attended.
(3) All gates or doors opening through a fence surrounding a pool shall
be equipped with a self-closing and self-latching device for keeping
the gate or door securely closed at all times when not in actual use,
except that the door of any dwelling, house or accessory building
which forms a part of the enclosure need not be so equipped. Any
such gate or door shall be kept locked while the swimming pool is
not under the direct supervision of a responsible individual who is
18 years of age or older.
(4) All equipment or mechanical devices pertinent to and in the
general vicinity of a pool relying on electrical power sources shall
be of single-phase, one-hundred-twenty-volt, three-wire
construction directly grounded to the ground system of the house
or the source of power.
(5) In the course of pool maintenance the emptying or discharging of
the contents of the pool shall be controlled in such a manner as not

Traditional Urban Design District
[Adopted 3-14-2007 by Ord. No. 1-2007]
§ 351-1. Legislative findings; intent.
§ 351-2. Purpose; design elements.
A. Findings.
(1) The City of Geneva is a destination city providing a high quality of
urban life enhanced by cultural, recreational, educational, and
economic opportunities; and
(2) The City's 1998 Master Plan recognizes that among the City's
unique assets is "a spatially and visually defined downtown that
highlights the geographic center of the community;" and that
"Geneva's downtown is the social and functional center of the City .
. . . well-defined and historic in character"; and
(3) The Master Plan recommends that the City of Geneva designate the
core downtown area as a Traditional Urban Design District to
conserve the architectural character of downtown by developing
"methods to preserve existing historic buildings and ensure that
new development conforms to the existing character"; and
(4) A Traditional Urban Design District will promote economic viability,
offer a diverse urban lifestyle, and help position the City as a
regional center;
B. As recommended by the Master Plan, a Traditional Urban Downtown
District (TUDD) shall be created as an overlay zoning district in the core
downtown area.
A. The purpose of the TUDD is to conserve the existing unique assets of
Geneva's historic urban center and to encourage new development that
enhances the traditional urban design and character of its downtown.
B. The elements of a Traditional Urban Design District are as follows:
(1) Pedestrian-oriented: characterized by a concentration of
commercial, office, civic, cultural and residential uses all within
walking distance of one another, which creates a working, growing
and attractive business center full of vitality and pedestrian
activity.
(2) Traditional mid-nineteenth through early-twentieth century urban
streetscape: characterized by zero side and lot line setbacks, zero
sidewalk setbacks, common walls between buildings, and buildings
that are at least two stories high. Lighting, benches, and signage
are geared toward encouraging pedestrian interest by
complementing the building's design. Parking is provided on the

§ 351-8. Building location.
Building location regulations are as follows:
§ 351-9. Demolition of buildings in TUDD.
§ 351-10. Guidelines.
Traditional Urban Design Guidelines have been developed in accordance
with the Master Plan to provide recommended standards to enable the City,
property owners, and prospective property owners to "preserve existing
historic buildings" when implementing general maintenance and repairs,
and to "ensure that new development conforms to the existing character."
These guidelines are not a part of this article. The Guidelines are intended
to convey desirable elements. They are recommendations, not
requirements.
A. Building fronts at the sidewalk.
B. The minimum lot coverage is 50%.
C. New construction and infill buildings must maintain the existing
alignment of facades along the street front. Exceptions may be granted
by the Planning Board as long as the setback is pedestrian-oriented and
contributes to the character of the streetscape.
A. An application for demolition of any building within the TUDD shall be
subject to a hearing prior to issuance of a demolition permit by the
Code Enforcement Office. A public hearing on the application shall be
held by City Council at its next regularly scheduled meeting upon notice
published within seven days of filing the application for demolition.
B. The purpose of the hearing shall be to notify the public of the pending
application, and to receive public comment on the issue of whether it is
in the public interest that the building be preserved and to allow for
solutions to demolition to be explored.
C. No permit for demolition shall be issued by the Code Enforcement
Office until at least 45 days after the filing of the application for
demolition.
D. The provisions of this section of the article may be waived by the Code
Enforcement Office if a building is damaged or destroyed in whole or in
part by fire or other catastrophe to the extent that it cannot be repaired,
or the building must be demolished for immediate emergency health
and public safety reasons, as determined by the Fire Department or
others considered by the Code Enforcement Office to be qualified to
assess the damage. In such instances, the building may be rebuilt in its
original form.
