ADOPTING ORDINANCE NO.                
AN ORDINANCE TO ADOPT THE 2000 CODIFIED ORDINANCES AND DECLARING AN EMERGENCY.
WHEREAS, the City has previously determined that it is necessary to have the
City=s ordinances recodified; and
WHEREAS, it has heretofore entered into a contract with the Walter H.  Drane
Company to prepare and publish such recodification, and
WHEREAS, the recodification of such ordinances, together with the new matter to
be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed are before the
Council,
NOW, THEREFORE, be it ordained by the Council of the City of Port Clinton,
Ottawa County, Ohio:
Section 1.  The ordinances of the City of Port Clinton, Ohio, of a general and
permanent nature, as revised, recodified, rearranged and consolidated into
component codes, titles, chapters and sections within the 2000 Codified
Ordinances of Port Clinton, Ohio are hereby approved and adopted.
Section 2.  The provisions of this Ordinance, including all provisions of the
Codified Ordinances, shall be in full force and effect from and immediately
after passage of this Ordinance.  All ordinances and resolutions or parts
thereof enacted prior to January 1, 2000, which are inconsistent with any
provision of the Codified Ordinances, are hereby repealed as of the effective
date of this Ordinance, except the enactment of the Codified Ordinances shall
not be construed to affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any
legislative provision prior to the effective date of such enactment, or an
action or proceeding for the enforcement of such right or liability.  Such
enactment shall not be construed to relieve any person from punishment for an
act committed in violation of any such legislative provision, nor to affect an
indictment or prosecution therefor.  For such purposes, any such legislative
provision shall continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the
purpose of revision and recodification.
Section 3.  The Clerk of Council, pursuant to Ohio R.C. 731.23, shall cause to
be published in a manner required by law a summary of the new matter contained
in the Codified Ordinances.  All sections of the Codified Ordinances without a
previous ordinance or resolution history at the end thereof indicate that the
section contains new matter ordained by this Adopting Ordinance.
Section 4.  That through authentication and approval of this Ordinance, the
Mayor and Clerk of Council shall certify that the permanent and general
ordinances of the City as codified therein are correctly set forth and
constitute the Codified Ordinances of Port Clinton, 2000.
Section 5.  This Ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure
necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, welfare and safety
for the reason that there exists an imperative necessity for the earliest
publication and distribution of the 2000 Codified Ordinances to the officials
and residents of the City, so as to facilitate administration, daily operation
and avoid legal entanglements including conflict with general State law. 
Wherefore, this Ordinance shall take effect and be in full force and effect
immediately upon its passage and approval by the Mayor.

EDITOR'S NOTE
     The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification.  Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number.  For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06.  The code
and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding
the first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all
digits left of the decimal.  The section number appears right of the decimal. 
As another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number
is 113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
     This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in
allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion.  Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation.  Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code.  Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections.  For example, newly
created 575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be
placed in their logical position.
 
Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in the
section.  The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code.  Sections without histories indicate
that the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting
Ordinance which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances.  It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections.  Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

month as the day of the month from which the computation is begun, unless there
are not that many days in the concluding month, in which case the period ends
on the last day of that month.
         (ORC 1.45)
      (3)   The time within which an act is required by law to be done shall be
computed by excluding the first and including the last day, except that when
the last day falls on Sunday or a legal holiday, then the act may be done on
the next succeeding day which is not a Sunday or a legal holiday.
   When a public office, in which an act required by law is to be performed, is
closed to the public for the entire day which constitutes the last day for
doing such act or before its usual closing time on such day, then such act may

   (f)   Exceptions.  The rules of construction shall not apply to any law

101.04  REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred there under;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;
      (4)   Affect any investigation, proceeding or remedy in respect of any
such privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment; and
the investigation, proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or
enforced, and the penalty, forfeiture or punishment imposed, as if the
ordinance had not been repealed or amended.
   (d)   If the penalty, forfeiture or punishment for any offense is reduced by
a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or
punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed according to the ordinance
as amended.
(ORC 1.58)
101.05  CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (a)   A reference to any portion of the Codified Ordinances applies to all
re-enactments or amendments thereof.
(ORC 1.55)
   (b)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
the last numbers or letters are included.
(ORC 1.56)
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)
101.06  CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both.  If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each.  If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails.  The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable.  Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
101.07  DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)   Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08  SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99  GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00).  A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

109.04   Employment goals.
109.05   Advisory Board for Affirmative Action and Equal Opportunity.
109.06   Equal Opportunity Officer.
109.07   Administration of policy.
 
109.01  DEFINITIONS.
   (a)   "Affirmative action" means the planned, earnest, integrated management
program to provide for equal employment opportunity.  It is a results-oriented
program designed to achieve equal employment opportunity rather than simply a
policy to assure nondiscrimination.
   (b)   "Equal employment opportunity" means an employer's posture that all
personnel activities will be conducted in a manner as to assure equal
opportunity for all.  This posture is exhibited in a statement of assurances
that all personnel activities will be based solely on individual merit and
fitness of applicants and employees without regard to race, color, religion,
sex, age, national origin, handicap or other nonmerit factors.
   (c)   "Minority population" includes Negro, Spanish-surnamed American, Asian
American and American Indian.
(Ord. 31-78.  Passed 10-10-78.)
109.02  MINORITY EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY AND AFFIRMATIVE ACTION.
   The City is firmly committed to the principle of minority employment
opportunity and affirmative action in all personnel actions.
   When jobs must be filled from the outside, the City will recruit and hire in
all job classifications without regard to race, color, sex or national origin. 
Further, the City will take affirmative action to insure that its recruiting
sources include sources likely to produce qualified minority applicants.  Where
applicable, the City will contact organizations which provide referral services
for minority applicants and will advertise in news media which have a
substantial number of minority customers, including minority news media.
   When opportunities for promotion occur, full consideration will be given to
all eligible candidates, and selection will be based on individual
qualifications for the job, without regard to race, color, sex or national
origin.
   Likewise all matters related to compensation, benefits, transfers, lay-offs,
educational opportunities and employee programs and facilities will be
administered without regard to race, color, sex or national origin.
(Ord. 31-78.  Passed 10-10-78.)
109.03  DISSEMINATION OF POLICY.
   The City government, including its administrative officers, affirmative
action and equal employment personnel, and the Advisory Board, are authorized
to carry out the affirmative policy against discrimination and to disseminate
it to all employees of the City.  Specifically, this policy will be distributed
to all current employees and will be given to new employees when they are
hired.
(Ord. 31-78.  Passed 10-10-78.)
109.04  EMPLOYMENT GOALS.
   The City presently has four percent (4%) minority employment, but the City
recognizes a need to encourage minority employment in certain jobs where the
percentage of minorities is now relatively low.
   The City, as its employment goals, will endeavor to attain a five percent
(5%) overall level of minority employment, and will seek to hire and/or promote
a sufficient number of minority persons.
   It is recognized that the attainment of the goals set forth herein is
dependent upon such factors as vacancies or positions to be filled, available
finances, maintaining current levels of City employment, and compliance with
applicable laws and the equal employment opportunity provisions of Section
109.02.
   The establishment of these goals does not preclude the City from hiring a
higher percentage of minority personnel.  Furthermore, the establishment of
these goals will never require the City to hire, transfer or promote a person
who does not have the qualifications needed to perform the job successfully;
nor shall the City be required to hire, transfer or promote a less qualified
person in preference to a better qualified person.
(Ord. 31-78.  Passed 10-10-78.)
109.05  ADVISORY BOARD FOR AFFIRMATIVE ACTION AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITY.
   An Advisory Board for Affirmative Action and Equal Opportunity, created
January 1, 1979 shall consist of five members, who shall be appointed by the
Mayor after consultation with Council and persons in the minority community. 
All Advisory Board members shall be City residents.  The minority community
shall be represented on the Board by at least two of the five representatives. 
The members of the Board shall be appointed for a term of three years, or until
a duly appointed successor has been qualified.  The terms of office on the
initial board shall be as follows:  three members to be appointed for a three-
year term with at least one member to be a representative of the minority
community.  Two members shall be appointed to serve a two-year term with at
least one member to be a representative of the minority community.  Thereafter,
each succeeding term shall be for a period of three years.
   The Advisory Board shall monitor the implementation of this policy and shall
generally advise the Mayor and Council on matters of minority opportunity and
relations within the community.
(Ord. 31-78.  Passed 10-10-78.)
109.06  EQUAL OPPORTUNITY OFFICER.
   The Mayor shall designate one of the administrative officials as Equal
Opportunity Coordinator and shall insure that the official has sufficient time
and/or assistance to perform fully his or her duties as Equal Opportunity
Coordinator.  These duties shall include:
   (a)   Monitoring the implementation of this policy and monitoring the City's
progress in insuring equal opportunity for minorities.
   (b)   Serving as a liaison between the City and minority groups.
   (c)   Accepting complaints or suggestions from minority employees and/or
citizens, investigating and attempting to resolve such complaints.
   (d)   Assisting in development of equal opportunity policies.
   (e)   Performing such other duties as may be required by affirmative action
plans submitted to government agencies and participating in development and
revision of such plans.
(Ord. 31-78.  Passed 10-10-78.)
109.07  ADMINISTRATION OF POLICY.
   Administration of this policy is the responsibility of the City and its
administrative staff, including the equal employment opportunity officer.  The
City will provide the Advisory Board, upon the request of its designated
representative, with information as to what actions the City has taken with
respect to this policy.

139.16  DRUG FREE WORKPLACE.
   (a)    Purpose. The City regards the illegal use of drugs and the abuse of
alcohol as serious problems. In addition to achieving compliance with the
Federal Drug Free Workplace Act of 1988, it is the purpose of this policy to
create an alcohol and drug free workplace, which will enhance the health,
safety, security and performance of the employees of the City.
   (b)    Policy.
      (1)    The illegal use, sale, manufacture, distribution, dispensation or
possession of drugs on City property is absolutely prohibited. Reporting to
work or working while under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs is also
prohibited except in the limited case of City sponsored social activities as
detailed below. Violation of this policy will result in disciplinary action up
to and including termination.
      (2)    Employees will be required to undergo a urine drug screening test
and/or blood alcohol test when there is reasonable suspicion to conclude that
they are under the influence of illegal drugs or alcohol on City property or
while on City business. Testing for reasonable suspicion will be conducted when
an employee:
         A.   Reports for work or appears to be working under the influence of
alcohol or illegal drugs;
         B.   When an employee admits to a supervisor being under the influence
of alcohol or illegal drugs while at work or on City business; and/or
         C.   Following any workplace accident or other incident which suggests
the employee is under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs.
      (3)    Any conviction for an alcohol or drug-related criminal offense
will be considered grounds for discipline, up to and including termination.
      (4)    It is the City’s intention to apply Federal law as it applies to
all employees, union and non-union. The City shall address problems associated
with having on-duty employees under the influence of alcohol or drugs and the
obligation of the City to deal with these problems pursuant to the Federal Drug
Free Workplace Act of 1988, the regulations there under, the Federal Omnibus
Transportation Testing Act of 1991 and House Bill 122 existing irrespective of
other policies. However, where a direct conflict between this policy and the
collective bargaining exists, the parties shall meet and confer to resolve any
conflicts. Discipline shall be enforced according to the terms of the
collective bargaining agreement.
   (c)    Responsibility.  All department heads and supervisors are responsible
for the implementation of this policy. Questions concerning the interpretation
of this policy should be referred to the Director of Safety Services for the
City.
   (d)    Implementation Guidelines.
      (1)    Urine drug screening test guidelines.
         A.   Testing of urine speciments will be conducted only by
laboratories that have received Health and Human Services’ (HHS) approval and
which follow HHS guidelines for testing. This will allow for maximum
consistency in operating procedures and quality control.
         B.   All urine samples will be tested for the following drugs:
marijuana, cocaine, amphetamines, opiates and phencyclidine (PCP).
         C.   Collection of urine samples will be conducted by controlled
laboratory methods to assure security, but will not require witnessing of
sample collection.
         D.   All urine samples will undergo a preliminary analysis for the
above listed substances. If the test result is positive, the urine sample will
undergo a confirmatory gas chromatography/ mass spectrometry (GC/MS) test. If
the urine sample tests positive on both of the preliminary analysis and the GC/
MS, the urine sample will be classified as positive. The laboratory will report
all results to a designated City official.
      (2)    Testing for reasonable suspicion.
         A.   Testing for reasonable suspicion will be conducted:
-When an employee reports for work or appears to be working under the influence
of alcohol or illegal drugs;
-When an employee admits to a supervisor being under the influence of alcohol
or illegal drugs while at work or on City business; and/or
- Following any workplace accident or other incident which suggests the
employee is under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs.
   Refusal to be treated for reasonable suspicion will be grounds for
discipline, up to and including termination. Submission of an adulterated
specimen will constitute a refusal to test.
         B.   When testing for reasonable suspicion is required, employees are
to be removed immediately from the workplace and escorted to an appropriate
medical facility. A urine drug screen will be conducted to detect the presence
of illegal drugs; a blood alcohol test will be conducted to detect the presence
of alcohol. The employee must consent to this test which must be performed in
an approved medical facility.
         C.   If the alcohol and/or drug test(s) are classified as negative
after review, the employee will be returned to work and standard disciplinary
practices will prevail for the incident which led to the testing. The only
exception to this is if other evidence exists which identifies the employee who
tested negative as a current illegal drug user. If sufficient evidence exists
to identify the employee as a current illegal drug user, the employee will be
subject to discipline/rehabilitation as described in division (e)(3) of this
section.
         D.   If the positive alcohol and/or drug test(s) are classified as
medically unjustified after review, the result(s) will be reported to the
Safety Service Director. The report will be made available to the employee if
requested.
   (e)    Discipline/rehabilitation.
      (1)    If the blood alcohol or drug test is a medically unjustified
positive, or if sufficient evidence exists to identify the employee as a
current illegal drug user, the City, at its discretion, may require an employee
to undergo rehabilitative treatment. The employee will be required to undergo
unannounced testing at the worksite, as recommended by the treatment facility
in conjunction with the EAP and the City’s Safety Service Director. An employee
who tests positive a second time is subject to termination without further
opportunity for rehabilitation. Refusal to undergo rehabilitative treatment
and/or failure to comply with post-rehabilitation testing will result in
termination.
      (2)    The City’s Employee Assistance Program (EAP) provides
professional, confidential assistance to help employees resolve problems with
alcohol and drugs and other issues that affect their personal and work life.
      (3)    The Safety Service Director for the City will contact the EAP to
discuss the employee’s alcohol or drug problem, develop a plan of action, and
if appropriate, arrange an appointment for the employee with the EAP. The
supervisor and the Safety Service Director will communicate the agreed upon
plan to the employee. An employee’s refusal to accept referral to the EAP and
follow EAP recommendations for addressing an alcohol or drug problem may be
grounds for discipline, up to and including termination.
      (4)    Representatives from the EAP will maintain contact with the
employee’s supervisor and/or Safety Service Director concerning the employee’s
participation in the EAP and compliance with treatment recommendations. 
Information regarding the employee’s diagnosis and treatment will not be
disclosed; any confidential information will be disclosed only with a signed
release from the employee.
   (f)    Convictions for Alcohol/drug Related Criminal Offenses.  Any
conviction for an alcohol or drug-related criminal offense will be considered
grounds for discipline, up to and including termination. When an employee is
convicted, the conviction will be reviewed by management, including
representatives from the union (if applicable), Safety Service Director and
Legal Departments, to determine the appropriate course of action. Where
applicable, all drug-related workplace convictions will be reported to the
appropriate contracting office of the Federal government, in accordance with
the provisions of the Drug Free Workplace Act of
1988.
   (g)    Employee Training and Education.  Each department, in conjunction
with Safety Service Director, is required to implement programs to inform
employees of the City’s Alcohol and Drug Free Workplace Policy. These programs
must:
      (1)    Educate employees and increase their awareness of the negative
effects of alcohol and drug abuse on health and safety;
      (2)    Train supervisory personnel on their responsibilities for ensuring
compliance with the City’s policy and fostering an alcohol and drug free
workplace; and
      (3)    Inform employees and supervisory personnel about the use of the
Employee Assistance Program.
   (h)    Searches. The City reserves the right to conduct reasonable searches
of any property when there is reason to suspect violation of the policy, with
prior notification and approval of the Safety Service Director and review by
legal counsel.
   (i)   Right to Privacy.
      (1)    Information regarding an employee’s use of alcohol or illegal
drugs will be maintained in a confidential medical record.
      (2)    All records that pertain to an employee’s use of the Employee
Assistance Program will be maintained by and remain property of the EAP. No
information concerning the employee’s diagnosis and treatment will be revealed
by the EAP except in the following circumstances:
            - The employee consents in writing;
            - The law requires disclosure; and
            - It is believed that life or safety are threatened by failure to
disclose.
   (j)   Driving Motor Vehicles. Any operation of a motor vehicle on City
business while under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs may be cause
from disciplinary action, up to and including termination.

171.01  DEFINITIONS.
   For purposes of this chapter, the following words and phrases shall have the
following meanings ascribed to them respectively.
   (a)    "Hotel" means every establishment kept, used, maintained, advertised
or held out to the public to be a place where sleeping accommodations are
offered for a consideration to guests, in which five or more rooms are used for
the accommodation of guests, whether the rooms are in one or several
structures.
   (b)    "Transient accommodation " means every establishment kept, used,
maintained, advertised or held out to the public to be a place where sleeping
accommodations are offered to guests in which four (4) or less rooms are used
for the accommodations of such guests, whether such rooms are in one (1) or
several structures. 
   (c)    "Occupancy" means the use or possession, or the right to the use or
possession of any room or rooms, or space or portion thereof, in any hotel or
transient accommodation for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes. The use or
possession or right to use or possess any room or any suite of connecting rooms
as office space, banquet or private dining rooms, or exhibit, sample or display
space shall not be considered occupancy within the meaning of this definition,
unless the person exercising occupancy uses or possesses, or has the right to
use or possess all or any portion of the room or suite of rooms for dwelling,
lodging or sleeping purposes.
   (d)    "Operator" means the person who is the proprietor of the hotel, or
transient accommodation whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, mortgagee in
possession, licensee or any other capacity. Where the operator performs his
functions through a managing agent of any type or character, other than an
employee, the managing agent shall also be deemed an operator for the purposes
of this chapter, and shall have the same duties and liabilities as his
principal. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter by either the
principal or the managing agent shall, however, be considered to be compliance
by both.
   (e)    "Person" means any individual, firm, partnership, limited liability
company, joint venture, association, social club, fraternal organization, joint
stock company, corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee,
syndicate or any other group or combination acting as a unit.
   (f)    "Rent" means the consideration received for occupancy valued in
money, whether received in money or otherwise, including all receipts, cash,
credits and property or services of any kind or nature, and also any amount for
which the occupant is liable for the occupancy without any deduction therefrom
whatsoever.
   (g)    "Transient guest" means a person occupying a room or rooms for
sleeping accommodations for less than thirty consecutive days.
   (h)    "Treasurer" means the City Treasurer of the City of Port Clinton.
      (Ord. 40-05.  Passed 12-27-05.)
171.02  RATE OF TAX.
   (a)    For the purpose of providing revenue with which to meet the needs of
the City for general operating expenses, there is levied an excise tax of three
percent (3%) on all rents received by a hotel or transient accommodation for
lodging furnished to transient guests.
   (b)    This tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient guest to the City,
which is extinguished only by payment to the operator as trustee for the City.
The transient guest shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel or transient
accommodations at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in
installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each
installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient guest ceasing to
occupy space in the hotel or transient accommodations. The tax imposed by this
Chapter shall be paid by the transient guest to the operator, and each operator
shall collect from the transient guest the full amount of the tax payable on
each taxable lodging.  If the transaction is claimed to be exempt, the
transient guest must furnish to the operator, and the operator must obtain from
the transient guest, written proof of exempt status as required by this
Chapter. If no such proof of exemption is obtained, it shall be presumed the
tax applies.
(Ord. 40-05.  Passed 12-27-05.)
171.03  EXEMPTIONS.
   (a)   No tax shall be imposed under this chapter:
      (1)   Upon rents not within the taxing power of the City under the
Constitution or laws of Ohio or the United States;
      (2)   Upon rents paid by the State of Ohio, or any of its political
subdivisions;
      (3)   Upon rents of five dollars ($5.00) a day or less.
   (b)   No exemption claimed under subsection (a)(1) or (2) hereof shall be
granted except upon a claim therefor made at the time rent is collected, and
under penalty of perjury, upon a form prescribed by the Treasurer.  All claims
of exemption under subsection (a)(3) hereof shall be made in the manner
prescribed by the Treasurer.
(Ord. 30-85.  Passed 12-20-85.)
171.04  TAX TO BE SEPARATELY STATED AND CHARGED.
   (a)   The tax to be collected shall be stated and charged separately from
the rent, and shown separately on any record thereof, at the time when the
occupancy is arranged or contracted and charged for, and upon every evidence of
occupancy, or any bill or statement or charge made for an occupancy issued or
delivered by the operator, and the tax shall be paid by the occupant to the
operator as trustee for and on account of the City, and the operator shall be
liable for the collection thereof and for the tax.
   (b)    No operator of a hotel or transient accommodation shall advertise or
state in any manner, whether directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part
thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be
added to the rent, or that, if added, any part will be refunded except in the
manner hereinafter provided.
(Ord. 40-05.  Passed 12-27-05.)
171.05  REGISTRATION.
   Within thirty days after the effective date of Ordinance 30-85, or within

registration certificate, to be at all times posted in a conspicuous place on
the premises. The certificate shall, among other things, state the following:
   (a)    The name of the operator;
   (b)    The address of the hotel or transient accommodations;
   (c)    The date upon which the certificate was issued;
   (d)    "This Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate signifies that the
person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the Transient
Occupancy Tax Ordinance by registering with the Treasurer for the purpose of
collecting from transient guests the Transient Occupancy Tax and remitting said
tax to the Treasurer. This certificate does not constitute a permit."
      (Ord. 40-05.  Passed 12-27-05.)
171.06  REPORTING AND REMITTING.
   (a)   Each operator shall, on or before the last day of the month following
the close of each calendar quarter, or at the close of any shorter reporting
period which may be established by the Treasurer, make a return to the
Treasurer, on forms provided by him, of the total rents charged and received,
and the amount of tax collected for transient occupancies. All claims for
exemption from the tax filed by occupants with the operator during the
reporting period shall be filed with the report. At the time the return is
filed, the full amount of the tax collected shall be remitted to the Treasurer.
The return shall be signed by the operator or an authorized agent thereof. The
Treasurer may establish shorter reporting periods for any certificate holder if
he deems it necessary in order to insure collection of the tax, and he may
require further information in the return if the information is pertinent to
the collection of the tax. Returns and payments are due immediately upon
cessation of business for any reason. All taxes collected by operators pursuant
to this chapter shall be held in trust for the account of the City until
payment thereof is made to the Treasurer. All returns and payments submitted by
each operator shall be treated as confidential by the Treasurer, and shall not
be released by him except upon order of a court of competent jurisdiction or to
an officer or agent of the United States, the State, the County or the City for
official use only.
   (b)   The Treasurer may authorize operators whose tax liability is not such
as to merit monthly returns, as determined by the Treasurer upon the basis of
administrative costs to the City, to make and file returns at less frequent
intervals. Such authorization shall be in writing and shall indicate the
intervals at which returns are to be filed.
(Ord. 40-05.  Passed 12-27-05.)
171.07  PENALTIES AND INTEREST.
   (a)   Delinquency.  Any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this
chapter within the time required shall pay a penalty equal to ten percent (10%)
of the amount of the tax, in addition to the tax.
   (b)   Fraud.  If the Treasurer determines that the nonpayment of any
remittance due under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty equal to twenty-
five percent (25%) of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition
to the penalties stated in subsection (a) hereof.
   (c)   Interest.  In addition to the previous penalties imposed, any operator
who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter shall pay interest at the
rate of one percent (1%) per month, or fraction thereof, on the amount of the
tax exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became
delinquent until paid.
   (d)   Penalties During Pendency of Hearing or Appeal.  No penalty provided
under the terms of this chapter shall be imposed during the pendency of any
hearing provided for in Section
171.08 nor during the pendency of any appeal to the Board of Review provided
for in Section
171.09.
   (e)   Abatement of Interest and Penalty.  In cases where a return has been
filed in good faith, and an assessment has been paid within the time prescribed
by the Treasurer, the Treasurer may abate any charge of penalty or interest, or
both.
(Ord. 30-85.  Passed 12-20-85.)
171.08  FAILURE TO COLLECT AND REPORT TAX; DETERMINATION OF TAX BY CITY
TREASURER.
   If any operator fails or refuses to collect the tax and to make, within the
time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of the tax, or any
portion thereof required by this chapter, the Treasurer shall proceed in such
manner as he may deem best to obtain facts and information on which to base his
estimate of the tax due.  As soon as the Treasurer procures such facts and
information upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this
chapter, and payable by any operator who has failed or refused to collect the
same and to make a report and remittance, he shall proceed to determine and
assess against the operator the tax, interest and penalties provided for by
this chapter.  In case such determination is made, the Treasurer shall give
notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally, or by depositing it
in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so
assessed at his last known place of address.  The operator may within ten days
after the serving or mailing of the notice make application in writing to the
Treasurer for a hearing on the amount assessed, if an application by the
operator for a hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the tax,
interest and penalties, if any, determined by the Treasurer, shall become final
and conclusive, and immediately due and payable.  If an application is made,
the Treasurer shall give not less than five days' written notice in the manner
prescribed herein to the operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in
the notice why the amount specified therein should not be fixed for the tax,
interest and penalties.  At the hearing, the operator may appear and offer
evidence why the specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. 
After the hearing, the Treasurer shall determine the proper tax to be remitted,
and shall give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed herein of
the determination and the amount of the tax, interest and penalties.  The
amount determined to be due shall be payable after fifteen days, unless an
appeal is taken as provided in Section
171.09.
(Ord. 30-85.  Passed 12-20-85.)
171.09  APPEAL.
   Any operator aggrieved by any decision of the Treasurer with respect to the
amount of the tax, interest and penalties, if any, may appeal to the Board of
Review by filing a notice of appeal with the Treasurer within fifteen days of
the serving or mailing of the determination of the tax due.  The Board of
Review shall fix a time and place for hearing the appeal, and shall give notice
in writing to the operator at his last known place of address.  The findings of
the Board of Review shall be served upon the appellant in the manner prescribed
above for service of a notice of hearing.  Any amount found to be due shall be
immediately due and payable upon the service of notice.
(Ord. 30-85.  Passed 12-20-85.)
171.10  BOARD OF REVIEW.
   (a)   A Board of Review, consisting of a chairman and two other individuals

The Board shall adopt its own procedural rules and shall keep a record of its
transactions.  Any hearings by the Board may be conducted privately and the
provisions of Section
171.06 with reference to the confidential character of information required to
be disclosed by this chapter shall apply to such matters as may be heard before
the Board on appeal.
   (b)   The Board shall hear and pass on appeals from any ruling or decision
of the Treasurer, and at the request of the operator, person or Treasurer, is
empowered to substitute alternate methods of allocation.  The Board shall, in
hearing, have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse or modify any such ruling or
decision, or any part thereof.
(Ord. 30-85.  Passed 12-20-85.)
171.11  RECORDS.
   Every operator liable for the collection and payment to the City of any tax
imposed by this chapter shall keep and preserve, for a period of three years,
all records as may be necessary to determine the amount of tax as he may have
been liable for the collection of and payment to the City, which records the
Treasurer shall have the right to inspect at all reasonable times.
(Ord. 30-85.  Passed 12-20-85.)
171.12  REFUNDS.
   (a)   Whenever the amount of any tax, interest or penalty has been overpaid
or paid more than once, or has been erroneously or illegally collected or
received by the City under this chapter.  It may be refunded as provided in
subsections (b) and (c) hereof, provided a claim in writing therefor, stating,
under penalty of perjury, the specific grounds upon which the claim is founded,
is filed with the Treasurer within three years of the date of payment.  The
claim shall be on forms furnished by the Treasurer.
   (b)   An operator may claim a refund or take as a credit against taxes
collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once, or erroneously
or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner
prescribed by the Treasurer that the person from whom the tax has been
collected was not a transient guest; provided, however, that neither a refund
nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has
either been refunded to the transient guest or credited to rent subsequently
payable by the transient to the operator.
   (c)   A transient guest may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid, or paid more
than once, or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the City, by
filing a claim in the manner provided in subsection (a) hereof, but only when
the tax was paid by the transient guest directly to the Treasurer, or when the
transient guest, having paid the tax to the operator, establishes to the
satisfaction of the Treasurer that the transient guest has been unable to
obtain a refund from the operator who collected the tax.
   (d)   No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section unless
the claimant establishes his right thereto by written records showing
entitlement thereto.
(Ord. 30-85.  Passed 12-20-85.)
171.13  ACTIONS TO COLLECT.
   (a)    Any tax required to be paid by a transient guest under the provisions
of this chapter shall be deemed a debt owed by the transient guest to the City.

deemed a debt owed by the operator to the City. Any person owing money to the
City under the provisions of this chapter shall be liable in an action brought
in the name of the City  for the recovery of the amount of tax due.
   (b)   No assessment shall be made or issued against an operator or transient
guest for any tax imposed by or pursuant to this chapter more than four years
after the return date for the period in which the lodging was ffirnished, or
more than four years after the return for such period is filed, whichever is
later. This section does not bar an assessment.
      (1)   When the Treasurer has substantial evidence of amounts of taxes
collected by an operator from transient guests's lodging which were not
returned to the City;
      (2)   When the operator assessed failed to file a return as required.
         (Ord. 40-05.  Passed 12-27-05.)
171.14  MONEYS RECEIVED; WHERE CREDITED.
   The moneys received under the provisions of this chapter shall be credited

(Ord. 30-85.  Passed 12-20-85.)
171.15  LIABILITY.
   (a)   The operator or authorized agent having control of or charged with the
responsibility of making and filing the return and making payment is personally
liable for failure to file the return or pay the tax due as required by this
chapter.
   (b)   If any operator corporation or other entity required to file returns
and to remit tax due to the City under the provisions of this chapter, fails
for any reason to make such filing or payment, any of its officers, members or
employees having control or supervision of or charged with the responsibility
of filing returns and making payments shall be personally liable for such
failure. The dissolution of a corporation or other entity shall not discharge
an officer's, member's, or employee's liability for a prior failure of the
corporation or other entity to file returns or remit tax due. The sum due for
such liability may be collected by assessment in the manner provided in this
chapter.
   (c)   If any operator fails to collect the tax or any transient guest fails
to pay the tax imposed by or pursuant to this chapter on any transaction
subject to the tax, such operator or transient guest shall be personally liable
for the amount of the tax applicable to the transaction. The Treasurer may make
an assessment against either the operator or transient guest, as the facts may
require, based upon any information in his possession.
   (d)   An assessment against an operator in cases where the tax imposed by or
pursuant to this chapter has not been collected or paid, shall not discharge
the transient guest's liability to reimburse the operator for the tax
applicable to such transaction.
   (e)   In each case, the Treasurer shall give to the operator or transient
guest assessed written notice of such assessment. Such notice may be served
upon the operator or transient guest assessed personally or by registered or
certified mail. An assessment issued against either, pursuant to the provisions
of this chapter shall not be considered an election of remedies, nor a bar to
an assessment against the other for the tax applicable to the same transaction,
provided that no assessment shall be issued against any operator or transient
guest for the tax due on a particular transaction if said tax has actually been
paid by another.
(Ord. 40-05.  Passed 12-27-05.)
171.16  REPORTS MUST BE FILED; FRAUDULENT REPORTS.
   (a)    No person, including any officer of a corporation, employee of a
corporation, or member of a limited liability company, having control or

cause to be filed any incomplete, false, or fraudulent retum, report or
statement, or aid or abet another in the filing of any false or fraudulent
return, report or statement.
   (b)    If any operator required to file monthly returns under this chapter
fails, on two consecutive months or on three or more months within a twelve-
month period, to file such returns when due or to pay the tax thereon, or if
any operator authorized by the Treasurer to file returns at less frequent
intervals, fails on two or more occasions within a twenty-four month period, to
file such returns when due or to pay the tax due thereon, the Treasurer may:
      (1)   Require such operator to furnish security in an amount equal to the
average tax liability of the operator for a period of one year, as determined
by the Treasurer from a review of returns or other information pertaining to
such operator, which amount shall in no event be less than one hundred dollars
($100.00). The security may be in the form of an advance tax payment to be
applied to pay the tax due on subsequent returns, or a corporate surety bond,
satisfactory to the Treasurer, conditioned upon payment of the tax due with the
returns from the operator. The security must be filed within ten days following
the operator's receipt of the notice from the Treasurer of its requirements.
      (2)   A corporate surety bond filed under this section shall be returned
to the operator if, for a period of twelve consecutive months following the
date the bond was filed, the operator has filed all returns and remitted
payment therewith within the time prescribed in this chapter.
         (Ord. 40-05.  Passed 12-27-05.)
171.17  PERSONAL LIABILITY OF CORPORATE OFFICERS OR EMPLOYEES.
   If any operator corporation, or limited liability company, required to file
returns and to remit tax due to the City under the provisions of this chapter,
fails for any reason to make such filing or payment, any of its officers,
members, or employees having control or supervision of or charged with the
responsibility of filing returns and making payments, shall be personally
liable for such failure. The dissolution of a corporation or limited liability
shall not discharge an officer's, member’s or employee's liability for a prior
failure of the corporation to file returns or remit tax due. The sum due for

chapter.

required herein, or furnish any return required to be made, or fail or refuse
to furnish a supplemental return or other data required by the Treasurer, or
render a false or fraudulent return or claim.  No person required to make,
render, sign or verify any report or claim, shall make a false or fraudulent
report or claim with intent to defeat or evade the determination of any amount
due required by this chapter to be made.

during the reporting period shall be filed with the report.  At the time the
return is filed, the full amount of the tax collected shall be remitted to the
Treasurer.  The Treasurer may establish shorter reporting periods for any
certificate holder if he deems it necessary in order to insure collection of
the tax, and he may require further information in the return if the
information is pertinent to the collection of the tax.  Returns and payments
are due immediately upon cessation of business for any reason.  All taxes
collected by operators pursuant to this chapter shall be held in trust for the

time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of the tax, or any
portion thereof required by this chapter, the Treasurer shall proceed in such
manner as he deems best to obtain facts and information on which to base his
estimate of the tax due.  As soon as the Treasurer procures such facts and
information upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this
chapter, and payable by any operator who has failed or refused to collect the
same and to make a report and remittance, he shall proceed to determine and
assess against the operator the tax, interest and penalties provided for by
this chapter.  In case such determination is made, the Treasurer shall give

assessed at his last known place of address.  The operator may, within ten days
after the serving or mailing of the notice, make application in writing to the
Treasurer for a hearing on the amount assessed.  If an application by the
operator for a hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the tax,
interest and penalties, if any, determined by the Treasurer, shall become final
and conclusive, and immediately due and payable.  If an application is made,
the Treasurer shall give not less than five days' written notice in the manner
prescribed herein to the operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in
the notice why the amount specified therein should not be fixed for the tax,
interest and penalties.  At the hearing, the operator may appear and offer
evidence why the specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. 
After the hearing, the Treasurer shall determine the proper tax to be remitted,
and shall give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed herein of
the determination and the amount of the tax, interest and penalties.  The
amount determined to be due shall be payable after fifteen days, unless an
appeal is taken as provided in Section

Review shall fix a time and place for hearing the appeal, and shall give notice
in writing to the operator at his last known place of address.  The findings of
the Board of Review shall be served upon the appellant in the manner prescribed
above for service of a notice of hearing.  Any amount found to be due shall be
immediately due and payable upon the service of notice.

overpaid, or paid more than once, or has been erroneously or illegally
collected or received by the City under this chapter, it may be refunded as
provided in subsections (b) and (c) hereof, provided a claim in writing
therefor, stating, under penalty of perjury, the specific grounds upon which
the claim is founded, is filed with the Treasurer within three years of the
date of payment.  The claim shall be on forms furnished by the Treasurer.
   (b)   An operator may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes
collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once, or erroneously
or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner
prescribed by the Treasurer that the person from whom the tax has been
collected was not the owner of a watercraft; provided, however, that neither a
refund nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected
has been refunded to the owner of the watercraft.
   (c)   An owner of a watercraft may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid, or
paid more than once, or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the

operator, establishes to the satisfaction of the Treasurer that the owner of

collected the tax.

thereto.

         A.   Rentals from real property.
      Rentals received by the taxpayer are to be included only if and to the
extent that the rental, ownership, management or operation of the real estate
from which such rentals are derived (whether so rented, managed or operated by
the taxpayer individually or through agents or other representatives)
constitutes a business activity of the taxpayer in whole or in part.
         B.   Where the gross monthly rental of any real properties, regardless
of number and value, aggregate in excess of two hundred dollars ($200.00) per
month, it shall be prima facie evidence that the rental, ownership, management
or operation of such properties is a business activity of such taxpayer, and
the net income of such rental properties shall be subject to tax; provided that
in case of commercial property, the owner shall be considered engaged in a
business activity when the rental is based on a fixed or fluctuating percentage
of gross or net sales, receipts or profits of the lessee, whether or not such
rental exceeds two hundred dollars ($200.00) per month; provided further that
in the case of farm property, the owner shall be considered engaged in a
business activity when he shares in the crops or when the rental is based on a
percentage of the gross or net receipts derived from the farm, whether or not
the gross income exceeds two hundred dollars ($200.00) per month; and provided
further that the person who operates a rooming house or bed and breakfast shall
be considered in business whether or not the gross income exceeds two hundred
dollars ($200.00) per month.

property, periods during which (by reason of vacancy or any other cause)
rentals are not received shall not be taken into consideration by the taxpayer.

buying and selling real estate shall be considered a part of business income.

net income from rentals (to the extent above specified), regardless of the
location of the real property owned.
            6.   Non-residents of Port Clinton are subject to such taxation
only if the real property is situated within the City of Port Clinton.
Nonresidents, in determining whether gross monthly rentals exceed two hundred
dollars ($200.00) shall take into consideration only real estate situated
within the City of Port Clinton.
            7.   Corporations owning or managing real estate are taxable only
on that portion of income derived from property located within the City of Port

within and wit trout the boundaries of a municipal corporation shall be
considered as having a taxable situs in such municipal corporation for purposes
of municipal income taxation in the same proportion as the average ratio of the
following:
      (1)    Multiply the entire net profits of the business by a business
apportionment percentage formula to be determined by:
         A.   The average original cost of the real and tangible personal
property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in such
municipal corporation during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
      As used in the preceding paragraph, real property shall include property
rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such property shall be
determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
         B.   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to persons employed in the business or profession for services performed
in such municipal corporation to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to persons employed in the business or profession,

taxable by the municipal corporation under Section 718.011 of the Ohio Revised
Code;
         C.   Gross receipts of the business or profession from sales made and 
services performed during the taxable period in such municipal corporation to
gross receipts of the business or profession during the same period from sales
and services, wherever made or performed.
         D.   Adding together the percentages determined in accordance with
subsections (b)(1)A., B., and C. hereof, or such of the aforesaid  percentages
as are applicable to the particular taxpayer and dividing the total so obtained
by the number of percentages used in deriving such total.
            1.   A factor is applicable even though it may be apportioned
entirely in or outside the Municipality.
            2.   Provided however, that in the event a just and equitable
result cannot be obtained under the business apportionment percentage formula
provided for herein, the Commissioner, upon application of the taxpayer, shall
have the authority to substitute other factors or methods calculated to effect
a fair and proper apportionment.
   (c)   As used in subsection (b) hereof, "sales made in a municipal

municipal corporation regardless of where title passes if shipped or delivered
from a stock of goods within such municipal corporation;
      (2)    All sales of tangible personal property delivered within such
municipal corporation regardless of where title passes even though transported
from a point outside such municipal corporation if the taxpayer is regularly
engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales
within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such solicitation
or promotion;
      (3)    All sales of tangible personal property shipped from a place
within such municipal corporation to purchasers outside such municipal
corporation regardless of where title passes if the taxpayer is not, through
its own employees, regularly engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales
at the place where delivery is made.
   (d)   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (e) hereof, net profit from
rental activity not constituting a business or profession shall be subject to
tax only by the municipal corporation in which the property generating the net
profit is located.
   (e)   This section does not apply to individuals who are residents of the
Municipality and, except as otherwise provided in Section 718.01 of the Ohio
Revised Code, the Municipality may impose a tax on all income earned by
residents of the Municipality to the extent allowed by the United States
Constitution.
   (f)   Net Operating Loss (NOL).
      (1)   The Municipality does not allow a net operating loss carryback or 
carryforward.
      (2)   Nothing in Chapter 718.01 of the Ohio Revised Code requires a
municipal corporation to allow a net operating loss carryback or carryforward.
   (g)   Consolidated Returns.
      (1)   Filing of consolidated returns may be permitted or required in
accordance with rules and regulations prescribed by the Commissioner.
      (2)    In the case of a corporation that carried on transactions with its
stockholders or with other corporations related by stock ownership,
interlocking directorates or some other method, or in case any person operates
a division, branch, factory, office, laboratory or activity within Port Clinton
constituting a portion only of its total business, the Commissioner shall
require such additional information as he may deem necessary to ascertain
whether net profits are properly allocated to Port Clinton. If the Commissioner
finds net profits are not properly allocated to Port Clinton by reason of
transactions with stockholders or with other corporations related by stock
ownership, interlocking directorates or transactions with such division,
branch, factory, office, laboratory or activity or by some other method, he
shall make such allocation of net profits to Port Clinton.
   (h)   Exclusions. The provisions of this chapter shall not be construed as
levying a tax upon the following:

      (11)    Any association or organization falling in the category listed in
the preceding paragraph receiving income from non-exempt real estate, tangible
or intangible personal property, or business activities of a type ordinarily

hereunder.
      (12)    In the event any association or organization receives taxable

The payer of such compensation is not required to withhold Municipal tax from
that compensation.

such tax by reason of residence or domicile in the Municipality, or the
headquarters of the authority or commission is located within the Municipality.
      (17)    The Municipality shall not tax the compensation paid to a
nonresident individual for personal services performed by the individual in the

         B.   The individual is a professional entertainer or professional

(Ord. 38-03.  Passed 12-23-03.)

from and after January 1, 1981, at the rate of one and one-half percent (1 2%).
(Ord. 22-80.  Passed 9-2-80.)
179.05  RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (a)   Each person who engages in business or other activity or whose
qualifying wage, commissions, other compensation, and other taxable income is
subject to the tax imposed by this Tax Code, shall, whether or not a tax be due
thereon, make and file a return on or before April 15 of the year following the
effective date of this Tax Code, and on or before April 15 of each year
thereafter. When the return is made for a fiscal year or other period different
from the calendar year, the return shall be filed on or before the fifteenth
(15th) day of the fourth (4th) month following the end of such fiscal year or
period. The Commissioner is hereby authorized to provide by regulation that the
return of an employer or employers, showing the amount of Municipal tax
deducted by said employer or employers from the salaries, wages, commissions or
other compensation of an employee, and paid by him or them to the Commissioner,
may be accepted as the return required of any employee whose sole income,
subject to tax under this Tax Code, is such qualifying wage, commissions, other
compensation, and other taxable income.
   (b)   A husband and wife may file either separate returns or a joint return
for municipal purposes, even though one of the spouses has neither taxable
income nor deductions included on the Municipal return regardless of whether
their federal and state returns were filed separately or jointly. If a joint
City return is made, the tax shall be computed on the aggregate taxable income
and the liability with respect to the tax shall be joint and several.
   (c)   The return shall be filed with the Commissioner on a form or forms
furnished by or obtainable upon request from the Commissioner, or on a generic
form, if the generic form, when completed and filed, contains all of the
information required to be submitted with the Municipality's  prescribed return
and, if the taxpayer or return preparer filing the generic form otherwise
complies with the Tax Code governing the filing of returns.
   (d)   The return shall set forth:
      (1)   The aggregate amounts of qualifying wages, commissions, other
compensation received, allocated, apportioned or set aside, other income
defined by statute as taxable, and gross income from any business, profession
or other activity, less allowable expenses incurred in the acquisition of such
gross income earned during the preceding year and subject to said tax; and
      (2)    The amount of the tax imposed by this Tax Code on such earnings
and profits; and
      (3)    Such other pertinent statements, information returns, copies of
federal or state tax returns and/or schedules, or other information as the
Commissioner may require, including a statement that the figures used in the
return are the figures used for federal income tax adjusted to set forth only
such income as is taxable under the provisions of this chapter.
   (e)   (1)   Any taxpayer that has requested an extension for filing a
federal income tax return may request an extension for the filing of a
Municipal Income Tax Return by filing a copy of the taxpayer's federal
extension request with the Municipal Tax Division. Any taxpayer not required to
file a federal income tax return may request an extension for filing a
Municipal Income Tax Return in writing. The request for extension must be filed
on or before the original due date for the annual return. If the request is
granted, the extended due date of the municipal income tax return shall be the
last day of the month following the month to which the due date of the federal
income tax return has been extended.
      (2)    The Commissioner may deny a taxpayer's request for extension if
the taxpayer:
         A.   Fails to timely file the request; or
         B.   Fails to file a copy of the federal extension request (if
applicable); or
         C.   Owes the Municipality any delinquent income tax, penalty,
interest or other charge for the late payment or nonpayment of income tax; or
         D.   Has failed to file any required income tax return, report, or
other related document for a prior tax period.
      (3)    The granting of an extension for filing a Municipal tax return
does not extend the due date as provided in this section for payment of the
tax; hence, penalty and interest may apply to any unpaid tax during the period
of extension at the rate set out by Section
179.10. No penalty shall be assessed in those cases in which the return is
filed and the final tax paid within the extension period provided all other
filing and payment requirements of the Tax Code have been met. Any extension by
the Commissioner shall be granted upon the condition that declaration filing
and payment requirements have been fulfilled; however, if, upon further
examination, it then becomes evident that declaration filing and payment
requirements have not been fulfilled, penalty and interest may be assessed in
full and in the same manner as though no extension had been granted.
   (f)   Payments With Returns.
      (1)   The taxpayer making a return shall, at the time of the filing
thereof, pay to the Commissioner the amount of taxes shown as due. However,
credit shall be allowed for:
         A.   Any portion of the tax so due which shall have been deducted at
the source pursuant to the provisions of Section
179.06; and
         B.   Any portion of said tax which shall have been paid by the
taxpayer, pursuant to the provisions of Section
179.07; and
         C.   Credit to the extent allowed by Section
179.14 for tax paid to another  municipality.
      (2)   Any taxpayer who has overpaid the amount of tax to which the
Municipality is entitled under the provisions of this Tax Code, such
overpayment shall first be applied against any existing tax liability and the
balance, if any, at the election of the taxpayer may have such overpayment
applied against any subsequent liability hereunder or, as indicated on the
return, such overpayment (or part thereof) shall be refunded, provided that no
additional taxes or refunds of less than five dollars ($5.00) shall be
collected or refunded.
   (g)   Amended Returns:
      (1)    Where necessary, an amended return shall be filed in order to
report additional income and pay any additional tax due, or claim a refund of
tax overpaid, subject to the requirements and/or limitations contained in
Sections
179.11 and
179.14. The Commissioner shall provide by regulation the format in which such
amended return shall be filed. A taxpayer may not change the method of
accounting or apportionment of net profits after the due date for filing the
original return.
      (2)    Within three (3) months from the final determination of any
federal tax liability affecting the taxpayer's Municipal tax liability, such
taxpayer shall make and file an amended Municipal return showing income subject
to the Municipal tax based upon such final determination of federal tax
liability and pay any additional tax shown due thereon or make claim for refund
of any overpayment.
   (h)   Information returns, schedules and statements required to support tax
returns which are incomplete without such information shall be filed within the
time limits set forth for the filing of, the tax returns and the failure to
file such information returns, schedules and statements shall be a violation of
this Tax Code. Provided, however, that the taxpayer shall have ten (10) days
after notification by the Commissioner, or his authorized representative, to
file the items required by this paragraph.
(Ord. 38-03.  Passed 12-23-03.)
179.06  COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (a)   Withholding by Employer. Each employer within, or doing business
within, the Municipality who employs one or more persons on a salary, wage,
commission or other compensation basis shall deduct, when such salary, wage,
commission or other compensation is paid, allocated, or set aside, the tax at
the rate provided in Section
179.03 hereof on the qualifying wages due by such employer to each such
employee and shall, on or before the last day of the month following such
withholding, make a return and payment to the Commissioner of the amount of
taxes so deducted. The return shall be on a form or forms prescribed by or
acceptable to the Commissioner and shall be subject to the Rules and
Regulations prescribed by the Commissioner.  Such employer shall be liable for
the payment of the tax required to be deducted and withheld, whether or not
such taxes have in fact been withheld.  Nothing in this section prohibits an
employer from withholding tax on a basis greater than qualifying wages.
   (b)   An employer is not required to make any withholding with respect to an
individual's disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the
time of the disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of the
corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued.
   (c)   (1)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer to withhold the tax as required by a municipal
corporation or by the  employer's exemption from the requirement to withhold
the tax.
      (2)    The failure of an employer to remit to the municipal corporation
the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability for that tax unless the
employee colluded with the employer in connection with the failure to remit the
tax withheld.
   (d)   Compensation deferred before the effective date of this amendment is
not subject to any municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax
withholding requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not
constitute qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or
distributed.
   (e)   So long as the taxes withheld by an employer for the Municipality
during the measurement period are less than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) per
month, payments may be made quarterly on or before the last day of the month
following the end of each quarter, subject to the approval of the Commissioner.
The Commissioner may revoke the approval of quarterly filing and payments
whenever the Commissioner has reason to believe that the conditions for
granting such authorization have changed, were judged incorrectly, were not
met, or when it is in the best interest of the Municipality to do so. Notice of
withdrawal shall be made in writing and, in such case, the employer must begin
to file in accordance with this section.
   (f)   Employer Considered as Trustee. Each employer in collecting such tax
shall be deemed to hold the same, until payment is made by such employer to the
Municipality, as a trustee for the benefit of the Municipality, and any such
tax collected by such employer from his employees shall, until the same is paid
to the Municipality, be deemed a trust fund in the hands of such employer. Each
employer shall be liable for the payment of the tax required to be deducted and
withheld, whether or not such tax, in fact, has been withheld.
   (g)   Any person who is required to withhold tax from qualifying wages shall
pay all such tax to the Municipality in accordance with the provisions of this
section. In the event taxes withheld from the qualifying wages of employees are
not paid to the Municipality in accordance with the provisions of this section,
all officers, members, managers, employees, and trustees having control or
supervision of or charged with the responsibility of filing the return and
making payment are jointly and severally personally liable for the tax not
returned or paid to the Municipality as well as any related interest and
penalties, and are also liable under the provisions of Section
179.99 hereof. The dissolution, termination or bankruptcy of a corporation,
limited liability company, or business trust does not discharge an officer's,
member's, manager's, employee's, or trustee's liability for a failure of the
corporation, limited liability company, or business trust to file returns or
pay said taxes.
   (h)   Withholding Return: List of Employees. Each employer shall file a
withholding tax reconciliation showing the sum total of all compensation paid
all employees, the portion of which (if any) was not subject to withholding
along with an explanation for same, and the portion of which was subject to
withholding, together with the amount of such withholdings remitted. Such
return shall include information concerning each employee from whom the
Municipal tax was withheld, showing the name, address, zip code and social
security number of each such employee, the total amount of compensation paid
during the year and the amount of Municipal tax withheld. If the total tax
withheld from any employee included tax withheld and remitted to another
municipality, the amount of same shall be separately shown on the return of
information to the Municipality concerning each employee. The withholding tax
reconciliation shall be filed by each employer on or before February 28
following the end of such calendar year.
   (i)   In addition to the wage reporting requirements of this section, any
person required by the Internal Revenue Service to report on Form 1099-Misc.
payments to individuals not treated as employees for services performed shall
also report such payments to the Municipality when the services were performed
in the Municipality. Further, any person who pays out any gambling winnings, as
defined in this code, who is required by the Internal Revenue Service to report
such payments on forms W-2G, 5754, 1099-MISC, or any other form required by the
Internal Revenue Service, shall also file a copy of such form(s) reporting such
payments with the Municipality.  The information may be submitted on a listing,
and shall include the name, address and social security number (or federal
identification number) and the amount of such payments made. Federal form(s) W-
2G, 5754 and/or 1099 may be submitted in lieu of such listing. The information
shall be filed annually on or before February 28 following the end of such
calendar year.
(Ord. 36-10.  Passed 1-25-10.)

   (C)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and file
a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or other
payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Commissioner. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the
qualifying wages reported by the employee’s employer, agent of the employer, or
other payer, unless the Municipality requires all resident individual taxpayers
to file a tax return under Section
183.091 of this Chapter.
   (D)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required to
withhold municipal income tax with respect to an individual’s disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation’s
successor entity.
   (E)    (1)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer’s, agent’s, or other
payer’s exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (F)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (G)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be

required by the Internal Revenue Service to report on form 1099 MISC payments
to individuals not treated as employees for services performed shall also
report such payments to the Tax Commissioner when services were performed in
the Municipality. The information may be submitted on a listing that shall
include the individual’s name, address, social security number (or federal
identification number), and the amounts of fee payments made. Federal form(s)
1099 may be submitted in lieu of such listing. The information shall be filed
annually on or before February 28 following the end of such calendar year.
   (I)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of the employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer’s or employee’s liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (J)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax
on tips and gratuities received by the employer’s employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer’s control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer’s control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (K)    The Tax Commissioner shall consider any tax withheld by an employer
at the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this Chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.

behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee’s qualifying wages
subject to division (B)(1)(a) of this    section among those two or more
municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including but not limited to, an equal allocation among such
municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales made
by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal corporation to
which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall be the
employee’s “principal place of work” with respect to those qualifying wages for
the purposes of this section.
For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends a
particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division (B)(2) of this
section, except that “location” shall be substituted for “municipal
corporation” wherever “municipal corporation” appears in that division.
   (B)    (1)    Subject to divisions (C), (E), (F), and (G) of this section,
an employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on qualifying
wages paid to an employee for the performance of personal services in a
municipal corporation that imposes such a tax if the employee performed such

a calendar year, unless one of the following conditions applies:
         (a)    The employee’s principal place of work is located in the

            (ii)    The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform actual services
at the location for more than twenty days.

requested that the employer withhold tax from the employee’s qualifying wages
as provided in Section
183.051 of this Chapter.
         (d)    The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee’s capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
      (2)    For the purposes of division (B)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee’s principal place of work:
         (a)    Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         (b)    Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         (c)    Traveling from any location to another location in order to
pick up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that
has been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished,
processed, remanufactured, or improved by the employee’s employer;
         (d)    Transporting or delivering property described in division (B)

employee does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate
owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee’s employer;
         (e)    Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee’s final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee’s
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (C)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee’s
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee’s principal place of work is located.
   (D)    (1)    Except as provided in division (D)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)    If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee’s
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (E)    Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee’s qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer’s fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer defined in Section
183.03 of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, the Tax Commissioner may require the employer to
provide the Tax Commissioner with the employer’s federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (F)    Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Commissioner and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
183.051 of this Chapter.

lottery terminal sales on behalf of the state to withhold and remit municipal
income tax with respect to amounts other than qualifying wages as provided in
this section.
   (B)    If a person’s prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the internal revenue service is required by section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall
deduct and withhold municipal income tax from the person’s prize award at a
rate of the tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the video lottery
terminal facility is located. 28
   (C)    Amounts deducted and withheld by a video lottery sales agent are held
in trust for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is owed.
      (1)    The video lottery sales agent shall issue to a person from whose
prize award an amount has been deducted and withheld a receipt for the amount
deducted and withheld, and shall obtain from the person receiving a prize award
the person’s name, address, and social security number in order to facilitate
the preparation of returns required by this section.
      (2)    On or before the tenth day of each month, the video lottery sales
agent shall file a return electronically with the Tax Commissioner of the
Municipality providing the names, addresses, and social security numbers of the
person from whose prize awards amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount
of each such deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the
amount of the prize award from which each such amount was withheld, and any
other information required by the Tax Commissioner. With the return, the video
lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax Commissioner all
amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (3)    A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all
receipts issued under division (C) of this section and shall make those records
available to the Tax Commissioner upon request. Such records shall be
maintained in accordance with section 5474.17 of the Ohio Revised Code and any
rules adopted pursuant thereto.
      (4)    Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, each video
lottery terminal sales agent shall file an annual return electronically with
the Tax Commissioner of the municipal corporation in which the facility is
located indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The video lottery sales agent shall remit electronically with
the annual return any amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not
previously remitted. If the name, address, or social security number of a
person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was
omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period that information shall be
indicated on the annual return.
      (5)    Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a video
lottery sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with
respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The information return shall show the total amount of municipal
income tax deducted and withheld from the person’s prize award by the video
lottery sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent
shall provide the Tax Commissioner of the municipal corporation a copy of each
information return issued under this division. The Tax Commissioner may require
that such copies be transmitted electronically.
      (6)    A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit
the amounts deducted and withheld is personally liable for the amount deducted
and withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty
and interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
   (C)    If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video
lottery sales agent that purchases the video lottery terminals from the agent
shall withhold an amount from the purchase money that is sufficient to cover
the amounts deducted and withheld and any penalties and interest thereon until
the predecessor video lottery sales agent operator produces either of the
following:
      (1)    A receipt from the Tax Commissioner showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
      (2)    A certificate from the Tax Commissioner indicating that no amounts
are due. If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is
personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
   (D)    The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person’s prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.

remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to remit amounts deducted
and withheld as required under this section, the Tax Commissioner of a

late. Interest shall accrue on past due amounts deducted and withheld at the
rate prescribed in section 5703.47 of the Ohio Revised Code.

portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:

      (2)    A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an

requested alternative method unless the Tax Commissioner denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of Section
183.19 of this Chapter.
      (3)    The Tax Commissioner may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by

inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee’s presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)    Any other location, if the Tax Commissioner determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer’s municipal income tax liability. If
the Tax Commissioner makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Commissioner’s determination is unreasonable.
   (D)    For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal
corporation as follows:
      (1)    Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall

sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.

corporation to purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the
taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the
solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
      (2)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the

      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group’s consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity’s net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity’s net profit or loss from the

purpose of making the computations required in Section
183.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group’s net profit

all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity’s net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
183.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group’s net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income

the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer’s receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)    If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of

compensation plan, then the “qualifying loss” is the product of the amount
resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this section
computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a fraction

taxable year for which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation
with respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of
which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If

average shall be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)    (1)    Except as provided in Division (D) of this section, a
refundable credit shall be allowed against the income imposed by a municipal

year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the qualifying
loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)    A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)    If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation’s proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)    In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)    (1)    For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.

credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the

the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)    The employee’s failure or inability to satisfy all the employer’s
terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.

   (B)    Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall

profit return electronically through the Ohio business gateway or in some other
manner shall mail the documents required under this division to the Tax
Commissioner at the time of filing. The department of taxation shall publish a
method of electronically submitting the documents required under this division
through the Ohio business gateway on or before January 1, 2016. The department
shall transmit all documents submitted electronically under this division to
the appropriate Tax Commissioner.
      (5)    After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Commissioner shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer’s
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Commissioner.
      (6)    Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Commissioner
of undocumented credits or losses.
   (G)    (1)    (a)    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Commissioner on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under division
(G) of section 5747.08 of the Ohio Revised Code. The taxpayer shall complete

profit income tax return required to be filed under this section by a taxpayer
that is not an individual shall be completed and filed as required by the tax
administrator on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the
end of the taxpayer’s taxable year or period. The taxpayer shall complete and
file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the tax administrator or on
generic forms, together with remittance made payable to the Municipality.
         (c)    In the case of individual income tax return required to be
filed by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed
by a taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)    If the Tax Commissioner considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Commissioner may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)    With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
183.092 of this Chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this
division conflicts with any provision in Section
183.092 of this Chapter, the provision in Section
183.092 of this Chapter prevails.
   (H)    (1)    For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (2)    Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the
Municipality an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) and (4) of this
section.
   (I)    This division shall not apply to payments required to be made under
division (B)(1)(b) of Section
183.051 of this Chapter.
      (1)    If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to be
filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or
before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period of
that to the Tax Commissioner or other municipal officer with which the report,
claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to which the
payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on the cover
in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment is mailed
shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment. “The date of
postmark” means, in the event there is more than one date on the cover, the
earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)    If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Commissioner for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. For purposes of this
section, “submitted the payment” means the date which the taxpayer has
designated for the delivery of payment, which may or may not be the same date
the payment was initiated by the taxpayer. 46
   (J)    The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent
of an employer, or other payer as described in Section
183.051 of this Chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation
as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the
amounts withheld were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Commissioner about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Commissioner to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Commissioner with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Commissioner for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer’s refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Commissioner and
has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Commissioner about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)    The Tax Commissioner of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter and of the
Municipality’s ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (M)    When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Commissioner, shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (N)    (1)    As used in this division, “worksite location” has the same
meaning as in Section
183.052 of this chapter.
      (2)    A person may notify a tax administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (a)    The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The
Tax Commissioner is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who has
not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)    The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation’s
income tax for the taxable year.
The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly explains
the person’s circumstances, including the location of the previous worksite
location and the last date on which the person performed services or made any
sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also shall include the
following statement: “The affiant has no plans to perform any services within
the municipal corporation, or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the
municipal corporation, or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the
municipal corporation during the taxable year. If the affiant does become
subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation for the taxable year,
the affiant agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly register as a
taxpayer with the municipal corporation, if such a registration is required by
the municipal corporation’s resolutions, ordinances, or rules.” The person
shall sign the affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         (c)    If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2)
of this section, the tax commissioner shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the tax commissioner possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit of if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the tax commissioner for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (N) of this section prohibits the tax commissioner from performing an
audit of the person.

support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in support of the
armed forces, may apply to the Tax Commissioner of the City of Port Clinton for

section, the Tax Commissioner may prescribe such contract terms as the Tax
Commissioner considers appropriate.
      (2)    If the Tax Commissioner ascertains that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the Municipality before the one hundred eighty-first day after
the applicant duty or service terminates.
      (3)    Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (B)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Commissioner shall not require
any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
   (C)    (1)    Nothing in this division denies to any person described in
this division the application of division (A) and (B) of this section.
      (2)    (a)    A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension
under the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in
which to file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of
time in which to make any payment of taxes required by the Municipality in
accordance with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under
division (C)(2)(a) of this section shall be equal to the length of the
corresponding extension that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue
Code. As used in this section, “qualifying taxpayer” means a member of the
national guard or a member of the reserve component of the armed forces of the
United States called to active duty pursuant to either an executive order
issued by the President of the United States or an act of the Congress of the
United States, or a civilian serving as support personnel in a combat zone or

division (C)(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension

the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Commissioner shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Commissioner
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (D)    For each taxable year to which division (A), (B), or (C) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (B)(2) and (3) or
(C) of this section, as applicable, apply to that spouse of that taxpayer if
the filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married and filing jointly
for that year.
(Ord. 19-15.  Passed 10-27-15.)
183.093 USE OF OHIO BUSINESS GATEWAY; TYPES OF FILINGS AUTHORIZED.
   (A)    Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to the
taxpayer’s net profit from a business or profession may file any municipal
income tax return or, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for

be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.

withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
   (D)    The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by Municipality, taxpayers, or

administration of municipal income taxes or to an appeal of a municipal income
tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
   (E)    Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing
the authority of the Municipality to administer, audit, and enforce the
provisions of its municipal income tax. 
(Ord. 19-15.  Passed 10-27-15.)
183.094 EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE.
   (A)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer’s federal income tax return shall automatically receive
an extension for filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due date
of the municipal income tax return shall be the fifteenth day of the tenth
month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates.
   (B)    Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal extension for a
period of other than six-months for filing the taxpayer’s federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for filing of a municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended federal income tax return.

for filing the taxpayer’s federal income tax return may request that the Tax
Commissioner grant the taxpayer six-month extension of the date for filing the
taxpayer’s municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the tax
commissioner on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due, the
tax commissioner shall grant the taxpayer’s requested extension.
   (D)    An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Commissioner grants an extension
of that date.
   (E)    If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of section 5747.08 of the
Ohio Revised Code, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the

      (3)    If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer’s consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Commissioner before filing the
amended return.
   (B)    (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars ($10.00) or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return.
Except as provided under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return
shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a
previously filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly,
by the adjustment to the taxpayer’s federal or state income tax return unless

Section
183.19 of this Chapter has not expired for a previously filed return.

taxpayer’s annual return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by
the adjustment to the taxpayer’s federal or state income tax return unless it
is also filed within the time prescribed in Section
183.096 of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer’s federal or state income tax return.
      (2)    The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.

dollars;
   (B)    (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Commissioner, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer’s claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and/or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Commissioner shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)    If the Tax Commissioner denies in whole or in part a refund
request included within the taxpayer’s originally filed annual income tax
return, the Tax Commissioner shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the
amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and
instructions for requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
183.18 of this Chapter.
   (C)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (B) of this section, shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:

postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)    The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)    The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (D)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts over paid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
division (A)(4) of Section
183.10 of this Chapter.

written description of the roles of the Tax Commissioner and of the taxpayer
during an audit and a statement of the taxpayer’s rights, including any right
to obtain a refund of an overpayment of tax. At or before the commencement of
an audit, the Tax Commissioner shall inform the taxpayer when the audit is
considered to have commenced.
   (B)    Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Commissioner shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business hours
and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is unable
to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the proposed
time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable alternative
dates for the audit.
   (C)    At all stages of an audit by the Tax Commissioner, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Commissioner shall prescribe a form by which a
taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the taxpayer in the
conduct of any proceeding resulting from actions by the Tax Commissioner. If a
taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Commissioner may accept as other
evidence, as the Tax Commissioner considers appropriate, that a person is the
authorized representative of the taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
the audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer’s
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner. This division does
not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.
   (D)    A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)    The failure of the Tax Commissioner to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer’s case.
   (F)    If the Tax Commissioner fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Commissioner, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest arising from
the audit.

   A person may round to the nearest whole dollar all amounts the person is
required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document required
under this chapter. Any fractional part of a dollar that equals or exceeds
fifty cents shall be rounded to the next whole dollar, and any fractional part
of a dollar that is less than fifty cents shall be dropped, rounding down to
the nearest whole dollar. If a person chooses to round amounts entered on a
document, the person shall round all amounts entered on the document.

accordance with this chapter.
   (B)    The Tax Commissioner may do either of the following if such action is

   (F)    The Tax Commissioner may require that the taxpayer provide detailed
financial documentation and information, in order to determine whether or not a
payment-over-time agreement will be authorized. The taxpayer’s failure to
provide the necessary and required information by the Tax Commissioner shall
preclude consideration of a payment-over-time agreement.
(Ord. 19-15.  Passed 10-27-15.)
183.133 AUTHORITY OF THE TAX COMMISSIONER; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (A)    The Tax Commissioner, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Commissioner believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. Upon written request by the
Tax Commissioner or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Commissioner, authorized agent, or employee
to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal and state
income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the request.
   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Commissioner believes is subject to,
the provisions of this Chapter shall be preserved for a period of six years
following the end of a taxable year to which the records or documents relate
unless the Tax Commissioner, in writing, consents to their destruction within
that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Commissioner of a municipal corporation by require any person, by notice

liability, for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding

Commissioner reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was

and federal and state income tax returns in such person’s possession or
control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant,
bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or examination. This
division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an
attorney.
   (D)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Commissioner compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal and state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.

with the Tax Commissioner to provide identifying information, which may include
the person’s social security number, federal employer identification number, or
other identification number requested by the Tax Commissioner. A person
required by the Tax Commissioner to provide identifying information that has
experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify the Tax
Commissioner of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax document
requiring the identifying information.
   (B)   (1)    If the Tax Commissioner makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Commissioner does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Commissioner from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
183.10 of this Chapter, in addition to any applicable penalty described in
Section
183.99 of this Chapter.
      (2)    If a person required by the Tax Commissioner to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Commissioner of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (A) of this section
within thirty days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
183.10 of this Chapter.
      (3)    The penalties provided for under divisions (B)(1) and (2) of this
section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable penalties described in Section
183.99 of this Chapter for a violation of
183.15 of this Chapter, and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax
Administrator by law.
         (Ord. 19-15.  Passed 10-27-15.)
183.14  CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by ORC 718 or by the charter
or ordinance of the Municipality is confidential, and no person shall access or
disclose such information except in accordance with a proper judicial order or
in connection with the performance of that person’s official duties or the
official business of the Municipality as authorized by ORC 718 or the charter
or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax Commissioner of the Municipality or
a designee thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received
under this chapter and other related tax information to the Internal Revenue

other municipal corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the Municipality from publishing or

to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 19-15.  Passed 10-27-15.)
183.15  FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by municipal corporation ordinance or
state law to be filed with the Tax Commissioner, or knowingly procure, counsel,
or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return, schedule,

this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Commissioner.
   (B)    A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Commissioner as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Commissioner shall be an “opinion of the Tax Administrator” and shall bind the
Tax Commissioner, in accordance with divisions (C), (G), and (H) of this
section provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)    The taxpayer’s request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction are clearly identified by
name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)    The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in
accordance with this Chapter.
      (3)    The Tax Commissioner’s response is signed by the Tax Commissioner
and designated as an “opinion of the Tax Commissioner.”

protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Commissioner’s opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)    The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax Commissioner
sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested. The effective
date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer’s date of receipt or one year
after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)    The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the Municipality’s
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)    The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the Municipality’s income tax ordinance;
      (4)    If the opinion of the Tax Commissioner was based on the
interpretation of federal law, effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes and
regulations;
      (5)    The effective date of any change in the taxpayer’s material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)    The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (D)    (1)    A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity
or transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)    If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts
or omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of Section
183.15 of this Chapter.
   (E)    If a Tax Commissioner provides written advice under this section, the
opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)    The tax consequences state in the opinion may be subject to change
for any of the reasons stated in division (C) of this section;
      (2)    It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (F)    A Tax Commissioner may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (G)    This section binds a Tax Commissioner only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Commissioner issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)    An opinion of a Tax Commissioner binds that Tax Commissioner only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Commissioner of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)    A Tax Commissioner shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Commissioner has

involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J) An opinion of the Tax Commissioner issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under subsection (F) may not be appealed.
(Ord. 19-15.  Passed 10-27-15.)
183.17  ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)    (1)    The Tax Commissioner shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)    The Tax Commissioner may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)    Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Commissioner or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the person
to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that assessment by
filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty days after the
receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Commissioner as
prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima facie evidence that
delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)    (1)    A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Commissioner
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Commissioner originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at that address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person’s agent or the person’s affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person’s affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty percent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee’s business.
      (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Commissioner or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Commissioner or other official from entering into a compromise
with the person if the person does not actually file an appeal with the Local
Board of Tax Review.
         (Ord. 19-15.  Passed 10-27-15.)
183.18  LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (A)    (1)    The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio Revised Code
Chapter 718.
      (2)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members.
Two members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the
Municipality, and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with
the Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years immediately
preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality. This member may be an employee of
the Municipality, but may not be the director of finance or equivalent officer,
or the Tax Commissioner or other similar official or an employee directly
involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)    The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)    Members of the board of tax review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in section
718.11(A)(4) of the Revised Code.
      (5)    A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)    A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member’s predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)    If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member’s
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)    A member of the local Board of Tax Review shall not be appointed
to or serve on another such board simultaneously.
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Commissioner issues an assessment, the Tax
Commissioner shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer’s right to appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal
should be directed, and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall
be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Commissioner’s
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board’s final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Commissioner may appeal the board’s
final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (F)    The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing and may be amended as needed
by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records available
for inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code. For this reason,
any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final determinations, or
working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure location under the
control of the Tax Commissioner. No member of the Local Board of Tax Review may
remove such documentation, copies of returns or reports, final determinations,
or working papers from the hearing. Hearings requested by a taxpayer before a
Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section are not meetings of
a public body subject to section 121.22 of the Ohio Revised Code. For this
reason, such hearings shall not be open to the public, and only those parties
to the case may be present during the hearing.
(Ord. 19-15.  Passed 10-27-15.)
183.19  ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (A)    (1)    (a)    Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            (i)    Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)    One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)    The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Commissioner and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)    As used in this section, “qualifying deferral period” means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)    Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in
Section
183.18 of this Chapter. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)    Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which
the final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if
any party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after

file a return, or the omission of twenty-five percent or more income required
to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after the
commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
183.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)    (1)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)    If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Commissioner, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
183.18 of this Chapter, of the Ohio board of tax appeals, or any court to which
the decision of the Ohio board of tax appeals has been appealed, so that the
amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than
the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant’s
assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as
provided in Section
183.096 of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division
(D) of this section.
   (E)    No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)    The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)    The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of
that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.

   (A)    Pursuant to section 718.30 of the Revised Code, the legislative
authority of the Municipality pursuant to this Chapter, grants authority to the
Tax Commissioner to adopt rules to administer the income tax imposed by the
Municipality. Such rules shall not conflict with or be inconsistent with any
provisions of this Chapter. In case of conflicts between any such rule and the
provisions of this Chapter, the provisions of this Chapter shall prevail.
Taxpayers are required to comply not only with the requirements of this
Chapter, but also to comply with the rules and regulations adopted by the Tax
Commissioner.
   (B)    All rules adopted under this section shall be published and posted on
the internet.

183.23  DEFINITIONS.
   If a term used in Sections
183.22 to
183.37 of the Codified Ordinances that is not otherwise defined in this chapter
is used in a comparable context in both the laws of the United States relating
to federal income tax and in Title LVII of the Revised Code and the use is not
consistent, then the use of the term in the laws of the United States relating
to federal income tax shall have control over the use of the term in Title LVII
of the Revised Code, unless the term is defined in Chapter 5703 of the Revised
Code, in which case the definition in that chapter shall control. Any reference
in this chapter to the Internal Revenue Code includes other laws of the United
States related to federal income taxes. If a term is defined in both this
section and Section
183.03 of the Codified Ordinances, the definition in this section shall control
for all uses of that term in Sections
183.22 to
183.37 of the Codified Ordinances.

   (A)    "Municipal taxable income" means income apportioned or sitused to the
municipal corporation under Section
183.24 of the Codified Ordinances, as applicable, reduced by any pre-2017 net
operating loss carryforward available to the person for the municipal
corporation.
   (B)    "Adjusted federal taxable income," for a person required to file as a

Section
183.03 of the Codified Ordinances, means a C corporation's federal taxable
income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined under
the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
      (1)    Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal taxable
income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the intangible
income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
      (2)    Add an amount equal to five per cent of intangible income deducted
under division (B)(1) of this section, but excluding that portion of intangible
income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property
described in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of
federal taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or
other disposition of an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code.
      (4)   (a)    Except as provided in division (B)(4)(b) of this section,
deduct income and gain included in federal taxable income to the extent the
income and gain directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of
an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code.

the income or gain is income or gain described in section 1245 or 1250 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (5)    Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction in
the computation of federal taxable income.
      (6)    In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated
investment company, add all amounts with respect to dividends to, distributions
to, or amounts set aside for or credited to the benefit of investors and
allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal taxable income.
      (7)    Deduct, to the extent not otherwise deducted or excluded in
computing federal taxable income, any income derived from a transfer agreement
or from the enterprise transferred under that agreement under section 4313.02
of the Revised Code.
      (8)    Deduct exempt income to the extent not otherwise deducted or
excluded in computing adjusted federal taxable income.
      (9)    Deduct any net profit of a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that net profit in
the group's federal taxable income in accordance with division (E)(3)(b) of
Section
183.28 of the Codified Ordinances.
      (10)    Add any loss incurred by a pass-through entity owned directly or

183.28 of the Codified Ordinances.
If the taxpayer is not a C corporation, is not a disregarded entity that has
made the election described in Section 718.01(L)(2) of the Revised Code, and is
not a publicly traded partnership that has made the election described in
division (23)(D)(v) of Section
183.03 of the Codified Ordinances, the taxpayer shall compute adjusted federal
taxable income under this section as if the taxpayer were a C corporation,
except guaranteed payments and other similar amounts paid or accrued to a
partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former
member shall not be allowed as a deductible expense unless such payments are in
consideration for the use of capital and treated as payment of interest under
section 469 of the Internal Revenue Code or United States treasury regulations.
Amounts paid or accrued to a qualified self-employed retirement plan with
respect to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member,
or former member of the taxpayer, amounts paid or accrued to or for health
insurance for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder,
member, or former member, and amounts paid or accrued to or for life insurance
for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or
former member shall not be allowed as a deduction.
Nothing in division (B) of this section shall be construed as allowing the
taxpayer to add or deduct any amount more than once or shall be construed as
allowing any taxpayer to deduct any amount paid to or accrued for purposes of
federal self-employment tax.
   (C)    "Taxpayer" has the same meaning as in Section
183.03(49) of the Codified Ordinances, except that "taxpayer" does not include
natural persons or entities subject to the tax imposed under Chapter 5745 of
the Revised Code. "Taxpayer" may include receivers, assignees, or trustees in
bankruptcy when such persons are required to assume the role of a taxpayer.
   (D)    "Tax return" or "return" means the notifications and reports required
to be filed pursuant to Sections
183.22 to
183.37 of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of reporting municipal income
taxes, and includes declarations of estimated tax.
   (E)    "Taxable year" means the calendar year or the taxpayer's fiscal year
ending during the calendar year, or fractional part thereof, upon which the
calculation of the taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income is based pursuant
to this chapter. If a taxpayer's taxable year is changed for federal income tax
purposes, the taxable year for purposes of Sections
183.22 to
183.37 of the Codified Ordinances is changed accordingly but may consist of an
aggregation of more than one taxable year for federal income tax purposes. The
tax commissioner may prescribe by rule an appropriate period as the taxable
year for a taxpayer that has had a change of its taxable year for federal
income tax purposes, for a taxpayer that has two or more short taxable years
for federal income tax purposes as the result of a change of ownership, or for
a new taxpayer that would otherwise have no taxable year.
   (F)    "Assessment" means a notice of underpayment or nonpayment of a tax
issued pursuant to Section
183.19 of the Codified Ordinances.
      (Ord. 38-18.  Passed 11-27-18.)
183.24  APPLICABILITY; TAXABLE SITUS; APPORTIONMENT.
   This section applies to any taxpayer that is engaged in a business or
profession in the City of Port Clinton and that has made the election under
Section

   (A)    Except as otherwise provided in division (B) of this section, net
profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of the City of Port Clinton shall be considered as having a taxable
situs in the City of Port Clinton for purposes of municipal income taxation in
the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:

personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the City of Port Clinton during the taxable period to the average original
cost of all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the
taxpayer in the business or profession during the same period, wherever

As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the City of Port Clinton to wages, salaries, and other
compensation paid during the same period to individuals employed in the
business or profession, wherever the individual's services are performed,
excluding compensation from which taxes are not required to be withheld under
Section
183.06(A)(20) of the Codified Ordinances;
      (3)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the City of
Port Clinton to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B)   (1)    If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the City of Port Clinton, the taxpayer may request, or the tax commissioner may
require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion of the
income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving one or
more of the following:
         (a)    Separate accounting;
         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
         (d)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)    A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the tax commissioner denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of Section
183.19 of the Codified Ordinances.
      (3)    The tax commissioner may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of Section
183.19 of the Codified Ordinances.
   (C)    As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)    A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         (a)    The employer;
         (b)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)    Any other location, if the tax commissioner determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If
the tax commissioner makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the tax
commissioner's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)    For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to the City of
Port Clinton as follows:
      (1)    Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall
be sitused to the City of Port Clinton only if, regardless of where title
passes, the property meets either of the following criteria:
         (a)    The property is shipped to or delivered within the City of Port
Clinton from a stock of goods located within the City of Port Clinton.
         (b)    The property is delivered within the City of Port Clinton from
a location outside the City of Port Clinton, provided the taxpayer is regularly
engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales
within the City of Port Clinton and the sales result from such solicitation or
promotion.
      (2)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
City of Port Clinton to the extent that such services are performed in the City

royalties from real property located in the City of Port Clinton shall be

property shall be sitused to the City of Port Clinton based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the City of Port Clinton.
   (E)    Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the
sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the City of Port
Clinton in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real
estate agent or broker shall be allocated to the City of Port Clinton based
upon the ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate located in the City of Port Clinton to the
commissions received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate
everywhere in the taxable year.
   (F)    If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (C)(12) and (R)(1)(d) of section 718.01 of the Ohio
Revised Code or substantially similar provision of the codified ordinances of
another municipal corporation, the taxpayer shall add the amount that is exempt
from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to the City of
Port Clinton. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to its net profit
that was apportioned to the City of Port Clinton any amount other than the
amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were the amount
related to the stock option not exempted from taxation.
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to the City of Port
Clinton under this section.
   (G)    When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.

      (2)    If the commissioner considers it necessary in order to ensure

      (3)    "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (A)
(1) of this section.
      (4)    "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
section 4927.01 of the Revised Code.
      (5)    "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
section 5727.01 of the Revised Code.
   (B)   (1)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of
corporations may elect to file a consolidated tax return for a taxable year if
at least one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to
municipal income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of
corporations filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to
that taxable year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning
with the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the
reporting method is required under federal law. The election continues to be
binding for each subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to
discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under division (B)(2) of this
section or a taxpayer receives permission from the tax commissioner. The tax
commissioner shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under
this section must be made on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of
the year following the last year of a five-year consolidated tax return
election period in effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election
to discontinue filing a consolidated tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)    An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)    When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under Section
183.22 of the Codified Ordinances, a valid election made by the taxpayer under
division (B)(1) or (2) of Section
183.22 of the Codified Ordinances is binding upon the tax commissioner for the
remainder of the five-year period.
      (5)    When an election made under Section
183.22 of the Codified Ordinances is terminated, a valid election made under
this section is binding upon the tax administrator for the remainder of the
five-year period.
   (C)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated tax return for that taxable year if the tax commissioner
determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany transactions
have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a distortive
shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net profits to a
municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated tax
return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated tax return for all
subsequent taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written
permission from the commissioner to file a separate return or a taxpayer has
experienced a change in circumstances.
   (D)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated tax return in the same manner
as is required under the United States department of treasury regulations that
prescribe procedures for the preparation of the consolidated federal income tax
return required to be filed by the common parent of the affiliated group of
which the taxpayer is a member.
   (E)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated tax return shall compute
adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
183.23 of the Codified Ordinances, by substituting "consolidated federal
taxable income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income"
appears in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of
corporation's" for "a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in
that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall make any
adjustment otherwise required under division (B) of Section
183.23 of the Codified Ordinances to the extent that the item of income or
deduction otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or
consolidated in the computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall do one of the following
with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for that taxable
year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
183.24 of the Codified Ordinances, exclude the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net
profit or loss is so excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a
separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise
be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
183.24 of the Codified Ordinances, include the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net
profit or loss is so included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a
separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in
the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated tax return shall
exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the purposes of making
the computations required in Section
183.24 of the Codified Ordinances, exclude the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with Sections
183.22 to
183.37 of the Codified Ordinances on the basis of the entity's net profits that
would otherwise be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the
affiliated group.
   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated tax return shall make the
computations required under Section
183.24 of the Codified Ordinances by substituting "consolidated federal taxable
income attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from"
appears in that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations"
for "taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated tax return is jointly and
severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges, or other
amounts applicable under Section
183.22 to
183.37 of the Codified Ordinances or Chapter 5703 of the Revised Code to the
corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any
portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated
group.
(Ord. 38-18.  Passed 11-27-18.)
183.29  FAILURE TO PAY TAX.
   If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under Sections
183.22 to
183.37 of the Codified Ordinances fails to pay any tax as required under
Sections
183.22 to
183.37 of the Codified Ordinances, or any portion of that tax, on or before the
date prescribed for its payment, interest shall be assessed, collected, and
paid, in the same manner as the tax, upon such unpaid amount at the rate per
annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the date
prescribed for its payment until it is paid or until the date an assessment is
issued under Section
183.19 of the Codified Ordinances, whichever occurs first.
(Ord. 38-18.  Passed 11-27-18.)
183.30  DECLARATION OF ESTIMATED TAXES.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Combined tax liability" means the total amount of a taxpayer's
income tax liabilities to all municipal corporations in this state for a
taxable year.
      (2)    "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's combined tax liability for the current taxable
year.
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (B)(4) of this section, every
taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for the current taxable
year, on the form prescribed by the tax commissioner, if the amount payable as
estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars.
      (2)    Except as provided in division (B)(4) of this section, a taxpayer
having a taxable year of less than twelve months shall make a declaration under
rules prescribed by the commissioner.
      (3)    The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of the taxable year or on
or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the taxpayer becomes
subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)    The tax commissioner may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.
   (C)    Each taxpayer shall file the declaration of estimated taxes with, and
remit estimated taxes to, the tax commissioner at the times and in the amounts
prescribed in division (C)(1) of this section. Remitted taxes shall be made
payable to the treasurer of state.
      (1)    The required portion of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year that shall be paid through estimated taxes shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half per cent of the combined
tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)    On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five per cent of the combined tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (c)    On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half per cent of the
combined tax liability for the taxable year;
         (d)    On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the
taxable year, ninety per cent of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year.
      (2)    If the taxpayer determines that its declaration of estimated taxes
will not accurately reflect the taxpayer's tax liability for the taxable year,
the taxpayer shall increase or decrease, as appropriate, its subsequent
payments in equal installments to result in a more accurate payment of
estimated taxes.
      (3)   (a)    Each taxpayer shall report on the declaration of estimated
taxes the portion of the remittance that the taxpayer estimates that it owes to
each municipal corporation for the taxable year.
         (b)    Upon receiving a payment of estimated taxes under this section,
the commissioner shall immediately forward the payment to the treasurer of
state. The treasurer shall credit the payment in the same manner as in division
(B) of section 718.85 of the Revised Code.
   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of estimated taxes, there shall
be added to the taxes an amount determined at the rate per annum prescribed by
section 5703.47 of the Revised Code upon the amount of underpayment for the
period of underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as
described in division (E) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall
be determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the
date prescribed for that payment;
         (c)    For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)    For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety per
cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently due.
      (3)    All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as
taxes collected under Sections
183.22 to
183.37 of the Codified Ordinances and shall be credited and distributed to
municipal corporations in accordance with section 718.83 of the Revised Code.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of a combined tax liability shall be
due to reasonable cause and the penalty imposed by this section shall not be
added to the taxes for the taxable year if any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety per cent of the combined tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a municipal
income tax return for that year.
         (Ord. 38-18.  Passed 11-27-18.)
183.31  ADDITIONAL PENALTIES.
   (A)    In addition to any other penalty imposed by Sections
183.22 to
183.37 of the Codified Ordinances or Chapter 5703 of the Revised Code, the
following penalties shall apply:
      (1)    If a taxpayer required to file a tax return under Sections
183.22 to
183.37 of the Codified Ordinances fails to make and file the return within the
time prescribed, including any extensions of time granted by the tax
commissioner, the commissioner may impose a penalty not exceeding twenty-five
dollars per month or fraction of a month, for each month or fraction of a month
elapsing between the due date, including extensions of the due date, and the
date on which the return is filed. The aggregate penalty, per instance, under
this division shall not exceed one hundred fifty dollars.
      (2)    If a person required to file a tax return electronically under
Sections
183.22 to 183.37 of the Codified Ordinances fails to do so, the commissioner
may impose a penalty not to exceed the following:
         (a)    For each of the first two failures, five per cent of the amount
required to be reported on the return;
         (b)    For the third and any subsequent failure, ten per cent of the
amount required to be reported on the return.
      (3)    If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under Section
183.22 of the Codified Ordinances fails to timely pay an amount of tax required
to be paid under this chapter, the commissioner may impose a penalty equal to
fifteen per cent of the amount not timely paid.
      (4)    If a taxpayer files what purports to be a tax return required by
Sections
183.22 to
183.37 of the Codified Ordinances that does not contain information upon which
the substantial correctness of the return may be judged or contains information
that on its face indicates that the return is substantially incorrect, and the
filing of the return in that manner is due to a position that is frivolous or a
desire that is apparent from the return to delay or impede the administration
of Sections
183.22 to
183.37 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty of up to five hundred dollars may
be imposed.
      (5)    If a taxpayer makes a fraudulent attempt to evade the reporting or
payment of the tax required to be shown on any return required under Sections
183.22 to
183.37 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the
greater of one thousand dollars or one hundred per cent of the tax required to
be shown on the return.
      (6)    If any person makes a false or fraudulent claim for a refund under
Section
183.15 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the
greater of one thousand dollars or one hundred per cent of the claim. Any
penalty imposed under this division, any refund issued on the claim, and
interest on any refund from the date of the refund, may be assessed under
Section
183.19 of the Codified Ordinances without regard to any time limitation for the
assessment imposed by division (A) of that section.
   (B)   For purposes of this section, the tax required to be shown on a tax
return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax paid on or before
the date, including any extensions of the date, prescribed for filing the
return.
   (C)    Each penalty imposed under this section shall be in addition to any
other penalty imposed under this section. All or part of any penalty imposed
under this section may be abated by the tax commissioner. The commissioner may
adopt rules governing the imposition and abatement of such penalties.
   (D)    All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as taxes
collected under Sections
183.22 to
183.37 of the Codified Ordinances and shall be credited and distributed to
municipal corporations in the same proportion as the underlying tax liability
is required to be distributed to such municipal corporations under section
718.83 of the Revised Code. 
(Ord. 38-18.  Passed 11-27-18.)
183.32  ASSESSMENTS AGAINST TAXPAYER.
   (A)    If any taxpayer required to file a return under Section
183.22 to
183.37 of the Codified Ordinances fails to file the return within the time
prescribed, files an incorrect return, or fails to remit the full amount of the
tax due for the period covered by the return, the tax commissioner may make an
assessment against the taxpayer for any deficiency for the period for which the
return or tax is due, based upon any information in the commissioner's
possession.
   The tax commissioner shall not make or issue an assessment against a
taxpayer more than three years after the later of the date the return subject
to assessment was required to be filed or the date the return was filed. Such
time limit may be extended if both the taxpayer and the commissioner consent in
writing to the extension. Any such extension shall extend the three-year time
limit in Section
183.19 of the Codified Ordinances for the same period of time. There shall be
no bar or limit to an assessment against a taxpayer that fails to file a return
subject to assessment as required by Sections
183.22 to
183.37 of the Codified Ordinances, or that files a fraudulent return. The
commissioner shall give the taxpayer assessed written notice of the assessment
as provided in section 5703.37 of the Revised Code. With the notice, the
commissioner shall provide instructions on how to petition for reassessment and
request a hearing on the petition.
   (B)    Unless the taxpayer assessed files with the tax commissioner within
sixty days after service of the notice of assessment, either personally or by
certified mail, a written petition for reassessment signed by the authorized
agent of the taxpayer assessed having knowledge of the facts, the assessment
becomes final, and the amount of the assessment is due and payable from the
taxpayer to the treasurer of state. The petition shall indicate the taxpayer's
objections, but additional objections may be raised in writing if received by
the commissioner prior to the date shown on the final determination. If the
petition has been properly filed, the commissioner shall proceed under section
5703.60 of the Revised Code.
   (C)    After an assessment becomes final, if any portion of the assessment
remains unpaid, including accrued interest, a certified copy of the tax
commissioner's entry making the assessment final may be filed in the office of
the clerk of the court of common pleas in the county in which the taxpayer has
an office or place of business in this state, the county in which the
taxpayer's statutory agent is located, or Franklin county.
   Immediately upon the filing of the entry, the clerk shall enter a judgment
against the taxpayer assessed in the amount shown on the entry. The judgment
may be filed by the clerk in a loose-leaf book entitled "special judgments for
municipal income taxes," and shall have the same effect as other judgments.
Execution shall issue upon the judgment upon the request of the tax
commissioner, and all laws applicable to sales on execution shall apply to
sales made under the judgment.
   If the assessment is not paid in its entirety within sixty days after the
day the assessment was issued, the portion of the assessment consisting of tax
due shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of
the Revised Code from the day the commissioner issues the assessment until the
assessment is paid or until it is certified to the attorney general for
collection under section 131.02 of the Revised Code, whichever comes first. If
the unpaid portion of the assessment is certified to the attorney general for
collection, the entire unpaid portion of the assessment shall bear interest at
the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the
date of certification until the date it is paid in its entirety. Interest shall
be paid in the same manner as the tax and may be collected by issuing an
assessment under this section.
   (D)    All money collected under this section shall be credited to the
municipal income tax fund and distributed to the municipal corporation to which
the money is owed based on the assessment issued under this section.
   (E)    If the tax commissioner believes that collection of the tax will be
jeopardized unless proceedings to collect or secure collection of the tax are
instituted without delay, the commissioner may issue a jeopardy assessment
against the taxpayer liable for the tax. Immediately upon the issuance of the
jeopardy assessment, the commissioner shall file an entry with the clerk of the
court of common pleas in the manner prescribed by division (C) of this section.
Notice of the jeopardy assessment shall be served on the taxpayer assessed or
the taxpayer's legal representative in the manner provided in section 5703.37
of the Revised Code within five days of the filing of the entry with the clerk.
The total amount assessed is immediately due and payable, unless the taxpayer
assessed files a petition for reassessment in accordance with division (B) of
this section and provides security in a form satisfactory to the commissioner
and in an amount sufficient to satisfy the unpaid balance of the assessment.
Full or partial payment of the assessment does not prejudice the commissioner's
consideration of the petition for reassessment.
   (F)    Notwithstanding the fact that a petition for reassessment is pending,
the taxpayer may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the petition. The acceptance of a payment by the treasurer of state does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the petition.
   If upon final determination of the petition an error in the assessment is
corrected by the tax commissioner, upon petition so filed or pursuant to a
decision of the board of tax appeals or any court to which the determination or
decision has been appealed, so that the amount due from the taxpayer under the
corrected assessment is less than the portion paid, there shall be issued to
the taxpayer, its assigns, or legal representative a refund in the amount of
the overpayment as provided by Section
183.19 of the Codified Ordinances, with interest on that amount as provided by
that section. 
(Ord. 38-18.  Passed 11-27-18.)
183.33  REFUND APPLICATIONS.
   (A)    An application to refund to a taxpayer the amount of taxes paid on
any illegal, erroneous, or excessive payment of tax under Sections
183.22 to
183.37 of the Codified Ordinances, including assessments, shall be filed with
the tax commissioner within three years after the date of the illegal,
erroneous, or excessive payment of the tax, or within any additional period
allowed by division (A) of Section
183.19 of the Codified Ordinances. The application shall be filed in the form
prescribed by the tax commissioner.
   (B)   (1)    On the filing of a refund application, the tax commissioner
shall determine the amount of refund to which the applicant is entitled. The
amount determined shall be based on the amount overpaid per return or
assessment. If the amount is greater than ten dollars and not less than that
claimed, the commissioner shall certify that amount to the director of budget
and management and the treasurer of state for payment from the tax refund fund
created in section 5703.052 of the Revised Code. If the amount is greater than
ten dollars but less than that claimed, the commissioner shall proceed in
accordance with section 5703.70 of the Revised Code.
      (2)    Upon issuance of a refund under this section, the commissioner
shall notify each municipal corporation of the amount refunded to the taxpayer
attributable to that municipal corporation, which shall be deducted from the
municipal corporation's next distribution under section 718.83 of the Revised
Code.
   (C)    Any portion of a refund determined under division (B) of this section
that is not issued within ninety days after such determination shall bear
interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised
Code from the ninety-first day after such determination until the day the
refund is paid or credited. On an illegal or erroneous assessment, interest
shall be paid at that rate from the date of payment on the illegal or erroneous
assessment until the day the refund is paid or credited.
(Ord. 38-18.  Passed 11-27-18.)
183.34  AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)    If any of the facts, figures, computations, or attachments required
in an annual return filed by a taxpayer that has made the election allowed
under Section
183.22 of the Codified Ordinances and used to determine the tax due under
Sections
183.22 to
183.37 of the Codified Ordinances must be altered as the result of an
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax return, whether initiated by
the taxpayer or the internal revenue service, and such alteration affects the
taxpayer's tax liability under those sections, the taxpayer shall file an
amended return with the tax commissioner in such form as the commissioner
requires. The amended return shall be filed not later than sixty days after the
adjustment is agreed upon or finally determined for federal income tax purposes
or after any federal income tax deficiency or refund, or the abatement or
credit resulting therefrom, has been assessed or paid, whichever occurs first.
If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal income tax
return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a consolidated
return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax return, the
taxpayer shall notify the commissioner before filing the amended return.
   (B)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. An amended return required by this section is a
return subject to assessment under Section
183.19 of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of assessing any additional
tax due under this section, together with any applicable penalty and interest.
The amended return shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments from a previously filed return no longer subject to assessment that
are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal tax return.
   (C)    In the case of an overpayment, an application for refund may be filed
under this division within the sixty-day period prescribed for filing the
amended return, even if that period extends beyond the period prescribed in
Section
183.19 of the Codified Ordinances, if the application otherwise conforms to the
requirements of that section. An application filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal income tax return unless it is also filed within the time
prescribed in Section
183.19 of the Codified Ordinances. The application shall not reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments that are not affected, either
directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax
return. 
(Ord. 38-18.  Passed 11-27-18.)
183.35  EXAMINATION OF RECORDS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS AND PERSONS.
   (A)    The tax commissioner, or any authorized agent or employee thereof,
may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax
returns of any taxpayer or other person that is subject to Sections
183.22 to
183.37 of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of
any return made or, if no return was filed, to ascertain the tax due as
required under those sections. Upon written request by the commissioner or a
duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every taxpayer or other person
subject to this section is required to furnish the opportunity for the
commissioner, authorized agent, or employee to investigate and examine such
books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns at a
reasonable time and place designated in the request.
   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer or other person that
is subject to Sections
183.22 to
183.37 of the Codified Ordinances shall be open to the tax commissioner's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the commissioner, in writing, consents to their destruction

pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under
Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle.  However,
if the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation
has established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give  the owner
or operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator may pay not
more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the motor vehicle.  That

subsection (d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is

without paying any fee.  However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if
applicable.  The owner of a motor vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
sheriff or chief of police, as applicable, to be necessary to a criminal
investigation;
         B.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger

specified, all of the following apply:
      (1)   “Distracted” means doing either of the following while operating a
vehicle:
         A.   Using a handheld electronic wireless communications device, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4511.204 except when utilizing any of the following:
            1.   The device’s speakerphone function;
            2.   A wireless technology standard for exchanging data over short

            4.   Any device that is physically or electronically integrated
into the motor vehicle.
         B.   Engaging in any activity that is not necessary to the operation
of a vehicle and impairs, or reasonably would be expected to impair, the
ability of the operator to drive the vehicle safely.
      (2)   “Distracted” does not include operating a motor vehicle while
wearing an earphone or earplug over or in both ears at the same time.  A person
who so wears earphones or earplugs may be charged with a violation of Section
331.43 .
      (3)   “Distracted” does not include conducting any activity while
operating a utility service vehicle or a vehicle for or on behalf of a utility,
provided that the driver of the vehicle is acting in response to an emergency,
power outage or a circumstance affecting the health or safety of individuals.
As used in subsection (a)(3) of this section:
         A.   “Utility” means an entity specified in division (A), (C), (D),
(E) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 4905.03.
         B.   “Utility service vehicle” means a vehicle owned or operated by a

and, notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 2929.28, is subject to an additional fine of not
more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) as follows:
      (1)   Subject to Traffic Rule 13, if a law enforcement officer issues an
offender a ticket, citation or summons for a violation of any section of the
Traffic Code that indicates that the offender was distracted while committing
the violation and that the distracting activity was a contributing factor to
the commission of the violation, the offender may enter a written plea of
guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), the
offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety course, the
duration and contents of which shall be established by the Ohio Director of
Public Safety.  If the offender attends and successfully completes the course,
the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender successfully
completed the course.  The offender shall be required to pay the total amount
of the fine established for the violation, but shall not be required to pay the
additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender

violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may
impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may impose the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the violation

court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section.  If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course.  The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence.

313.01  OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer. 
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person.  Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place. 
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.  If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree.  If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.
   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the distracting
activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense, the
offender is subject to the additional fine established under Section
303.991 of the Traffic Code.
(ORC 4511.12)
313.02  THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section.  Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations.  When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction.  Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of
that proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing
or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways.  For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway
or portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical
terminus of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at
which vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or
yield to traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence
districts the Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway,
or portion thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected
residence district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. 
Where two or more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b)
intersect and no traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield
signs shall be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department
of Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop.  Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the
operator of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.  (ORC
4511.65)
313.03  TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device.  Such vehicular traffic, including

court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that

      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any

         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail

under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control

attending the program.  The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the

any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.

As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours.  If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days. 
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the

under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education  programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs.  The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars

addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the

assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to

(1)B.1. or 2. or (h)(1)C.1. or 2. of this section and if, within sixty days of

      (1)   A.   Twenty miles per hour in school zones during school recess and
while children are going to or leaving school during the opening or closing
hours, and when twenty miles per hour school speed limit signs are erected;
except, that on controlled-access highways and expressways, if the right-of-way
line fence has been erected without pedestrian opening, the speed shall be
governed by subsection (b)(4) hereof and on freeways, if the right-of-way line
fence has been erected without pedestrian opening, the speed shall be governed
by  subsection (b)(7) hereof.  The end of every school zone may be  marked by a

school zone boundaries defined by projecting school property lines, except when
those boundaries are extended as provided in subsections (b)(1)A. and C.
hereof.

have driven, and in charges made in reliance upon subsection (c) hereof also
the speed which subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or
established pursuant to this section declares is prima-facie lawful at the time
and place of such alleged violation, except that in affidavits where a person
is alleged to have driven at a greater speed than will permit the person to
bring the vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead the
affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven.
   (f)   When a speed in excess of both a prima-facie limitation and a
limitation in subsection (d) hereof is alleged, the defendant shall be charged
in a single affidavit, alleging a single act, with a violation indicated of
both subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or of a limit declared or
established pursuant to this section by the Director or local authorities, and
of the limitation in subsection (d) hereof.  If the court finds a violation of
subsection (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or established
pursuant to this section has occurred, it shall enter a judgment of conviction
under such subsection and dismiss the charge under subsection (d) hereof.  If
it finds no violation of subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof or a limit
declared or established pursuant to this section, it shall then consider
whether the evidence supports a conviction under subsection (d) hereof.

(a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C. 4507.03,
4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public road or
highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of

license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4506.
      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public road
or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507.  The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section.  The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor.  When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be

the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours.
The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor.  If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
   (e)   If the offender is sentenced under subsection (c)(2) hereof, if within
three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.

have more than one valid license at any time. 
(ORC 4507.02)
   (c)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever

offender to complete a term of community service imposed by the court may be
punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02
that may be filed in the underlying case.  If, within three years of the

permit for a definite period of one year.
   (d)   The filing of a sworn complaint against a person for a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4511.205 does not preclude the filing of a sworn complaint for a
violation of a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same
conduct.  However, if a person is adjudicated a delinquent child or a juvenile
traffic offender for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.205 and is also adjudicated
a delinquent child or a juvenile traffic offender for a violation of a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same conduct, the two
offenses are allied offenses of similar import under Ohio R.C. 2941.25.

driver’s license, commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit,
probationary license or nonresident operating privilege from the range

license plates.  If issued, the order shall be issued and enforced under Ohio
R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4511.203 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the court may order the criminal forfeiture to

If title to a motor vehicle that is subject to an order for criminal forfeiture
under this subsection is assigned or transferred and division (B)(2) or (3) of
Ohio R.C. 4503.234 applies, in addition to or independent of any other penalty
established by law, the court may fine the offender the value of the vehicle as

The proceeds from any fine imposed under this subsection shall be distributed
in accordance with division (C)(2) of Ohio R.C. 4503.234.
   (d)   If a court orders the immobilization of a vehicle under subsection (c)
of this section, the court shall not release the vehicle from the

   (e)   If a court orders the criminal forfeiture of a vehicle under
subsection (c) of this section, upon receipt of the order from the court,
neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor any deputy registrar shall accept
any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any motor
vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the order.  The period of denial
shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the

in any collision in which the licensee may be involved.  When a demand is
properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license.  A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.

this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor.  When the offense is an

the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C.

suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section.  The
person charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may

of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in

jurisdiction over each parking infraction that occurs within the territory of

Parking Violations Bureau and the enforcement of each such parking infraction
shall be handled pursuant to and be governed by the provisions of this chapter.
   (b)    The operating costs of the Parking Violations Bureau shall be paid by
the City of Port Clinton. The Director of Safety and Service shall appoint the
Violations Clerk, necessary clerical employees and hearing examiners. No person
shall be employed as a hearing examiner unless such person is an attorney

judgments and default judgments entered pursuant to this chapter. All contracts
entered into by the Director of Safety and Service shall be authorized by City
Council. (Ord. 28-13.  Passed 8-13-13.)
352.04  PARKING TICKET, SERVICE, AND LIABILITY.
   (a)    The parking ticket adopted in Section
352.10 hereof shall be used by law enforcement officers in all cases in which a
person is charged with committing a parking infraction within the City of Port
Clinton. The parking ticket shall be the summons and complaint for purposes of
this chapter.
   (b)    A law enforcement officer who issues a parking ticket for a parking
infraction shall complete the ticket by identifying the parking infraction
charged, recording the license plate number, type, and make or model of the
vehicle, and indicating the date, time, and place of the parking infraction
charged. The officer shall sign the ticket and affirm the facts it contains and
file a copy with the Violations Clerk. If the operator of the vehicle is
present, the officer also shall record on the ticket the name of the operator
in a space provided on the ticket for identification of the offender, and then
shall personally serve the parking ticket upon the operator. If the operator of
the vehicle is not present, the officer shall insert the word "owner" in the
space provided on the ticket for identification of the offender, and then shall
constructively serve the parking ticket upon the owner of the vehicle by
affixing the ticket to the vehicle in a conspicuous place.  Constructive
service of a parking ticket upon an owner of a vehicle by affixation as
provided in this Division, or by the procedure described in subsection (d)
hereof, has the same force and effect, and potentially subjects both the owner
and the operator of the vehicle whose act or omission resulted in the parking
infraction, if different, to the same fine, penalties, fees, and costs for
failure to timely answer or to appear, if a hearing is requested, as if the
parking ticket were personally served on both the owner and operator of the
vehicle at the time of the violation.
   (c)    The original of a parking ticket issued pursuant to this Section or
any true copy of it shall be considered a record kept in the ordinary course of
business of the City of Port Clinton and of the law enforcement agency whose
officer issued it, and shall be prima-facie evidence of the facts it contains.
   (d)    An operator of a vehicle, who is not the owner of the vehicle, but
who operates it with the express or implied permission of the owner, is the
agent of the owner for purposes of the receipt of parking tickets served in
accordance with this Section, and personal service of a parking ticket upon the
operator in accordance with this Section constitutes constructive service upon
the owner for purposes of this chapter. The operator of a rented or leased
vehicle, whose act or omission resulted in an alleged parking infraction, shall
not be considered an agent of the owner if the owner is engaged in the business
of renting or leasing vehicles pursuant to a written rental or lease agreement
and if the owner follows the procedures set forth in Section
352.09 hereof.
   (e)    Except as provided in Section
352.09 hereof, when a parking ticket is issued for a parking infraction and is
served pursuant to this Section, the operator of the vehicle, whose act or
omission resulted in the parking infraction for which the ticket was issued,
and the owner of the vehicle involved in the parking infraction, if different,
are jointly liable for the parking infraction and any fine, penalty, fees, and
costs arising out of the parking infraction. Any owner of a vehicle, who pays
any fine, penalty, fees, and cost imposed for a parking infraction pursuant to
this chapter, may recover the amount paid from the operator of the vehicle,
whose act or omission resulted in the parking infraction. (Ord. 28-13.  Passed
8-13-13.)

explanation, may, when he makes his answer, pay the fine arising out of the
infraction admitted to the Violations Clerk of the Parking Violations Bureau.
      (2)    A.   A person, who admits that he committed a parking infraction
with explanation, shall submit evidence to the Parking Violations Bureau that
explains the circumstances surrounding the parking infraction. The evidence may
be submitted in person or, to avoid the necessity of personal appearance, may
be sent as affidavits and other documentary evidence, by mail. The Parking
Violations Bureau, when it receives an answer admitting that a person committed
a parking infraction with explanation, shall promptly determine whether the
explanation mitigates the fact that the person committed the parking infraction
and notify the person, in writing, of its determination.
         B.   If the Parking Violations Bureau determines that the explanation
mitigates the fact that the person committed the parking infraction, the
Parking Violations Bureau shall eliminate or reduce the amount of the fine
arising out of the parking infraction. If the fine is eliminated or reduced and
the person has previously paid the fine, the amount paid in excess of the
revised fine shall be returned to the person; if the fine is eliminated or
reduced and the person has not previously paid the fine, the person shall pay
only the amount of the revised fine. If the Parking Violations Bureau
determines that the explanation does not mitigate the fact that the person
committed the parking infraction, the person owes the entire amount of the fine
arising out of the parking infraction, and if the person has not previously
paid the fine, the person shall pay the entire amount of the fine. If a person
admits that he committed a parking infraction with explanation and the person
fails to pay the amount of the fine due within ten (10) days after receiving
notice of the Parking Violations Bureau's determination, unless the amount due
has previously been paid, the Parking Violations Bureau's determination and the
amount of the fine due shall be considered a judgment and shall be treated as
if it were a judgment rendered subsequent to a hearing held pursuant to Section
 352.07(b) hereof.
      (3)    A person, who denies that he committed a parking infraction, shall
be granted a hearing concerning the infraction. The Parking Violations Bureau
shall set a date for the hearing and notify the person, in writing, of the
date, time, and place of the hearing. The hearing shall be conducted by a
hearing examiner of the Parking Violations Bureau in accordance with Section
352.07 hereof.
   (c)    If a person, who is personally or constructively served with a
parking ticket charging the commission of a parking infraction, fails to timely
answer the charge, as provided in subsection (a) hereof, the Parking Violations
Bureau shall issue the proper notifications of infraction pursuant to Section
352.06 hereof, and proceed according to that Section. Failure to answer the
charge within the ten (10) day period provided by subsection (a) hereof, shall
result in the imposition of an additional penalty of fifteen dollars ($15.00).
   (d)    The issuance of a parking ticket, the filing of or failure to file an
answer by a person personally or constructively served with the ticket, the
substance of an answer, the payment of any fine, penalty, fee, and cost, and
any other relevant information shall be entered in the records of the Parking
Violations Bureau.

such infraction also shall be paid. The answer shall be governed by the
provisions of Section
352.05(b) hereof for answers relative to parking infractions charged in a
parking ticket, except that any determination of the amount to be paid under an
answer admitting the commission of the parking infraction with explanation also

   (d)    If a person who is issued a notification of infraction pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 4521.07, and subsection (c) hereof, fails to timely answer, the

(Ord. 28-13.  Passed 8-13-13.)
352.07  HEARING PROCEDURE.
   (a)    (1)   If a person who is personally or constructively served with a
parking ticket charging the commission of a parking infraction or who receives
a notification of infraction, in his answer to the charge denies that he
committed the infraction, the Parking Violations Bureau shall conduct a hearing
to determine if the person committed the parking infraction. Each hearing shall
be conducted by a hearing examiner of the Parking Violations Bureau. Each
hearing shall be conducted in such manner as the hearing examiner considers
appropriate. Rules regarding the admissibility of evidence shall not be
strictly applied in the hearing, but all testimony shall be under oath.
      (2)   At the hearing, the City of Port Clinton has the burden of proving,
by a preponderance of the evidence, that the person for whom the hearing is
being conducted committed the parking infraction. If the person, in his answer,
denied that he committed the parking infraction and requested the presence at
the hearing of the law enforcement officer who issued the parking ticket, the
officer shall be required to attend the hearing unless the hearing examiner
determines that the officer's presence is not required. If the officer's
presence at the hearing has been requested and the officer is unable to attend
the hearing on the day and at the time scheduled, the hearing examiner may
grant a reasonable continuance. The person for whom the hearing is being
conducted may present any relevant evidence and testimony at the hearing. The
person does not have to attend the hearing if he submits documentary evidence
to the hearing examiner prior to the day of the hearing.
      (3)   The City of Port Clinton shall submit the original parking ticket
that was personally or constructively served on the person or a true copy of
that ticket, and information from the Bureau of Motor Vehicles that identifies
the owner of the vehicle. The ticket and the information in proper form is
prima-facie evidence that the registered owner of the vehicle was the person
who committed the parking infraction. The City of Port Clinton may present
additional evidence and testimony at the hearing. The City of Port Clinton does
not have to be represented at the hearing by an attorney.
   (b)   (1)    If a person for whom a hearing is to be conducted under
subsection (a) hereof appears at the scheduled hearing or submits evidence in
accordance with that subsection, the hearing examiner shall consider all
evidence and testimony presented and shall determine whether the City of Port
Clinton has established, by a preponderance of evidence, that the person
committed the parking infraction. If the hearing examiner determines that the
person committed the infraction, an order indicating the determination as a
judgment against the person and requiring the person to pay the appropriate
fine and any additional penalties, fees, and costs shall be entered in the
records of the Parking Violations Bureau.
      (2)    If a person for whom a hearing is to be conducted under subsection
(a) hereof fails to appear at the scheduled hearing and fails to submit
evidence in accordance with that Division, the hearing examiner shall, if he
determines from any evidence and testimony presented at the hearing, by a
preponderance of the evidence that the person committed the parking infraction,
enter a default judgment against the person and require the person to pay the
appropriate fine and any additional penalties, fees, and costs. A default
judgment entered under this Division shall be entered in the records of the
Parking Violations Bureau.
      (3)    If a person, who is sent a notification of infraction pursuant to
Section
352.06 hereof, does not timely answer, as provided in subsection (c) of that
Section, the hearing examiner of the Parking Violations Bureau shall, if he
determines from any evidence and testimony presented to him by the local
authority, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the person committed the
parking infraction, enter a default judgment against the person and require the
person to pay the appropriate fine and any additional penalties, fees, and
costs. A default judgment entered under this division shall be entered in the
records of the Parking Violations Bureau.
      (4)    If the hearing examiner does not determine, by a preponderance of
the evidence, that a person in any of the classes described in subsection (b)
(1), (2), or (3) of this Section committed the parking infraction, the hearing
examiner shall enter judgment against the City of Port Clinton, shall dismiss
the charge of the parking infraction against the person, and shall enter the
judgment and dismissal in the records of the Parking Violations Bureau.
      (5)    A default judgment entered under this Section may be vacated by
the hearing examiner who entered it if all of the following apply:
         A.    The person against whom the default judgment was entered files a
motion with the Parking Violations Bureau within one (1) year of the date of
entry of the judgment;
         B.    The motion sets forth a sufficient defense to the parking
infraction out of which the judgment arose;
         C.    The motion sets forth excusable neglect as to the person's
failure to attend the hearing or answer the notification of infraction.
   (c)    Payment of any judgment or default judgment entered against a person
pursuant to this Section shall be made to the Violations Clerk of the Parking
Violations Bureau in which the judgment was entered within ten (10) days of the
date of entry. All money paid in satisfaction of a judgment of default judgment
shall be disbursed by the Violations Clerk to the City of Port Clinton and the
Violations Clerk shall enter the fact of payment of the money and its
disbursement in the records of the Parking Violations Bureau. If payment is not
made within this time period, the judgment or default judgment may be filed
with the office of the Clerk of Court, Civil Division, and when so filed, shall
have the same force and effect as a money judgment in a civil action rendered
in the Court.
   As required by Division (C) of Ohio R.C. 4521.08, judgments and default
judgments filed with the Ottawa County Municipal Court, office of the Clerk of
Court, Civil Division, shall be maintained in a separate index and judgment
roll from other judgments rendered in that Court. Computer printouts,
microfilm, microdot, microfiche, or other similar data recording techniques may
be utilized to record such judgments. When a judgment or default judgment is
filed with the Court, execution may be levied, and such other measures may be
taken for its collection as are authorized for the collection of an unpaid
money judgment in a civil action rendered in that Court. The Municipal Court
may assess additional costs against the judgment debtor, in an amount not
exceeding ten dollars ($10.00) for each parking infraction, to be paid upon
satisfaction of the judgment.
   (d)    (1)   Any person against whom a judgment or default judgment is
entered pursuant to this Section and the City of Port Clinton if judgment is
entered against the City pursuant to this Section may appeal the judgment or
default judgment to the Ottawa County Municipal Court by filing notices of
appeal with the Parking Violations Bureau and the Municipal Court within
fifteen (15) days of the date of entry of the judgment and by the payment of
such reasonable costs as the Court requires. Upon the filing of an appeal, the
Court shall schedule a hearing date and notify the parties of the date, time,
and place of the hearing. The hearing shall be held by the Court in accordance
with the rules of the Court. Service of a notice of appeal under this
subsection by a person does not stay enforcement and collection of the judgment
or default judgment from which appeal is taken by the person unless the person
who files the appeal posts bond with the Parking Violations Bureau in the
amount of the judgment, plus court costs, at or before service of the notice of
appeal.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the judgment on appeal
of the Municipal Court is final, and no other appeal of the judgment of the
Parking Violations Bureau and no appeal of the judgment of the Municipal Court
may be taken.
   (e)    A judgment or default judgment entered pursuant to this Section may
be filed with the Municipal Court, office of the Clerk of Court, Civil
Division, under subsection (c) hereof at any time within three (3) years after
the date of issuance of the parking ticket charging the parking infraction out
of which the judgment arose. This Division applies to any ticket issued for an
offense that would be a parking infraction on or after the effective date of
this Section, if the ticket was issued within three (3) years prior to the
effective date of this section and a warrant has not been issued and served on
the operator or owner of the vehicle involved in that offense.

Sections
352.05 or
352.06 hereof, the answer denies that he committed the infraction and requests
a hearing concerning the infraction, the owner additionally asserts and
provides reasonable evidence at that time to prove that the vehicle, at the
time of the commission of the parking infraction, was being used by the
operator without the owner's express or implied consent, and the Parking
Violations Bureau determines that the vehicle was being used without the
owner's express or implied consent at that time. If the Parking Violations
Bureau does not so determine, it shall conduct the hearing concerning the
infraction according to Section
352.07 hereof.
      (2)    The owner answers the charge of the parking infraction under
Sections
352.05 or

or proves the facts described in subsection (a)(2) of this Section.
   (b)    An owner of a vehicle who is engaged in the business of renting or
leasing vehicles under written rental or lease agreements, but who does not
satisfy the additional requirements of subsection (a)(2) of this Section is not
liable for any penalties or processing fees arising out of a parking infraction
involving the vehicle if at the time of the commission of the parking
infraction, the vehicle was in the care, custody, or control of a person other
than the owner pursuant to a written rental or lease agreement, and if the
owner answers the charge of the parking infraction by denying that he committed
the parking infraction or by paying the fine arising out of the parking
infraction within thirty (30) days after actual receipt of the parking ticket
charging the infraction or, if the owner did not receive the parking ticket,
within thirty (30) days after receipt of the notification of infraction.
   Proof that the vehicle was in the care, custody, or control of a person

time of the alleged parking infraction shall be established by sending a true
copy of the rental or lease agreement or an affidavit to that effect to the
Parking Violations Bureau within thirty (30) days after the date of receipt by
the owner of the parking ticket charging the infraction or, if the owner did
not receive the parking ticket, within thirty (30) days after receipt of the

2-18 of the Ohio Administrative Code, any vessel overtaking any other shall
keep out of the way of the vessel being overtaken.
   (b)    A vessel shall be deemed to be overtaking when coming up with another
vessel from a direction more than twenty-two and one half degrees abaft its
beam; that is, in such a position with reference to the vessel it is
overtaking, that at night it would be able to only see the sternlight of that
vessel but neither of its sidelights.
   (c)    When a vessel is in any doubt as to whether it is overtaking another,
it shall assume that this is the case and act accordingly.
   (d)    Any subsequent alteration of the bearing between the two vessels
shall not make the overtaking vessel a crossing vessel within the meaning of
these rules or relieve it of the duty of keeping clear of the overtaken vessel
until it is finally past and clear.
   No person shall operate or permit to be operated, any vessel in violation of
this rule.
(OAC 1501:47-2-13)
383.36  HEAD-ON SITUATION.
   (a)    Unless  otherwise  agreed, when two power-driven vessels are meeting
on reciprocal or nearly reciprocal courses so as to involve risk of collision
each shall alter its course to starboard so that each shall pass on the port
side of the other.
   (b)    Such a situation shall be deemed to exist when a vessel sees the
other ahead or nearly ahead and by night it could see the masthead lights of
the other in a line or nearly in a line or both sidelights and by day it
observes the corresponding aspect of the other vessel.
   (c)    When a vessel is in any doubt as to whether such a situation exists
it shall assume that  it does exist and act accordingly.
   (d)    Notwithstanding subsection (a) hereof, a power-driven vessel
operating on Lake Erie and its tributaries, and proceeding downbound with a
following current shall have the right-of-way over an upbound vessel, shall
propose the manner of passage, and shall initiate the maneuvering signals
prescribed by paragraph (A)(1) of rule 1501:47-2-34 of the Ohio Administrative
Code, as appropriate.

this rule.
(OAC 1501:47-2-14)
383.37  CROSSING SITUATION.
   (a)    When two power-driven vessels are crossing so as to involve risk of

of the way and shall, if the  circumstances of the case admit, avoid crossing
ahead of the other vessel.

383.39  ACTION BY STAND-ON VESSEL.
   (a)   (1)    Where one of two vessels is to keep out of the way, the other
shall keep its course and speed.
      (2)    The latter vessel may, however, take action to avoid collision by
its maneuver alone, as soon as it becomes apparent to it that the vessel
required to keep out of the way is not taking appropriate action in compliance
with this chapter.
   (b)    When, from any cause, the vessel required to keep its course and
speed finds itself so close that collision cannot be avoided by the action of
the give-way vessel alone, it shall take such action as will best aid to avoid
collision.
   (c)    A power-driven vessel which takes action in a crossing situation in
accordance with subsection (a) (2) hereof to avoid collision with another
power-driven vessel shall, if the circumstances of the case admit, not alter
course to port for a vessel on its own port side.
   (d)    This rule does not relieve the give-way vessel of its obligation to
keep out of the way.
   No person shall operate or permit to be operated, any vessel in violation of
this rule.

(2)    A vessel restricted in its ability to maneuver.
   (d)    A seaplane on the water shall, in general, keep well clear of all

1501:47-2-10 of the Ohio Administrative Code.
   (d)    A vessel which detects by radar alone the presence of another vessel
shall determine if a close-quarters situation is developing or risk of
collision exists. If so, it shall take avoiding action in ample time, provided
that when such action consists of an alteration of course, so far as possible
the following shall be avoided: an alteration of course to port for a vessel
forward of the beam, other than for a vessel being overtaken and an alteration
of course toward a vessel abeam or abaft the beam.
(e)    Except where it has been determined that a risk of collision does not
exist, every vessel which hears apparently forward of its beam the fog signal
of another vessel, or which cannot avoid a close-quarters situation with
another vessel forward of its beam, shall reduce its speed to the minimum at
which it can be kept on course. It shall if necessary take all its way off and,
in any event, navigate with extreme caution until danger of collision is over.
   No person shall operate or permit to be operated, any vessel in violation of
this rule.

      (7)   The person, by means of a computer, computer system, computer
network, telecommunication, telecommunications device, telecommunications
service, or information service, causes or knowingly permits any writing, data,
image, or other telecommunication to be disseminated or transmitted into this
Municipality in violation of the law of this Municipality.
   (b)   This Municipality includes the land and water within its boundaries
and the air space above such land and water, and real property outside the
corporate limits, with respect to which this Municipality has either exclusive
or concurrent legislative jurisdiction.  Where the boundary between this
Municipality and another jurisdiction is disputed, the disputed territory is
conclusively presumed to be within this Municipality for purposes of this
section.
   (c)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this Municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this Municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this Municipality.
   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (f)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this Municipality.
   (g)   For purposes of subsection (a)(2) of this section, an overt act is
substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the part of
the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (h)   As used in this section, “computer”, “computer system”, “computer
network”, “information service”, “telecommunication”, “telecommunications
device”, “telecommunications service”, “data”, and “writing” have the same
meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2913.01. (ORC 2901.11)
501.06  LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be
barred unless it is commenced within the following periods after an offense is
committed:
      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for an offense of which an element is
fraud or breach of a fiduciary duty, within one year after discovery of the
offense either by an aggrieved person, or by his legal representative who is
not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a  public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs.  In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first.  A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same.  A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution.  Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin
to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred.  (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07  REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense.  Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense.  Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug. 
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08  CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature.  A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. 
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature.  A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature.  A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element.  When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element.  When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.  (ORC 2901.22)
501.09  ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense.  An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt.  An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted.  In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor.  An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section. 
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.  (ORC 2923.02)
501.10  COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
         "The testimony of an accomplice does not become
      inadmissible because of his complicity, moral turpitude
      or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity
      of a witness may affect his credibility and make his
      testimony subject to grave suspicion, and require that
      it be weighed with great caution.
"It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender.  A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11  ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission.  This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity.  "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.  (ORC 2901.23)
501.12  PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf.  (ORC
2901.24)
501.13  CONSPIRACY.
   (a)   No person, with purpose to commit or to promote or facilitate the
commission of aggravated murder, murder, kidnapping, abduction, compelling
prostitution, promoting prostitution, trafficking in persons, aggravated arson,
arson, aggravated robbery, robbery, aggravated burglary, burglary, engaging in
a pattern of corrupt activity, corrupting another with drugs, a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, theft of drugs,
or illegal processing of drug documents, the commission of a felony offense of
unauthorized use of a vehicle, illegally transmitting multiple commercial
electronic mail messages or unauthorized access of a computer in violation of
Ohio R.C. 2923.421 or the commission of a violation of any provision of Ohio
R.C. Chapter 3734, other than Ohio R.C. 3734.18, that relates to hazardous
wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy.  For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators.  In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section.  In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.
   (m)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession
offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;
         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.
      (2)   “Minor drug possession offense” has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 2925.01.  (ORC 2923.01)
501.99  PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions.  In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section.  If the court in its
discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to,
the following:
      (1)   Restitution.  Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor
or could be disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court
under Traffic Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the
offender’s crime or any survivor of the victim, in an amount based on the
victim’s economic loss.  The court may not impose restitution as a sanction
pursuant to this section if the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13.  If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
   If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine the amount of
restitution to be paid by the offender.  If the court imposes restitution, the
court may base the amount of restitution it orders on an amount recommended by
the victim, the offender, a presentence investigation report, estimates or
receipts indicating the cost of repairing or replacing property, and other
information, provided that the amount the court orders as restitution shall not
exceed the amount of the economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and
proximate result of the commission of the offense.  If the court decides to
impose restitution, the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution
if the offender, victim or survivor disputes the amount of restitution.  If the
court holds an evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the victim or survivor has
the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the amount of
restitution sought from the offender.
All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery of economic
loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any survivor of the victim
against the offender.  No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the offender pay a
surcharge, of not more than five per cent of the amount of the restitution
otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and processing
restitution payments.
The victim or survivor may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered.  If the court grants the motion, it may
modify the payment terms as it determines appropriate.
      (2)   Fines.  A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.

above, a written notice to the registered owner of any motor vehicle which is
in violation of this section, or to the owner or person in lawful possession or
control of the property on which the equipment or motor vehicle is located,

days that the inoperable equipment or motor vehicle continues to be so left
constitutes a separate offense, provided that a separate notice under
subsection (c) hereof has been issued for each offense.
   (d)   Whoever violates any provision of this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the fourth degree on a first offense. If the offender previously

   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   "Sexual conduct" means vaginal intercourse between a male and female;
anal intercourse, fellatio and cunnilingus between persons regardless of sex;
and, without privilege to do so, the insertion, however slight, of any part of

opening of another.  Penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete
vaginal or anal intercourse.
   (b)   "Sexual contact" means any touching of an erogenous zone of another,

   (d)   "Prostitute" means a male or female who promiscuously engages in
sexual activity for hire, regardless of whether the hire is paid to the
prostitute or to another.
   (e)   “Harmful to juveniles” means that quality of any material or
performance describing or representing nudity, sexual conduct, sexual
excitement, or sado- masochistic abuse in any form to which all of the
following apply:
      (1)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, appeals to
the prurient interest of juveniles in sex.
      (2)   The material or performance is patently offensive to prevailing
standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable
for juveniles.
      (3)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, lacks
serious literary, artistic, political and scientific value for juveniles.
   (f)   When considered as a whole, and judged with reference to ordinary
adults, or, if it is designed for sexual deviates or other specially
susceptible group, judged with reference to such group, any material or
performance is "obscene" if any of the following apply:
      (1)   Its dominant appeal is to prurient interest;
      (2)   Its dominant tendency is to arouse lust by displaying or depicting

      (3)   Its dominant tendency is to arouse lust by displaying or depicting
bestiality or extreme or bizarre violence, cruelty or brutality;
      (4)   Its dominant tendency is to appeal to scatological interest by
displaying or depicting human bodily functions of elimination in a way which

serving any genuine scientific, educational, sociological, moral or artistic
purpose;
      (5)   It contains a series of displays or descriptions of sexual
activity, masturbation, sexual excitement, nudity, bestiality, extreme or
bizarre violence, cruelty or brutality, or human bodily functions of
elimination, the cumulative effect of which is a dominant tendency to appeal to

primarily for its own sake or for commercial exploitation, rather than
primarily for a genuine scientific, educational, sociological, moral or
artistic purpose.

genitals when in a state of sexual stimulation or arousal.

541.01  DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).
   (c)    Prima-facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Section
545.02(d) may be used to establish the value of property pursuant to this
section.  (ORC 2909.11)
541.02  ARSON.
   (a)   No person, by means of fire or explosion, shall knowingly cause or
create a substantial risk of physical harm to any property of another without
the other person’s consent.
   (b)   (1)   No person, by means of fire or explosion, shall knowingly cause
or create a substantial risk of physical harm to any structure of another that
is not an occupied structure;
      (2)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under subsection (b)(1) of
this section that the defendant acted with the consent of the other person.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of arson, a misdemeanor of the
first degree.  If the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, arson is a felony and shall
be prosecuted under appropriate State law. 
(ORC 2909.03)
541.03  CRIMINAL DAMAGING OR ENDANGERING.
   (a)   No person shall cause, or create a substantial risk of physical harm

      (2)   Recklessly, by means of fire, explosion, flood, poison gas, poison,
radioactive material, caustic or corrosive material, or other inherently
dangerous agency or substance.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of criminal damaging or
endangering, a misdemeanor of the second degree.  If violation of this section
creates a risk of physical harm to any person, criminal damaging or endangering
is a misdemeanor of the first degree.  If the property involved in a violation
is an aircraft, an aircraft engine, propeller, appliance, spare part, or any
other equipment or implement used or intended to be used in the operation of an

545.02  DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06, or
545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense.  When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense.  The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,

545.05 or

service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense.  If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.

span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section.  While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services.  As used in this section, "fair
market value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting ina
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.  (ORC 2913.61)

EQUIVALENCY FACTORS
   The following equivalency factors are based upon the Ohio Environmental
Protection Agency guide and are computed on the basis of the probable demand a
user places on the public water system. The probable flow rate demand is
correlated to the demand expected by a single family dwelling by the use of
equivalency factors shown below. The minimum equivalency factor that shall be
met is one(1) when computing fees and charges (unless [1] E.D.U. already exists
on the property). Equivalency factors for types of users not listed must be
determined by the Safety- Service Director on an individual basis.

   For any use not shown herein, the equivalency factor shall be determined by
the Safety Service Director on the basis of accepted engineering practice on
the basis of anticipated flow from applicant when compared to a single-family
residence where the flow of 400 gallons per residence per day will be
considered as a unit of one.
   The connection charge( tap-in fee) shall be calculated in accordance with
this schedule by multiplying the base rate of $105.00 times the equivalency
factor times the number of units to equal the total tap in charge.
   (d)   For the purposes of providing revenue to help finance and to more
equitably distribute the cost of construction of necessary additions to both
the sewer system and the sewage treatment facilities, it is hereby determined
and declared necessary to provide for the establishment, exaction, and
regulation of a sanitary sewer-capacity charge as hereinafter determined with
such charge to be in addition to any and all other fees which may be imposed
with respect to the City sewer system.
   The funds received from the collection of such charge, as it is herein
authorized, shall be deposited with the City Treasurer who shall credit them to
a fund from which the Council of the city may take appropriations for the
payment of the cost and expense of the construction, operation, maintenance,
management and repair of the sanitary sewerage systems, storm sewer systems,
pumping stations and sewerage treatment works and for the payment of the cost
and expense of replacement, extensions to or the enlargement of the same and
for the payment of the principal and interest on any debt incurred for the
construction of such sewerage system, storm sewer system, pumping stations, and
sewerage treatment works and for the creation of a sinking fund for the payment
of such debt.
   The Director of Safety and Service shall be and is hereby authorized and
directed to exact a sanitary system-capacity charge whenever: (1) Application
is made for the issuance of a sewer permit to provide sanitary sewer service to
a new structure; (2) At the time an existing structure is enlarged or its use
changes; and (3) When an existing structure is removed and a new structure
built and reuse is made of an existing sanitary sewer service or new sanitary
sewer service is constructed, wherever such property is or will be tributary,
directly or indirectly, to any sanitary sewer built or maintained by the City,
either inside or outside the corporate limits of said City.
   The system capacity charge is established as $205.00 per benefitted unit
(EDU). The capacity charge shall be calculated in accordance with the schedule
set forth in paragraph C of this
Section, by multiplying the capacity charge of $205.00 times the equivalency
factor times the number of units (ED Us) to equal the total capacity charge to
be paid.
   (e)   System Capacity Charges and charges for connections (tap-ins) made to
the City wastewater treatment system for properties outside the boundaries of
the City and not subject to any separate governmental agreements shall be one
hundred fifty percent (150%) of the applicable charge for a connection made
within the City.
   (f)   The Director of Safety and Service shall collect the connection charge
(tap-in fee) and system capacity charge for all applications submitted for
connection(s) to the City sanitary sewer system.
   (g)   The permits and charges provided for in this Chapter shall not be
deemed to preclude the subsequent levy of special assessments against
benefitted properties to provide funds for the construction, replacement,
rehabilitation or other improvement of sanitary sewers required to provide
sewer service to such properties, and the permits and charges provided for
herein shall be in addition to any other petmits and charges required by law
and any other Ordinances or regulations of the City.
   (h)   In the event that the Safety-Service Director shall ascertain that any
lot or land or building or other structure has been connected directly or
indirectly to the City Wastewater Treatment System in violation of any of the
provisions of this Chapter, and the owner, agent, lessee, tenant or occupant of
such lot or land fails or refuses to disconnect the same upon being directed to
do so by the Safety Service Director, the Director is hereby authorized to
cause such lot or land to be disconnected from the system, until such violation
shall cease. The City shall be reimbursed by the violator for expenses incurred
by the City in making such disconnection.
   (i)   Whoever violates any provision of this section shall upon conviction
be fined as provided in Section
911.99.
   (j)   All charges collected pursuant to the provisions of this section shall
be deposited in the Sewer Revenue Fund created pursuant to Section
915.03.
(Ord. 14-15.  Passed 7-14-15.)
911.04  LICENSED WORKER.
   No house sewer shall be constructed and no connection shall be made to a
public sewer by any person who has not been authorized and licensed  to do the
work.
(Ord. 307.  Passed 11-24-42.)
911.05  REGULATIONS FOR USE.
   The written permission to construct a house sewer or to make a connection to
a public sewer shall specify the permissible use of such house sewer and
connection, and such specifications shall be governed by the following
requirements:  sewage, including wastes from water closets, urinals,
lavatories, sinks, bathtubs, showers, laundries, cellar floor drains, garage

entitled to protection as trade secrets or proprietary information of the user.
         D.   When requested by a user furnishing a report, the portions of a
report which may disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made
available for inspection by the public but shall be made available upon written
request to governmental agencies for uses related to this chapter, the national
pollutant discharge elimination system (NPDES) permit, state disposal system
permit and/or the pretreatment programs; provided, however, that such portions
of a report shall be available for use by the State or any state agency in
judicial review or enforcement proceedings involving the user furnishing the
report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics will not be recognized as
confidential information.
         E.   Information accepted by the City as confidential, shall not be
transmitted to any governmental agency by the City until and unless a ten day

913.11  INFILTRATION AND INFLOW (I/I).
   (a)   Purpose. The City operates and maintains sanitary sewer systems within
the City and by agreement outside of the City. The City operates these systems
pursuant to Ohio E.P.A. regulations and the conditions and regulations
established in the City's NPDES permits. Excessive infiltration and storm water
inflow into these sanitary sewer systems may result in system overflows and
bypasses and excessive loadings on treatment facilities in violation of Ohio
E.P.A. regulations and NPDES permit conditions. Additionally, these conditions
pose potential public health and safety concerns and impose unnecessary and
avoidable system costs.
   The City has determined that its sanitary sewer systems may be impacted by
excessive infiltration and storm water inflow attributable to private property
sewer facilities. The purpose of these rules is to allow for the identification
and remediation of excessive infiltration and storm water inflows attributable
to private sewer facilities and to establish a policy of enforcement.
   (b)   Definitions. The following definitions apply for purposes of these
rules and regulations.
      (1)   Average Metered Water - This is the water meter readings for a
period of usage (i.e.: a typical usage month divided by the number of days in
the monthly billing period), or yearly readings divided by 365 days, or water
reading averaged for a sanitary flow monitoring period to be determined by the
Sanitary Engineer.
      (2)   Average Daily Metered Water Usage Rate - This is the Average Daily
Metered Water Usage divided by 1440 minutes to calculate a gallon per minute
rate of flow.
      (3)   Dry Average Flow - The dry average flow is the amount of water in
the collection system on an average dry day expressed in gallons per day. This
flow can be measured with portable flow meters or estimated using population
equivalents or EDU's for the collection subsystem area.
      (4)   Establishment - Any residence, condominium, homeowner's
association, commercial development, industrial development, or institutional
development, which has a private sanitary sewer connection to the public
sanitary sewer.
      (5)   Infiltration - Water other than wastewater that enters a sewer
system (including sewer service connections and foundation drains) from the
ground through such means as defective pipes, pipe joints, connections or
manholes. Infiltration does not include, and is distinguished from, inflow.
      (6)   Inflow - Water other than wastewater that enters a sewer system
(including sewer service connections and foundation drains) from sources such
as, but not limited to, roof leaders, cellar drains, yard drains, area drains,
foundation drains, field tile, drains from springs and swampy areas, manhole
covers, cross connections between storm sewers and sanitary sewers, catch
basins, cooling towers, storm waters, surface run-off, street wash water, or
drainage. Inflow does not include, and is distinguished from, infiltration.
      (7)   Metered Average Dry Weather Sanitary Flow - This is the Average
Daily Metered Flow (in gallons) during a metering period which occurs on non-
storm impacted days.
      (8)   Metered Average Dry Weather Sanitary Flow Rate - This is the
Metered Average Dry Weather Sanitary Flow (in gallons) divided by 1440 minutes
in order to calculate a gallon per minute rate of flow.
      (9)   National Average Daily Dry Weather Flow Rate Per EDU - This is the
National Average Daily Dry Weather Flow divided by 1440 minutes to calculate a
gallon per minute rate of flow.
      (10)   Ohio EPA/U.S. EPA Theoretical Average Dry Weather Sanitary Flow -
This is the Theoretical Daily Design Flow per equivalent dwelling unit (EDU)
based on domestic usage of 80 gallons per capita day (gpcd) and four (4) people
per EDU or 320 gallons per day (gpd)/EDU for a residential unit.  All other
classes are converted to EDU's by dividing their Daily Ohio EPA Theoretical
Design Flow by 400 gpd, and then multiplying by 320 gpd/EDU to obtain their
Theoretical Average Dry Weather Sanitary Flow in gallons per day.
      (11)   Ohio EPA/U.S. EPA Theoretical Average Dry Weather Sanitary Flow
Rate - This is the Ohio EPA/U.S. EPA Theoretical Average Dry Weather Sanitary
Flow divided by 1440 minutes to calculate a gallon per minute rate of flow.
      (12)   Safety-Service Director - The City of Port Clinton Safety-Service
Director.
      (13)   Sanitary Sewers - A conduit intended to carry liquid and water-
carried waste from residences, commercial buildings, industrial plants, and
institutions together with non-excessive quantities of ground, storm, and
surface waters.
      (14)   Sanitary Sewer User - A person, firm, or corporation owning,
leasing, or occupying real property within the jurisdiction of the City sewer
system, which property is served by a connection to sanitary sewers maintained
or operated by the City. The real property served may be residential,
commercial, governmental, or industrial.
      (15)   Wet Maximum Flow- (Metered) - The amount of water flowing from the
collection system during wet weather conditions with saturated soils averaged
over on 24-hour period measured in gallons per day. This flow rate shall be
measured with portable flow meters.
      (16)   Wet Peak Flow - (Metered)- The peak incremental flow observed
flowing from the collection system during wet weather conditions with saturated
soil measured in gallons per minute. This could be in increments of 15 minutes,
but no more than hourly. This flow rate shall be measured with portable flow
meters.
      (17)   Calculated Wet Maximum Flow - This calculated value is based on
the theoretical dry average flow value per EDU plus an appropriate I/
I allowance multiplied by the calculated number of ED Us. The value used for
this policy is 960 gpd per EDU. This value is compared to the wet maximum flow
observed over a 24-hour period for one (I) EDU. Calculations for this value can
be found in Table "A" of this section.
      (18)   Calculated Wet Peak Flow - This calculated value is based on the
theoretical dry average flow value per EDU plus an appropriate I/I allowance
multiplied by the calculated number of EDUs. The value used for this policy is
0.889 gpm per EDU. This value is compared to the wet peak flow observed over a
one hour period for one (I) EDU. Calculations for this value can be found in
Table "A" of this section.
   (c)   Duty of Property Owner to Maintain.  It is the duty of the owner of
real property served by a connection to sanitary sewers maintained or operated
by the City to construct, operate, and maintain all sanitary sewer facilities
located on or within the owner's real property in accordance with all
applicable state and local laws, statutes, rules and regulations including, but
not limited to, Ohio E.P.A. regulations and the City of Port Clinton Wastewater
Rules and Regulations and Codified Ordinances of the City.
   (d)   Prohibited Inflow.
      (1)   No person, including the property owner or sanitary sewer user,
shall connect storm water inflow to sanitary sewers maintained and operated by
the City, nor shall such person cause, permit, or allow inflow into such
sanitary sewers except by written permission of the Safety-Service Director.
      (2)   Whenever the Safety-Service Director determines that Section
913.11(d)(2) has been, or is being, violated, he shall issue a written order to
the property owner and/or sanitary sewer user to disconnect such unlawful
connection or otherwise remove or relocate the unlawful inflow in accordance
with applicable building or health codes or other state or local regulations.
      (3)   Any unlawful connection or inflow under this section constitutes a
nuisance subject to injunctive relief and abatement pursuant to Chapter 3767 of
the Ohio Revised Code or as otherwise permitted by law.
      (4)   Any person violating this section is subject to penalties provided
in Section
913.99 of the Port Clinton Codified Ordinances. Any person subject to written
order of the Safety-Service Director pursuant to Section
913.11 (D)(2) is entitled to appeal pursuant to Section 105.04 of the Port
Clinton Water Regulations and By-Laws.
      (5)   Upon continuing violation of this section or written order issued
pursuant to this section, the Safety-Service Director may restrict flow or
disconnect sewer service. Except in a case of emergency, disconnections shall
occur no earlier than thirty (30) days after service of written notice of
disconnection.
   (e)   Excessive Infiltration Defined. For purposes of these rules and
regulations, "excessive infiltration" is defined to be that infiltration which
violates two (2) or more of the following standards of acceptable practice:
      (1)   Where metered sanitary sewer flows or physical timed monitoring of
the same exceed three (3) times the water meter flows during the same general
monitoring period.
      (2)   Where wet maximum (metered) sanitary sewer flows or physical timed
monitoring of the same exceed three (3) times the water meter flows during the
same general monitoring period.
      (3)   Where the wet peak (metered) sanitary flow exceeds the metered
average dry weather sanitary flow rate or Average Monthly Metered Water Usage
Rate by four (4) times during any 15 minute or one hour daily incremental
period.
      (4)   Where direct visual observation by an authorized City
representative has determined a potential infiltration contribution source and
where such occurrence is documented in a dated observation report.
      (5)   Where the wet maximum flow measured exceeds the Ohio EPA/U.S. EPA
Theoretical Average Dry Weather (daily or monthly) Sanitary Flow by three (3)
times. Example- 3 X 320 gpd/E.D.U. in a 24 hour period.
      (6)   Where the peak flow measured exceeds the Ohio EPA/U.S. EPA
Theoretical Average Dry Weather (daily or monthly) Sanitary Flow Rate by four
(4) times for any incremental hourly period. Example- 4 X 320 gpd/E.D.U. in any
I hour period.
      (7)   Where dye testing, smoke testing, or internal video inspection
indicates potential infiltration contribution sources which could contribute to
excessive infiltration in the system.
      (8)   Where dry weather metered sanitary flows exceed metered water usage
by 2:1 during the metering period. This testing would be not related to an
actual rainfall event, but could be subsequent to an event.
   (f)   Excessive Infiltration and Enforcement of Remediation. Where real
property served by a connection to sanitary sewer maintained or operated by the
City is suspected by the Safety-Service Director of contributing excessive
infiltration and/or inflow to the City sanitary sewer system, the Safety-
Service Director shall determine and enforce remediation as follows:
      (1)   The Safety-Service Director, or his agent, may conduct an
inspection of the private collection system(s) located on the subject real
property. The inspection may include visual or video observation, smoke
testing, flow metering, or use of other means commonly accepted in the

INFILTRATION AND INFLOW
TABLE "A"
Calculation for Infiltration/Inflow:
Since Ohio EPA uses 400 gallons per day per equivalent dwelling unit (EDU) as a
design standard and Pott Clinton uses the Ohio EPA standard as a basis for
current billing, the SSES Policy was correlated with this standard while using
the U.S. EPA handbook Sewer System Infrastructure Analysis and Rehabilitation
and the American Society of Civil Engineers' Existing Sewer Evaluation and
Rehabilitation, WEF Manual of Practice FD-6, ASCE Manuals and Reports on
Engineering Practice No. 62, second edition, as additional resources.
   
The Ohio EPA Standard is based on 100 gallons per capita day (gpcd) usage and
four ( 4) people per family or 400 gpd/EDU. The Ohio EPA 100 gpcd standard
could be further allocated as 80 gpcd for domestic flow and 20 gpcd as
infiltration based on U.S. EPA criteria.
The ASCE' s Existing Sewer Evaluation and Rehabilitation, Existing Sewer
Evaluation and Rehabilitation, WEF Manual of Practice FD-6, ASCE Manuals and
Reports on Engineering Practice No. 62, second edition, states, "Even in a well
constructed, separated system, the ratio of wet maximum to dry average usually
ranges from 2 to 3 and wet peak to dry average from 3 to 4; higher values
indicated a more pronounced problem.
      A.    Ohio EPA EDU    =   400 gpd (based on 100 gpcd)
                  =   320 gpd (based on 80 gpcd domestic flow)
                  =   Wet Max= 3 x 320 = 960 gpd/EDU
                  =    Wet Peak= 4 x 320 = 1,280 gpd/EDU
Summary
I.    The highest wet maximum flow would be 960 gpd per EDU. Under no
circumstances will the acceptable wet maximum flow exceed this amount.
2.    The highest wet peak flow would be 1,280 gpd per EDU divided by 1440
minutes = 0.889 gpm. Under no circumstances will the acceptable wet peak flow
rate exceed this amount.
   The Director of Public Safety and Service or his authorized representative
shall be charged with the enforcement of these regulations, shall conduct such
surveys as may be necessary to detect any existing connection of roof drains to
sanitary sewers, and the Director or his authorized representative bearing
proper credentials shall be permitted to enter upon all properties for the
purpose of inspection, observation and testing in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 10-16.  Passed 4-26-16.)
913.12  REGULATION OF WASTEWATER RECEIVED FROM OTHER POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS/
SATELLITE COLLECTION SYSTEMS.
   (a)    If another political subdivision, or user located within another
political subdivision, contributes wastewater to the POTW, the Director shall
enter into an inter-jurisdictional agreement with the contributing political
subdivision.
   (b)    Prior to entering into an agreement required by subsection (a), the
Director shall request the following information from the contributing
political subdivision:
      (1)   A description of the quality and volume of wastewater discharged to
the POTW by the contributing political subdivision;
      (2)    An inventory of all users located within the contributing
political subdivision that are discharging to the sanitary sewer system; and
      (3)    Such other information as the Director may deem necessary.
   (c)    An inter-jurisdictional agreement as required by subsection (a) shall
contain the following conditions:
      (1)    A requirement that the contributing political subdivision adopt a
sewer use regulation which is at least as stringent as this Chapter and local
limits, including required baseline monitoring reports, that are at least as
stringent as those set out in Section
913.04 of this Chapter. The requirement shall specify that the political
subdivision's ordinance and limits shall be revised as necessary to reflect
changes made to this Chapter and local limits;
      (2)    A requirement for the contributing political subdivision to submit
a revised user inventory on at least an annual basis;
      (3)    A provision specifying which pretreatment implementation
activities, including individual wastewater discharge permit issuance,
inspection, sampling, and enforcement, will be conducted by the contributing
political subdivision; which of these activities will be conducted by the
Director; and which of these activities will be conducted jointly by the
contributing political subdivision and the Director;
      (4)   A requirement for the contributing political subdivision to provide
the Director with access to all information that the contributing political
subdivision obtains as part of its pretreatment activities;
      (5)    Limits on the nature, quality, and volume of the contributing
political subdivision's wastewater at the point where it discharges to the City
sewer system;
      (6)    Requirements for monitoring the contributing political
subdivision's discharge;
      (7)    A provision ensuring the Director access to the facilities of
users located within the contributing political subdivision's jurisdictional
boundaries for the purpose of inspection, sampling, and any other duties deemed
necessary by the Director; and
      (8)    A provision specifying remedies available for breach of the terms
of the inter-jurisdictional agreement.
         (Ord. 10-16.  Passed 4-26-16.)
913.99  PENALTY.
   (a)    Administrative Fine.  Notwithstanding any other section of this
chapter, any person or User who is found to have violated any provision of this
chapter, or permits and orders issued hereunder, shall be fined by the Safety-
Service Director in an amount not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000) per
violation. Each day on which noncompliance occurs or continues shall be deemed
a separate and distinct violation. Such assessments may be added to the
person's or User's next scheduled sewer service charge and the Safety-Service
Director shall have such other collection remedies as he has to collect other
service charges. Unpaid charges, fines and penalties shall constitute a lien
against the individual user's property. Any person or Industrial User desiring
to dispute such fines shall file a request for the Safety-Service Director to
reconsider the fine within ten days of being notified of the fine. Where the
Safety-Service Director believes a request has merit, he shall convene a
hearing on the matter within fifteen days of receiving the request from the
person or Industrial User.
   (b)    Injunctive Relief. Whenever any person or an Industrial User has
violated or continues to violate the provisions of this chapter or permit or
order issued hereunder, the Safety-Service Director, through counsel, may
petition the Court for the issuance of a preliminary or permanent injunction or
both (as may be appropriate) which restrains or compels the activities on the
part of the person or Industrial User. The Safety-Service Director shall have
such remedies to collect these fees as it has to collect other sewer service
charges.
   (c)    Civil Penalties.
      (1)    Any Industrial User who has violated or continues to violate this
chapter or any order or permit issued hereunder, shall be liable to the City
for a civil penalty of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000) plus actual
damages incurred to the POTW per violation per day for as long as the violation
continues. In addition to the above described penalty and damages, the City may
recover reasonable attorney's fees, court costs and other expenses associated
with the enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses.
      (2)    The City Law Director shall petition the Court to impose, assess
and recover such sums.
      (3)    In determining the amount of the Administrative Fine or Civil
Penalty to be assessed for violations of this Chapter, the following factors
may be considered: (a) the economic benefit derived by the violator from the
deferral of remedial action; (b) the degree of environmental harm and/or POTW
damage caused from the violation; (c) the recalcitrance of the violator; (d)
good faith efforts by the violator to take appropriate remedial action; and (e)
the duration of the violation.
   (d)    Criminal Prosecution.
      (1)   Violations generally. Any industrial user who willfully or
negligently violates any provision of this chapter or any orders or permits
issued hereunder shall be fined not to exceed twenty-five thousand dollars
($25,000) or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both.
      (2)    Whoever violates any provision of this chapter shall upon
conviction be guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree and shall be fined
not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) and be subject to imprisonment
of not more than six months, for each offense. A separate offense shall be
deemed to have been committed for each day that such violation continues after
a period of thirty days following the original conviction.
      (3)    Falsifying information. Any industrial user who knowingly makes
any false statements, representations or certifications in any application,
record, report, plan or other document filed or required to be maintained
pursuant to this chapter or wastewater permit, or who falsifies, tampers with
or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under
this chapter shall be fined not more than twenty-five thousand dollars
($25,000).
   (e)    In addition to the penalties authorized in this section, the City may
recover its cost of investigating and remediating violations of this Chapter
plus the cost of pursuing civil or criminal actions related to any violation of
this Chapter. All penalties and fines collected under this Chapter shall be
credited to the Sewer Fund of the City.

   For the purposes provided in Section
915.03, there is hereby levied and charged upon each lot, parcel of land or
premises served by, or having a connection with the sewer system or otherwise
discharging sewage, industrial wastes, water or other liquids, either directly
or indirectly, into the sewer system, sewer charges payable as hereinafter
provided and in the amounts to be determined as follows:
   (a)   Except as otherwise hereinafter provided and subject to the provisions
of subsection (f) hereof, sewer charges at the rates provided in this section
with respect to any premises shall be based upon the quantity of water consumed
upon such premises during the applicable sewer charge billing period as
measured by the City water meter there in use, or other meter installed or
approved by the Director of Public Safety and Service and such charges shall be
determined as follows:
      (1)   Commencing January 1, 2012, the Uniform Sewer Rate Structure,
applicable to all users shall be:
         First 4,800 cubic feet $10.66 per 100 cu.ft. or part thereof
         Over 4,800 cubic feet $10.66 per 100 cu.ft. or part thereof
   (b)   Premises located outside the corporate limits of the City which are
served by the sewer system shall be charged 150 percent of the rate which would
be applicable to such premises under subsections (a), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g)
and (h) hereof, if located within the corporate limits of the City, unless a
different rate is specified in an approved sewer service agreement.
   (c)   On premises using water supplied from sources other than the water
distribution system of the City and not measured by a City water meter or other
meter acceptable to the Director of Public Safety and Service, the quantity of
water consumed shall be measured by a meter installed and maintained for such
purpose at the expense of the owner or other interested party and acceptable to
the Director of Public Safety and Service, or the owner or other interested
party may, at his option, request the Director of Public Safety and Service to
determine the amount of water consumed on such premises in accordance with
accepted engineering practices; and the quantity of water consumed on such
premises shall be the amount so measured by such meter or as determined by the
Director of Public Safety and Service.
   (d)   In the event that any premises discharge industrial waste either
directly or indirectly into the sewer system, and the Director of Public Safety
and Service finds that it is impractical to measure such wastes by meter, such
wastes shall be measured in such manner and by such method as the Director
shall find practicable in order to determine the sewer service charge based
upon the rate provided in subsections (a) and (b) hereof.
   (e)   In the event that the Director of Public Safety and Service shall be
satisfied that a portion of the water from any source consumed upon any
premises does not and cannot enter the sewer system, then in such case, the
owner or other interested party may, at his expense, install and maintain such
separate metering devices, or provide such data in conformity with accepted
engineering practices, as shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Director
that portion of the water so consumed which is discharged into the sewer
system, and such portion shall be the basis for measuring the sewer charge
under subsections (a) and (b) hereof and in Section
915.05, if applicable.
   (f)   In the event that a commercial or industrial user shall discharge
cooling or process water not containing organic matter into the sewer system
and such water is metered separately to the satisfaction of the Director of
Public Safety and Service and/or is otherwise measured separately to his
satisfaction in accordance with accepted engineering practices, the sewer
charge thereof shall be nine dollars and forty cents ($9.40) per 1,000 cubic
feet, except as otherwise provided in subsection (b) hereof and shall be billed
monthly in the case of a commercial user and monthly in the case of an
industrial user.
   (g)   There shall be a minimum monthly sewer charge for each lot, parcel,
building or premises situated within and without the City having access to or
benefitted by the sanitary sewer system of the City whether or not connected
with or discharging to a public sewer based on the size of the water meter
serving the premises as follows:
 
Meter Size Minimum Sewer Usage Minimum Monthly Sewer Charge
5/8"       3CCF                $31.98
3/4"       3CCF                $31.98

each unit as if a separate meter was installed with a separate minimum charge
for each unit.
   (h)   The rates and charges established in subsection (g) of this section
shall be increased at the rate of two percent (2%) per year, commencing January
1, 2013, unless the legislative authority of the City adopts legislation
waiving the increase, reducing the increase, or enlarging the increase in such

between the City and the owner of any premises served by the sewer system such
additional charges for industrial wastes of unusual strength or composition
which are accepted by the City for treatment as may be determined to be fair

   (c)   Any premises making connection with the sewer system and using the
same after the first day of any calendar month shall be charged a per diem pro
rata amount, based upon the monthly minimum charge, as the case may be, from
the time such connection is made or such discharged into the sewer system is
begun, until the commencement of the next following billing period applicable
to such premises, except that, should the measured service exceed the minimum
charge, the measured rate shall be charged.

within or without the corporate limits of the City, the owner, lessor, rentor
or occupant of such lot, land, building or premises shall be required to treat,
neutralize or in other ways prepare the noxious substance therein to the
satisfaction of the Director of Public Safety and Service, in order to convert
the same into acceptable industrial wastes.

protection of the sewer system, including, but not limited to rules and
regulations concerning the proper classification of particular users for the
purposes of Section

enjoyment of the substantial property right and not merely to serve as a
convenience to the applicant.

   (h)    Regulations for Planned  Unit Developments (PUD). It is the intent of
this Section to regulate planned unit developments, as defined herein, in such
a manner as to preserve the character of the surrounding neighborhood.
      (1)   Intent and Purpose. The intent and purpose of a Planned Unit
Development is to achieve the following:
         A.   A maximum choice of living environments by allowing a variety of
housing, complimentary commercial uses, through the use of various building
types and a reduction in lot dimensions, yards, building setbacks, and area
requirements, while preserving the overall density objectives set by zoning.
         B.   A more useful pattern of open space and recreation areas and, if
permitted as part of the project, more convenience in the location of desirable
neighborhood commercial uses and services.
         C.   A development pattern which preserves and utilizes natural
topography and geologic features, scenic vistas, trees and other vegetation,
and prevents the disruption of natural drainage patterns.
         D.   A more efficient use of land than is generally achieved through
conventional development, which may result in substantial savings through
shorter lengths of utilities and streets.
         E.   A development pattern in harmony with land use density,
transportation facilities, connecting open space, and community facilities.
         F.   A development, that in the opinion of the Planning Commission and
City Council is advantageous to the community at large.     
      (2)   Uses Permitted. The following uses are permitted in a Planned Unit
Development:
A.   Land and buildings in the PUD shall be limited to one (1) or more of the
following uses:
            1.   Detached single-family dwellings.
            2.   Zero lot line, attached twin single, townhouse, condominium,
or other innovative forms of residential development.
            3.   Commercial uses, permitted in the underlying zoning district. 
The commercial uses must be complimentary to any residential uses proposed in
the planned unit development.
            4.   Parks, playgrounds and playfields, including outdoor
recreational facilities open to the public with or without a fee.
            5.   Normal accessory buildings and uses, provided all uses and
functional characteristics are specifically included in the approved PUD.
            6.   Other residential-oriented uses, which in the opinion of the
Planning Commission meet the purpose and intent of the PUD and are adequately
designed, located, or otherwise provided for by the development plan and other
required documents.
            7.   If the PUD is located within an Overlay Zoning Districts, the
requirements of the Overlay Zoning District shall take precedence.
      (3)     Development Standards.
         A.   The gross lot area of the tract to be developed under the planned
unit development approach shall conform to the following schedule:
 
Type of PUD                  Minimum Area (Acres)
Residential                  5
Commercial                   5
Mixed Residential-Commercial 5
         B.   When the PUD is a mixture of residential and commercial uses, the
Planning Commission shall determine that the percentages of the tract devoted
to the commercial and residential uses are appropriate. 
         C.   The area of a PUD must be an integral tract.  It cannot be a
collection of isolated pieces of land, except that roads, streets, or waterway
may lie between portions of the tract.
         D.   The minimum lot width of a planned unit development shall be
sixty (60) feet.
         E.   Any residential lots to be transferred in a planned unit
development shall have a minimum width of sixty (60) feet and a minimum lot
area of four thousand eight hundred (4,800) square eet, and a minimum lot depth
of one hundred ten (110) feet.
      (4)   Density.  The density of a residential development within a PUD
shall not exceed seven (7) units per acre.
      A.   Each phase submitted for approval shall not exceed the density
requirements for the acreage included in that phase. If a phase is approved
with less than the maximum density allowed for that phase, a subsequent phase
of the PUD may be permitted to include the allowed density not incorporated in
that previous phase.
         B.   Aggregating or clustering of dwelling units is permitted, but
there shall be no more than ten (10) dwelling units permitted per aggregation
or cluster.
         C.   For purposes of calculating the maximum density, the acreage of
the tract of land included as part of the PUD shall be multiplied by the
permitted density number.  The acreage may not include land allocated for
public right-of-ways and land below 574 feet above sea level in determining
density.
      (5)     Common Open Space.
         A.   Common open space and recreational facilities may be reserved for
the residents and users of the area being developed.  The open space and
recreational facilities shall be so sited that residents will have easy access
to it without trespassing on private areas.
         B.   Common open space is land within the development, not
individually owned or dedicated for a specific use like roads or easements,
that is designed and intended for the common use or enjoyment  of the residents
of the development and their guests, and may include complementary structures
and improvements as are necessary and appropriate.
         C.   At least ten (10%) percent of the gross area included in each
phase shall be set aside as common open space.  At least one-third (1/3) of the
common open space    for each phase must be dry land not normally covered or
inundated by water.
      D.   Such common open space land reserved under a PUD shall be held in
corporate ownership by owners of the project area for the use of each owner who
buys property within the development.
         E.   The responsibility for the maintenance of all open spaces shall
be specified by the developer before approval of the final development plan and
shall be included in deed restrictions, protective covenants, and other legal
statements or devices to be used to control the use, development, and
maintenance of the land and the improvements thereon, including those areas
which are to be commonly owned and maintained.
         F.   Common open space and recreational facilities shall be of a size,
shape, topography, and location to be usable and accessible to the residents of
the PUD.  Wherever possible, common open spaces in a PUD shall be designed to
complement open space within an adjoining development.
      (6)     Building Height.
         A.   The maximum height for all residential and commercial buildings
and structures, excluding accessory buildings, shall meet the requirements of
the underlying zoning district, unless approved at a greater height by the
Planning Commission during the review process.
      (7)     Building Yards.
         A.   All principal buildings shall have a minimum front yard setback
of twenty (20) feet, a minimum side yard setback of ten (10) feet, and a
minimum rear yard setback of twenty (20) feet.  Corner lots shall have the
front yard setback on both streets.
         B.   Units with a common wall or that are contiguous because of an
authorized zero setback are considered one (1) building. There shall be a
minimum twenty (20) foot separation between buildings of this type.
         C.   In areas where aggregation or clustering is proposed, the
Planning Commission shall have the flexibility to reduce these setbacks when
appropriate.
      (8)     Dwelling Size and Accessory Building Standards.
         A.   The dwelling size in a PUD in the “CB” and “WB” Districts shall
be approved by the Planning Commission.  The dwelling size in the “R-4"
District shall comply with Chapter
1143.07 of these regulations.  All floor-space measurements exclude open or
enclosed porches, patios, breeze-ways and garages.
         B.   Accessory buildings for each dwelling unit or commercial use
shall have a total area no greater than six hundred (600) square feet and a
maximum height no greater than fifteen (15) feet.  An accessory building must
be located within two hundred (200) feet of the dwelling unit or commercial use
it serves.
      (9)   Off-Street Parking Requirements.
         A.   The parking and off street loading requirements of Chapter
1145 shall be met.  In cases where specific standards are not established for
proposed uses within the PUD, the Planning Commission shall establish the
parking requirements that will apply.
      (10)     Commercial Uses.
         A.   When the PUD includes commercial uses, commercial buildings and
establishments should be planned as groupings, whenever possible, having common
parking areas and common ingress and egress points in order to reduce the
number of potential accident locations at intersections with thoroughfares.
         B.   Only commercial uses that are listed as permitted uses in the
underlying zoning district will be permitted.  Other similar uses not
specifically listed may be substituted with permission of the Planning
Commission.
         C.   The PUD shall provide, where commercial areas abut residential
areas, a landscape plan that, in the opinion of the Planning Commission,
provides a sufficient buffer where necessary. 
      (11)     Traffic Circulation.
         A.   The PUD shall provide for the integrated and harmonious design of
buildings, and for adequate and properly arranged facilities for internal
traffic circulation, landscaping, and such other features and facilities as may
be necessary to make  the project attractive and efficient from the standpoint
of the adjoining and surrounding non-commercial areas.
      (12)     Signs.
         A.   The requirements of Chapter
1147 shall apply for all residential and commercial uses.

considerations:
            1.   The proposed development will be initiated within two (2)
years from the date of approval.
            2.   Each individual phase of the development, as well as the total
development, can exist as a independent phase capable of creating an
environment of sustained desirability and stability, and that adequate
assurance is provided that such objective will be attained.
            3.   The uses proposed will not be detrimental to present and
potential surrounding uses, but will have a beneficial effect.
            4.   The streets and thoroughfares proposed are suitable and
adequate to carry anticipated traffic in such amounts as not to overload the
street network outside the PUD.  Required improvements shall be made prior to
any construction occurring.
            5.   Any appropriate commercial development at the locations
proposed.

in coordination and substantial compatibility with the proposed development.
            8.   The existing and proposed utility services are adequate for
the population density and the nonresidential uses proposed.
            9.   That the benefits, improved arrangements, and the design of
the proposed PUD justify the deviation from standard residential development
requirements included in the Ordinance.
            10.   The Planning Commission may require such changes or
modifications in the PUD, as are needed to achieve conformity to the standards
as herein specified.
         E.   Upon the finding by the Planning Commission that all of the
standards as herein specified have been met, it may approve of the PUD.  It
shall also, where it deems appropriate and necessary, recommend those
conditions to be imposed upon the project, its operation, or both, that are
needed to assure adherence to the aforesaid standards.
         F.   The PUD approved as a result of the application is to be a
binding plan, not subject to change by the owner or developer after its
approval and acceptance, except for minor deviation permitted herein.
         G.   Unless a deviation from a regulation in the Zoning Ordinance,
otherwise applicable to the property, is shown in the approved PUD, such
regulation shall not be assumed to be waived.
      (15)   Other Approvals.
         A.   For such parts of the PUD that are proposed to be subdivisions,
the Port Clinton Subdivision Regulations must also be met.
         B.   The approval of the PUD by the Planning Commission does not imply
approval by any other agency with jurisdiction over the development of the
property.  Approvals by other agencies must be obtained before proceeding with
the PUD.
      (16)    Expansion.
         A.   If properly zoned, an existing PUD may be expanded onto a
contiguous or adjoining parcel of land.  The plan for the expansion will be
required to follow the procedures prescribed for a new PUD.
         B.   In cases where previous phases of the PUD did not use all of the
permitted density that was allowed, that surplus density may be used on the
adjoining property with the approval of the Planning Commission.
      (17)     Minor Deviations.
         A.   Minor changes in the location or siting of buildings, structures,
streets, or parking areas, or in the areas of open space after approval of a
PUD shall not be made without approval by the Planning Commission.
         B.   The Planning Commission may hear and may approve by majority vote
such change at any public meeting if such change is made necessary by
engineering or other circumstances not foreseen at the time the PUD was
approved.  No change approved by the Planning Commission or cumulative change
resulting from a series of changes may cause a change in the use or character
of the development or any of the following:
            1.   An increase in the density of dwelling units by more than two
percent (2%).
            2.   A reduction in common open space or in visual open space.
            3.   An increase in problems of vehicular or pedestrian traffic
circulation or safety, or of utilities.
            4.   A reduction of off-street parking or loading space.
            5.   A reduction in approved pavement widths.
            6.   A reduction of more than five percent (5%) in structural
setback from the PUD’s boundary.
All other changes or cumulative changes not meeting the above standards shall
be subject to the review process of Chapter
1139 of the Codified Ordinances.
          (18)     Default.
         A.   If no significant construction has begun within two (2) years
after approval of a PUD, it shall be void, unless an extension of the time
limit of the approved PUD is approved by the Planning Commission, after
submission of a written request, identifying the basis for the time extension,
and a finding by the Planning Commission that such extension is not in conflict
with the public interest.
         B.   If construction is started but amenities, roads and drives,
sewer, water, drainage, utilities, and landscaping are not done in accordance
with the approved PUD, the Planning Commission may require of the owner that it
be done forthwith or the special use approval may be revoked.

not need their parking facilities may by agreement approved by the Planning
Commission, use those facilities instead of providing their own; except that
such other facilities must be off-street, paved and meet the total requirements
for churches and temples.
      (3)    The following use shall be enclosed by a solid masonry wall or
similar barrier six inches thick along any lot line when adjacent to any

1151.01  INTENT AND PURPOSE.
   (a)   There is hereby created a Downtown Waterfront Overlay District in the
City of Port Clinton Zoning ordinance. This District is created to promote and
protect the public health, safety, comfort, convenience, and general welfare by
providing for the consistent and coordinated treatment of the properties in
proximity to Lake Erie and its tributaries within the corporate limits of the
City of Port Clinton.
   (b)   The underlying zoning districts in the Downtown Waterfront Overlay
area include the "R-3" Medium Density Residential District, the "IGOS"
Institutional, Governmental and open Space District, the "CB" Central Business
District, the "WB" Waterfront Business District, the "M-1" Light Manufacturing
District, and the "M-2" Heavy Manufacturing District.
   (c)   Land use regulations control development, but at the same time, these
regulations must allow for the City to attract and encourage investment within
its boundaries. The Downtown Waterfront Overlay District does not change the
existing zoning of the property within the geographic area that it  covers, but
it does create additional requirements and does limit the types of uses that
may be permitted for the development or redevelopment of property within the
Overlay area.
(Ord.  25-04.  Passed 10-12-04.)
1151.02  CONFLICTS BETWEEN OVERLAY DISTRICT AND UNDERLYING ZONING DISTRICT.
   Where conflicts occur between the Downtown Waterfront Overlay District

Waterfront Overlay District requirements shall apply and prevail.
(Ord. 25-04.  Passed 10-12-04.)
1151.03  DOWNTOWN WATERFRONT OVERLAY DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   The boundaries of the Downtown Waterfront Overlay District are established
and will be shown on the zoning map of the City of Port Clinton. A map
depicting the boundaries of the Overlay district is included herein. The area
includes all of the following property: the east boundary is Fulton Street
including its imaginary extension to the waters of Lake Erie, the west boundary
is Harrison Street extended to the south side of the Portage River, the north
boundary is the waters of Lake Erie up to the mouth of the Portage River at
which point the north boundary becomes the south shore of the Portage River as
it heads westerly to Harrison Street extended, and the south  boundary is the
first alley south of Perry Street that runs from Fulton Street to Harrison
Street.
(Ord. 25-04.  Passed 10-12-04.)
1151.04  PLANS REQUIRED PRIOR TO APPLICATION FOR ZONING PERMIT.
   Within the Downtown Waterfront Overlay District, a site plan approval from
the Port Clinton Planning Commission shall be required prior to a zoning permit
being issued by the City's Zoning Inspector. A site plan review and approval
shall be necessary for all new development. Where an existing structure is
enlarged by thirty (30) percent or more of the existing square footage in the
structure, a site plan review shall also be required. The site plan review
shall require the following process to be completed.
   (a)    Planning Commission Approval. Within the Downtown Waterfront Overlay
District, all site plans shall be submitted to the Planning Commission for
review and approval. Site plans shall meet all of the content requirements set
forth when submitted. Incomplete site plan submittals may be returned to the
applicant for completion prior to review by the Planning Commission. Site plan 
applications shall be obtained at the office of the Zoning Inspector in the
City Complex at 1868 E. Perry Street in Port Clinton.
      (1)   To be considered by the Port Clinton Planning Commission, six (6)
copies of the site plan application shall be submitted to the Port Clinton
Zoning Inspector along with the required fee as established by City Council.
Submission must be at least fifteen (15) business days prior to the regularly
scheduled Planning Commission meeting. A public hearing where a review of the
site plan shall occur will be scheduled for the next appropriate meeting of the
Commission. The Zoning Inspector is responsible for distributing the site plan
application to the Planning Commission members at least five (5) business days
prior to the scheduled hearing. The Zoning Inspector shall follow the procedure
specified in Section
1133.02(b) and (c) of the City Zoning ordinances to notify the public of the
public hearing on the site plan.
      (2)   At the hearing, the Commission shall review the site plan and the
hearing may be continued if the Commission requests additional information.
Within fifteen (15) days of the conclusion of the hearing, the Planning
Commission shall approve, conditionally approve, or disapprove the site plan
application. When conditional approval is granted by the Planning Commission,
all applicable conditions shall be met prior to the issuance of a zoning
permit. The Planning Commission shall submit an approved copy of the site plan
to the Zoning Inspector. The site plan must be approved in writing and shall be
retained by the Commission as an official record of approval.
      (3)   Site plan approval shall be in effect for eighteen (18) months from
the approval date. An applicant may request one (1) extension of the site plan
approval from the Planning Commission for not more than one (1) additional
year.
      (4)   A site plan approval by the Planning Commission shall not be
required for a one-family dwelling, an addition to a one-family dwelling, or
for an accessory structure to a residential use.
      (5)   A zoning permit must still be obtained by the applicant. Copies of
all administrative actions shall be made available to the Planning Commission
at the next regularly scheduled meeting. Enforcement of the terms and
conditions of the site plan approval shall occur as specified in Chapter
1127.
      (6)   Prior to submitting a site plan, the applicant may request a pre-
application conference with the Zoning Inspector and representatives of the
Planning Commission. The purpose of the conference is to provide information
about site plan requirements and provide guidance in preparing the site plan.
No formal action shall be taken on the site plan at the pre-application
conference.
   (b)    Site Plan Application Requirements. The following information shall
be included on the site plan application:
      (1)   The name, address and telephone number of the owner, the owner's
agent (if applicable) and the person preparing the site plan;
      (2)   A north arrow and scale (one inch equals fifty feet or larger);
      (3)   A location or vicinity map;
      (4)   The boundaries of the lot, dimensioned to the nearest foot, and the

      (15)   An explanation of how building/facilities for things such as
services, i.e. garbage collection, gas pumps, pump out, etc. will be handled.
   Regardless of the requirements set out above, the Planning Commission may
waive specific site plan information requirements if the requirements are
judged to be inapplicable to a particular project or are judged to impose a
special hardship on the applicant.
(Ord. 25-04.  Passed 10-12-04.)
1151.05  COMPLIANCE WITH SITE PLAN APPROVAL.
   All subsequent development on the site shall occur in accordance with the
approved site plan, unless the Planning Commission approves a site plan
amendment. A site plan amendment shall follow the same procedure as the
original site plan approval. Any deviation from an approved site plan shall be
deemed a violation of the site plan approval.
(Ord. 25-04.  Passed 10-12-04.)
1151.06  REVOCATION OF SITE PLAN APPROVAL.
   (a)   Any site plan approval issued upon a false statement shall be voidable
by action of the Planning Commission. Whenever the fact of a false statement
shall be established to the satisfaction of the Planning Commission as
evidenced by an affirmative vote of three-fourths of the members of the
Planning Commission, the site plan approval shall be revoked. Upon the
revocation of a site plan approval, the Planning Commission shall deliver a
written notice of revocation to the holder of the revoked site plan approval,
by personal service or by certified mail, with return receipt requested. If the
holder of the revoked site plan approval cannot be located, then the written
notice shall be served by posting the notice of revocation in a conspicuous
place upon the premises.
   (b)   Any person who shall thereafter proceed with any work on or use of the
premises without having obtained a new site plan approval, in accordance with
these requirements, shall be guilty of a zoning violation.
(Ord. 25-04.  Passed 10-12-04.)

1155.01  INTENT AND PURPOSE.
   (a)   There is hereby created a Perry Street Corridor Waterfront Overlay
District in the City of Port Clinton Zoning Ordinance. This District is created
to promote and protect the public health, safety, comfort, convenience, and
general welfare by providing for the consistent and coordinated treatment of
the properties in proximity to Lake Erie and its tributaries within the
corporate limits of the City of Port Clinton.
   (b)   The underlying zoning districts in the Perry Street Corridor
Waterfront Overlay area include the "R-3" Medium Density Residential District,
the "IGOS" Institutional, Governmental and Open Space District, the "GB"
General Business District, the "WB" Waterfront Business District, the "AB"
Accommodation Business District and the "M-1" Light Manufacturing District.
   (c)   Land use regulations control development, but at the same time, these
regulations must allow for the City to attract and encourage investment within
its boundaries. The Perry Street Corridor Waterfront Overlay District does not
change the existing zoning of the property within the geographic area that it
covers, but it does create additional requirements and does limit the types of
uses that may be permitted for the development or redevelopment of property
within the overlay area.
(Ord. 25-04.  Passed 10-12-04.)
1155.02  CONFLICT BETWEEN OVERLAY DISTRICT AND  UNDERLYING ZONING DISTRICT.
   Where conflicts occur between the Perry Street Corridor Waterfront Overlay
District requirements and those of the underlying zoning district, the Perry
Street Corridor Waterfront Overlay District requirements shall apply and
prevail.
(Ord. 25-04.  Passed 10-12-04.)
1155.03  PERRY STREET CORRIDOR WATERFRONT OVERLAY DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   The boundaries of the Perry Street Corridor Waterfront Overlay District are
established and will be shown on the zoning map of the City of Port Clinton. A
map depicting the boundaries of the Overlay district is included herein. The
area includes all of the following property: the west boundary is the east
right-of-way of Fulton Street including its imaginary extension to the waters
of Lake Erie, the east boundary is the corporation limits of the City, the
north boundary is the waters of Lake Erie, and the south boundary is the depth
of the lots that actually front on Perry Street, up to a maximum of three
hundred feet in depth from the south right-of-way line of Perry Street, where
these lots exceed three hundred feet in depth.
(Ord. 25-04.  Passed 10-12-04.)

1167.01  GENERAL STATEMENT.
The regulations in this chapter, inclusive, shall control the manner in which
streets, lots, and other elements of a subdivision are arranged on the land.
These design controls shall help insure convenience and safe streets, the
creation of usable lots, the provision of space for public utilities, and the
reservation of land for recreational uses. The planning of attractive and
functional neighborhoods shall be promoted, minimizing the undesirable features
of unplanned, haphazard growth.
The Commission and appropriate city and county officials have the
responsibility for reviewing the design of each future subdivision early in its
design development. The Commission shall insure that all of the requirements of
this chapter are met.
1167.02  CONFORMITY TO DEVELOPMENT PLANS AND ZONING.
The arrangement, character, and location of all arterial and collector
thoroughfares or extensions thereof shall conform with the Major Thoroughfare
System. Thoroughfares not contained in the aforementioned system shall conform
to the recommendation of the Commission and the City officials based upon the
design standards set forth in Sections
1167.02 to
1167.13. In addition, the final plat shall conform to the Port Clinton zoning
ordinance, if applicable. 
1167.03  SUITABILITY OF LAND.
If the Commission finds that land proposed to be subdivided is unsuitable for
subdivision development due to flooding, poor drainage, topography, soils,
inadequate water supply or sewage disposal, transportation facilities, and
other such conditions which may endanger health, life, or property, and, if
from investigations conducted by the public agencies concerned it is determined
that in the best interest of the public the land should not be developed for
the purpose proposed, the Commission shall not approve the land for subdivision
unless adequate methods are advanced by the subdivider for solving the problems
that will be created by the development of the land.
1167.04  STREET DESIGN.
The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade construction, and location of
all streets shall conform to the Major Thoroughfare System.
All streets shall be considered in their relation to existing and planned
streets, topographical conditions, public convenience and safety, and the
proposed uses of the land to be served by such streets. The circulation pattern
shall discourage through traffic in the interior of a subdivision. The
subdivider shall provide, within the boundaries of the subdivision plat, the
necessary right-of-way for the widening, continuance, or alignment of such
streets in conformity with the Major Thoroughfare System. The Commission
reserves the right to disapprove any street plan which does not represent good
design or does not insure continuity of existing street systems.
1167.05  STREET DESIGN STANDARDS FOR CUL-DE-SACS.
The maximum length of a street with a cul-de-sac shall be one thousand (1000)
feet. The terminal right-of-way shall be a circular area with a minimum radius
of fifty (50) feet measured from a point on the street centerline.
1167.06  RIGHTS-OF-WAY FOR ALL STREETS.
The rights-of-way for thoroughfares shall be in accordance with the Major
Thoroughfare System, and the minimum requirements shall be as follows:
 
Street Type            R/W Width (Feet)
Secondary route        100
Arterial street        80
Local Collector Street 60
Residential Street     60
Special Streets:
Marginal Access Street 50-60
Cul-de-sac             50 radius
1167.07  HORIZONTAL ALIGNMENT.
Horizontal street curves shall have the following minimum radii of centerline
curvature:
 
Primary and Secondary Routes   300 Feet
Arterial and Collector Streets 200 Feet
Residential Streets            100 Feet
A minimum tangent of at least one hundred (100) feet shall be provided between
reversed curves on all residential streets; greater tangential lengths shall be
required on collector and arterial streets and other higher order
thoroughfares.
The Commission may modify the aforementioned minimum standards in the following
situations:
   (a)   When a collector or residential street's lines deflect from each other
at any point by more than ten (10) degrees, they shall be connected by a curve
with a radius adequate to insure a sight distance of not less than two hundred
(200) feet or with such greater radius as the Commission may deem necessary for
the particular situation.
   (b)   For arterial streets, curves with radii adequate to insure longer
sight distances may be required by the Commission.
   (c)   In subdivisions where the street pattern is curvilinear, curves shall
have radii acceptable to the Commission.
1167.08  VERTICAL ALIGNMENT.
Vertical street profiles shall conform to the grades listed below.
 
(a)   Arterial Streets                                  Maximum Grade - 4%
(b)   Collector and Residential Streets and Alleys
                                                           Maximum Grade - 6%
(c)   Intersection Approaches (for at least 100 ft.)
                                                           Maximum Grade - 4%
(d)   Rate of Change of Grade                           Maximum Grade - 4%
(e)   Minimum Grade (normally only with curbs and gutter
                                                           0.1%
1167.09  INTERSECTION DESIGN STANDARDS.
Proposed streets shall intersect one another as nearly at right angles as
topography or other limiting factors will permit. No intersection of streets at
angles less than sixty (60) degrees shall be approved unless justified by
extreme topographical conditions. In such a case, special provisions as deemed
necessary by the Commission shall be made in designing the intersection to
afford a satisfactory sight distance of approaching vehicles from each
intersecting street.
Residential street intersections shall be rounded with a twenty-five (25) foot
radius measured at the back of curbs, if such intersections occur at right
angles. Under the same condition and measured similarly, all other
intersections shall be rounded with a radius deemed appropriate by the
Commission. If an intersection at an angle less than sixty (60) degrees is
unavoidable, the radius of curvature shall be such as to allow vehicles,
especially trucks and buses, to make right turns and proceed in the proper lane
without encroaching upon the high speed lane of a multi-lane thoroughfare or
across the centerline of a two-lane thoroughfare.
Streets jogs at intersections with centerline offsets shall be avoided. Points
of access to a primary or secondary route shall be spaced at a minimum of 800
feet.
1167.10  SPECIAL STREET TYPES.
The following requirements shall apply to special street types:
   (a)   Permanent dead-end streets shall not be permitted. Temporary dead-end
streets shall be permitted only as a segment of a continuing street plan
subject to extension into undeveloped acreage. Temporary dead-end streets shall
extend to the boundary of such undeveloped acreage and shall be provided with
an interim turnaround satisfactory to the Commission in design. The Commission
shall reserve the right to limit the length of such a dead-end street based on
principles of proper planning, and the Commission may require a street to
extend to the boundary between a proposed subdivision and the undeveloped
acreage to provide for future development.
   (b)   The dedication of new half-streets shall not be permitted: If a parcel
to be subdivided exists adjacent to a dedicated or platted and recorded half-
width street or alley, the other half-width of such street or alley falling
within the proposed subdivision shall be platted, providing that in the opinion
of the Commission such right-of-way is necessary for the proper development of
the area.
   (c)   Where subdivision lots would require direct vehicular access onto an
existing or proposed primary or secondary route as specified in the Major
Thoroughfare System, a marginal access street shall be designed. A planting
strip of a minimum width of twenty (20) feet shall be provided between the
primary or secondary route and the marginal access street.
   (d)   Where a subdivision borders on or contains the right-of-way of a
railroad or an expressway, the Commission may require a street approximately
parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way at a distance which will
permit appropriate use of the land situated between such right-of-way and the
required parallel streets. Such distance shall also be determined with due
regard for the requirements of approach grades and future grade separations. In
addition, the Commission may also require the provision of buffer planting
strips, the platting of loop streets or cul-de-sacs connected to such parallel
streets, or any combination of such.
   (e)   Easements or reserve strips controlling access to streets shall be
prohibited except where deemed necessary by the Commission and where their
control is definitely placed with the city.
   (f)   In subdividing land along existing streets or roads and within a
proposed subdivision, provisions for the dedication of land for one or more
streets to undeveloped land not fronting on an existing street or road shall be
incorporated. Said access streets shall be spaced not less than eight hundred
(800) feet nor more than one thousand four hundred (1,400) feet apart.
   (g)   Alleys shall not be approved in residential subdivisions except where
justified by extreme conditions. Alleys may be approved in commercial and
industrial subdivisions if no other provisions can be made for adequate service
access. The minimum widths for alleys shall be twenty (20) feet. Alley
intersections, sharp changes in alignment, and dead-ends shall not be permitted
unless extreme conditions would warrant such permission.
1167.11  STREETS FOR COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL SUBDIVISIONS.
Streets in commercial and industrial subdivisions shall be so planned as to
minimize conflict between vehicular and pedestrian movement. Such streets shall
connect with arterial streets so as to not generate excess traffic on
residential streets. The Commission may require marginal access streets in such
subdivisions to provide maximum safety and convenience.
1167.12  STREET VACATION.
The Commission shall not recommend to City Council the vacation of any street
dedicated to and accepted by the public if such vacation will adversely affect
the proper functioning of the existing street system or any future street plans
prepared by, or approved by, the Commission.
1167.13  NAMES OF STREETS.
Names of streets shall not duplicate nor be confusingly similar to the name of
any other street in the City of Port Clinton. New streets which are extensions
of, or in alignment with, existing streets shall bear the name of the existing
streets.
1167.14  BLOCKS.
The following regulations shall govern the design and layout of blocks:
   (a)   The arrangement of blocks shall conform to the street design criteria
set forth in Sections
1167.04 to
1167.13.
   (b)   Blocks shall be arranged to accommodate lots and building sites of the
size and character required by these regulations  and any applicable zoning
resolution, to provide for adequate community facilities, and to regard the
limitations and opportunities of topography.
   (c)   Irregularly-shaped blocks, those intended for cul-de-sacs and loop
streets, and those containing interior parks or playgrounds may be approved by
the Commission if properly designed and located.
   (d)   No block shall be longer than one thousand four hundred (1,400) feet
nor less than six hundred (600) feet. The block shall normally accommodate two
(2) tiers of lots and shall have a minimum width of two hundred fifty (250)
feet, except where unusual topography or other extreme physical circumstances
exist.
   (e)   Where blocks are more than nine hundred (900) feet in length, a
crosswalk easement not less than ten (10) feet in width at or near the halfway
point of the block may be required.
   (f)   Blocks intended for commercial and industrial subdivisions shall be
designed specifically for such purposes and shall include adequate provisions
for parking, loading, and delivery services. Such blocks shall not be less than
two hundred fifty (250) feet in width nor less than one thousand feet in
length.
1167.15  LOTS.
The following regulations shall govern the design and layout of lots:
   (a)   The lot arrangement and design shall be such that all lots will
provide satisfactory building sites, properly related to topography and the
character of surrounding development.
   (b)   All lots shall conform to or exceed the requirements of these
regulations and applicable zoning requirements.
   (c)   Each lot shall front on, be contiguous to, or border on a public
street.
   (d)   The minimum lot area shall be four thousand eight hundred (4,800)
square feet. The minimum lot width shall be sixty (60) feet.
   (e)   In residential subdivisions, a minimum front, side, and rear setback
line as established by the zoning district shall be required. The Commission
may require additional setback in unique situations. Front setback lines shall
be measured from the road right-of-way line.
   (f)   All side lot lines should be straight lines and should be at right
angles to street lines or radial on curved street lines except where the
Commission determines that a variation would benefit the public interest.
   (g)   Lots with double frontage shall be avoided except where the Commission
determines that it is essential to overcome specific topographical
disadvantages and orientation and location problem due to existing street.
   (h)   No corner lot shall have a width, measured at the required  front
setback line, of less than seventy-five (75) feet.
   (i)   Lots fronting on a street upon which no other lots face should be
avoided. No rear lot line should border adjacent side lot lines. Where the rear
lot lines of a subdivision border a thoroughfare, the Commission may require a
screen planting contained in a nonaccess easement or reservation along said
road.
   (j)   No lot shall have an average depth which is more than five (5) times
its average width, nor shall the depth of any lot be less than one hundred
twenty (120) feet measured from the edge of the road right-of-way.
1167.16  EASEMENTS.
All easements shall be a minimum of twenty (20) feet. Where utilities are
located outside street right-of-way lines, easements at least twenty (20) feet
in width centered along rear or side lot lines shall be provided. All easements
locations shall be approved by the utility company or county agency involved;
and, where necessary, easements of greater width may be required by the
Commission. Easements shall also be provided along every water course, storm
sewer, or drainage channel within a subdivision as provided in Section
1167.17 of these regulations.
1167.17  STORM DRAINAGE.
The preferred runoff pattern shall be towards the street. The design of streets
and grading shall be such that runoff from roofs, driveways, and other
impervious surfaces will be collected in ditches and/or gutters in short runs
three hundred (300) feet to four hundred (400) feet in length. The runoff shall
then be diverted from the surface into storm sewers or a natural water course.
Streets shall be located away from water courses unless storm sewers are to be
installed.
Adequate measures for the protection of open and closed drainage channels shall
be provided.
Property lines shall be so designed as to follow drainage easements, except
that such easements may cross lots larger than one (1) acre.
No water course shall be altered in such a way as to change the amount or
direction of flow; no fill, building, nor structures shall be situated in
natural water courses unless provision is made for the flow of water in a
manner satisfactory to the Safety Service Director.
1167.18  PUBLIC SITES, OPEN SPACE, AND NATURAL FEATURES.
Where a park, playground, school, public access to water frontage, or other
public uses, which are contained within the Comprehensive Plan are located in
whole or in part in a proposed subdivision, the Commission may request the
dedication of such area within the subdivision or that provision be made for
the acquisition of such area by the proper agency within a period of two (2)
years or other mutually acceptable period.
The Commission may require up to ten percent (10%) of a subdivision, exclusive
of streets, to be allocated for recreational purposes. Such requirement shall
depend upon the size of the proposed subdivision, the density of population,
the location of the subdivision in relation to existing public open spaces, and
other similar determining factors.
Where a large scale subdivision is proposed, the Commission may require that
consideration be given to sites for schools, parks, playgrounds, and other such
areas for common use and that provisions be made for such reservation or
acquisition by the proper agency.
The Commission reserves the right to deny approval to a subdivision if such a
subdivision disregards the preservation of natural features which add value to
residential development and the community, such as wooded areas, water courses,
beaches, areas of natural or historical significance, and similar irreplaceable
assets as determined by the appropriate federal, state, and county agencies.
1167.19  SOIL EROSION REQUIREMENTS.
In the development of a subdivision, the developer shall not create a situation
where the erosion of soil can impair a public or private surface ditch, stream,
or river; nor shall excessive amounts of sediment be deposited onto an
adjoining property. Adequate controls of erosion and sedimentation of both a
temporary and permanent nature shall be provided during all phases of clearing,
grading, and construction to conserve soil resources and to insure no
significant change in water quality.
In the event that any developer shall intend to make changes in the contour of
the land to a degree that erosion and sedimentation may occur, the developer
shall submit an erosion and sedimentation plan for approval to the Commission.
The Commission will request review of the plan by the Ottawa County Soil and
Water Conservation District. Failure to employ the recommended practices is
cause to restrain the developer from further work until he complies with the
recommendations and withholding of performance bond payments for work
completed.

insure their completion with a performance guarantee acceptable to the
Commission, the City Council, and the appropriate official before the final
plat may be approved. All improvements shall be completed within a two (2) year
period from the date of final plan approval. Otherwise the appropriate official
will take the necessary steps to complete or correct the improvements using the
performance guarantee. Extensions to the completion deadline may be granted by
the appropriate official, if necessary. Once the improvements have been
completed, a one year period of time must pass before the improvements will be
accepted. A sufficient amount of funds will be retained during the warranty
period to insure any required repairs can be undertaken.
1169.33  TYPES OF PERFORMANCE GUARANTEES.
To guarantee the construction and/or maintenance of required improvements prior
to the approval and recording of the final plat, the subdivider may be required
to provide a performance guarantee in one or a combination of the following
arrangements:
   (a)   Performance Bond: The subdivider may post a bond executed by a surety
company equal to the estimated cost plus ten percent (10%) of the required
improvements. The bond shall be in favor of the City Council. The bond shall
guarantee construction of the improvements according to the plans and
specifications approved by the Commission and the responsible public officials.
The term of the bond shall not exceed two (2) years, except the Commission may
grant an extension where due cause can be shown.
   (b)   Deposit: The subdivider may make a deposit with a responsible escrow
agent or with a trust company. The deposit shall be money or negotiable bonds
in an amount equal to the estimated cost plus ten percent (10%) of the required
improvements. If a cash deposit is made, an agreement may be executed to
provide payments to the contractor or the subdivider from the deposit as the
work progresses and is approved by the responsible officials.
   (c)   Escrow Agreements: Where escrow agreements for the proposed
improvements are proposed for the estimated cost of the improvements plus ten 
percent (10%), they will constitute sufficient guarantee for the installation
of required improvements in lieu of other methods stated above. An escrow
agreement form is available from the appropriate agency involved and must be
used.
   (d)   Failure of Subdivider to Complete Improvements: In case the subdivider
shall fail to complete the required improvements work within such time period
as required by the conditions or guarantees as outlined above, the Commission
and City Council may proceed to have such work completed and reimburse the City
for the cost thereof by appropriating the cash deposit, certified check, surety
bond, or escrow account, or shall take the necessary steps to require
performance by the bonding company.
1169.34  ACCEPTANCE OF STREETS AND OTHER IMPROVEMENTS.
The subdivider shall properly construct and shall be responsible for making
repairs and/or alterations to provide that improvements are in good condition
at the time the subdivider requests their acceptance by the City Council. The
acceptance of improvements for use and maintenance by the public shall be
subject to satisfactory compliances with the following requirements:
   (a)   Inspection and approval of all improvements by the responsible county
and city officials, with notification by those agencies to the Commission and
City Council in writing when the construction of the improvements has been
satisfactorily completed.
   (b)   When the required improvement construction is completed and all
required written approvals regarding same have been granted and received by the
Commission and City Council, the subdivider shall place a certificate on the
final plat indicating the acceptance, by City Council of the improvement
(including the improvements constructed therein) for use and maintenance by the
public.
   (c)   When the required improvement construction is not completed, or
written approvals of completed construction have not been received by the
Commission, and City Council prior to submittal of the final plat for approval,
the Commission shall, if it approves the plat, notify City Council when the
construction of all required streets and other required improvements in a
specific plat has been satisfactorily completed, giving a description of the
improvement and Council shall thereupon adopt a resolution/ordinance accepting
such improvement (which shall include the improvements constructed therein) for
use and maintenance by the public; however, such acceptance shall be dated one
year from the date of the resolution/ordinance and the subdivider shall keep
such improvements in a satisfactory state of maintenance, otherwise such
acceptance shall be voided. Where the improvement is to be publicly owned,
transfer of the improvement, in a manner acceptable to City Council, shall
occur.

1171.01  PURPOSE AND INTENT.
(a)   To restrict or prohibit the subdivision of lands for uses which are
dangerous to health, safety, or property in times of flood or which, with
reasonably anticipated improvements, will cause excessive increases in flood
heights or velocities.
(b)   To require that each subdivision lot in an area vulnerable to floods be
provided with a safe building site with adequate access and that public
facilities which serve such uses will be installed with protection against
flood damage at the time of construction; and
(c)   To protect individuals from buying lands which are unsuited for intended
purposes because of flood hazards by prohibiting the subdivision of unprotected
flood hazard lands, requiring that flood hazard areas be delineated on all
plats, and reserving through deed restrictions areas not suitable for
development.
1171.02  FLOOD PLAIN EVALUATION.
The primary source of information that will be used by the Commission in
determining the flood hazard potential of an area is the Floodway and Flood
Boundary Maps as amended. These maps were prepared by the Federal Flood
Insurance Administration for the City of Port Clinton. Where necessary, other
sources of information may be used by the Commission.
A proposed subdivision will be located on the maps and its flooding potential
determined. Restrictions on the types of uses within a portion or the entire
proposed subdivision will be noted and must be followed. The Commission will
meet with the subdivider to evaluate the degree and the extent of the flood-
prone areas within the proposed subdivision.
1171.03  FLOOD PLAIN REQUIREMENTS.
In addition to the other stipulations set forth in these regulations, the
following shall be required of subdivisions within the delineated flood hazard
areas:
   (a)   The Floodway and Flood Boundary areas shall be clearly labeled on the
final plat.
   (b)   Building site shall not be permitted in the Floodway area. They may be
permitted in the Flood Boundary area if the sites are filled or if the lowest
floor of the structure is elevated above the one hundred (100) year flood
elevation of the area. The one hundred (100) year flood elevation will be
stated on the final plats.
   (c)   Fill areas shall extend beyond the limits of the intended building
site and shall include areas for proper drainage and slope.
   (d)   The Safety Service Director or their designee shall determine the
street elevations in flood hazard areas and state what drainage systems will be
required for the subdivision.
1171.04  WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
The degree of flood protection required by these regulations shall be
considered reasonable for regulatory purposes. These regulations do not imply
that areas outside the delineated flood hazard areas or land uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. These
regulations shall not create liability on the part of the City of Port Clinton
or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that results from
reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.

1173.03  SALE OF LAND WITHIN SUBDIVISIONS.
No owner or agent of the owner of any land located within a subdivision shall
attempt to transfer any land within the subdivision before such plat has been
approved and recorded in the manner prescribed in these regulations. The
description of such lot or parcel by metes and bounds in the instrument of
transfer or other documents used in the process of selling or transferring
shall not exempt the transaction from the provisions of these regulations.
1173.04  VARIANCES.
The following regulations shall govern the granting of variances:
   (a)   Where the Commission finds that extraordinary and unnecessary hardship
may result from strict compliance with these regulations, due to exceptional
topographic or other physical conditions, it may vary the regulations so as to
relieve such hardship, provided such relief may be granted without detriment to
the public interest and without impairing the intent and purpose of these
regulations or the desirable development of the neighborhood and community.
Such variations shall not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose
of these regulations, or the Comprehensive Plan.
   (b)   In granting variances or modifications, the Commission may require
such conditions as, in its judgment, will secure substantially the objective of
the standards or requirements so varied or modified.
   (c)    Any variance granted shall be entered in the minutes of the

   (a)    "Fence" means any structure composed of wood, iron, steel, shrubbery,
hedges or other material erected in such a manner and position as to enclose or
partially enclose any premises or any part of any premises. Trellises or other
structures supporting or for the purpose of supporting vines, flowers, and
other vegetation when erected in such a position as to enclose any premises or
any part of any premises shall be included within this definition. Structures
erected other than on lot lines or in close proximity to lot lines, which have
solely an ornamental purpose and which do not in fact serve the purpose of
enclosing or partially enclosing premises or of separating premises from
adjoining premises, shall not be included within this definition.
   (b)    "Privacy fence" means a fence made to inhibit public view and provide
seclusion and, when viewed at an angle, has very little, if any, of the area of
its vertical plane (the area within a rectangular outline enclosing all parts
of the fence in its vertical plane) open to light or air. Examples of privacy
fences may include:
      (1)    Basket weave or woven fence. A fence made of interwoven strips or
slats of flexible or semi-flexible material in which the pattern has the
appearance of a plaited basket.

placed at an angle or positioned so as to provide air but to deflect light
perpendicular to its vertical plane.
      (3)    Stockade or Palisade fence. A fence constructed with a row of
large pointed stakes placed upright against each other having more than fifty
percent (50%) of the area of its vertical plane closed to light or air.
   (c)    "Open ornamental fence" means a fence usually made of wood
constructed for its beauty or decorative effect and, when viewed at an angle,
one would have the ability to see through the fence to the adjoining property.
Examples of open ornamental fences may include:
      (1)    Rail or split rail fence. A fence constructed of narrow, whole or
split, wooden timbers placed horizontally between upright supporting posts.
      (2)    Picket fence. An open fence made of upright pales or slats.

the property line shall be designed, constructed and finished so that  the
supporting members thereof shall face the property of the owner of the fence.
If a fence does not meet these standards, the owner of the property with the
fence shall be subject to the penalty of Section
1309.99. 
(Ord. 33-05.  Passed 11-8-05.)
1309.08  PERMIT.
   (a)   Any fence which may be permitted shall require the issuance of a
permit by the Safety-Service Director or a designated representative after the
same has been approved by him.  A fence permit shall be granted only upon the
basis or representation made by clear drawings and specifications accurately
indicating the location, kind of material and full dimensions in figures of

1309.09  INSPECTION.
   Each property owner shall determine property lines and ascertain that the
fence thus constructed does not deviate from the plans as approved by the
Safety-Service Director issuing permits, and such fence does not encroach upon
another lot or parcel of land.  The City shall furnish such inspection as is
deemed necessary to determine that such fence is constructed in accordance with
plans submitted for permit, provided however, that the issuance of such permit
by the City shall not be construed as to mean the City has determined such
fence is not encroaching upon another lot, nor shall it relieve the property
owner of the duty imposed upon him herein.
(Ord. 29-77.  Passed 9-13-77.)
1309.10  REQUEST FOR VARIANCE.
   (a)    Application for Variance. An application for a variance may be taken
by any property owner, including a tenant, from the provisions and requirements
of this chapter. The application shall be to the Board of Zoning Appeals
(hereinafter referred to as the Board). The application shall be filed with the
Administrative office of the Board, who shall transmit the same to the Board. A
fee as established by Council shall accompany any application for a variance.
   (b)    Variance by Board. No variance shall be granted unless the board
finds that all of the following facts and conditions exist:
      (1)    That special circumstances or conditions apply to the subject
property that do not apply generally to other properties in the same zoning
district.
      (2)    That the special circumstances or conditions are not the result of
the actions of the property owner or applicant.
      (3)    That the special circumstances or conditions make it necessary
that a variance be granted to preserve a substantial property right of the
applicant which is possessed by owners of other property in the same zoning
district.
      (4)    That the grant of a variance will not be injurious to neighboring
properties and will not be contrary to the public interest or the intent and
purpose of this Chapter.
   Factors or standards to be considered and weighed for an area variance
include, but are not limited to the following:
      (1)    Whether the variance is substantial.
      (2)    Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be
substantially altered or whether adjoining properties would suffer a
substantial detriment as a result of the variance.
      (3)    Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of
governmental services.
      (4)    Whether the property owner's predicament feasibly can be prevented
through some method other than a variance.
      (5)    Whether the spirit and intent behind the fence regulations would
be observed and substantial justice done by granting the variance.
   (c)    In granting a variance, the board, may impose such requirements and
conditions regarding the location, character and other features of the proposed
fence structure as the board deems necessary to carry out the intent and
purpose of the fence regulations and to otherwise safeguard the public safety
and welfare.
(Ord. 33-05.  Passed 11-8-05.)

1313.01  GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization.  Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens. Therefore, the City Council of Port Clinton, State of Ohio, does
ordain as follows:
   (b)   Findings of Fact.  The City of Port Clinton has special flood hazard
areas that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life
and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection
and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the
public health, safety, and general welfare. Additionally, structures that are
inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such
damages and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, this Chapter is
adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose.  It is the purpose of Chapter to promote the
public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss.  In order to accomplish its purposes,
this Chapter includes methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply.  This Chapter shall apply to
all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of Port
Clinton, Ohio as identified in the Flood Insurance Study-Ottawa County, Ohio
(and incorporated areas) and Flood Insurance Rate Maps effective May 18, 2015,
including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by The City of
Port Clinton.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard.  For the
purposes of this Chapter, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study-Ottawa Connty, Ohio (and Incorporated Areas)
and Flood Insurance Rate Maps Effective May 18, 2015.
      (2)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard,
including, but not limited to Letters of Map Change.
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City of Port Clinton as required by Section
1313.04(c) Subdivisions and Large Scale Developments.
   Any revisions to.the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby adopted
by reference
and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or studies are on
file at the Port Clinton City Hall, 1868 E. Peny Street, Port Clinton, Ohio
43452.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.  This Chapter is not intended to
repeal any existing ordinances including subdivision regulations, zoning or
building codes. In the event of a conflict between this Chapter and any other
ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. This Chapter shall not
impair any deed restriction, covenant or easement but the land subject to such
interests shall also be governed by the provisions of this Chapter.
   (h)   Interpretation.  In the interpretation and application of this
Chapter, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.  Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.  The degree of flood protection
required by this Chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and
is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and
will occur on rare occasions.  Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. This Chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. This Chapter shall not create liability on the part
of the City of Port Clinton, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on
this Chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (j)   Severability.  Should any section or provision of this Chapter be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the chapter as a whole, or any part thereof other
than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 06-15.  Passed 4-14-15.)
1313.02  DEFINITIONS.

paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials.
   (g)   Enclosure Below the Lowest Floor:
See "Lowest Floor."
   (h)   Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management):
Issued by President Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally
assisted activities be conducted in or have the potential to affect identified
special flood hazard areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA):
The agency with the overall responsibility for administering the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (j)   Fill:
      A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   Flood or Flooding:
A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally
dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM):
Usually the initial map, produced by the Federal Emergency Management Agency,
or U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, for a community depicting
approximate special flood hazard areas.
   (m)   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM):

Department of Housing and Urban Development has delineated the areas of special
flood hazard.
   (n)   Flood Insurance Risk Zones:
Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that indicate the magnitude of the flood
hazard in speciftc areas of a community. Following are the zone definitions:
Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; base flood
elevations are not determined.
Zones A1-30 and Zone AE: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; base flood elevations are determined.
Zone AO:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; with
flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain); average
depths are determined.
Zone AH: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; flood
depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood elevations are
determined.
Zone A99: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood to be
protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection system under
construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
Zone Band Zone X (shaded): Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject to the 100-
year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with contributing
drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by levees from the

Zone C and Zone X (unshaded): Areas determined to be outside the 500-year
floodplain.
   (o)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS):
The official report in which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or the
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has provided flood profiles,
floodway boundaries (sometimes shown on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and
the water surface elevations of the base flood.
   (p)   Flood Protection Elevation:
The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE, is the base flood elevation plus 2 feet
of freeboard. In areas where no base flood elevations exist from any
authoritative source, the flood protection elevation can be historical flood
elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the
floodplain administrator.
   (q)   Floodway:
A flood way is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent
land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood discharge. A
floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and hydrologic engineering
analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water surface elevation of
the base flood discharge is no more than a designated height.  In no case shall
the designated height be more than one foot at any point within the community.
The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized by
any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
   (r)   Freeboard:
A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for the
purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate for the many
unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height
calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave
action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the hydrologic
effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   Historic structure:
      Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by the City of Port Clinton's historic preservation program, which program is
certified by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis:
An analysis performed by a professional engineer, registered in the State of
Ohio, in accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA,
used to detenmine flood elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC):
A Letter of Map Change is an official FEMA determination, by letter, to amend
or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway
Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs are broken down into the following
categories:
Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA)
A revision based on technical data showing that a property was incorrectly
included in a designated special flood hazard area. A LOMA amends the current
effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and establishes that a specific property is
not located in a special flood hazard area.
Letter of Map Revision (LOMR)
A revision based on technical data that, usually due to manmade changes, shows
changes to flood zones, flood elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations,
and planimetric features. One common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination
concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the
base flood elevation and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard
area.
Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR)
A formal review and comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies
with the minimum National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management
criteria. A CLOMR does not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps,
Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)   Lowest floor:
The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) of a
structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure below the lowest floor" which
is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely for parking of
vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a basement area,
provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the applicable design
requirements specified in this Chapter for enclosures below the lowest floor.
   (w)   Manufactured home:
A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a
permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent
foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured
home'' does not include a "recreational vehicle." For the purposes of this
Chapter, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes and mobile homes as
defined in Chapter 3781.06 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (x)   Manufactured home park:
As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code 3701-27-01, a manufactured home
park means any tract of land upon which three or more manufactured homes, used
for habitation, are parked, either free of charge or for revenue purposes, and
includes any roadway, building, structure, vehicle, or enclosure used or
intended for use as part of the facilities of the park. A tract of land that 
is subdivided and the individual lots are not for rent or rented, but are for
sale or sold for the purpose of installation of manufactured homes on the lots,
is not a manufactured home park, even though three or more manufactured homes
are parked thereon, if the roadways are dedicated to the local government
authority.
   (y)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP):
The NFIP is a Federal program enabling property owners in participating
communities to purchase insurance protection against losses from flooding. This
insurance is designed to provide an insurance alternative to disaster
assistance to meet the escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and
their contents caused by floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an
agreement between local communities and the Federal government that states if a

and floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:

the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
this Chapter.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
bonndary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
 1313.05 Appeals and Variances.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations.  Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc.
After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process.
These measures include issuing press releases, public service announcements,
and  other public information materials related to the floodplain development
permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal,
state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations;
providing owners of damaged structures materials and other information related
to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and
assist owners of substantially damaged structures with Increased Cost of
Compliance insurance claims.

the banks shall be established by a field determination of the "bankfull
stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department ofNatural Resources, Division of Soil and Water Resources, must
be notified prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of
such notification must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the
City of Port Clinton specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an
agreement is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain
development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1313.03(j)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.

1313.05  APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)   Appeals Board Established.

granted a hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such
person shall file, within 15 days of the date of such notice and order, or
other official action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for
the mitigation of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain
Administrator's decision. Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the
applicant, and be filed with the Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the
appeal, the Floodplain Administrator shall transmit said notice and all
pertinent information on which the Floodpiain Administrator's decision was made
to the Appeals Board. Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board
shall fix a reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties
in interest, and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is
submitted.
   (d)   Variances.  Any person believing that the use and development
standards of this Chapter would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of this
Chapter, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary to
the public interest where, owing to special conditions of the lot or parcel, a
literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would result in
unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a Variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name; address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
      (2)   Notice for Public Hearing.  The Appeals Board shall schedule and
hold a public hearing within thirty (30) days after the receipt of an
application for a variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the
hearing, a notice of such hearing shall be given in one (1) or more newspapers
of general circulation in the community at least ten (10) days before the date
of the hearing,
      (3)   Public Hearing.  At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations, and the following factors:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and Emergency vehicles.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges. Variances shall only be issued upon:
            1.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
            2.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the
property.  Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of this
Chapter does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
            3.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in this Chapter;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
            4.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
            5.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of this Chapter, the
Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances; as it
deems necessary to further the purposes of this Chapter.
      (4)   Other Conditions for Variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated flood way if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section 
1313.05(d)(3)A. to K. have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be. permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The Administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court.  Those aggrieved by the final decision of the
Appeals Board may appeal such decision to the Ottawa County Court of Common
Pleas, as provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.

applications approved by the Floodplain Administrator authorize only the use,

community. In conducting its review, the Board shall make examination of and
give consideration to the elements of the application including, but not
necessarily limited to:
      (1)    Height.
      (2)    Building massing, which shall include the relationship of the
building width to its height and depth, and its relationship to the viewer's
and pedestrian's visual perspective;
      (3)    Window treatment, which shall include the size, shape and
materials of the individual window units and the overall harmonious
relationship of window openings;
      (4)    Exterior detail and relationships, which shall include all
projection and receding elements of the exterior, including but not limited to,
porches and overhangs and the horizontal or vertical expression which is
conveyed by these elements;
      (5)    Roof shape and materials which shall include type, form and
materials;
      (6)    Materials, texture and color, which shall include a consideration
of material compatibility among various elements of the structure;
      (7)    Compatibility of design and materials, which shall include the
appropriateness of the use of exterior design details;
      (8)    Landscape design and plant materials, which shall include, in
addition to requirements of the zoning code, lighting and the use of landscape
details to highlight architectural features or screen or soften undesirable
view.
      (9)    Signage, which shall include, in addition to the requirements of
Chapter
1147, the appropriateness of signage to the building.
      (10)    Sustainable Features, which shall include environmentally
friendly details and conservation practices such as solar energy panels, bike
racks and rain barrels.
   (b)    The Board shall also give consideration to the United States
Secretary of the Interior
Standards for Rehabilitation. The Standards are to be applied to specific
rehabilitation projects in a reasonable manner, taking into consideration
economic arid technical feasibility.
The Standards for Rehabilitation are as follows:
      (1)    A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in
a new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the
building and its site and environment.
      (2)    The historic character of a property shall be retained and
preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and
spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided.
      (3)    Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its
time, place and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical
development, such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from
other buildings, shall not be undertaken.
      (4)   Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired
historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved.
      (5)    Distinctive features, finishes and construction techniques or
examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property shall be preserved.
      (6)    Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than
replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a
distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color,
texture, and other visual qualities, and where possible, materials. Replacement
of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical; or
pictorial evidence.
      (7)    Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause
damage to historic materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of
structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means
possible.
      (8)    Significant archeological resources affected by a project shall be
protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation
measures shall be undertaken.
      (9)    New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction
shall not destroy historic materials that characterized the property. The new
work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the
massing, size, scale and architectural features to protect the historic
integrity of the property and its environment.
      (10)   New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be
undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the feature, the essential form
and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.
   (c)    In conducting its inquiry and review, the Board may request from the
applicant additional information, sketches and data as it shall reasonably
require. It may call upon experts and specialist for testimony and opinion
regarding the matters under examination. It may recommend to the applicant
changes in the plans that it considers desirable and may accept a voluntary
amendment to the application to include or reflect such changes. The Board
shall keep a record of its proceedings and shall append to the application
copies of information, sketches and data needed to clearly describe any
amendment to it.
   (d)    When its review is concluded, the Board will determine by a vote of
its members whether the application for certificate of appropriateness shall be
approved. If approved by three (3) or more of its members, the Board shall
return the application and appended material to the Secretary with the
instruction that the certificate of appropriateness be issued, provided all
other requirements for a building permit and zoning permit, if applicable, are
met. A copy of the certificate of appropriateness shall be issued to the
applicant and a copy delivered to the Zoning Inspector.
   The certificate of appropriateness shall be valid for five years from the
date of approval, or such extension as may be granted by the Board. If not
approved, the Board shall return the application and appended material to the
applicant with a detailed explanation of all rationale utilized by the Board
regarding the reason for disapproval.
   (e)   The Board may waive compliance with this Chapter upon a finding that a
substantial hardship would be imposed on the property owner if the property
owner is required to substantially comply with the requirements of the Chapter.
The Board may issue a waiver conditioned upon the applicant's performance of
reasonable conditions imposed by the Board to carry out the purposes of this
Chapter as reasonably practicable.

   The chapter is strictly limited to the establishment of minimum standards
for the maintenance of exterior surfaces and exterior functioning units of all
agricultural, commercial, industrial, manufacturing, and residential
structures, buildings and uses within the City, including yard areas
immediately contiguous thereto. No provision of this chapter shall, in any way,
directly or indirectly, be interpreted to interfere with, or to limit the right
of any owner or resident to inhabit real property owned or leased by them in
such manner and form as they may determine appropriate, consistent with other
applicable provisions of law. This chapter is directed to obvious visual
problems which are likely to lead to a blighting or deteriorating influence on
neighboring properties, or which will impair or adversely affect the value of
neighboring properties, or conditions within the City. All matters of the
interior use, occupancy or habitation of any structure or building within the
City are specifically excluded from the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 30-08.  Passed 11-25-08.)
1327.03  PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to protect the public health, safety and
welfare by establishing minimum standards governing the maintenance and
exterior condition of structures  in such condition as will not constitute a
blighting or deteriorating influence on the neighborhood and the community; to
fix responsibilities and duties upon the owners and occupants of structures
with respect to repair and maintenance; to establish enforcement procedures;
and to fix penalties for violations. This chapter is hereby declared to be
remedial and essential for the public interest, and it is intended that this
chapter be construed and interpreted to effectuate the purposes stated herein. 
(Ord. 30-08.  Passed 11-25-08.)
1327.04  APPLICABILITY.
   Every property, building, or structure will comply with the provision of
this chapter, whether or not such building or structure shall have been
constructed, altered or repaired before or after the enactment of this chapter,
and without regard to any permits or licenses which shall have been issued for
the use or occupancy of the building premises, for the construction or repair
of the building or use, or for the installation or repair of equipment or
facilities prior to the effective date of this chapter. This chapter
establishes minimum standards for the initial and continued use of all such
structures and does not replace or modify standards otherwise established for
the construction, repair, alteration, or use of the building.
(Ord. 30-08.  Passed 11-25-08.)
1327.05  CONFLICT OF LAWS.
   In any case where a provision of this chapter imposes a higher standard than
that set forth in any other ordinance by the City or law of the State, then the
standard set forth herein shall prevail, but if a provision of this chapter
imposes a lower standard than that imposed by any other ordinance of the City
or law of the State, then the higher standard contained in any such other
ordinance or law shall prevail.

conditions.
      (2)    Notice shall be served by being delivered personally, or by
certified mail with return receipt requested, to the owner of the property
appearing on the current record of the County Auditor and/or to the last known
address of the tenant to be served. Notice may also be served by leaving a copy

required in section (b) any person affected by the notice may request a hearing
thereon before the Board of Zoning Appeals by filing a written request with the
Property Maintenance Officer or his designee. The Property Maintenance Officer
or his designee shall forward such request to the Board within five (5)
business days of receipt. The Chairperson of the Board, upon receipt of the

these administrative proceedings.

determining appropriate action to be taken, to wit:
         A.    That any modification of the original order of the Property

alter the standards of this chapter and shall not affect detrimentally the
health, safety or welfare of the occupants or owners of adjacent premises or of
the immediate neighborhood; and
         B.    That strict enforcement would constitute an undue and
unnecessary hardship on the owner, manager or resident by reason of compelling
an expenditure for repair of the premises which would be substantially
disproportionate to any benefit to the health, safety or welfare of the City
that might be derived there from.
      (3)    No license or permit or other certification of compliance with
this chapter shall constitute a defense against any violation of any other
local ordinance applicable to any structure or premises, nor shall any
provision herein relieve any owner, manager or resident from complying with any
such other provision, nor any official or the City from enforcing any such
provision.

express provisions of this Code.

purpose of making an exterior inspection, the Property Maintenance Officer may
apply for and obtain a search warrant pursuant to constitutional guidelines in

   (c)    Nothing contained in this section shall limit the right of immediate

guilty of a minor misdemeanor on a first offense. A separate offense shall be
committed each day on which a violation occurs or continues. If the offender,
