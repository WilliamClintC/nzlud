   The inhabitants of the City of Goldsboro, within the corporate limits
as now or hereafter established shall be and continue as they have heretofore
been a municipal body politic and corporate, under the name of the City of
Goldsboro. The City of Goldsboro shall have all the powers, duties, rights,
privileges, and immunities conferred and imposed on cities by the
Constitution, by the general laws of the State of North Carolina and by this
charter. The enumeration of particular powers by the charter shall not be
deemed to be exclusive, and it is intended that the City of Goldsboro shall

the corporate limits as the same may exist as of the effective date of this
charter. The city engineer shall also prepare a written description of the
corporate limits as shown on said map to be designated "Description of
Goldsboro Corporate Limits." Said map and description shall be retained
permanently in the office of the city clerk as the official map and a
description of the corporate limits of the city.



Immediately upon alteration of the corporate limits made pursuant to law from
time to time the city engineer shall indicate such alteration by making
appropriate changes and/or additions to said official map and description.
Photographic types or other copies of said official map or description
certified as by law provided for the certification of ordinances shall be
admitted in evidence in all courts and shall have the same force and effect
as would the official map or description.



   (b)   The city clerk shall require the redrawing of the official map
and the rewriting of the official description as may from time to time be

on which shall be entered a brief description of each lot or parcel of land
assessed, the amount assessed against each lot, the name or names of the

that a map of the improvements on which is shown the frontage and location of
each affected lot, together with the amount assessed against each lot and the
name or names of the owner or owners thereof as far as the same can be
ascertained, shall be a sufficient assessment roll. If the resolution
directed the making of more. than one improvement, a single preliminary
assessment roll for all the improvements authorized by such resolution shall
be sufficient, but the cost of each improvement to each lot affected shall be
shown separately. After the preliminary assessment roll has been completed,
it shall be filed in the office of the city clerk, and there shall be
published in some newspaper of general circulation in the city which is
qualified to carry legal notices, or if there be no such newspaper, the city
clerk shall cause to be posted in three (3) public places in the city a
notice of the completion of the assessment roll, setting forth a description
in general terms of the improvements, and stating the time fixed for the
meeting of the council for the hearing of objections to the special
assessments, such meeting to be not earlier than ten (10) days after the
first publication or from the date of posting of said notice. Any number of
assessment rolls may be included in one notice. In any case where the
preliminary notice was served or mailed instead of being published, this
notice need not be published or posted but may be served or mailed. The
serving or mailing of notices shall be completed not less than five (5) days
prior to the date fixed for the hearing of the assessment roll, and the
return of the person serving or mailing the same shall, in the absence of
fraud, be conclusive that the same were served or mailed.

relation thereto. Then or thereafter, the council shall either annul or
sustain or modify in whole or in part the assessment, either by confirming
the preliminary assessment against any or all lots or parcels described
thereon, or by canceling, increasing or reducing the same. If any property is
omitted from the preliminary roll, the council may place it on the roll and
levy the proper assessment. The council may thereupon confirm the assessment
roll. Whenever the governing body shall confirm assessments for local
improvements, the city clerk shall enter on the council minutes and on the
assessment roll the date, hour and minute of confirmation, and from the time
of confirmation the assessment shall be a lien on the property assessed of
the same nature and to the same extent as county and city taxes and shall be
superior to all other liens and encumbrances. After the assessment roll is
confirmed, a copy of the same shall be delivered to the city tax collector.

assessment, he may, within ten (10) days after the confirmation of the
assessment roll, give written notice to the council that he takes an appeal
to the superior court of Wayne County, in which case he shall within twenty
(20) days after the confirmation of the assessment roll serve on the mayor or
city clerk a statement of facts upon which he bases his appeal. The appeal
shall be tried as other actions at law. The remedy herein provided for any
person dissatisfied with the amount of the assessment against any property of
which he is the owner or in which he is interested shall be exclusive.

newspaper, the city clerk shall cause to be posted at three (3) public places
in the city a notice referring to the assessment roll in which the error was
made, naming the owner or owners of the lot or parcel of land affected by the
error if the same can be ascertained, and naming the time and place fixed for
a hearing by the council for the correction of the error, such meeting not to

posting of the notice. At the time fixed in the notice or at some subsequent
time to which the council may adjourn, the council, after giving the owner or
owners of the property affected and other persons interested therein an
opportunity to be heard, may proceed to correct the error, and the assessment
then made shall have the same force and effect as if it had originally been
properly made. No notice and hearing shall be necessary if the correction
does not increase an assessment against any property not owned by the city,

Sec. 10.15.  REASSESSMENT.



   The council shall have the power, when in its judgment there is any
irregularity, omission, error or lack of jurisdiction in any of the
proceedings relating thereto, to set aside the whole of the local assessment
made by it and thereupon to make a reassessment. In such case there shall be
included, as a part of the cost of the improvements involved, all interest
paid or accrued on notes or certificates of indebtedness or bonds issued by
the city to pay the expenses of such improvement. The proceeding shall, as
far as practicable, be in all respects as in the case of original
assessments, and the reassessment shall have the same force as if it had
originally been properly made.

Sec. 10.16.  PUBLICATION OF NOTICE OF CONFIRMATION OF ASSESSMENT ROLL.



   After the expiration of twenty (20) days from the confirmation of the
assessment roll, the city clerk shall cause to be published one time in some
newspaper of general circulation in the city which is qualified to carry
legal notices, or if there be no such newspaper, shall cause to be posted at
three (3) public places in the city a notice of confirmation of the
assessment roll, and that assessments may be paid at any time before the
expiration of thirty (30) days from the date of publication or posting of the
notice without interest from the date of confirmation of the assessment roll,
but that if such assessment is not paid in full within said time, all
installments thereof shall bear interest at the rate of six per cent (6%) per
annum from the date of confirmation of the assessment roll.



('70 Code, Charter Sec. 10.16)



Sec. 10.17.  PAYMENT OF ASSESSMENTS IN CASH OR BY INSTALLMENTS.



   The property owner assessed shall have the option of paying for
improvements in cash or in not less than two (2) or more than five (5) equal
annual installments as may have been determined in the resolution ordering
the improvements. If paid in installments, installments shall bear interest
at the rate of eight per cent (8%) per annum from the date of confirmation of
the assessment roll. If any assessment is not paid in cash, the first
installment with interest shall become due and payable thirty (30) days after
the publication or posting of the notice of confirmation, and one subsequent
installment and interest shall be due and payable on the same day of the same
month in each successive year until the assessment is paid in full; provided,
however, that if the council shall so direct installments shall become due
and payable on the same date when property taxes of the city are due and
payable. If any installment with interest is not paid when due, it shall be
subject to the same penalties as are now prescribed by law for unpaid taxes,
in addition to the interest herein provided for. The whole assessment may be
paid at any time by the payment of the full amount due with accrued interest.

Sec. 10.18.  PROCEDURE TO ENFORCE PAYMENT; MANDAMUS AGAINST RAILROADS AND
STATE AGENCIES; FORECLOSURE AGAINST INDIVIDUALS.



   Upon the failure of any property owner to pay any installment when due
and payable, all of the installments remaining unpaid shall immediately
become due and payable, and property and rights-of-way may be sold by the
city under the same rules, regulations, rights of redemption and savings as
are now prescribed by law for the sale of land for unpaid taxes.  Collection
of assessments with interest and penalties may also be made by the city by
proceedings to foreclose the lien of assessments as a lien for mortgages is
or may be foreclosed under the laws of the state, and it shall be lawful to
join in any bill for foreclosure any one or more lot or parcels of land, by
whomsoever owned, if assessed for an improvement ordered by the same
resolution, after default in the payment of any installment. The payment of
said installment, together with interest and penalties due thereon and any
advertising and legal costs already incurred, before the lot or parcel of
land against which the same is a lien is sold or said lien is foreclosed,
shall bar the right of the city to sell land or to foreclose the lien by
reason of default.

Sec. 10.19.  ASSESSMENT OF COST OF WATER MAIN AND SEWER EXTENSIONS.



   If the resolution ordering the making of any improvement or
improvements included a provision far any necessary extension of a water main
or sewer or sewers beyond the limit of a street or streets, at such time
after the completion of said extension or extensions, as in the judgment of
the council circumstances justify the assessment of the cost thereof, the
council shall cause a preliminary assessment to be made, and the procedure
thereafter to be followed with respect to such assessment and the force and
effect thereof shall be as already prescribed for other assessments.

   In any case where one or more special assessments have been made, and
property has been or is about to be subdivided, and it is desirable that the
assessments be apportioned among the subdivisions of such property, the
council may, upon application by the owner or owners, apportion the
assessments among the subdivisions. Thereafter, each subdivision shall be
relieved of any part of the original assessment except the part apportioned
to the subdivision, and the part of the original assessment apportioned to
any subdivision shall be of the same force and effect as the original
assessment.

   No change of ownership of any property or interests therein after the
passage of a resolution ordering the making of a local improvement shall

   (a)   Determination by council; effect. The city council may provide
by resolution that the collection of assessments levied against abutting lots
or parcels of land for water main improvements or sanitary sewer
improvements, when in its opinion such improvements may not presently be used
by the owner or owners of the abutting lots or parcels of land, may be held
in abeyance without the payment of any interest thereon until such time as
the council shall determine that any such assessments shall be paid in
accordance with the terms set out in the confirming resolution. The
collection of some part of the assessments levied for the improvements herein
set out on a street or streets or portion thereof may be held in abeyance as
herein provided without holding the collection of all of said assessments in
abeyance.



   (b)   Statutes of limitations suspended. All statutes of limitations
are hereby suspended during the time that the collection of any assessment is
held in abeyance without the payment of interest as provided in subsection

are made adjacent to any lands outside the city limits, the city council may
upon the completion of such local improvements levy assessments against the
abutting property in the same manner as if such abutting property were within
the city limits and delay the collection of part or all of such assessments
without any interest until the city limits are extended to include such
abutting property, or the council may provide that no water or sewer service
connections shall be made to such property, pending she annexation thereof,
until all assessments thereon are paid. Upon annexation, if not paid prior
thereto, the council may proceed to collect the assessments for such
property. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to prohibit or
restrict the city council and a property owner from entering into an
agreement for payments in lieu of assessments.



   (b)   Statutes of limitations suspended. All statutes of limitations
are hereby suspended during the time that the collection of any assessment is

adoption of a resolution by the council determining that such assessment
shall be paid in accordance with the original resolution confirming it.

   Whenever, in the opinion of the city council, it is for the best
interest of the city that any street should be widened or extended, or both,
or that a new street should be opened, the council may pass an ordinance
declaring that such street should be widened or extended, or both, or that
such new street should be opened, and shall lay out in the ordinance the
lines within which such street should be widened, extended or opened. If any
street under the provisions of such ordinance is to be widened, it need not
be widened on both sides; and if it is to be widened on both sides, the
distance to be widened on both sides need not be the same. Any ordinance
introduced for the purpose of widening, extending, or opening any street
under the provisions of this charter may not be adopted until the proposed
ordinance is published in a newspaper of general circulation in the city and
qualified to carry legal notices at least two (2) times on separate days at
least ten (10) days before the passage of the ordinance, or if there be no
such newspaper, posted in three (3) public places in the city. There shall be

   After the passage of such ordinance, it shall be unlawful for any land
within the proposed street lines established by such ordinance to be built
upon or improved or for any part of any existing building within said lines
to be repaired or otherwise improved until the city shall have first been
given an opportunity to purchase or otherwise acquire said property for
street purposes as provided in this charter. To that end, any person
proposing to build upon such land or to make repairs or improvements to that
part of any existing building situated thereon shall, in writing, notify the
city council of the nature and estimated cost of such building, repairs or
improvements. The council shall then determine whether it will take the
necessary steps to acquire said land prior to the construction of said
building or the making of such repairs or improvements, and if it fails
within sixty (60) days from date of receipt of said notice to acquire, or to
institute condemnation proceedings to acquire, said property, the owner or
other person giving such notice may proceed to erect the building in
accordance with the ordinances and regulations of the city or to make the
repairs or improvements described in said notice.

opportunity to acquire said land free from said improvements, as provided in
the preceding section, the city shall not be required to pay for the value of

condemned lies within the limits of an improvement directed in said
proceedings, then the amount paid by the city for the land purchased or
condemned, together with the cost of the condemnation proceeding and interest
on said amount paid and costs at the rate of six per cent (6%) per annum from
the date of payment, shall be included in the cost of said improvement and

after receiving notice that the same is to be built upon or that a building
thereon is to be repaired or otherwise improved, or its failure within said
time to institute proceedings to condemn the same, shall not limit the right
of the city at any subsequent time to condemn the same; but in such case, the
owner shall be entitled to compensation as now provided by law for the
building, repairs or improvements made after the giving of the required
notice and the failure of the city to acquire said land free of said

provide advice to the city council from a citizen perspective.

at the fee shown in § 50.08(E).



   (F)   A return service fee may be assessed for bins that were not
serviced on the original route due to citizens failure to comply with bin
placement ordinance found in divisions (C) - (E). The return service will be

and only city-issued bins will be serviced. If the bin is in the back yard of
a fenced-in area, the fence shall be unlocked and all dogs, regardless of
temperament or size, shall be restrained. A medical waiver may be granted to
a citizen so that they may receive the premium side yard service at basic
service rates. Fees are shown in section § 50.08(E).

GENERAL PROVISIONS



§ 51.001  PURPOSE AND POLICY.



   (A)   This chapter sets forth uniform requirements for direct and
indirect contributors into the wastewater collection and treatment system for
the city of Goldsboro, hereafter referred to as the city, and enables the

municipal wastewater system which will interfere with the operation of the
system or contaminate the resulting sludge;



      (2)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the
municipal wastewater system which will pass through the system, inadequately
treated, into receiving waters or the atmosphere or otherwise be incompatible
with the system;



      (3)   To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim
wastewaters and sludges from the system;



      (4)   To protect both municipal personnel who may come into
contact with sewage, sludge, and effluent in the course of their employment
as well as protecting the general public;



      (5)   To provide for equitable distribution of the cost of
operation, maintenance and improvement of the municipal wastewater system; and



      (6)   To ensure the municipality complies with its NPDES or
non-discharge permit conditions, sludge use and disposal requirements and any
other federal or state laws which the municipal wastewater system is subject
to;



      (7)   To aid in the prevention of wastewater collection system
blockages and obstructions and resulting sanitary sewer overflows from
contributions and accumulation of fats, oils, and greases into the municipal
wastewater system from industrial or commercial establishments, particularly
food preparation and serving facilities.



   (C)   This regulation provides for the regulation of direct and
indirect contributors to the municipal wastewater system, through the
issuance of permits to certain non-domestic users and through enforcement of
general requirements for the other users, authorizes monitoring and
enforcement activities, requires user reporting and provides for the setting
of fees for the equitable distribution of costs-resulting from the program
established herein.



   (D)   This regulation shall apply to all users of the city of
Goldsboro's wastewater collection and treatment system and to persons outside
the city, who are, by permit or agreement with the city, users of the city
POTW.  Except as otherwise provided herein, the Public Utilities Director
shall administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of this regulation. 
Any powers granted to or imposed upon the POTW Director may be delegated by
the POTW Director to other city personnel.  By discharging wastewater into
the municipal wastewater system, industrial users located beyond  the city
limits agree to comply with the terms and conditions established in this
regulation, as well as any permits or orders issued hereunder.

Director.



(Ord. 1994-79, passed 11-21-94)



§ 51.017  PRETREATMENT OF WASTEWATER.



   (A)   Pretreatment facilities.  Users shall provide wastewater
treatment as necessary to comply with this chapter and wastewater permits
issued under § 51.051 and shall achieve compliance with all National
categorical pretreatment standards, local limits, and the prohibitions set
out in § 51.010 within the time limitations as specified by EPA, the state,
or the POTW Director, whichever is more stringent.  Any facilities necessary
for compliance shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's
expense.  Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating
procedures shall be submitted to the city for review and shall be approved by
the POTW Director before construction of the facility. The review of such
plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the user from the
responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent
acceptable to the city under the provisions of this chapter.  Any subsequent
changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be
reported to and be approved by the POTW Director prior to the user's
initiation of the changes.



   (B)   Additional pretreatment measures.



      (1)   Whenever deemed necessary, the POTW Director may require
users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that
specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate
domestic sewage wastestreams from industrial wastestreams, and such other
conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine the user's
compliance with the requirements of this chapter.



      (2)   The POTW Director may require any person discharging
into the POTW to install and maintain, on their property and at their
expense, a suitable storage and flow control facility to ensure equalization
of flow.  A wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for flow
equalization.



      (3)   Sand interceptors shall be installed when, in the
opinion of the Building Inspector, they are necessary for the proper handling
of wastewater containing excessive amounts of sand; except that such
interceptors shall not be required for residential users.  All sand
interception units shall be of type and capacity approved by the Building
Inspector and shall be so located to be easily accessible for cleaning and
inspection.  Such interceptors shall be installed, inspected, cleaned, and
repaired regularly, as needed, by the user at their expense.



      (4)   Users with the potential to discharge flammable
substances may be required to install and maintain an approved combustible
gas detection meter.

§ 51.018  GREASE TRAP PROGRAM.



   (A)   Grease, fats and oil interceptors shall be installed and
maintained by users operating food cooking establishments. Grease
interceptors may also be required in food non-cooking establishments and
other industrial or non-domestic users when, in the opinion of the Building
Inspector, they are necessary for the proper handling of wastewater
containing excessive amounts of grease, fats, and oils; except that such
interceptors shall not be required for residential users. Interceptors shall
be installed and maintained at the user’s expense. If no grease is found
through investigation by the City Inspector(s) at a food establishment, a
grease trap may not be required.



   (B)   No user shall allow any wastewater discharge concentration
from the interceptor to exceed 325 milligrams per liter (EPA Method 1664) or
275 milligrams per liter (EPA Method 413) in fats, oils, and greases. These
limits shall be consistently maintained.



   (C)   All interception units shall be of type and capacity approved
by the Building Inspector and shall be so located to be easily accessible for
cleaning, inspection, and wastewater effluent sampling. Such interceptors
shall be inspected, cleaned of grease, sludge, debris and the like and
repaired as required in order to maintain minimum design capability of the
grease interceptor, but not less often than every 30 days if grease problems
are found. This maintenance shall be performed by the user at their expense.
The Building Inspector will allow the use of an automatic grease separator
system under the following conditions:



      (1)   A food establishment has physical limitations creating a
hardship condition which prohibits installing a properly sized in-ground
grease trap.



      (2)   The sizing of an automatic grease separator system will
be according to the manufacturer’s specifications.



      (3)   The food establishment manager/staff signs a log
certifying each daily, weekly, and quarterly maintenance of the automatic
grease separator system has been done according to the manufacturer’s
specifications.



   (D)   The POTW Director, in his or her discretion, may grant a
variance to a user as it relates to the required grease trap/interceptor
cleanout requirements based upon certified documentation that the
requirements of this chapter impose an unnecessary or unreasonable burden on
the user. The POTW Director may rescind or modify such variance if the
quantity or concentration of the user’s discharge has changed or causes a
detriment to the city’s sewer collection system.



   (E)   Access manholes, with a minimum diameter of 24 inches shall be
provided over each interceptor chamber and sanitary tee. The access manholes
shall extend at least to finished grade and be designed and maintained to
prevent water inflow and infiltration. The manholes shall also have readily
removable covers to facilitate inspection, grease removal, and wastewater
sampling activities.



   (F)   Minimum design capability of the interceptor must be in
accordance with the North Carolina edition of the International Plumbing Code
and provide for a minimum hydraulic retention time of 24 minutes at actual
peak flow or 12 minutes at the calculated theoretical peak flow rate as
predicted by the Uniform Plumbing Code fixture criteria, between the influent
and effluent baffle with 20% of the total volume of the grease interceptor
being allowed for sludge to settle and accumulate.



   (G)   Grease interceptors that are 50 pounds or larger in size must
be cleaned out commercially. The food establishments that clean their own
small grease traps (less than 50 pounds) shall put the grease in a sealed
container and dispose of it as set forth in state regulations. The grease,
fats and oils removed from a grease interceptor must be put in an appropriate
container and properly disposed of as solid waste or recycled commercially.
The Building Inspection will evaluate and determine the cleaning frequency of
under-the-sink traps. Care must be taken to prevent grease, fats, and oils
from entering the stormwater system or sanitary sewer system. No non-grease
laden sources are allowed to be connected to any sewer line intended for
grease interceptor service.



   (H)   The user shall maintain a written record of interceptor
maintenance for three years. All such records will be available for
inspection by the city at all times. The user shall submit written reports of
such maintenance when requested by the city. The user shall refer to the
Grease Trap User Guidance Manual for information on permitting requirements,
forms, non-compliance fines, and the like.



   (I)   Any user required to install or upgrade a grease interceptor
by the Building Inspector must complete the installation/upgrade of the
grease interceptor within six months after written notification from the
Building Inspector. Adequately sized grease traps shall be required for any
new grease trap installation at new food establishments no prohibited by
space constraints. The size, type, and location of the grease interceptor
shall be approved by the Building Inspector. If an obstruction of a city
sewer main(s) occurs that causes a sanitary sewer overflow and the overflow
can be attributed in part to the user, the user shall be required to install
or upgrade a grease interceptor within 30 days after written notice from the
city. In cases of sanitary sewer overflows, the city shall take appropriate
enforcement actions, as set forth in the city’s industrial pretreatment
enforcement plan and the sewer use ordinance, against the user.



   (J)   Existing undersized grease traps in use at food establishments
will be evaluation on the following:



      (1)   The products sold by the food establishments will be
evaluated by City Inspector(s). The Inspector will be given the discretion to
allow or resize an existing grease trap.



      (2)   An existing undersized grease trap may require an
increased cleaning schedule.



      (3)   All final decisions regarding an undersized grease trap
will be determined by the Chief Building Inspector.

§ 51.019  ACCIDENTAL AND/OR SLUG LOAD DISCHARGES.



   (A)   Accidental spill and/or slug control plans.  At least once,
the POTW Director shall evaluate whether each significant industrial user
needs an accidental discharge/slug control plan. The POTW Director may
require any user to develop, submit for approval, and implement such a plan.
Alternatively, the POTW Director may develop such a plan for any user.



   (B)   All SIU’s are required to notify the POTW immediately of any
changes at its facility affecting the potential for spills and other
accidental discharges, discharges of a non-routine, episode nature, a
non-customary batch discharge, or a slug load. Also see §§ 51.064 and
51.065.



   (C)   An accidental discharge/slug control plan shall address, at a
minimum, the following:



      (1)   Description of discharge practices, including
non-routine batch discharges.



      (2)   Description of stored chemicals;



      (3)   Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW Director
of any accidental or slug discharged as required by § 51.065; and



      (4)   Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental
or slug discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to,
inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of
materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff,
worker training, building or containment structures or equipment, measures
for containing toxic organic pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures
and equipment for emergency response.



      (5)   It is the responsibility of the user to update plans
upon any changes.



   (D)   Hauled wastewater.



      (1)   Septic tank waste may be introduced into the POTW only
at locations designated by the POTW Director, and at such times as are
established by the POTW Director.  Such waste shall not violate §§ 51.010
through 51.018 or any other requirements established by the city. The POTW
Director may require septic tank waste haulers to obtain wastewater discharge
permits.



      (2)   The POTW Director shall require haulers of industrial
waste to obtain wastewater discharge permits. The POTW Director may require
generators of hauled industrial waste to obtain wastewater discharge
permits.  The POTW Director also may prohibit the disposal of hauled
industrial waste. The discharge of hauled industrial waste is subject to all
other requirements of this chapter.



      (3)   Industrial waste haulers may discharge loads only at
locations designated by the POTW Director. No load may be discharged without
prior consent of the POTW Director.  The POTW Director may collect samples
of each hauled load to ensure compliance with applicable standards. The POTW
Director may require the industrial waste hauler to provide a waste analysis
of any load prior to discharge.



      (4)   Industrial waste haulers must provide a waste tracking
form for every load. This form shall include, at a minimum, the name and
address of the industrial waste hauler, permit number, truck identification,
names and addresses of sources of waste, and volume and characteristics of
waste. The form shall identify the type of industry, known or suspected waste
constituents, and whether any wastes are RCRA hazardous wastes.

   (A)   All industrial users of the POTW are subject to industrial
waste surcharges on discharges which exceed the levels stated in § 51.012.



   (B)   The amount of surcharge will be based upon the mass emission
rate (in pounds per day) discharged above the levels listed in § 51.012. The
amount charged per pound of excess will be set forth in the Schedule of
Charges And Fees.



      (1)   The volume of flow used in determining the total
discharge of wastewater for payment of user charges and surcharges shall be
based on the following:



         (a)   Metered water consumption as shown in the records
of meter readings maintained by the city; or



         (b)   If required by the city or at the individual
dischargers option, other flow monitoring  devices which measure  the
actual volume of wastewater discharged to the sewer. Such devices shall be
accessible and safely located, and the measuring system shall be installed in
accordance with plans approved by the city. The metering system shall be
installed and maintained at the users expense according to arrangements that
may be made with the city.



         (c)  Where any user procures all or part of his water
supply from sources other than the city, the user shall install and maintain
at his own expense a flow measuring device of a type approved by the city.



      (2)   The character and concentration of the constituents of
the wastewater used in determining surcharges shall be determined by samples
collected and analyzed by the city. Samples shall be collected in such a
manner as to be representative of the actual discharge and shall be analyzed
using procedures set forth in 40 CFR Part 136.



      (3)   When the quantity of wastewater discharged at any point
exceeds 5% of total daily wastewater flow as measured at the treatment plant,
the user discharging such wastewater shall install and maintain, at his own
expense, a wastewater flow meter and recorder of a type approved by the
Director for the purpose of determining the volume of flow to be charged.
Each separate industrial plant will be considered and assessed individually
even though a User may operate two or more industrial plants on the city of
Goldsboro's sewerage system.

   (A)   The industrial waste of each user discharging same into the
city's WWTP shall be subject to periodic inspection and a determination of
character and concentration of said wastes shall be made semi-annually, or
more often as may be deemed necessary, by the POTW Director or his authorized
assistants.  Sampling to  determine the concentrations will be on a
composite basis.  Grab samples may be used as required to determine short
term characteristics that may be deleterious to the treatment process.



   (B)   Samples shall be collected in such manner as to be
representative of the actual quality of the wastes.  The laboratory methods
used in the examination of said wastes shall be those set forth in the latest
edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, as
published by the American Public Health Association, one copy of which shall
be maintained in the office of the POTW Director for inspection by any
interested parties.



   (C)   The determination of the character and concentration of the
industrial wastes by the POTW Director, or his authorized assistants, shall
be binding as a basis for charges. Industries wishing to have another sample
taken other than at the regular interval may request the POTW Director to
take such a sample.  Costs of such additional sampling and testing shall be
borne by the industry.

51.060(B)(4-6). For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits
established in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR 403.6(c), this report
shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long-term production rate. 
For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed
in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other
measure of operation), this report shall include the user's actual production
during the appropriate sampling period.  All compliance reports must be
signed and certified in accordance with § 51.051(C).

§ 51.063  PERIODIC COMPLIANCE REPORTS.



   (A)   All significant industrial users shall, at a frequency
determined by the POTW Director but in no case less than once every six
months, submit a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants
in the discharge which are limited by pretreatment standards and the measured
or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period.
Sampling and analysis must be performed in accordance with procedure set out
in §§ 51.069 and 51.070. All periodic compliance reports must be signed and
certified in accordance with § 51.051(C).



   (B)   All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's
discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be
properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all
times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working
order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are
unrepresentative of its discharge.



   (C)   If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section
monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the POTW Director,
using the procedures prescribed in § 51.069, the results of this monitoring
shall be included in the report.



   (D)   The Director may impose mass limitations on users which are
using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or
in other cases where the imposition of mass limitations are appropriate. In
such cases, the report required by subparagraph (i) of this paragraph shall
indicate the mass of pollutants regulated by pretreatment standards or
requirements in the effluent of the user.

user shall immediately telephone and notify the POTW Director of the
incident.  This notification shall include the location of the discharge,
type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions
taken by the user.



   (B)   Within five days following such discharge, the user shall,
unless waived by the POTW Director, submit a detailed written report
describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the
user to prevent similar future occurrences.  Such notification shall not
relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may
be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any
other damage to person or property; such notification shall not relieve the
user of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed
pursuant to this chapter.



   (C)   A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin
board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event
of a discharge described in paragraph (A) above. Employers shall ensure that
all employees, who may cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the
emergency notification procedure.



   (D)   All SIUs are required to notify the POTW immediately of any
change in its facility affecting the potential for spills and other

§ 51.068  NOTIFICATION OF DISCHARGE OF HAZARDOUS WASTES.



   (A)   Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall
notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and
state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW
of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste
under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the
hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste
number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user
discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the
POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the
extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an
identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an
estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the
wastestream discharge during the calendar month, and an estimation of the
mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the
following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days
after the discharge commences. Any notification under this subsection need be
submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharge. However,
notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under § 51.064. The
notification requirements in this section does not apply to pollutants
already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under
the self-monitoring requirements of §§ 51.060, 51.062, and 51.063.



   (B)   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of paragraph (A)
above during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15
kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes
as specific in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e).  discharge of more than 15
kilograms of non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any
quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and
261.33(e), requires a one time notification. Subsequent months during which
the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not
require additional notification.



   (C)   In the case of any new regulation under section 3001 of RCRA
identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any
additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the POTW
Director, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste  Division Director, and
state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within
90 days of the effective date of such regulations.



   (D)   In the case of any notification made under this section, the
user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and
toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be
economically practical.



   (E)   This provision-does not create a right to discharge any
substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this chapter, a permit
issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.

§ 51.070  GRAB AND COMPOSITE SAMPLE COLLECTION.



   (A)   All wastewater samples must be representative of the users
discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measuring facilities shall be
properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all
times. The failure of the user to keep its monitoring facility in good
working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results
are unrepresentative of its discharge.



   (B)   Grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil
and grease, sulfide, volatile organic compounds, and any other pollutants as
required by 40 CFR 136. The POTW shall determine the number of grabs
necessary to be representative of the users discharge. See 40 CFR
403.12(g)(5) for additional grab sample numbers requirement for BMR and
90-day compliance reports. Additionally the POTW Director may allow
collection of multiple grabs during a 24-hour period which are composited
prior to analysis as allowed under 40 CFR 136.



   (C)   Composite samples. All wastewater composite samples shall be
collected with a minimum of hourly aliquots or grabs for each hour that there
is a discharge. All wastewater composite samples shall be collected using
flow proportional composite collection techniques, unless time-proportional
composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the POTW Director. When
authorized time-proportional composite or grab, the samples must be
representative and the decision to allow the alternative sampling must be
documented.

retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of
information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this
chapter and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to
monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such
requirements. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time
of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates
analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical
techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records
shall remain available for a period of at least three years. This period
shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning
the user or the city, or where the user has been specifically notified of a
longer retention period by the POTW Director.

COMPLIANCE MONITORING



§ 51.080  MONITORING FACILITIES.



   (A)   The city requires the user to provide and operate at the
user's own expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling, and
flow measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage systems. 
The monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user's premises,
but the city may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue
hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public
street or sidewalk area and located so that it will not be obstructed by
landscaping or parked vehicles.



   (B)   There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or
facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis.
The facility, sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all
times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user.



   (C)   Whether constructed on public or private property, the
sampling and monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the
city's requirements and all applicable local construction standards and
specifications.  Construction shall be completed within 90 days following
written notification by the city.



(Ord. 1994-79, passed 11-21-94)



§ 51.081  INSPECTION AND SAMPLING.



   The city will inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain whether
the purpose of this chapter is being met and all requirements are being
complied with.  Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is created
or discharged shall allow the city approval authority and EPA or their
representative ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of the
premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and
copying, or in the performance of any of their duties. The city approval
authority and EPA shall have the right to set up on the user's property such
devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, inspection, compliance
monitoring and/or metering operations.  Where a user has security measures
in force which would require proper identification and clearance before entry
into their premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with their
security guards so that upon presentation of suitable identification,
personnel from the city, approval authority and EPA will be permitted to
enter, without delay, for the purposes of performing their specific
responsibilities. Denial of the POTW Director's, approval authority's or
EPA's access to the user's premises shall be a violation of this chapter. 
Unreasonable delays may constitute denial of access. The city may make
unannounced inspections at any time when there is activity at the permitted
facility.



(Ord. 1994-79, passed 11-21-94)



§ 51.082  SEARCH WARRANTS.



   If the POTW Director, approval authority, or EPA has been refused
access to a building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is
able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation
of this chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of
a routine inspection and sampling program of the city designed to verify
compliance with this chapter or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to
protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then
the POTW Director, approval authority, or EPA may seek issuance of a search
warrant from the Superior Court of Justice of Wayne County.

   (A)   Information and data on a user obtained from reports,
questionnaires, permit applications, permits and monitoring programs and from
inspections shall be available to the public or other governmental agency
without restriction unless the User specifically requests and is able to
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the POTW Director that the release of such
information would divulge information, processes or methods of production
entitled to protection as trade secrets of the user. Any such request must be
asserted at the time of submission of the information or data.



   (B)   When requested by the person furnishing a report, the portions
of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not
be made available for inspection by the public but shall be made available
upon written request to governmental agencies for uses related to this
regulation, the national pollutant discharge elimination system (NPDES)
permit, Non-discharge permit and/or the pretreatment programs; provided,
however, that such portions of a report shall be available for use by the
state or any state agency in judicial review or enforcement proceedings
involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and
characteristics will not be recognized as confidential information.



   (C)   All records relating to compliance with pretreatment standards
shall be made available to officials of the approval authority and EPA upon
request.

ENFORCEMENT



§ 51.100  ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES.



   The POTW Director is authorized to take action as specified below to
enforce the provisions of these regulations. The actions to be taken under
specific circumstances are as detailed in the pretreatment program
enforcement response plan.  This plan is contained in a separate document
and is as currently approved by the North Carolina Division of Environmental
Management Pretreatment Office.



   (A)   Notification of violation.  Whenever the POTW Director finds
that any industrial user has violated or is violating this regulation,
wastewater permit, or any prohibition, limitation or requirements contained
therein or any other pretreatment requirement the POTW Director may serve
upon such a person a written notice stating the nature of the violation. 
Within 30 days from the date of this notice, an explanation for the violation
and a plan for the satisfactory correction thereof shall be submitted to the
city by the user. Submission of this plan does not relieve the discharger of
liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice
of violation.



   (B)   Consent orders.  The POTW Director is hereby empowered to
enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other
similar documents establishing an agreement with the person responsible for
the noncompliance.  Such orders will include specific action to be taken by
the discharger to correct the noncompliance within a time period also
specified by the order. Consent orders shall have the same force and effect
as an administrative order issued pursuant to § 51.100(D) below.



   (C)   Show cause hearing.



      (1)   The POTW Director may order any industrial user who
causes or is responsible for an unauthorized discharge, has violated this
chapter, or is in noncompliance with a wastewater discharge permit to show
cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken.  In the event
the POTW Director determines that a show cause order should be issued, a
notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the
hearing, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a
request that the user show cause why this proposed enforcement action should
not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by
registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least 10 days
before the hearing. Service may be made on any agent or officer of a
corporation.



      (2)   The POTW Director shall review the evidence presented at
the hearing and determine whether the proposed enforcement action is
appropriate.



      (3)   A show cause hearing under this section is not a
prerequisite to the issuance of an administrative order under § 51.100 or
the assessment of a civil penalty under § 51.101.



   (D)   Administrative orders.  When the POTW Director finds that an
industrial user has violated or continues to violate this regulation, permits
or orders issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment requirement the POTW
Director may issue an order to cease and desist all such violations and
direct those persons in noncompliance to:



      (1)   Immediately comply with all requirements;



      (2)   Comply in accordance with a compliance time schedule set
forth in the order;



      (3)   Take appropriate remedial or preventive action in the
event of a continuing or threatened violation.



      (4)   Disconnect unless adequate treatment facilities,
devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated
within a specified time period.



   Appeals from an administrative order in accordance with this section
shall be as provided in § 51.051(H).



   (E)   Emergency suspensions.



      (1)   The POTW Director may suspend the wastewater treatment
service and/or wastewater permit when such suspension is necessary in order
to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an
imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or
the environment, interferes with the POTW or causes the POTW to violate any
condition of its NPDES or non-discharge permit.



      (2)   Any user notified of a suspension of the wastewater
treatment service and/or the wastewater permit shall immediately stop or
eliminate the contribution. A hearing will be held within 15 days of the
notice of suspension to determine whether the suspension may be lifted or the
user's waste discharge permit terminated. In the event of a failure  to
comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the POTW Director shall take
such steps as deemed necessary including immediate severance of the sewer
connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system or endangerment
to any individuals. The POTW Director shall reinstate the wastewater permit
and the wastewater treatment service upon proof of the elimination of the
non-compliant discharge.  The industrial user shall submit a detailed
written statement describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the
measures taken to prevent any future occurrence to the POTW Director prior to
the date of the above-described hearing.



   (F)   Termination of permit or permission to discharge. The POTW
Director may revoke a wastewater discharge permit or permission to discharge
for good cause, including, but not limited to, the following reasons:



      (1)   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents
and characteristics of his discharge;



      (2)   Failure to report significant changes in operation, or
wastewater constituents and characteristics;



      (3)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for
the purpose of inspection or monitoring; or



      (4)   Violation of conditions of the permit or permission to
discharge, conditions of this chapter or any applicable state and federal
regulations.



   Non-compliant industrial users will be notified of the proposed
termination of their wastewater permit and will be offered an opportunity to
show cause under § 51.100 of this regulation why the proposed action should
not be taken.

County Judicial District may, at the request of the city, prosecute
non-compliant users who violate the provisions of G.S. § 143-215.6B. 
[Note: Under North Carolina law, it is a crime to negligently violate any
term, condition, or requirement of a pretreatment permit, or negligently fail
to apply for a pretreatment permit, issued by local governments (G.S. §
143-215.6B(f)), to knowingly and willfully violate any term, condition, or
requirement of a pretreatment permit, or knowingly and willfully fail to
apply for a pretreatment permit, issued by local governments (G.S. §
143-215.6B(g), to knowingly violate any term, condition, or requirement of a
pretreatment permit issued by local governments, or knowingly fail to apply
for a pretreatment permit, knowing at the time that a person is placed in
imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury, (G.S. § 143-215.6B(h)),
and to falsify information required under G.S. Article 21 of Chapter 143
(G.S. 143-215.6B(i).]



   (B)   Injunctive relief.  Whenever an industrial user is in
violation of the provisions of this regulation or an order or permit issued
hereunder, the POTW Director, through the City Attorney, may petition the
Superior Court of Justice for the issuance of a preliminary or permanent
injunction, or both as may be appropriate, which restrains or compels the
activities in question.  In the event the POTW chooses to correct the
violation itself, the cost of such correction may be added to the next
scheduled sewer service charge payable by the person(s) causing the
violation.  The POTW shall have such remedies for the collection of such
costs as it has for the collection or other sewer service charges.



(Ord. 1994-79, passed 11-21-94)



§ 51.103  OTHER REMEDIES.



   (A)   Water supply severance.  Whenever an industrial user or
establishment is in violation of the provisions of this regulation or an
order or permit issued hereunder, water service to the industrial user may be
severed and service will only recommence, at the  user's expense, after it
has satisfactorily demonstrated consistent compliance.



   (B)   Public nuisances.  Any violation of the prohibitions or
effluent limitations of this regulation or of a permit or order issued
hereunder, is hereby declared a public nuisance and shall be corrected or
abated as directed by the POTW Director. Any person(s) creating a public
nuisance shall be subject to the provisions of the appropriate city code
governing such nuisances, including reimbursing the POTW for any costs
incurred in removing, abating or remedying said nuisance.



(Ord. 1994-79, passed 11-21-94; Am. Ord. 2007-45, passed 6-4-07)



§ 51.104  REMEDIES NONEXCLUSIVE.



   The remedies provided for in this chapter are not exclusive.  The POTW
Director may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a
non-compliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be
in accordance with the city's enforcement response plan.  However, the POTW
Director may take other action against any user when the circumstances
warrant.  Further, the POTW Director is empowered to take more than one
enforcement action against any non-compliant user.



(Ord. 1994-79, passed 11-21-94)



ANNUAL PUBLICATION OF SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE



§ 51.110  ANNUAL PUBLICATION OF SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE.



   At least annually, the POTW Director shall publish in the largest daily
newspaper circulated in the service area, a list of those industrial users
which were found to be in significant noncompliance, also referred to as
reportable noncompliance in 15A NCAC 2H.0903(b)(10), with applicable
pretreatment standards and requirements, during the previous 12 months.

AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS



§ 51.120  UPSET PROVISION.



   (A)   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action
brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the
requirements of subsection (B) below are met.



   (B)   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of
upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating
logs, or other relevant evidence that:



      (1)   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s)
of the upset;



      (2)   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent
and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and
maintenance procedures; and



      (3)   The user has submitted the following information to the
POTW Director within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this
information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within
five days):



         (a)   A description of the indirect discharge and cause
of noncompliance;



         (b)   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates
and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is
expected to continue; and



         (c)   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce,
eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.



      (4)   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to
establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.



      (5)   Users will have the opportunity for a judicial
determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for
noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards.



      (6)   Users shall control production of all discharges to the
extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment
standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until
the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. 
This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the
primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.



(Ord. 1994-79, passed 11-21-94)



§ 51.121  PROHIBITED DISCHARGE STANDARDS DEFENSE.



   A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action
brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in §
51.010(A) or the specific prohibitions in § 51.010(A)(1)(b)(2), (3), and (5)
through (7) if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know,
that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other
sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either:



   (A)   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the
user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the
pass through or interference; or



   (B)   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change
substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when
the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case
of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal
requirements.



(Ord. 1994-79, passed 11-21-94)



§ 51.122  BYPASS.



   (A)   A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause
pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is
for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are
not subject to the provision of subsections (B) and (C) of this section.



   (B)   (1)   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass,
it shall submit prior notice to the POTW Director, at least ten days before
the date of the bypass, if possible.



      (2)   A user shall submit oral notice to the POTW Director of
an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within
24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission
shall also be provided within five days of this time the user becomes aware
of the bypass.  The written submission shall contain a description of the
bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and
times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is
expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent reoccurrence of the bypass.  The POTW Director may waive the written
report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24
hours.



   (C)   (1)   Bypass is prohibited, and the POTW Director may take
an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:



         (a)   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life,
personal injury, or severe property damage;



         (b)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass,
such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated
wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime.  This
condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been
installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a
bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or
preventive maintenance; and



         (c)   The user submitted notices as required under
subsection (B) of this section.



      (2)   The POTW Director may approve an anticipated bypass,
after considering its adverse effects, if the POTW Director determines that
it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (C)(1) of this section.

ENFORCEMENT RESPONSE PLAN



§ 51.130  INTRODUCTION.



   (A)   Federal and state pretreatment regulations, as well as Part
III (B)(6) of the city of Goldsboro's NPDES permit requires the city to take
timely and effective enforcement actions against significant industrial users
(SIUs) for failure to comply with pretreatment standards and requirements.
Federal and state regulations also require each POTW, with an approved
pretreatment program, to develop and implement an enforcement response plan
(ERP). By regulation, this plan must:



      (1)   Describe how the POTW will investigate instances of
noncompliance;



      (2)   Describe the types of escalating enforcement responses
the POTW will take in response to all anticipated types of SIU violations and
the time periods within which responses will take place;



      (3)   Identify the official(s) responsible for each type of
response; and



      (4)   Adequately reflect the POTW's primary responsibility to
enforce all applicable pretreatment requirements and standards.



   (B)   The purpose of the city of Goldsboro's enforcement response
plan is two-fold. First, to ensure compliance with federal and state
regulations.  Second, to ensure that, if and when it is necessary for the
city to enforce pretreatment standards and requirements, all industries are
treated in a fair and equitable manner.



(Ord. 1994-79, passed 11-21-94)



§ 51.131  ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES AVAILABLE TO THE CITY.



   (A)   Sections 51.100 through 51.104 gives the Public Utilities
Director the authority to take a wide variety of enforcement actions.  Each
of these actions can be viewed as having a certain degree of punitiveness.
The city's enforcement response plan will utilize all of the enforcement
tools available to the Director in the system which outlines escalating
enforcement actions dependent on the nature of the violation and the
cooperativeness, or recalcitrance, of the violator.  The following is a list
of remedies authorized by the sewer use ordinance and ordinance citation. 
It is presented in order of punitiveness, least punitive first and most
punitive last.



      (1)   Notice of Violation § 51.100(A)



      (2)   Consent Order § 51.100(B)



      (3)   Administrative Order § 51.100(C)



      (4)   Show Cause Order/Hearing § 51.100(D)



      (5)   Emergency Suspensions (temporary) § 51.100(E)



      (6)   Termination of Permit (permanent) § 51.100(F)



      (7)   Civil Penalties § 51.101(A) and (B)



      (8)   Judicial Remedies § 51.102(A) and (B)



   (B)   In addition to the tools listed above, § 51.100 through
51.104 authorizes the Director to assess civil penalties of up to $1,000.00
per day per violation. Civil penalties are normally used in conjunction with
one of the other eight activities listed above and the punitiveness of the
penalty depends on the dollar amount.



(Ord. 1994-79, passed 11-21-94)



§ 51.132  NONCOMPLIANCE DETERMINATIONS.



   The staff will generally investigate SIU compliance three ways: on site
inspections of the SIU, review of SIU self-monitoring data, and review of
compliance data collected by the city. Using the this chapter, as well as
guidance which has been provided by EPA and the Division of Environmental
Management, the city staff has identified four categories of permit
noncompliance.  Below is a discussion of the types of violations within each
category and the city staff member responsibility for the initial compliance
determination for each violation type.



   (A)   Unpermitted discharges.



      (1)   Unpermitted discharges can result from several
activities. An SIU might fail to obtain a permit prior to discharging to the
wastewater treatment plant. An SIU might discharge to a point in the
collection system which is not identified in the SIU's permit. An SIU might
begin to discharge a pollutant which was previously identified as absent by
the industry. Also, an SIU might continue to discharge when its permit has
expired.



      (2)   Unpermitted discharges will normally be discovered
during the inspection of an industry. The inspector will be responsible for
determining the severity of the violation during his inspection.  The
severity will normally depend on whether the unpermitted discharge poses an
immediate threat to the POTW or the environment and whether the industry was
unaware of the requirements or was seeking to avoid the regulations.



   (B)   Permit noncompliance.  Noncompliance with an SIU's
pretreatment permit falls into four areas: limits violations, monitoring
violations, reporting violations, and violations of permit conditions.



      (1)   Permit limit noncompliance.  Permit limit violations
are fairly straight forward and the severity depends on whether the violation
is considered reportable noncompliance (RNC). RNC is defined in North
Carolina's general pretreatment regulations [15A NCAC 2H.0903(b)(10)].  It
is the Pretreatment Coordinator's responsibility to evaluate compliance with
pretreatment limitations each time data is received and at the end of each
semiannual reporting period.



      (2)   Self-monitoring noncompliance.



         (a)   Noncompliance with monitoring occurs when an SIU
fails to conduct all of the self-monitoring required by its pretreatment
permit. The severity of the violations depends on how much self-monitoring
was actually completed.  If the SIU conducted less than 80% of the sampling
and analyses required in a six-month period, the violation is considered
significant or RNC.



         (b)   Each time a self-monitoring report is received
from an SIU, it is the responsibility of the Pretreatment Coordinator to
compare the report to the permit requirement sand evaluate compliance with
monitoring requirements.



      (3)   Reporting violations.



         (a)   Reporting violations occur when an SIU fails to
provide information which is required by the permit within the time period
stated in the permit or when the information is incomplete or false. Reports
required by the permit can include self- monitoring reports, spill prevention
plans, baseline monitoring reports, 90-day compliance reports, and sludge
handling plans.  In the case of late or incomplete reports, the severity of
the violation depends on the length of time the report is late. If a complete
report is not submitted within 30 days of the due date, the violation is
considered RNC. Knowingly submitting false information is always considered a
significant violation.



         (b)   It is the Pretreatment Coordinator's
responsibility to track the report due dates included in the pretreatment
permits and to evaluate compliance in terms of the tardiness and completeness
of the submission.



      (4)   Violations of other permit conditions.  The
pretreatment permits issued by the city contain about 20 conditions which do
not fall into the category of limits, monitoring, or reporting requirements.
For example, the pretreatment permit prohibits slug loads and requires the
SIU to properly operate its pretreatment facility.  Violations of these
conditions would normally be discovered as part of an inspection or in
conjunction with another enforcement action. The Pretreatment Coordinator is
responsible for evaluating compliance with these requirements and the
severity of the violation is determined by the Director.



   (C)   Violations of enforcement orders.



      (1)   Violations of enforcement orders are actually very
similar to pretreatment permit noncompliance in that they can be broken down
into limits violations (interim limits), monitoring violations (increased
monitoring required by the order), and reporting violations. In addition,
violations of enforcement orders would include missing milestone dates and
noncompliance with final limits once the order has expired.  However, all
violations of enforcement orders, with the exception of interim limits
violations, are considered RNC. Interim limit violations would not be
considered significant if they did not meet the criteria listed in 15A NCAC
2H.0903(b)(10)(A) and if the SIU paid the stipulated penalty assessed.



      (2)   Once an SIU has been put on an enforcement order, the
city's initial response to violations becomes simply a matter of notifying
the SIU of the violation and collecting the stipulated penalty outlined in
the order.  It is the Pretreatment Coordinator's responsibility to track
compliance with the order and notify the Director when penalties should be
assessed. Once the Director is informed of noncompliance with an order, he
will determine whether the violations are so severe as to warrant escalated
enforcement. For example, an escalated enforcement actions would be needed if
it was clear that the SIU could no longer meet the remaining milestone dates
in the existing order.



(Ord. 1994-79, passed 11-21-94)



§ 51.133  RESPONSES TO NONCOMPLIANCE.



   (A)   In order to ensure that the city is taking timely and
effective enforcement actions, two tools will be employed - an enforcement
response guide in subsection (C) and an enforcement flowchart.  The purpose
of the enforcement response guide (ERG) is to identify initial responses and
time frames for each of the types of violations discussed in § 51.132. Once
the enforcement action is taken, the flow chart is used to identify the more
punitive action which would be taken if the SIU failed to return to
compliance as a result of the previous or initial action.



   (B)   As an example of how the ERG and flowchart can be used to
determine appropriate enforcement responses, consider an SIU which submits a
self-monitoring report which shows a violation.  The ERG tells the
Pretreatment Coordinator to issue a notice of noncompliance within 14 days.
The notice will require the SIU to collect additional data to confirm
compliance or noncompliance. The next step is to determine if the SIU is in
reportable noncompliance (RNC) at the end of the six month reporting
period.  As indicated by the flow chart, if the data does not show RNC, no
action is required. If the data does show RNC, a notice of violation (NOV) is
issued.  The ERG tells the Pretreatment Coordinator that, in response to RNC
with permit limits, an NOV assessing a fine of $100 should be sent within 30
days of receiving all of the data.  The NOV requires the SIU to respond by
indicating the cause and time needed to correct the violation. If the time
needed to correct the violation was greater than 90 days, a consent order
would be drafted. Hopefully the SIU would comply with the consent order and
the violation would be resolved. However, if the SIU failed to meet the
compliance date of the consent order, the flow chart indicates that a notice
to comply should be issued and the ERG gives the Pretreatment Coordinator
information on time frames, penalties, and responses which should be included
in the notice to comply. By using the flowchart and ERG, a worst case
scenario can be followed in a similar manner through the issuance and
violation of an administrative order, through a show cause meeting and,
eventually, to termination of service.

§ 52.06  BACKFLOW AND CROSS-CONNECTION CONTROL.



   (A)   Introduction.



      (1)   This regulation shall apply to all users connected to
the City of Goldsboro's public water system.



      (2)   This regulation complies with the Federal Safe Drinking
Water Act (P.L. 93-523), the North Carolina State Administrative Code (Title
15A, Subchapter 8C), and the North Carolina State Building Code (Volume II)
as they pertain to cross connections with the public water supply.



   (B)   Purpose. The purpose of this regulation is:



      (1)   To define the city as the water purveyor in the
elimination of all cross-connections within the public water system;



      (2)   To protect the public water system of the city from the
possibility of contamination or pollution by isolation within the
customers’ internal potable water distribution system(s), or the
customers’ private water system(s), such contaminants or pollutants which
could backflow into the public water system;



      (3)   To promote the elimination or control of existing
cross-connections, actual or potential, direct or indirect, between the
city’s customers' potable water system(s) and non-potable water systems,
plumbing fixtures and industrial piping systems; and



      (4)   To provide a continuing inspection program of
cross-connection control; which will systematically and effectively prevent
potential contamination or pollution of the public water system.



   (C)   Responsibility.  The city endeavors to protect its public
water system from contamination or pollution due to the backflow of
contaminants or pollutants through the water service connection.  If the
city requires an approved backflow prevention assembly to protect the water
distribution system, the city will give notice to the customer to install an
approved backflow prevention assembly(s).  If the assembly(s) is not
installed as required by the city, the water service may be disconnected
until such assembly(s) has been properly installed.



   (D)   Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.



   AIR GAP (AG).  The unobstructed, vertical, physical separation between
the lowest opening from any pipe or faucet supplying water to a tank,
plumbing fixture, or other vessel and the flood level rim of said receiving
vessel.  An approved AIR GAP, shall be at least double the diameter of the
supply pipe, as measured vertically above the overflow rim of the vessel. 
In no case shall the AIR GAP be less than one inch.



   APPROVED. Accepted by the city as meeting an applicable
specification(s) stated or cited in this regulation, or as suitable for the
proposed use.



   AUXILIARY WATER SUPPLY.  Any water supply on or available to the
consumer's premises other than the city's approved public water supply.



   BACKFLOW. The reversal of the normal direction of flow of water caused
by either backpressure or backsiphonage.



   BACKFLOW PREVENTER.  An assembly or means designed to prevent backflow.



   BACKPRESSURE.  Backpressure occurs when the customer's water system
pressure exceeds the water purveyor's system pressure.  This can occur
through an increase in the downstream pressure, a decrease in the water
purveyor's pressure or a combination of both.  Increases in the customer's
water pressure above the water purveyor's pressure can be created by booster
pumps, temperature increases (such as in a boiler), head pressure caused by
elevation and the like.



   BACKSIPHONAGE.  Backflow caused by negative or reduced pressure in the
supply piping. BACKSIPHONAGE occurs when the supply line pressure falls below
atmospheric pressure (14.7 psi). Decreases in the pressure of the potable
water system can be caused by fire fighting, flushing of a water main, a
break in the water main, water mains being shut down for maintenance and the
like.



   CERTIFIED TESTER.  An individual who has demonstrated competency to
test and repair backflow prevention assemblies as required by the city. 
Each person who is certified to make competent test, or to repair, overhaul
and make reports on backflow prevention assemblies shall be knowledgeable of
applicable laws, rules and regulations, shall be a licensed plumber or must
hold a certificate of completion from an approved training program in testing
and repair of backflow prevention assemblies and have at least two years
experience under and be employed by a state licensed plumber.

§ 52.21  DECLARATION OF A WATER SHORTAGE CRISIS.



   (A)   Whenever the Mayor of the city is informed by the City Manager
that either the drinking water supply is limited or that raw water supplies
are below the level necessary to meet normal needs and that serious shortages
exist, the Mayor is empowered to declare by this subchapter that a water
shortage crisis exists.  In addition, the Mayor (or City Manager or his or
her designee) is authorized to call upon all water customers to employ water
shortage crisis measures as outlined in Addendum 3.  These restrictions
shall continue until the emergency is ended by the announcement of
return-to-normal conditions by the city.  Under a water shortage crisis, it
is contingent upon the city to provide for the equitable distribution of
critically-limited water supplies, in order to balance demand and limited
available supplies, and to assure that sufficient water is available to
preserve public health and safety.  In the case of a drought, a Declaration
of Water Shortage Crisis shall be imposed when the level of the Neuse River
at the city's intake structure reaches 49.5 feet MSL and that mandatory
conservation measures have not achieved a 30% water reduction goal.



   (B)   Situations could occur that declaration of a water shortage
crisis is necessary even before the river level reaches 49.5 feet MSL. 
Examples include, but are not limited to:  (1) if the city was informed that
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has significantly reduced the flow from the
Falls Lake Dam and that water supply to the city will be questionable; (2) if
water lines are broken and drinking water is in short supply.  In these
types of situations, the Mayor (or City Manager or his or her designee) is
authorized to call upon all water customers to employ water shortage crisis
measures as outlined in Addendum 3.

§ 52.22  OBJECTIVES OF DECLARATION OF A WATER SHORTAGE CRISIS.



   To meet the objectives of the declaration of a water shortage crisis:



   (A)   It is imperative that water customers achieve an immediate
further reduction in water use in order to extend existing water supplies
and, at the same time, assure that sufficient water is available to preserve
the public health and sanitation and to provide fire protection service.



   (B)   The immediate further reduction in water usage is another step
along a continuum of responses to the present water supply shortage.  Should
shortage continue, further reductions in usage may be required.



   (C)   The plan provides for equitable reductions in water usage and
for equal sacrifice on the part of each water customer. The success of this
subchapter depends on the cooperation of all water customers in the emergency
area.

   (A)   Whenever the Mayor of the city is informed by the City Manager
that raw water supplies are well below the level necessary to meet basic
water needs and that serious shortages exist, the Mayor is empowered to
declare by this subchapter that a water shortage interruption situation
exists.  Under a water shortage interruption situation, it is contingent
upon the city to provide critically-limited water supplies, in order to
preserve public health and safety of its citizens.



   (B)   In addition, the Mayor (or City Manager or his or her
designee) is authorized to call upon all water customers to employ water
shortage interruption measures as outlined in Addendum 4.  These
restrictions shall continue until this phase is ended by the announcement by
the city that water service interruptions conditions no longer exist.



   (C)   If the water shortage crisis indicates that despite
conservation measures in effect, the water supply cannot meet the city's
water consumption, broader water main interruptions may be required which
will affect water users. The following provisions shall govern the
implementation of temporary service interruptions.



      (1)   In order to effectuate compliance with this subchapter,
the city is hereby authorized and required to plan and implement temporary
service interruptions to all or part of its water supply system, as may be
deemed appropriate, when any and/or all of the following conditions are
determined to exist:



         (a)   The mandated reduction in system-wide usage has
not been achieved; and/or



         (b)   The mandated reduction in system-wide water usage
has been achieved, but has failed to have a significant impact in extending
limited water supplies; and/or



         (c)   Temporary service interruptions are necessary in
order to further extend limited and/or dwindling water supplies.



      (2)   In the event it is determined that temporary service
interruptions are necessary, the city shall notify its customers through the
public media (newspapers, radio, and television), at least one day prior to
the temporary service interruptions, that a planned, temporary service
interruption is to be imposed.  Such notice shall:



         (a)   State the day or days when the planned, temporary
service interruption will occur;



         (b)   State the time(s) when such planned, temporary
service interruptions will commence, and the time(s) such interruption will
cease;



         (c)   State whether the planned, temporary service
interruptions are to be imposed on the entire system, or part thereof, and,
if only part(s) of the system will experience planned, temporary service
interruptions, identify geographic boundaries within which such interruptions
will occur; and



         (d)   Advise all customers within the areas affected by
planned, temporary service interruptions how to treat any water received from
the system, for human consumption, during the period(s) of such interruptions
and for such additional time as may be necessary until full pressure is
restored to the system.



      (3)   If a planned, temporary service interruption is imposed
as authorized and required by this subchapter, the city must provide for the
continued delivery of water to health care facilities within the area(s)
affected by such interruptions, by means of any adequate, alternative
delivery measures that may be necessary.



      (4)   If a planned, temporary service interruption is
implemented, the city must make provision, by any means possible, for the
continued delivery of such water as may be necessary for the proper operation
of sewage collection, treatment, and disposal systems and facilities.



      (5)   If a planned, temporary service interruption is
implemented, the city shall impose a temporary moratorium on all new service
connections to the city's water system.

§ 52.28  WATER SHORTAGE RATES.



   Upon the declaration of a water supply shortage as provided in §§
52.17 through 52.27, the governing body of the city shall have the power to
adopt shortage water rates by ordinance designed to conserve water
supplies.  Such rates may provide for, but not be limited to: (a) higher
charges per unit for increasing usage (increasing block rates); (b) extra
charges for use in excess of a specified level (excess demand surcharge).

§ 52.29  RETURN-TO-NORMAL.



   When it is determined that the water shortage has abated, the reverse
order of water conservation stages will be followed until a full
return-to-normal is achieved.  For example, the water shortage crisis phase
will go to a less restrictive mandatory conservation phase, then to a much
less restrictive voluntary conservation phase until a return-to-normal
condition is reached.  It is the city's intent to remain for an adequate
period of time at each water conservation phase to avoid oscillating back and
forth between water shortage phases and the return-to-normal condition.

§ 52.30  PUBLIC COMMENT.



   The city will provide a public comment period to review revisions to
this subchapter.  A public hearing date will be set and advertised at least
ten days prior to the public hearing.  Interested citizens will be provided
with the proposed ordinance revisions by request to the City Clerk.  After
the public hearing comments have been taken into consideration, the City
Council may adopt the revised ordinance.

ADDENDUM 1:  VOLUNTARY CONSERVATION PHASE



   Direct users to adopt the following conservation measures:



   (A)   Take five-minute showers instead of baths.



   (B)   Do not let water run while shaving, brushing teeth, and
rinsing dishes.



   (C)   Keep a bottle of chilled water in the refrigerator for
drinking, so as not to run the tap to get cold water.



   (D)   Only run dishwasher or clothes washing machine when have full
loads.  Washing dishes by hand saves about 25 gallons (don't let tap run).



   (E)   Inspect and repair leaky valves on faucets and toilets.



   (F)   Install water-saving devices on toilets and showers. (Such as
place an item in the toilet tank (do not use a brick) to reduce amount of
water per flush, install low-flow shower heads and the like. Look for water
conservation features if buying new water-consuming appliances.)



   (G)   Do not allow children to play with hose or sprinklers.



   (H)   Limit lawn and outside plant watering, then only at night
between 5:00 p.m. and 12:00 midnight, no more than three times per week, to
avoid water evaporation loss.  In an hour, 600 gallons of water can be
wasted.



   (I)   Position sprinklers to water the lawn, to avoid water spraying
on pavement.



   (J)   Avoid watering on windy days when the wind not only blows
water off target, but also causes excess evaporation.



   (K)   Know how to turn off an automatic sprinkler system in case of
rain.  There are automatic rain sensors available that prevent automatic
sprinkler from starting if it has just rained.



   (L)   Use an alarm clock or a timer to remind one to shut off
hose-fed sprinklers that don't have timers.



   (M)   Consider delaying the seeding or sodding of new lawns.



   (N)   Golf courses and athletic fields shall attempt to reduce water
consumption by 50%.



   (O)   While waiting for water to get hot, catch running water from
sink and tub faucets and use for animals to drink or to water plants.



   (P)   Use a broom instead of water to wash down sidewalks, patios,
and driveways.



   (Q)   Do not fill empty swimming pools or wading pools.



   (R)   Do not use the toilet as a wastebasket.  Put tissues and
trash in a trash can.



   (S)   Limit toilet flushes.



   (T)   Use disposable and biodegradable dishes where possible.



   (U)   Be ready to catch rainfall that occurs.  Place containers
under drain spouts.



   (V)   Use pistol-grip nozzles on hoses to avoid waste when watering
flowers and shrubs.



   (W)   Aerate lawns by punching holes six inches apart.  This allows
water to reach roots rather than run off surfaces.



   (X)   Keep sprinkler heads clean to prevent uneven watering.



   (Y)   Adjust hose to simulate a gentle rain.  Sprinklers that
produce a fine mist waste water through evaporation.



   (Z)   Install automatic shut off devices on sprinkler systems.



   (AA)   The city will delay the implementation of landscape code
requirements until the next planting season after return-to-normal condition.
However, a performance bond will be required for any landscaping required by
the city’s Unified Development Ordinance.

('70 Code, § 25-30)  (Ord. 1983-47, passed 10-4-82)  Penalty, see § 10.99



§ 53.17  CONDITIONS FOR MAKING WATER AND SEWER CONNECTIONS.



   (A)   For residential and commercial property:



      (1)    Access to water and sewer lines will be provided to a
requesting developer or private property owner outside the city limits only
upon the receipt and approval of a voluntary petition for annexation by a
developer or private property owner who are deemed the same.



      (2)   It shall be the responsibility of the city to extend
water and sewer lines, if funds are available, from its current location to
the existing city limits. The city shall assess the costs of such extension
(except for costs incurred for the oversizing of lines due to projected
expansions) to the abutting property owners located within the city.



      (3)   The requesting developer shall then be entitled to
access to the water and sewer lines, and may gain such access on the property
described in a voluntary annexation petition. The developer shall be required
to pay all costs incurred with the extension of the line from the city limits
to the points of disbursement on his property. If the property of the
developer is not contiguous to the city limits, he shall likewise be
responsible for extending the line to the nearest point of access on his
property outside the city limits. The developer shall not be responsible for
the payment of the costs of an oversized line.



      (4)   It shall be the responsibility of the developer to
extend all lines within his subdivision, tract or property to ensure water
and sewer service to all existing or potential development within the
property described in the petition for voluntary annexation.



      (5)   Although the city shall be dedicated to the concept of
making such extensions possible, the city shall not be responsible for such
extensions if funds are not reasonably available. In the event that there are
not reasonable funds available for the extensions of such lines, the city
shall be entitled to consider and implement one or more of the following
options:



         (a)   The city may deny the petition for annexation.



         (b)   The city may negotiate with the developer and
reach an agreement whereby the developer will pay the city's cost which would
normally be incurred under this chapter and may be reimbursed at a later date
as funds become available to the city.



         (c)   The city may reach an agreement with the developer
to accept the petition for annexation without the extension of any water and
sewer lines.



         (d)   The city may reach a contractual agreement with
the developer whereby the acceptance of the petition for voluntary annexation
will be delayed until some future date upon the city's extension of the lines.



      (6)   A developer who participates in the costs of the
extension of lines will be entitled to recapture his costs through frontage
fees. Frontage fees will be established by the city based upon the actual
cost of the construction per front foot. The recapture of costs of
construction shall not include, however, any federal or state funds which may
be available to the developer in the extension of these lines. The developer
shall not be entitled to recover a frontage fee based upon his own front
footage, nor shall he be entitled to recover frontage fees in excess of his
actual cost.



      (7)   (a)   The frontage fee charged by the city shall be
based upon the then current cost of construction rather than the original
cost of construction. The city shall establish by resolution the frontage fee
to be charged a developer, property owner or lessee. The cost incurred by
virtue of the installation of oversized lines shall not be charged as a part
of the frontage fee. Any monies collected in excess of the actual cost of
construction and refunded to the developer or any funds received from
frontage fees after 25 years shall be retained by the city. In addition, if
the city is unable to locate the developer after reasonable inquiry, any
monies collected for frontage fees which would be refunded to the developer
may be retained by the city after 30 days written notice to the developer's
last known address.



         (b)   Frontage fees shall be collected by the city for a
period not to exceed 25 years. These frontage fees shall be collected at the
time that a tap is made, provided however, when the frontage fee exceeds $500
for residential use and $1,000 for nonresidential use, then and in that event
the frontage fees may be paid in five annual equal installments and shall
bear interest at the same rate as that charged by the city for unpaid taxes
from the date said tap is made. The first installment shall be due and
payable on the date a water or sewer account is opened with the city and the
subsequent installment and interest payments shall be due and payable on the
same day of the same month in each successive year until the indebtedness is
paid in full. If any installment with interest is not paid when due, it shall
be subject to the same penalties as are now prescribed by law for unpaid
taxes, in addition to the interest herein provided for and upon the failure
to pay any installment, the entire balance shall be due and payable without
further notice.



         (c)     When an installment account is requested for
the payment of frontage fees, a developer, owner and/or lessee shall be
required to execute an agreement with the city establishing a lien upon the
property served by the utility. The lien shall continue until the amount of
said installments, including interest, has been paid in full. Further, if any
annual installment, plus interest, is 90 days in arrears, the water and/or
sanitary sewer service to said property may be terminated by the city. Any
reconnection cost shall be made at the user's expense.



      (8)   If a developer or private property owner desires city
water or sewer service from lines for which there are no assessment rolls or
utility agreements, a frontage fee based upon the current cost of
construction as per City Council resolution will be charged. This entire fee
will be retained by the city.



      (9)   There may arise certain requests for water and/or
sanitary sewer line extensions which the developer cannot reasonably fund.
For example, there are certain natural and manmade barriers existing in and
around the city such as swamps, creeks, rivers, railroads, highways, and the
like, where the costs of extension of lines across such barriers would be
extremely high. It is the intent and concept of this chapter that the city
should consider the possibilities of future expansions and resulting benefits
in determining whether or not to participate or accept a petition for
voluntary annexation from a developer whose line would be extended across
such barriers. The city may negotiate solutions to line extension problems
which arise by virtue of these barriers.



   (B)   For industrial property:



      (1)   An industry will be defined as listed under Division D,
Manufacturing, of the Standard Industrial Classification Manual, published by
the Office of the Management and Budget of the United States Government.



      (2)   The city will agree to provide access to water and sewer
lines to any industry requesting such extension, provided that the industry
locates within three miles of the city limits.



      (3)   An industry requesting access to water and sewer lines
will be granted such access upon execution of a formal agreement with the
city to file a petition for voluntary annexation on or before the expiration
of seven years from the date occupancy begins.



      (4)   It shall be the responsibility of the developer to pay
for the extension of water and sewer lines from the point of nearest access
to its property, but the city shall agree to reimburse the developer for such
costs in accordance with this chapter and formula provided for the payment of
frontage fees for residential and commercial development. If the developer is
in fact the county, the developer will be responsible for the extension of
water and sewer lines including any oversized lines to be required for future
development. In addition, the operation and maintenance of pump lift stations
constructed relative to these lines outside of the city limits would be borne
by the county until properly for which pump lift station was installed is
annexed. If the developer is in fact a private developer, then it shall be
the responsibility of the city to bear the costs of any oversized lines
required by it. However, the county will also be entitled to the recoupment
of its expenses, including oversized lines, through frontage fees in
accordance with the policy and formula described for residential and
commercial development. Recapture of the expenses of oversized lines shall be
based upon the front foot cost of the line, excluding oversizing, plus the
line's future inflated cost not to exceed the original front foot cost of the
oversized line.



      (5)   Any industry located outside the city limits obtaining
access to water and/or sewer facilities shall continue to pay revenues based
upon the rates then in effect and shall continue to pay such prevailing rates
until its annexation into the city pursuant to the petition for voluntary
annexation.



   (C)   Every person owning a house, apartment house, storehouse,
restaurant or any building inside the city limits used for sleeping quarters
or any building where any persons are employed, which building abuts or
adjoins a street or alley along which there is public water or sewer, shall,
within 30 days from the date of legal notice served by the City Plumbing
Inspector or other authorized deputy, have sewer and water connections made
to the building or house. All such connections must be made according to the
requirements of this subchapter in the interest of public health and safety.



   (D)   The permission to connect will be conditioned upon the
premises being supplied with city water and sewer and upon the house plumbing
being installed in accordance with this subchapter.



   (E)   Applications for such connections shall be made at the revenue
office application window and service will not be turned on until the
certificate from the inspections division is received that the house plumbing
has been properly installed.



   (F)   The city reserves the right to change the rate or to refuse to
give service where conditions herein mentioned are not met or where
conditions are such as to make such service impractical.

         The applicant shall comply with all regulations and
ordinance that pertain to the city's sanitary sewer system.



      (2)   The city retains ownership of the sewer service line.
Sewer service lines shall be kept in repair by the city and at the expense of
the city. Necessary renewals of sewer service lines, due to age, disrepair or
general maintenance purposes, shall be made by the city and at the expense of
the city. Renewals of sewer service lines, due to upgrade, change in location
of desired service or other consumer requests not due to ordinary or expected
maintenance, shall be at the expense of the consumer. The work of furnishing
and installing the service line from the main sanitary sewer line to the
right-of-way line shall be performed by the City Maintenance Division.



      (3)   The property owner shall pay in advance for new service
lines which are deemed the same.



('70 Code, § 25-33)



   (C)   Contents of permit application for water connection.  All
applications for a permit to make connections with the water system shall be
made at the Office of the City Engineer. Such application shall fully
describe the locality where such connection is desired and shall fully
contain a correct statement of the various uses to which the water is to be
applied. At the time the application is made, tap fees shall be paid. 



('70 Code, § 25-34)



   (D)   Permit revocation.  All permits to connect with the city
water and sewer systems shall be given upon the condition that the City
Engineer may at any time, before the completion of the connection, revoke and
annul the permit when the work is not being properly executed.  No party
interested shall have a claim for damage in consequence of such permit being
revoked or annulled.

(Ord. 1982-47, passed 10-4-82; Am. Ord. 2010-22, passed 4-5-10)



§ 53.19  INSPECTION OF PLANS.



   It shall be the duty of the Plumbing Inspector to inspect applications

('70 Code, § 25-36)  (Ord. 1982-47, passed 10-4-82)



§ 53.20  CITY ENGINEER TO GRANT PERMIT, CAUSE SERVICE LINES TO BE LAID;
OWNERSHIP OF SERVICE LINES; REVOCATION OF PERMIT, AND THE LIKE.



   The City Engineer may grant such permit and shall cause suitable water
service lines to be laid from the main water line to and including the curb
stop, which shall be located near the abutting public easement line or road
right-of-way, and be provided with a suitable meter box. The city retains
ownership of the water service line. Water service lines shall be kept in
repair by the city and at the expense of the city. Necessary renewals of
water service lines, due to age, disrepair or general maintenance purposes,
shall be made by the city and at the expense of the city. Renewals of water
service lines, due to upgrade, change in location or desired service, or
other consumer requests not due to ordinary or expected maintenance, shall be
at the expense of the consumer. The work of furnishing and installing the new
water service line shall be performed by the City Maintenance Division and
paid for in advance by the property owner. The applicant shall furnish and
install the balance of the water service line at his own expense, subject,
however, to the supervision and direction of the Plumbing Inspector. Such
water service lines shall be laid to the depth of the bottom of the main
water line, unless otherwise permitted by the plumbing inspector, and shall,
when required by the city, be covered with at least 18 inches of some
approved material to protect the water service line from frost. All water and
sewer service lines shall be as specified in the North Carolina Plumbing
Code, Volume II, and as approved by the Plumbing Inspector. Backflow
prevention devices shall be installed where directed by the Plumbing
Inspector. If the applicant, in putting in any service lines from the
property line to his structure, disregards the direction of the City
Engineer, Maintenance Division or Plumbing Inspector in any particular, the
permit granted for the use of water may be revoked by the City Engineer and
the tap fee forfeited to the city.

CHARGES.



   (A)   All new water connections shall be metered, and the Director
of Finance reserves the right to place a meter on any service now in use,
without application from the consumer where such action may be deemed
necessary to prevent waste or to protect the interest of the revenue office.
Where meters are located within the building, consumers or property owners
must not cover the meters or place obstructions that may prevent convenient
access to the meter at any time by the employees of the revenue office for
the purpose of reading or making repairs. Separate water connections to
consumers or property owners will be installed wherever possible. Split
connections will not be allowed unless approved by the City Engineer.

         Grade G (with sewer)              6,000 - Over



         (b)   Payment for water will be based upon a flat rate
established for each grade. Customers assigned a grade will pay the
corresponding rate for each 100 cubic feet of water consumed. If during the
year a consumer's water usage varies from the grade assigned, this usage,
nevertheless, will be billed at the rate established for the assigned grade.
All residential customers will be assigned a Grade A classification. All new
nonresidential customers will be assigned a classification based upon their
projected bi-monthly water consumption. At the conclusion of six months this
classification will be reexamined, taking into consideration the users actual
water usage in order to determine its appropriateness. If the actual water
consumption does not justify the grade assigned, a grade adjustment will be
made. All classifications other than those assigned residential consumers
will be reviewed annually in order to determine the accuracy based upon the
volume of water used by the consumer for the previous year.



      (5)   For customers outside the city the monthly water rate
shall be established by City Council resolution. No bill shall be rendered
for less than an amount established annually by City Council resolution. The
rate established for Grade G is effective only for customers using city sewer
services.



   (B)   Applicability.  This schedule applies to all water supplied
to the customer's premises at one point of delivery through one meter.



   (C)   Type of service.  The volume of water flow and pressure at
the point of delivery, location of meter, shall be in accordance with the
city's standard practices.



   (D)   Rate.  For customers inside the city the monthly water rate
shall be established by board resolution. No bill shall be rendered for less
than an amount established by City Council resolution.



('70 Code, § 25-110)  (Ord. 1982-47, passed 10-4-82)



§ 53.41  CHARGES FOR SANITARY SEWER.



   (A)   Sanitary sewer service charge generally, inside and outside
city.  Any person discharging waste water into the sanitary sewer of the
city, except as indicated in division (B) of this section shall pay a sewer
service charge established by City Council resolution. The charges shall be
based upon the metered water consumption.



('70 Code, § 25-120)



   (B)   No sanitary sewer charge where service is not rendered inside
and outside city.  Any person using water supplied by the city utility
system but not discharging waste water into the sewer system of the city
shall not be charged a sewer service charge provided that a sanitary sewer
line is not available to serve the property. In instances where a sanitary
sewer line is available to serve the property but the property owner decides
not to connect to the sewer line, a minimum bi-monthly sanitary sewer bill
shall be assessed, as established by City Council resolution, against the
resident if he is the property owner. This requirement will become effective
five years after annexation in order for property owners to plan for and
amortize septic tanks.



('70 Code, § 25-121)



   (C)   Charges to commercial or industrial consumers.  Any
commercial or industrial consumer of city water that retains 75% or 30,000
gallons per day or more of its water consumption in the preparation of its
product, may supply the city with engineering documentation as prepared by a
registered engineer of the percentage of its water usage actually discharged
into the city's sanitary sewer system. This percentage will be applied to the
customer's average daily water consumption derived from its monthly water
consumption bill in order to determine the number of gallons of water
actually not being discharged into the sanitary sewer system on a daily
basis. Where a measuring device is necessary to so determine the actual use
of the sewer, the consumer shall be required to bear the cost of the
installation and maintenance of such measuring device. Upon acceptance by the
city of such statistical data, said sanitary sewer bill will be computed at
the sanitary sewer rate established by City Council resolution based upon the
estimated percentage of water consumption actually discharged into the
sanitary sewer system.



('70 Code, § 25-122)



   (D)   Action taken upon failure to pay sanitary sewer service;
reinstatement charges.



      (1)   Any person failing to pay the sewer service charge as
set forth by City Council resolution shall:



         (a)   If a consumer of the city revenue office, have his
water disconnected;



         (b)   If not a consumer of the city revenue office, have
his sanitary sewer service connection severed and blocked.



      (2)   Where it becomes necessary to disconnect and block a
sanitary sewer connection, the person or persons desiring to reinstate sewer
service shall pay to the city an amount established by City Council
resolution for disconnection and re-establishing such service.



('70 Code, § 25-123)



   (E)   Fire suppression fee outside city.  The city has assumed a
substantial financial responsibility in constructing the water facility and
its distribution system. As an integral part of the distribution system, the
water facility necessarily has maintained a reserve water capacity for the
purpose of fire suppression. Although users outside the territorial limits of
the city are currently paying double rates, these rates provide only a very
small portion of the costs incurred for fire protection. This excess capacity
is not recouped through water and sewer rates, but is built into the system
to provide sufficient capacity in the event of the occurrence of fire, not
only within the city, but outside the city as well.  There is only a minimal
cost in the maintenance of a capacity sufficient for fire suppression
purposes for residential dwellings. The needed capacity for fire suppression
capability for industrial or large plants and businesses is substantial.
Therefore, the city establishes an annual fire suppression fee for all users
of water located outside the city limits whose plant or facility exceeds
5,000 square feet. The fire suppression fee is based on a rate established by
board resolution for such users. Such fee will be assessed on a fiscal year
basis and is due and payable July 1 of each calendar year. Fees issued for
any business located beyond the city limits and connecting to the city water
system on or after January 1 of a fiscal year shall have their fire
suppression fee prorated at 50% of their normal fee for that year.

(Ord. 1982-47, passed 10-4-82; Am. Ord. 2002-65, passed 7-15-02)



§ 53.42  DISCONNECTION FOR LATE PAYMENT.



   (A)   It is the policy of the city to discontinue utility service to
customers by reason of nonpayment of bills only after notice and a meaningful
opportunity to be heard on disputed bills.  The city's form for application
for utility service and all bills shall contain, in addition to the title,
address, room number, and telephone number of the official in charge of
billing, clearly visible and easily readable provisions to the effect:



      (1)   That all bills are due and payable on or before the date
set forth on the bill; and



      (2)   That if any bill is not paid by or before that date, a
second bill will be mailed containing a cutoff notice that if the bill is not
paid within ten days of the mailing of the second bill, service will be
discontinued for nonpayment; and



      (3)   That any customer disputing the correctness of his bill
shall have a right to a hearing at which time he may be represented in person
and by counsel or any other person of his choosing and may present orally or
in writing his complaint and contentions to the city official in charge of
utility billing.  This official shall be authorized to order that the
customer's service not be discontinued and shall have the authority to make a
final determination of the customer's complaint.



   (B)   Requests for delays or waiver of payment will not be
entertained; only questions of proper and correct billing will be
considered.  In the absence of payment of the bill rendered or resort to the
hearing procedure provided herein, service will be discontinued at the time
specified, but in no event until the charges have been due and unpaid for at
least 30 days.



   (C)   When it becomes necessary for the city to discontinue utility
service to a customer for nonpayment of bills, service will be reinstated
only after all bills for service then due have been paid, along with a
turn-on charge in the sum of $20.

(Ord. 2017-29, passed 6-5-17; Am. Ord. 2018-3, passed 1-22-18)



§ 54.03  STORMWATER MANAGEMENT UTILITY ESTABLISHED; ADMINISTRATION; POWERS
AND DUTIES.



   (A)   The City Council hereby establishes a stormwater management
utility to carry out the purposes, functions and responsibilities set forth
in this section. The governing body of the stormwater management utility
shall be the City Council. The City Manager shall administer the stormwater
management utility through the Public Works Department or such other
departments and divisions as the City Manager shall designate.



   (B)   The stormwater management utility shall have the following
powers and duties, subject to available revenues, which powers and duties are
not necessarily exclusive to the stormwater management utility.



      (1)   Stormwater management planning and preparation of
comprehensive watershed master plans for stormwater management.



      (2)   Regular inspections and maintenance of public stormwater
management facilities, and measures for the construction thereof, as well as
regular inspections of private stormwater management facilities.



      (3)   Maintenance and improvement of stormwater management
facilities that have been accepted by the city for purposes of stormwater
management.



      (4)   Plan review and inspection of sediment control and

related thereto, except for those regulations that require approval by City
Council.



      (10)   Any and all powers and duties delegated or granted to
it as a local government implementing agency under the laws and regulations
of the state and the ordinances of the city.



(Ord. 2017-29, passed 6-5-17)



§ 54.04  BOUNDARIES AND JURISDICTION.



   The boundaries and jurisdiction of the stormwater management utility
shall extend to the corporate limits of the city, as they may exist from time
to time, and such areas lying outside the corporate limits of the city as
shall be approved by the City Council.



(Ord. 2017-29, passed 6-5-17)



§ 54.05  STORMWATER UTILITY SERVICE FEES, RATES AND FEE SCHEDULE.



   (A)   Stormwater utility service fees will be determined and
modified from time to time by the City Council, so that the total revenues
generated by these fees will be used to pay such expenses as are reasonably
necessary or convenient in the management, administration, planning,
regulatory compliance, public education, construction, operation, and
maintenance of the stormwater system, and to pay principal of and interest on
the debt incurred for stormwater purposes. 



   (B)   The fee system must be reasonable and equitable so that users
pay to the extent they contribute to the need for the stormwater management
utility, and so that fees bear a substantial relationship to the cost of
service.  The City Council recognizes that these benefits, while
substantial, in many cases cannot be measured directly.



      (1)   Stormwater utility service fees shall accrue on the date
determined by City Council and set forth in the city schedule of rates and
fees. Stormwater utility service fees shall apply to all land as presented in
§ 54.04, whether public or private. Exemptions shall not be allowed based on
age, tax exemption, or other status of an individual or organization, except
as set forth in § 54.06.



      (2)   Stormwater utility service fees shall be based on a
commonly accepted rate unit for stormwater utilities, the equivalent
residential unit (ERU). The ERU is used to relate a base rate fee charged to
a single-family residential property to that charged to a non-single-family
residential property. The city’s ERU is 3,000 square feet of impervious
surface area. The ERU is determined by analyzing digital photographs and, for
verification purposes, performing field checks of a representative sample of
single-family residences within the city limits.



         (a)   All single-family residential properties will be
charged one ERU per month.



         (b)   All non single-family residential properties will
be charged based on the number of ERUs on the property.

§ 54.06  CREDITS.



   (A)   Stormwater utility fee credits will be made available to
developed non-single family residential properties with structural BMPs that
treat at least 100% of runoff from the parcel. Credit for either a 10% or up
to a total of 20% reduction in the stormwater utility fee will be given, as
long as the property meets the eligibility requirements and the BMP meets the
appropriate treatment requirements and is being properly maintained. The
credit percentage is applied after the complete stormwater bill is calculated.



   (B)   Credit eligibility, application, approval, and expiration
criteria and procedures are documented in the stormwater utility fee policies.



(Am. Ord. 2018-3, passed 1-22-18)



§ 54.07  BILLING METHOD; RESPONSIBLE PARTIES.



   (A)   Bills for stormwater utility service fees shall be sent at
regular, periodic intervals. Stormwater utility service fees may be billed on
a combined utility bill that also contains fees for other utilities. 
Stormwater utility service fees that are shown on a combined utility bill may
be for a different service period than that used for other utilities. For
properties not having otherwise active utility accounts, the fee for only
stormwater utility service accounts shall be billed to the owners or other
persons listed on the real property tax records. These accounts may be billed
at different intervals than the accounts receiving combined utility billings.



   (B)   As the general rule, stormwater utility bills for a property
that receives other city-provided utilities shall be sent to the customer
receiving such service. Billing for parcels or groups of adjacent and
associated parcels with multiple utility accounts may be done as a separate
bill to each account with the impervious area allocated among the accounts.
Where this allocation results in an amount of impervious area allocable to a
given account that is similar to that for a single family residential
property, the account will be billed the same way as a single family
residential property.



   (C)   Townhouse and condominium developments and other similar
properties billed through individual utility accounts and not the property
owner, but containing impervious surface greater than one ERU in common
ownership areas, shall be charged a stormwater utility service fee for the
total impervious surface of all commonly-owned property within the
development. The stormwater utility bill for the commonly-owned areas shall
be sent to the homeowners’ association.



   (D)   Stormwater utility service fees shall be due and payable as
set forth in the city schedule of rates and fees, a copy of which is located
in the office of the City Clerk, and is incorporated by reference herein.



(Ord. 2017-29, passed 6-5-17; Am. Ord. 2018-3, passed 1-22-18)



§ 54.08  BACKBILLING.



   Failure to receive a stormwater utility service fee bill is not
justification for nonpayment. The owner of each parcel of land shall be
ultimately obligated to pay such fee. If a customer is under-billed or if no
bill is sent, the city may backbill for up to two years.



(Ord. 2017-29, passed 6-5-17)



§ 54.09  COMPLAINTS REGARDING A BILL.



   (A)   A customer having a grievance or complaint that a bill is
excessive must file written notice with the city’s finance office. If it is
determined that the bill is in error, an adjustment will be made according to
the schedule of rates and fees.



   (B)   No adjustment will be made for more than a three-year period.



(Ord. 2017-29, passed 6-5-17)



§ 54.10  APPEAL.



   (A)   For the purposes of the stormwater utility fee, any person who
disagrees with any final determination of the Public Works Director in the
administration of the fee with regards to classification of parcels,
stormwater fees, application of credits, final administrative policies, or
procedures, and other matters related to the administration of the stormwater
utility have 30 days from the date of notification of such determination to
apply for a hearing.



   (B)   All appeals of administrative determinations are to be heard
by the City Manager.



   (C)   Appeals to the City Manager's determination constitute a
quasi-judicial process and will be heard by the Board of Adjustment.



(Am. Ord. 2018-3, passed 1-22-18)



§ 54.11  USE OF REVENUE; INVESTMENT OF FUNDS; BORROWING.



   Funds generated for the stormwater management utility from fees, bond
issues, other borrowing and other sources shall be utilized only for those
purposes for which the stormwater management utility has been established.
Such funds shall be invested and reinvested pursuant to the same procedures
and practices established by the city for investment and reinvestment of
funds. The City Council may use any form of borrowing authorized by law to
fund capital acquisitions or expenditures for the stormwater management
utility.

Engineering Departments; however, the property owner still maintains
responsibility for long-term maintenance of the structure. In the event that
a BMP is severed from the original site it was designed for (such as by the
division of the original site, sale of a portion of the original site, or
construction of a road through the site), a substitute BMP must be
constructed by the responsible party (the property owner, unless otherwise

      (4)   Inspections and annual inspection fee.



         (a)   The Building Inspector (or other authorized agent
of the city) has full power and authority to enter upon a premise housing a
BMP for the purpose of inspecting the BMP on an annual basis. The City
Council has established an annual inspection fee of $100 per structural BMP
to fund this additional inspection program.

         (a)   Issuance of citation.  The Building Inspector,
Code Enforcement Officer or other authorized officer, agent or employee of
the city is empowered to issue warning citations, notices of violation and
citations with fines, if there is a reasonable cause to believe that any
provision of the City Code of Ordinances has been violated. Where a provision
has been violated, such citations shall be issued to the violator or property
owner.



         (b)   Violator.  A violator of a provision of the code
or an ordinance of the city shall be deemed to be the owner of the premises,
the agent of the owner authorized to be responsible for the premises, and/or
the appropriate occupant, lessee, employee or person having immediate
beneficial use of and/or responsibility over the premises or property.



         (c)   Methods of issuance of citations.  A citation
shall be considered issued if it is delivered in person to the violator, or
if the violator cannot be readily found, then the citation may be mailed to
the last known mailing address of the owner or agent shown on public records.
If the violator cannot be found and after other reasonable efforts have been
made to communicate the existence of the violation to the owner or agent,
then the citation shall also be considered issued if directed to the owner,
agent or occupant and left at the place of residence or location of the
violation.



         (d)   Types of citations and notices.  It shall be in
the sole discretion of the Building Inspector, Code Enforcement Officer or
other authorized officer, agent or employee of the city to determine which of

forth in § 96.10 (B)(1)(d)3. and impose the cost of remedying or abating the
nuisance as set forth in §§ 96.06 and 96.07 in the Code of Ordinances. In
the event an inspector determines that a nuisance is an immediate detriment
to human health, safety or welfare, the inspector may take appropriate action
to summarily abate the condition without notice.



            3.   Citations with fines.  If the violation
continues after the deadline to correct a violation, then a citation with a
fine in an initial amount of $50 shall be authorized to be issued against the
violator. Thereafter, each day the violation continues shall be deemed an
additional offense and additional citations with increasing fines up to $250
may be issued each day the violation continues. Any unpaid citations and
delinquency charges shall be cumulative and shall be recovered in a civil
action or in the nature of debt as well as any attorney fees incurred by the
city incident thereto.  In lieu of a civil action to recover the debt, the
city may turn unpaid penalties in to a credit/collection agency for
collection. The offender will be responsible for all reasonable monetary
damages as required by the collections agency to recover the debt. This
section may also be enforced by any appropriate, equitable action. In

§ 96.12  AGGRESSIVE PANHANDLING PROHIBITED ON CITY STREETS, SIDEWALKS AND
OTHER PUBLIC PLACES.



   (A)   Definitions.  For the purposes of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.



      (1)   The words "panhandling" or "begging" are used
interchangeably and mean any aggressive language or such other aggressive
act, a purpose of which is to obtain a contribution of money or goods for the
principal benefit of the person making the solicitation.



      (2)   The word "aggressive" refers to the approaching and
following of a person, any physical contact with another person, the use of
abusive language toward another person, or any word or act which intimidates
or attempts to intimidate another person, a purpose of which is to obtain a
contribution of money or goods for the principal benefit of the person making
the solicitation.



      (3)   "Public place" and "place open to the public" mean an
area generally visible to public view and include streets, sidewalks,
bridges, alleys, plazas, parks, driveways, parking lots, public
transportation, buildings open to the general public including those which
serve food or drink or provide entertainment, and the doorways or entrances
in buildings and their grounds.



   (B)   Purpose.  The purpose of this section is to ensure unimpeded
pedestrian and vehicle traffic flow, to maintain and protect the well-being
of pedestrians and to otherwise foster a harassment-free climate in public
places.



   (C)   Conduct prohibited. In accordance with G.S. § 160A-179, it
shall be unlawful for any person to aggressively panhandle or beg for money
or goods from another in a public place or in a place open to the public. 
The offering of items of nominal value, such as pencils, chewing gum and the
like for a donation shall not make the conduct lawful.



   (D)   Exceptions.  The conduct prohibited does not include
solicitations made by authorized representatives of not-for-profit
corporations, organizations or groups in order to obtain funds designed
principally to further the purpose of such not-for-profit corporations,
organizations or groups provided proper identification such as signs, vests,
badges and the like, are clearly visible to the general public naming the
not-for-profit corporations, organizations or groups.



   (E)   Opportunity to stop the prohibited activity.



      (1)   No arrest shall be made for an initial violation of this
section unless the arresting officer first affords a person an opportunity to
stop the conduct that violates division (C).  After being warned that
aggressive panhandling or begging is illegal within the city limits of
Goldsboro, a police officer will issue a panhandling warning ticket to the
individual.  A copy of this ticket will be maintained by the Goldsboro
Police Department for documentation purposes.  If after being warned the
panhandler does not cease these activities or if an officer observes a person
who has been duly warned conducting aggressive panhandling activities again
within the city limits, that individual shall be immediately arrested.



      (2)   If a complaint is registered with the police department
by a private citizen and the complainant formally identifies the person
accused of aggressive panhandling or begging activities, a panhandling
warning ticket will be issued to that individual.  If the person accused of
aggressive panhandling or begging by a private citizen has previously been
duly warned of the illegality of this activity, that person will be arrested
if the complaining citizen files appropriate charges or agrees to serve as a
witness.



   (F)   Severability.  If any portion of this section is for any
reason held invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent
jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed severable, and such holding shall
affect the validity of the remaining portions hereof.

      (7)   Failure of a property owner to display the official
street address on the structure, after proper notice from the City of
Goldsboro, shall be subject to a penalty of $25 for each offense.  Each 30

signs for private streets within the city limits and extraterritorial
jurisdiction of Goldsboro.



   (B)   Street name guidelines.  In general, private streets shall be
given a unique name to avoid duplication and confusion.  Names which refer
to landmarks, places and natural features are preferable.  In no case shall
the name for a private street duplicate or be phonetically similar to
existing street names, irrespective of the use of the suffix street, avenue,
boulevard, drive, place or court.



   (C)   Street name approval.



      (1)   Any property owner desiring to name or rename a private
street shall submit a petition on a form provided by the Department of
Planning and Community Development.  An appropriate subdivision plat, record
survey, or tax map illustrating all affected parcels or lots shall also be
provided.  The submitted petition shall include the head of household name
and mailing address for each dwelling fronting on the street.



      (2)   The Department of Planning and Community Development
shall review the proposed street name and compare it to the official street
name to determine its acceptability.  If the proposed street name is found
to be acceptable, written notice shall be provided to all individuals
included on the petition, the U.S. Postal Service and all public utility
companies.



   (D)   Street name signs.



      (1)   Street name signs shall be erected and maintained by the
City of Goldsboro where private streets intersect with public streets.  When
private streets do not intersect with public streets and provide access to
two or more dwelling units, street name signs shall be erected and maintained
by the private street owner(s) in accordance with current city standards. 
The City of Goldsboro may, at the written request of the property owner(s),
construct and install street name signs, at cost, if the owner desires to
purchase these services from the city.



      (2)   Failure of a property owner to install a street name
sign on a private street that does not intersect with a public street, after
proper notice from the City of Goldsboro, will constitute a civil penalty
with a fine of $25 per day, per street.

projects involving tree removal or tree alterations which require
coordination with the Appearance Commission (such as, street paving, sidewalk
construction/repair, utility line construction, playground/park modification
or expansion, urban renewal/redevelopment, and the like).

plan to the designated members of the Appearance Commission for their review.
Concurrence with the plan or recommendations for changes will be requested
not later than a specific date which will provide the Appearance Commission a
minimum of seven calendar days.



   (D)   Step IV.  The Appearance Commission will return the plans to
the city department within the time allocated along with written concurrence
or recommended changes.



   (E)   Step V.  The city department will review recommended changes
and reasons submitted by the Appearance Commission and where feasible,
integrate recommended changes. If all recommendations cannot be accommodated,
the department will notify the Appearance Commission designee and schedule a
meeting with the Appearance Commission and the City Manager and review the
Department's final plans and reasons for not using all recommendations.



   (F)   Step VI.  The city department will review recommended changes
and integrate into its plans those changes it has no objection to. If the
department has objections to any of the recommendations, it shall promptly
request a meeting with the Appearance Commission and attempt to settle the
matter. The city or the Appearance Commission may request a public hearing if
public interest is involved or may be helpful in resolving the differences.

appropriate length of tributary which shall be improved. All property owners
on both sides of the section of tributary shall be assessed a cost for its
improvement up to a cap. If the tributary does not follow a property line and
one owner owns land on both sides, then that owner shall be assessed a cost
for the improvement for each side up to a cap. This cap shall be established
by the City Council and shall be evaluated annually based upon the average
material cost for an 18-inch storm drainage line. In time of budgetary
constraints, the City Council shall prioritize tributary improvements.

   (B)   Requirement for registration. Unless exempt as described in
this section, each person who conducts a business within this city is subject
to this section. One conducts a business “within the city” if one
maintains a business location within the city; or if, either personally or

up or delivers goods or services within the city limits.



   (C)   Period of registration; due date.

period beginning July 1 and ending June 30.



      (2)   Registrations for periods shorter than one year. If the
division of this section applicable to a particular business so provides, a
registration may be issued for a period of one day, one week, or some
comparable period of less than a full registration year. A person may not
commence to conduct a business within the city until the business
registration is obtained and may not continue such a business beyond the
period for which the registration is issued.



   (D)   Separate businesses. A separate registration is required for
each place of business unless two or more places of business under common
ownership are contiguous to each other, communicate directly with and open
into each other, and are operated as a unit.



   (E)   Exemptions. The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all
businesses within the City of Goldsboro municipal jurisdiction unless
specifically exempted or excluded from registering by this section, by the
laws of North Carolina or by laws of the United States.



   (F)   Registration application. A person shall apply to the
Administrator for each registration required by this section before
commencing business. The application, which shall be submitted on forms
provided by the City of Goldsboro City Administrator, shall contain:



      (1)   The name of the owner, and if applicable the agent for

business currently holds.



      (6)   Any other information the Administrator determines to be
necessary to issue the registration, or otherwise regulate the business
appropriately.



      (7)   The application shall be accompanied by the payment of a
registration fee, which is described below. In compliance with state law,
this fee shall not exceed the cost to the city of the administrative process
of the production and issuance of the registration, or to otherwise monitor
the business.



   (G)   Reasons for refusal or revocation of a registration. The
Administrator shall refuse to issue a registration or may revoke a
registration for either of the following reasons:



      (1)   The owner or agent misrepresents a fact relevant to his
or her qualifications for a registration.



      (2)   The owner or agent refuses to provide necessary
information, as determined by the Administrator in his or her discretion.



   (H)   Unqualified agents; right to a conference.



      (1)   After receipt of the completed application, if the
Administrator believes that a reason exists for refusing a registration, the
Administrator shall not issue the registration. At the agent’s request, the
Administrator shall in accordance with this ordinance, give the owner or
agent a written statement of the reason for refusing the registration. The
owner or agent may, within ten days after the day the statement is received,
request a conference to discuss the refusal. In the request, the owner or
agent shall specify why the application for a registration should not be
refused. The Administrator shall arrange the conference within three business
days of receiving the request.



      (2)   If the Administrator refuses to issue a registration,
the owner or agent may reapply for a registration at any time thereafter. If
the reason for which the application was refused no longer exists, and if no
other reason exists for refusing to issue a registration, the Administrator
shall issue the registration in compliance with this ordinance.



   (I)   Administrator to issue registration; payment of registration

maximum permitted by North Carolina law for that particular business or
enterprise.



   (K)   Revocation.

with the Administrator in writing. The request shall specify the reasons why
the registration should not be revoked. The Administrator shall arrange the
conference within three business days of receiving the request.

days after the day on which notice is mailed, the Administrator shall revoke

not revoke the registration until after the conference.



      (3)   If the Administrator revokes a registration, the person
whose registration has been revoked may apply for a new registration at any
time thereafter. If the reason for which the registration was revoked no
longer exists and if no other reason exists for refusing to issue a
registration, the Administrator shall issue the registration in accordance
with Section 14-98 of this chapter.



   (L)   Form and contents of registration. A registration shall show
the name of the person, and any agent who may act on the person’s behalf,
the place where the business is conducted (if it is to be conducted at one
place), the nature of the business and the period for which the registration
is issued. The Administrator shall keep an exact copy of each registration
issued.



   (M)   Assignments. A registration may be assigned if (1) a business
under this ordinance and carried on at a fixed place is sold as a unit to any
person and (2) the purchaser is to continue the same business at the same
place. Such a change shall be reported to the Administrator in accordance
with this section. Otherwise, each registration issued under this chapter is
a separate registration and is not assignable.



   (N)   Record of conferences. The Administrator shall maintain for
three years a record of each conference held in accordance with this chapter.
The record shall contain the agent’s and person’s name, the date of the
conference, and a brief statement of the issues discussed and the result
reached. After three years, the Administrator may dispose of the record in
accordance with this section.



   (O)   Duty to determine whether registration is required. Each
person or his/her designated agent has the duty to determine whether the
business he or she conducts is required to be registered under this
ordinance, and if so, whether that registration has been obtained.



      (1)   Administrator to investigate. If the Administrator has
reason to believe that a person is conducting a business in the city in
violation of this section, the Administrator shall conduct an investigation
to determine the status of the business.



      (2)   Duty to permit inspection. Each person who conducts a
business in the city shall permit the Administrator to inspect the business
premises during normal business hours to determine the nature of the business
conducted there.



      (3)   Duty to post registration. A business shall post the
registration or registrations conspicuously in the place of business
registered. If the person has a regular place of business, the registration

officials.



   (P)   Appeal. Any agent/person refused or denied a registration
under this section may appeal to the City Manager for review of such refusal
or denial. Such appeal shall be in writing, and shall be delivered to the

license fees or charges established by proper authority and applicable to the
holder or the vehicle(s) under his operation and control.  In addition,

licensed to do business in the state, and is fit, willing and able to perform
such public transportation as to conform to the provisions of this chapter
and the rules promulgated by the City Council, especially as they pertain to
the provisions of indemnity bonds, liability insurance, cash or approved
securities, then the City Council shall issue a certificate stating the name
and address of the applicant, the number of vehicles authorized under the
certificate and the date of issuance; otherwise, the application shall be
denied.



   (B)   In making the above findings, the City Council shall take into

also be suspended or revoked by the City Council if the holder thereof has
violated any of the provisions of this chapter, discontinued operations for
more than 30 days,  has violated any ordinance  of the city,  the state or
the laws of the United States, the violations of which reflect unfavorably on
the fitness of the holder to offer public transportation.

notice of the proposed action to be taken and shall have an opportunity to
appeal directly to the City Council.

utilizing a contract service, a charge of $0.25 will be assessed for each
traveler in excess of this number. If passengers are not discharged at the
same destination, the first passenger leaving the taxicab shall be chargeable
for the amount of the fare shown on the taximeter and before proceeding to
transport the remaining passenger(s), the flag shall again be placed in the
earning position so as to designate the beginning of a new and separate trip
as to the remaining passenger(s) in such taxicab and such process shall be
repeated each time a passenger reaches his destination and alights from the
taxicab so that the remaining passenger(s) leaving the taxicab shall be
chargeable with such fare appearing upon the taximeter upon leaving the
taxicab. This procedure, however, does not apply for passengers who are being
transported in limousines under contract, copies of which have been placed on

in those instances where limousines have been retained to transport
passengers to a predetermined destination beyond the city limits and such

operator and passenger without utilizing the privileges of a contract of any
nature, general rates for such trips shall be determined by the City Council

GENERAL PROVISIONS



§  151.01  STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.



   The Legislature of the State of North Carolina has in G.S. §§
143-215.51 et seq., 160A-174 et seq., 160A-381 et seq., 160A-411 et seq., and
160A-456 et seq., delegated to local governmental units the responsibility to
adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general
welfare of its citizenry.



(Ord. 2018-24, passed 5-21-18)



§  151.02  FINDINGS OF FACT.



   (A)   The flood prone areas within the jurisdiction of the City of
Goldsboro are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life,
property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief,
and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public
health, safety, and general welfare.



   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities
and by the occupancy in flood prone areas of uses vulnerable to floods or
other hazards.



(Ord. 2018-24, passed 5-21-18)



§  151.03  STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.



   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote public health, safety, and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions within flood prone areas by provisions designed to:



   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards or that result in
damaging increases in erosion, flood heights or velocities;



   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
that serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of
initial construction;



   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream
channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the
accommodation of floodwaters;



   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and all other development
that may increase erosion or flood damage; and



   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that
will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to
other lands.



(Ord. 2018-24, passed 5-21-18)



§  151.04  OBJECTIVES.



   The objectives of this chapter are:



   (A)   To protect human life and health;



   (B)   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood
control projects;



   (C)   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated
with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;



   (D)   To minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions;



   (E)   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities (for
example, water and gas mains, electric, telephone, cable and sewer lines,
streets, and bridges) that are located in flood prone areas;



   (F)   To minimize damage to private and public property due to
flooding;



   (G)   To make flood insurance available to the community through the
National Flood Insurance Program;



   (H)   To maintain the natural and beneficial functions of
floodplains;



   (I)   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound
use and development of flood prone areas; and



   (J)   To ensure that potential buyers are aware that property is in
a Special Flood Hazard Area.

effective date of this ordinance and located totally or partially within the
floodway, non-encroachment area, or stream setback, provided there is no
additional encroachment below the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation in
the floodway, non-encroachment area, or stream setback, and provided that
such repair, reconstruction, or replacement meets all of the other
requirements of this chapter.



   (I)   New solid waste disposal facilities, hazardous waste
management facilities, salvage yards, and chemical storage facilities shall
not be permitted in Special Flood Hazard Areas, except by variance as

level, including basement, elevated no lower than the regulatory flood
protection elevation, as defined in § 151.05 of this chapter. Structures
located in A, AO, AE and A99 Zones may be floodproofed to the regulatory
flood protection elevation in lieu of elevation provided that all areas of
the structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, below
the required flood protection elevation are watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water, using structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads and the effect of buoyancy. For AO Zones, the floodproofing elevation
shall be in accordance with § 151.36(B). A registered professional engineer
or architect shall certify that the standards of this section are satisfied.
Such certification shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator or Chief
Building Inspector as set forth in § 151.21(3), along with the operational,
inspection, and maintenance plans.



(Ord. 2018-24, passed 5-21-18)

(Ord. 2018-24, passed 5-21-18)



§  151.31(4)  ELEVATED BUILDINGS.



   Enclosed areas, of new construction or substantially improved
structures, which are below the regulatory flood protection elevation:



   (A)   Shall not be designed or used for human habitation, but shall
only be used for parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage of
maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises. Access to the
enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles
(garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment (standard exterior
door), or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator). The interior
portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into
separate rooms, except to enclose storage areas;



   (B)   Shall not be temperature-controlled or conditioned;



   (C)   Shall be constructed entirely of flood resistant materials
below the regulatory flood protection elevation; and



   (D)   Shall include, in Zones A, AO, AE, AH and A99, measures to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on wails by allowing for the
entry and exit of floodwaters. To meet this requirement, the openings must
either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the
following minimum design criteria;



      (1)   Provide a minimum of two openings on different sides of
each enclosed area subject to flooding;



      (2)   The total net area of all openings must be at least one
square inch for each square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;



      (3)   If a building has more than one enclosed area, each area
must have openings to allow floodwaters to automatically enter and exit;



      (4)   The bottom of all required openings shall be no higher
than one foot above the higher of the interior or exterior adjacent grade;



      (5)   Flood openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or
other opening coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic flow
of floodwaters in both directions; and



      (6)   Foundation enclosures made of flexible skirting are not
considered enclosures for-regulatory purposes, and, therefore, do not require
flood openings. Masonry or wood underpinning, regardless of structural
status, is considered an enclosure and requires openings as outlined above.



   (E)   Property owners shall be required to execute and record a
non-conversion agreement prior to issuance of a building permit declaring
that the area below the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation shall not be
improved, finished or otherwise converted to habitable space; The City of
Goldsboro will have the right to inspect the enclosed area. The City of
Goldsboro will conduct annual inspections. This agreement shall be recorded
with the Wayne County Register of Deeds and shall transfer with the property
in perpetuity.



   (F)   Release of restrictive covenant. If a property which is bound
by a non-conversion agreement is modified to remove enclosed areas below
Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation, then the owner may request release of
restrictive covenant after staff inspection and submittal of confirming
documentation.

§  151.31(5)  ADDITIONS/IMPROVEMENTS.



   (A)   Additions and/or improvements to pre-FIRM structures when the
addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications
to the existing structure are:



      (1)   Not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or
improvements must be designed to minimize flood damages and must not be any
more nonconforming than the existing structure.



      (2)   A substantial improvement, with
modifications/rehabilitations/improvements to the existing structure or the
common wall is structurally modified more than installing a doorway, both the
existing structure and the addition must comply with the standards for new
construction.



   (B)   Additions to pre-FIRM or post-FIRM structures that are a
substantial improvement with no modifications/rehabilitations/improvements to
the existing structure other than a standard door in the common wall, shall
require only the addition to comply with the standards for new construction.



   (C)   Additions and/or improvements to post-FIRM structures when the
addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications
to the existing structure are:



      (1)   Not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or
improvements only must comply with the standards for new construction
consistent with the code and requirements for the original structure.



      (2)   A substantial improvement, both the existing structure
and the addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new
construction.



   (D)   Where a fire wall or independent perimeter load-bearing wall
is provided between the addition and the existing building, the addition(s)
shall be considered a separate building and only the addition must comply
with the standards for new construction.



   (E)   Any combination of repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition or improvement of a building or structure taking place during a one
year period, the cumulative cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of the market
value of the structure before the improvement or repair is started must
comply with the standards for new construction. For each building or
structure, the one year period begins on the date of the first improvement or
repair of that building or structure subsequent to the effective date of this
chapter. Substantial damage also means flood-related damage sustained by a
structure on two separate occasions during a 10-year period for which the
cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equals
or exceeds 25% of the market value of the structure before the damage
occurred. If the structure has sustained substantial damage, any repairs are
considered substantial improvement regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The requirement does not, however, include either:



      (1)   Any project for improvement of a building required to
correct existing health, sanitary or safety code violations identified by the
building official and that are the minimum necessary to assume safe living
conditions.



      (2)   Any alteration of a historic structure provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure.

ELEVATIONS.



   Within the Special Flood Hazard Areas designated as Approximate Zone A
and established in § 151.21(3), where no Base Flood Elevation (BFE) data has
been provided by FEMA, the following provisions, in addition to § 151.30,
shall apply:



   (A)   No encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements or new development shall be permitted within a
distance of 20 feet each side from top of bank or five times the width of the
stream, whichever is greater, unless certification with supporting technical
data by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that
such encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during
the occurrence of the base flood discharge.



   (B)   The BFE used in determining the regulatory flood protection
elevation shall be determined based on one of the following criteria set in
priority order:



      (1)   When Base Flood Elevation (BFE) data is available from

§  151.35  FLOODWAYS AND NON-ENCROACHMENT AREAS.



   Areas designated as floodways or non-encroachment areas are located
within the Special Flood Hazard Areas established in § 151.07. The floodways
and non-encroachment areas are extremely hazardous areas due to the velocity
of floodwaters that have erosion potential and carry debris and potential
projectiles. The following provisions, in addition to standards outlined in
§§ 151.30 and 151.31, shall apply to all development within such areas.



   (A)   No encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements and other developments shall be permitted unless:



      (1)   It is demonstrated that the proposed encroachment would
not result in any increase in the flood levels during the occurrence of the
base flood discharge, based on hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in
accordance with standard engineering practice and presented to the Floodplain
Administrator prior to issuance of floodplain development permit; or



      (2)   A Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) has been
approved by FEMA. A Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) must also be obtained
within six months of completion of the proposed encroachment.



   (B)   If § 151.35(A) is satisfied, all development shall comply
with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this chapter.



   (C)   No manufactured homes shall be permitted. Existing
manufactured homes shall be permitted to remain unless the manufactured home
sustains substantial damage in which case the manufactured home shall not be
repaired or replaced. An existing manufactured home shall not be replaced
under any circumstances.

   (A)   Located within the Special Flood Hazard Areas established in
§ 151.07, are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have
special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet
where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding
is unpredictable and indeterminate. In addition to §§ 151.30 and 151.31,
all new construction and substantial improvements of all structures shall
have the reference level elevated to:



      (1)   A least as high as the depth number specified on the
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), in feet, plus a freeboard of two feet, above
the highest adjacent grade; or



      (2)   At least three feet above the highest adjacent grade
plus a freeboard of two feet if no depth number is specified;



   (B)   All new construction and substantial improvements of all
non-residential structures, including attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, may, in lieu of elevation, be floodproofed to the same depths as
listed above so that any space below that level shall be watertight with
walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads and effects of buoyancy. Certification is required as per §§
151.21(3) and  151.31(2).



   (C)   Adequate drainage paths shall be provided around structures on
slopes, to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.

in support of such determination, and shall issue and cause to be served upon
the owner thereof an order directing and requiring the owner to repair, alter
and improve such dwelling or dwelling unit to comply with the minimum
standards of fitness established by this chapter within a specified period of
time, not to exceed 90 days. Such order may also direct and require the owner

from a decision of the Inspector refusing to allow the person aggrieved
thereby to do any act, his decision shall remain in force until modified or
reversed. When any appeal is from a decision of the Inspector requiring the
person aggrieved to do any act, the appeal shall have the effect of
suspending the requirement until the hearing by the Board, unless the
Inspector certifies to the Board, after the notice of appeal is filed with
him, that by reason of the facts stated in the certificate (a copy of which
shall be furnished to the appellant), a suspension of his requirement would
cause imminent peril to life or property, in which case the requirement shall
not be suspended except by a restraining order, which may be granted for due
cause shown upon not less than one day's written notice to the Inspector, by
the Board, or by a court of record upon petition made pursuant to G.S. §

all the powers of the Inspector, but the concurring vote of four members of
the Board shall be necessary to reverse or modify any decision or order of
the Inspector. The Board shall have power also in passing upon appeals, in
any case where there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in
the way of carrying out the strict letter of this chapter, to adapt the
application of this chapter to the necessities of the case to the end that

1.1 SHORT TITLE.
This Ordinance shall be known as the Goldsboro Unified Development Ordinance and may be
referred to as the “UDO” or the “Zoning Ordinance.” The Official Zoning Map of Goldsboro,
North Carolina may be referred to as the “Zoning Map” and is hereby incorporated into and made
part of this Ordinance.
1.2 AUTHORIZATION.
Zoning provisions enacted herein are under the authority of North Carolina General Statues (GS)
160A, which extends to cities the authority to enact regulations promoting the health, safety, morals
and general welfare of the community. These provisions are further authorized to regulate and
restrict the erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair or use of buildings, structures or
land. This Ordinance further authorizes the establishment of overlay districts in which additional
regulations may be imposed on properties that lie within the boundaries of the district.
Subdivision provisions enacted herein are under the authority of GS 160A, which provides for the
coordination of streets and public facilities, the dedication or reservation of recreation areas or for
the provision of funds to be used to acquire recreation areas, and for the distribution of population
and traffic in a manner that will avoid congestion and overcrowding.
Watershed protection provisions enacted herein are under the authority of GS 160A and in GS 143,
which delegates and directs local governments to promote the health, safety and welfare of its
citizenry by adopting regulations designed to protect public water supplies.
Whenever any provision of this Ordinance refers to or cites a section of the North Carolina General
Statutes or a state or federal department rule or regulation and that section is later amended or
superseded, the Ordinance shall be deemed amended to refer to the amended section or the section
that most nearly corresponds to the superseded section.
1.3 JURISDICTION.
This Ordinance is effective throughout the City’s planning jurisdiction, consisting of the area within
the corporate boundaries of the City and the area beyond the City limits within which the
extraterritorial jurisdiction of the City has been extended.
1.4 EXEMPTION FOR BONA FIDE FARMS (AGRICULTURAL USES)
The building area and setback requirements of this Ordinance shall not apply to any bona fide farm
located in any district outside of the corporate limits of the City except as provided in Sections
5.3.3.1, 5.9 and 5.10. In case of conversion to nonagricultural uses, however, a certificate of zoning
compliance must be procured as prescribed in this Ordinance and the new use must comply with all
of the regulations for the district in which it is located.
1.5 RELATIONSHIP TO THE LAND USE PLAN
It is the intention of the Goldsboro City Council, hereafter referred to as the “Council” or “City
Council,” that this Ordinance implement the planning policies adopted for the City and its
extraterritorial jurisdiction, as reflected in the land use plan and other planning documents. While the
Council reaffirms its commitment that this Ordinance and any amendment to it conform to the
adopted planning policies, Council hereby expresses its intent that neither this Ordinance nor any
1-3
7/31/2007
amendment to it may be challenged based on any alleged nonconformity with any planning
document.
1.6 THE UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE AFFECTS EVERY BUILDING
AND USE
No building or land shall be used or occupied and no building or part thereof shall be erected,
moved or altered except in conformity with the regulations herein specified for the district(s) in
which it is located, except as provided in this Ordinance. For the purposes of this Section, the “use”
or “occupancy” of a building or land relates to anything and everything that is done to, on or in the
building or land.
1.7 FEES
Reasonable fees sufficient to cover the costs of administration, inspection, publication of notice and
similar matters may be charged to the applicants seeking any permits or approvals over which this
Ordinance has authority. The amount of fees charged shall be established by resolution of the
Council and filed in the office of the City Clerk.
1.8 SEVERABILITY
It is hereby declared the intention of the Council that the sections, paragraphs, sentences, clauses and
phrases of this Ordinance are severable. If any section, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase is
declared unconstitutional or otherwise invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction in a valid
judgment or decree, such unconstitutionality or invalidity shall not affect any of the remaining
sections, paragraphs, sentences, clauses or phrases of this Ordinance, since the same would have
been enacted without the incorporation into this Ordinance of such unconstitutional or invalid
section, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase.
1.9 INTERPRETATION AND PURPOSE
In adopting this Ordinance, it is the intent and purpose of the City to place the minimum restrictions
on the rights of owners of private property in the development and uses thereof, consistent with the
protection of the public health, safety, prosperity and welfare of all citizens. It is not intended by this
Ordinance to abrogate or annul any easements, covenants or other agreements between parties,
provided, however, that when this Ordinance imposes a greater restriction upon the use and
development of buildings or property than are imposed or required by other ordinances, rules,
regulations or agreements, the provisions of this Ordinance shall govern.
1.10 EFFECTIVE DATE
These regulations shall become effective on July 9, 2007. Upon such date, these regulations shall
supercede, repeal and replace the Goldsboro Zoning Code, as amended, adopted on April 4, 2005,
the Goldsboro Subdivision Regulations, as amended, adopted on April 4, 2005 the Goldsboro
Landscape and Tree Preservation Ordinance, as amended, adopted on April 4, 2005, the Goldsboro
Stormwater Management for New Development Ordinance, as amended, adopted on November 20,
2000, the Goldsboro Illegal Discharge Control Ordinance, as amended, adopted on February 19,
2001, and the Goldsboro Watershed Protection Ordinance, as amended, adopted on April 1, 2002.

7/31/2007
1.11 TRANSITIONAL RULES
To the extent that provisions o f this Ordinance are the same in substance as the previously adopted
provisions they replace in the City’s zoning, subdivision, watershed and other ordinances they shall
be considered as continuations thereof and not as new enactments. The following rules shall govern
the transition to the new Unified Development Ordinance.
1. Any violation of the previous zoning and subdivision ordinances shall continue to be a
violation under this Ordinance and be subject to penalties and enforcement under Section
4.0 (Enforcement), unless the use, development, construction or other activity complies with
the provisions of this Ordinance. Payment shall be required for any civil penalty assessed
under the previous Ordinances, even if the original violation is no longer considered a
violation under this Ordinance.
2. Special use permits, conditional use permits, vested rights, subdivision plans, site plan
approvals, building permits, sign permits and variances, any of which are valid on April 4,
2005, shall remain valid until their expiration date except as provided below. Projects with
valid approvals or permits may be carried out with the development standards in effect at
the time of approval, provided the permit or approval is valid and has not lapsed. Site plans,
Special Use Permits and subdivision plats that did not have an expiration date prior to the
adoption of this code shall remain valid for a period of three years from the original
adoption date of the Unified Development Ordinance (April 4, 2005). Site plans,
subdivision plats, Conditional Use Permits, and Special Use Permits that were approved
prior to the original adoption of the Unified Development Ordinance on April 4, 2005 and
the implementation of the stormwater regulations on March 9, 2001 shall expire as listed in
this section or when vested rights for stormwater approvals expire, whichever occurs first.
No site plan or preliminary subdivision plat approved prior to March 9, 2001 that would be
subject to stormwater requirements shall be valid after March 9, 2006 due to the expiration
of stormwater vested rights.
3. No provision of this Ordinance shall require any change in the plans, construction or
designated use of any structure for which a building permit has been issued prior to April 4,
2005.
4. The Planning and Community Development Director may renew or extend the time of a
previous approval if the proposed project complies with all the requirements of this
Ordinance. Any extension granted shall not exceed one year in length, and no more than one
extension shall be granted. Any re-application for an expired project approval shall meet the
standards in effect at the time of re-application.
5. All pending projects for which a complete application was submitted and accepted by the
City prior to the effective date of this Ordinance shall be exempt from complying with the
provisions of this Ordinance and shall comply with the development standards in effect at
the time of the acceptance of the completed application.
6. Any legal nonconformity under the previous ordinances will also be a legal nonconformity
under this Ordinance, as long as the situation that resulted in the nonconforming status
under the previous ordinance continues to exist. If nonconformity under the previous
ordinance becomes conforming because of the adoption of this Ordinance, then the
situation will no longer be nonconforming.
1-5
7/31/2007
7. When a lot is used for a purpose that was a lawful use before the effective date of this
Ordinance, and this Ordinance no longer classifies such use as either a permitted use or
special use in the general use zoning district in which it is located, such use shall be
considered nonconforming and shall be controlled by the provisions of Section 5.6
(Nonconforming Situations) of this Ordinance.
8. Where any building, structure or lot that existed on the effective date of this Ordinance does
not meet all standards set forth in this Ordinance, such building, structure, or lot shall be
considered nonconforming and shall be controlled by the provisions of Section 5.6
(Nonconforming Situations) of this Ordinance.

2.2 CONDITIONAL AND SPECIAL USE APPROVAL
2.2.1 PERMITS REQUIRED
The use of a property may not be changed, clearing, grading or excavation commenced and buildings or
other structures constructed, erected, moved or altered except in accordance with and pursuant to one
of the following approvals:
1. A special use permit issued by the Goldsboro Board of Adjustment
2. A conditional use permit issued by the Goldsboro City Council
3. A sign permit issued by the Inspections Department
4. A site plan approved by the City Council or Planning Department.
Agriculture, mining or forestry activities are exempt from the above permit requirements except as
provided for in this Code.
Special use permits, conditional use permits and sign permits are issued under this Ordinance only
when the application and necessary plans have been submitted and indicate that the development will
comply with the provisions of this Ordinance. Such plans and applications as are finally approved are
incorporated into any permit issued. All development shall occur strictly in accordance with approved
plans and applications.
All permits shall be issued in the name of the applicant or the principal, if submitted by an agent. The
permit shall identify the property involved, the proposed use, incorporate by reference the plans
submitted and contain any special conditions or requirements lawfully imposed by the permit issuing
authority.
2.2.2 NO OCCUPANCY, USE OR SALE OF LOTS UNTIL REQUIREMENTS
FULFILLED
Issuance of a conditional use or special use permit authorizes the applicant to commence the activity
resulting in a change in use of the land or, with a building permit, to construct, erect, move or alter
buildings or other structures or to make necessary improvements to a subdivision. However, except as
provided in Section 2.12 (Improvement Guarantees), the intended use shall not be commenced, no
building shall be occupied and in the case of subdivisions, no lots shall be sold until all of the
requirements of this Ordinance and all additional requirements imposed pursuant to the issuance of a
conditional use or special use permit have been complied with.
2-4 7/31/2007
2.2.3 WHO MAY SUBMIT PERMIT APPLICATIONS/SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS?
Applications for rezoning, special use, conditional use or sign permits and subdivision plat approval will
be accepted only from persons having the legal authority to take action in accordance with the permit
or subdivision plat approval. By way of illustration, this means that applications should be made by the
owners, their agents, lessees or persons who have contracted to purchase the property contingent upon
permit approval. The Director of Planning and Community Development may require an applicant to
submit evidence of his authority to make the application, whenever there appears to be a reasonable
basis for questioning this authority.
2.2.4 APPLICATION DEADLINES
All applications for permits, site plan and subdivision approvals shall be submitted to the respective
boards and commissions as follows:
Planning Commission Two weeks prior to next meeting.
City Council Four weeks prior to next public hearing.
Board of Adjustment Four weeks prior to next public hearing.
Historic Preservation Commission Four weeks prior to next public hearing.
2.2.5 APPLICATIONS TO BE COMPLETE.
All applications and accompanying plans for permits must be complete before the issuing authority will
consider the application. Subject to subsection below, an application is complete when it contains all
the information necessary for the issuing authority to decide whether the development, if completed as
proposed, will comply with all the requirements of this Ordinance.
Detailed or technical design requirements and construction specifications relating to various types of
improvements (streets, sidewalks etc.) are set forth in one or more of the appendices or other sections
of this Ordinance. It is not necessary that the application contain the type of detailed construction
drawings that would be necessary to determine compliance with theses appendices, so long as the plans
provide sufficient information to allow the permit issuing authority to evaluate the application in the
light of the substantive requirements set forth in this Ordinance. However, whenever this Ordinance
requires a certain element of the development to be constructed in accordance with the detailed
requirements set forth in one or more of these appendices, then no construction work on such element
shall begin until detailed construction drawings have been submitted to and been approved by the
Department of Planning and Community Development. Failure to observe this requirement may result
in permit revocation, denial of final plat approval or other penalty as provided in Section 4.0
(Enforcement).
2-5 7/31/2007
2.2.6 STAFF CONSULTATION BEFORE FORMAL APPLICATION.
To minimize development planning costs, avoid misunderstanding or misinterpretation and ensure
compliance with the requirements of this Ordinance, pre-application consultation between the
developer and the planning staff may be required as provided by this Section. The applicant is
encouraged to arrange a pre-application consultation at least ten days prior to the application deadline.
The Director of Planning and Community Development or his designee shall meet with the developer
as soon as possible to review the proposed development plans. Before submitting an application for any
other permit, developers are strongly encouraged to consult with the planning staff concerning the
application of this Ordinance to the proposed development.
2.2.7 STAFF CONSULTATION AFTER THE APPLICATION HAS BEEN SUBMITTED
Upon receipt of a formal application for a special use, conditional use or sign permit approval, the
Director of Planning and Community Development or his designee shall review the application and
confer with the applicant to ensure that he understands the planning staff’s interpretation of the
requirements of this Ordinance, that he has submitted all of the information that he intends to, and that
the application and accompanying plans represents precisely and completely what he proposes to do.
If the application is for a special use or conditional use permit, the Director of Planning and
Community Development shall place the application on the agenda of the appropriate Board when the
applicant indicates the application is as complete as he intends to make it. However, if the Director of
Planning and Community Development believes that the application is incomplete or finds substantial
deficiencies in the submitted plans, he shall reject the application and inform the applicant of its
deficiencies.
2.2.8 SPECIAL USE AND CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS CRITERIA FOR APPROVAL
An application and accompanying plans for a special or conditional use permit shall be submitted to the
Board of Adjustment or City Council by filing a copy of the application with the Administrator in the
Planning and Community Development Department.
Subject to subsection below, the Board of Adjustment or the Council shall issue the requested permit
unless it concludes, based upon the information submitted at the hearing that;
1. The permit request is not within its review authority according to the table of permitted uses;
or
2. The application is incomplete; or
3. If completed as proposed in the application the development will not comply with one or more
requirements of this Ordinance, not including those requirements for which a variance has
2-6 7/31/2007
been granted or those the applicant is not required to comply with under the circumstances
specified in Section 5.6 (Nonconforming Situations).
Even if the permit-issuing Board finds that the application complies with all the other provisions of this
Ordinance, it may still deny the permit if it concludes, based upon information submitted at the hearing
that if completed as proposed the development:
1. Will materially endanger the public health or welfare; or
2. Will substantially injure the beneficial use of adjoining or abutting property; or
3. Will not be in harmony with existing development and uses within the area in which it is
located; or
4. Will not be in general conformity with the Comprehensive Plan, Thoroughfare Plan or other
plan officially adopted by the Council.
2.2.9 PUBLIC HEARING REQUIRED
Before the City Council or Board of Adjustment makes a final determination on special or conditional
use permits a public hearing shall be held in accordance with the procedures detailed in Section 3.2
(Quasi-Judicial Hearing Procedures).
2.2.10 RECOMMENDATIONS ON SPECIAL USE PERMIT APPLICATIONS
When presented to the Board of Adjustment at the hearing, the application for a special use permit shall
be accompanied by a report setting forth the planning staff’s findings concerning the application’s
compliance with the requirements of this Ordinance as well as any staff recommendations for
additional requirements to be imposed by the Board of Adjustment.
If the staff proposes a finding or conclusion that the application fails to comply with any of the
requirements of this Ordinance, it shall identify the requirement in question and specifically state the
reasons supporting such a finding or conclusion.
2.2.11 RECOMMENDATIONS ON CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT APPLICATIONS
Following a joint public hearing of the Council and Planning Commission, an application for a
conditional use permit shall be referred to the Planning Commission for action in accordance with this
Section.
When presented to the Planning Commission, the application for a conditional use permit shall be
accompanied by a report (verbal or written) setting forth the planning staff’s findings concerning the
application’s compliance with the requirements of this Ordinance as well as any staff recommendations
for additional requirements to be imposed by the Council. If the staff report proposes a finding or
2-7 7/31/2007
conclusion that the application fails to comply with any of the requirements of this Ordinance, it shall
identify the requirement in question and specifically state the reasons supporting such a finding or
conclusion.
The Planning Commission shall consider the application and supporting staff reports in a timely
fashion and may, for clarification purposes, request additional information from the applicant or
members of the public. After reviewing the application, the Planning Commission shall report to the
Council whether it concurs in whole or in part with the staff’s findings and proposed conditions. To the
extent that there are differences, the Planning Commission shall propose its own recommendations and
state the reasons supporting such a finding or recommendation. In response to the Planning
Commission’s recommendations, the applicant may modify his application prior to submission to the
Council. The planning staff may likewise revise its recommendations.
2.2.12 CITY COUNCIL ACTION ON CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS
In considering whether to approve an application for a conditional use permit, the Council shall
proceed according to the following format:
1. The Council shall consider whether the application complies with all the applicable
requirements of this Ordinance. If a motion to this effect passes, the Council need not make
further findings concerning such requirements and may issue the permit. If such a motion fails
or is not made, a motion shall be made that the application be found not in compliance with
one or more of the requirements of this Ordinance. Such a motion shall specify the
requirements that have not been met.
2. If the Council concludes that the application complies with all other provisions of this
Ordinance, it may still deny the application for one or more of the reasons specified in Section
2.2.8 (Special Use and Conditional Use Permits Criteria for Approval). Such a motion shall
propose specific findings, based upon the evidence submitted, justifying such a conclusion.
The Council vote need only achieve a simple majority of the members present to reach a decision.
2.2.13 BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT ACTION ON SPECIAL USE PERMITS
In considering whether to approve an application for a special use permit, the Board of Adjustment
shall proceed in the same manner as the Council when considering a conditional use permit, except that
the format of the Board of Adjustment proceedings will differ as a result of the four-fifths voting
requirement set forth in Section 8.2 (Board of Adjustment).
1. The Board shall consider whether the application complies with all of the applicable
requirements of this Ordinance. If a motion to this effect passes by the necessary four-fifths
vote, the Board need not make any further findings and may issue the permit. If such a motion
is not made or fails to receive the required four-fifths vote, then a motion shall be made that
the application is not in compliance with one or more of the requirements of this Ordinance.
Such a motion shall specify the requirements the application failed to meet.
2-8 7/31/2007
2. If the Board concludes that the application complies with all other provisions of this
Ordinance, it may still deny the application for one or more of the reasons specified in Section
2.2.8 (Special Use and Conditional Use Permits Criteria for Approval). Such a motion shall
propose specific findings, based upon the evidence submitted, justifying such a conclusion.
2.2.14 ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS ON SPECIAL USE AND CONDITIONAL USE
PERMITS
In granting a special use or conditional use permit, the issuing Board may attach to the permit
additional reasonable requirements beyond the provisions in this Ordinance, to ensure that the
development in its proposed location:
1. Will not materially endanger the public health, safety or welfare; or
2. Will not substantially injure the beneficial use of adjoining or abutting property; or
3. Will be in harmony with existing development and uses within the area in which it is located; or
4. Will be in general conformity with the Comprehensive Plan, Thoroughfare Plan or other plan
officially adopted by the Council.
The permit issuing Board may not attach additional conditions that modify or alter the specific
requirements set forth in this Ordinance, unless the development in question presents extraordinary
circumstances. Extraordinary circumstances may include unexpected conditions that negatively affect
nearby residential uses or previously unrecognized external consequences that require mitigation. All
additional conditions or requirements shall be entered on the permit and are enforceable in the same
manner and same extent as any other requirement of this Ordinance.
Without limiting the foregoing, the permit issuing Board may attach to a permit a condition limiting the
permit to a specified duration.
2.2.15 MAINTENANCE OF REQUIRED COMMON AREAS, IMPROVEMENTS AND
FACILITIES
The recipient of any sign, special use permit, subdivision approval, site plan approval or conditional use
permit or his successor, shall be responsible for maintaining all common areas, improvements and
facilities required by this Ordinance or any permit issued in accordance with its provisions, except those
areas, improvements and facilities with respect to which an offer of dedication to the public has been
accepted by the appropriate public authority.
2.2.16 COMPLETING DEVELOPMENTS IN PHASES
If a development is constructed in phases in accordance with this Section the provisions of Section
2.2.2 (No Occupancy, Use or Sale of Lots until Requirements Fulfilled) and Section 2.12 (Improvement
Guarantees) shall apply to each phase as if it were the entire development.
2-9 7/31/2007
The developer shall submit plans that clearly show the various phases of the proposed development
and that the requirements of this Ordinance will be satisfied by each phase.
If a development that is to be built in phases includes improvements that are designed to be used or
benefit the entire development, then, as part of his application for development approval, the developer
shall submit a proposed schedule for the completion of such improvements. The schedule shall relate
completion of such improvements to completion of one or more phases of the entire development.
Once a schedule has been approved and made part of the permit, no land may be used, no building
occupied and no subdivision lot sold except in accordance with the schedule approved as part of the
permit and/or the requirements imposed by Section 2.12 (Improvement Guarantees).
2.2.17 EXPIRATION OF PERMITS
Special & conditional use permits and sign permits, not approved as part of the vested right certificate
approval process detailed in Section 2.8 (Zoning Vested Rights Certificate Approval), shall expire
automatically if, within one year after the issuance of the permit:
1. The use authorized by such permits has not commenced, in circumstances where no substantial
(i.e. no building permit is needed) construction, alteration, demolition or similar work is
necessary before commencement of such use; or
2. Less than ten percent of the total cost stated on the permit application (as determined by the
Inspections Department) of all construction, alteration, demolition or similar work on any
development authorized by such permits has been completed on the site. With respect to
phased development, this requirement shall apply only to the first phase.
The Planning Director may grant a one-time extension of up to six (6) months from the original
expiration date provided the owner or owner’s agent submits a written request for an extension at least
thirty (30) days prior to the expiration date.
If after some physical alteration to land or structures begins and work is discontinued for a period of six
consecutive months, then the special use, conditional use or sign permit authorizing such work shall
immediately expire. However, expiration of the permit shall not affect the provisions of Section 2.2.18
(Effect of Permit on Successors and Assigns).
After approval of a site specific development plan and vested rights certificate, if no substantial physical
alteration to land or structures has begun or the permitted use has not commenced, conditional use
permits and special use permits shall expire at the end of the two-year vesting period established in
accordance with Section 2.8 (Zoning Vested Rights Certificate Approval). Substantial shall mean either
1) installation and approval of on-site infrastructure or 2) lawful continuous grading activity that has not
ceased for a period of thirty (30) days or longer.
All permits for conditional and special uses shall become invalid if the use for which the permit was
issued is discontinued, abandoned or ceases for one hundred and eighty consecutive days.
For purposes of this Section, the special use permit within the jurisdiction of the Board of Adjustment
is issued when the Board votes to approve the application and issues the permit. A conditional use
2-10 7/31/2007
permit within the jurisdiction of the City Council is issued when the Council votes to approve the
application and issues the permit. A zoning or sign permit within the jurisdiction of the Administrator is
issued when the earlier of the following takes places:
1. A copy of the fully executed permit is delivered to the permit recipient. Delivery is
accomplished when the permit is hand delivered or mailed to the applicant; or
2. The Administrator notifies the applicant that the application has been approved and that all
that remains for a fully executed permit to be delivered is for the applicant to take certain
actions, such as having the permit executed by the property owner so it can be recorded under
Section 2.2.19 (Effect of Permit on Successors and Assigns).
Notwithstanding any of the provisions of Section 5.6 (Nonconforming Situations), this Section shall be
applicable to permits issued prior to the date this Section becomes effective.
2.2.18 EFFECTS OF PERMIT ON SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS
Special use, conditional use and sign permits authorize the permittee to make use of the land and
structures in a particular way. Such permits are transferable. However, so long as the land, structures or
any portion thereof covered under a permit continues to be used for the purposes for which the permit
was granted, then:
1. No person shall make use of the land or structures covered under the permit except in
accordance with all the terms and requirements of that permit; and
2. The terms and requirements of the permit apply to and restrict the use of the land or structures
covered under the permit, not only with respect to all persons having any interest in the
property at the time the permit was obtained, but also to persons who subsequently obtain an
interest in all or part of the covered property and wish to use it for a purpose other than that
for which the permit was originally issued, so long as the person(s) who subsequently obtained
an interest in the property had actual or record notice (as provided for below) of the existence
of the permit at the time they acquired their interest.
2.2.19 AMENDMENTS TO AND MODIFICATIONS OF PERMITS
A developer/landowner requesting modifications to an approved permit shall submit a written request,
describing and identifying the proposed changes, to the Administrator. Approval of all changes must be
given in writing. The Administrator shall determine into which category the proposed modifications
fall:
1. Insignificant deviation – A deviation is insignificant if it has no discernable impact on
neighboring properties, the public or those intended to occupy or use the proposed
development. Typical deviations may include small adjustments in the location of utilities,
roadways, landscaping or structures to accommodate physical site conditions. No insignificant
deviation shall require a variance from the requirements of this Ordinance. The Administrator
without a formal application, public hearing or payment of an additional fee may approve this
category.
2-11 7/31/2007
2. Minor design modification – A modification that has no substantial impact on neighboring
properties, the public or those intended to occupy or use the proposed development. Typical
design modifications may include relocating internal intersections, adjusting parking locations,
small design adjustments to the building footprint or elevation, small modifications to the
stormwater control system or landscaping plan. No minor design modification shall require a
variance from any requirement of this Ordinance. The Administrator, without a formal
application, public hearing or payment of an additional fee may approve this category.
3. Major design modification - All other requests for major changes in approved plans will be
processed as new applications. If such requests are required to be acted upon by the Council or
Board of Adjustment, new conditions may be imposed in accordance with Section 2.2.16
(Additional Requirements on Special and Conditional Use Permits). The applicant retains the
right to reject such additional conditions by withdrawing his request for an amendment and
may proceed in accordance with the previously issued permit. This category will be treated as a
new application and shall require a formal application, an additional public hearing and the
payment of additional fees.
A vested right established in accordance with Section 2.8 (Zoning Vested Rights Certificate Approval)
shall not be extended by any amendment or modification to an approved site-specific development plan
unless expressly provided for by the City Council.
2.2.20 REHEARING
Whenever the Administrator denies a zoning or sign permit, on any basis other than a failure of the
applicant to submit a completed application, such action may be appealed to the Board of Adjustment
by the person aggrieved within thirty days of the notification to deny the permit by following the
procedures described in Section 3.1 (Appeals, Variances and Interpretations).
Whenever the City Council denies a conditional use permit or the Board of Adjustment denies a special
use permit or variance, on any basis other than the failure of the applicant to submit a completed
application, such action shall not be reconsidered by the respective issuing authority for a period of six
months unless the applicant clearly demonstrates that:
1. Circumstances affecting the property have substantially changed; or
2. New information is available that could not, with reasonable diligence, have been presented at
the previous hearing. A request to be heard on this basis must be filed within thirty days of the
notification of the decision to deny the first application. However, such a request does not
extend the period within which an official legal appeal must be filed with the superior court.
(See Section 3.2.7 - Judicial review).
Notwithstanding subsection above, the Council, Board of Adjustment or Administrator may at any time
consider a new application affecting the same property as an application previously denied. A new
application is one that the City Council has determined differs in some substantial way from the one
previously considered. For the purposes of determining fees, resubmission of an application shall be
treated as a new application subject to new fees.

2.3 SUBDIVISION APPROVAL
2.3.1 REGULATION OF SUBDIVISION
Major subdivisions are subject to a two-step approval process including:
1. Physical improvements to the land being subdivided are authorized by a preliminary
subdivision plat. Preliminary subdivision plats shall follow the approval process as provided in
Section 2.3.4 of this Ordinance;
2. Sale of lots is permitted after final plat approval as provided in Section 2.3.9 (Major subdivision
final plat approval process).
Minor subdivisions require a one-step approval process, final plat approval in accordance with Section
2.3.4 (Minor subdivision final plat approval process).
2.3.2 NO SUBDIVISION WITHOUT PLAT APPROVAL
As provided in GS 160A-375, no person shall subdivide land except in accordance with all of the
provisions of this Ordinance. In particular, no person shall subdivide land unless a final plat of the
subdivision has been approved in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.3.8 (Minor subdivision
final plat approval process) or Section 2.3.9 (major subdivision final plat approval process) and
recorded in the Wayne County Registry.
Whenever a final plat is approved to authorize development, nothing authorized by the final plat
approval shall be done until the owner of the property records the plat in the Wayne County Registry,
indexed under the book of maps and page number and returns a copy of the recorded plat to the
Planning and Community Development Department.
As provided in GS 160A-373, the Wayne County Register of Deeds shall not record a plat of any
subdivision within the City’s planning jurisdiction unless the plat has been approved in accordance with
the provisions of this Ordinance.
2.3.3 EXCEPTIONS TO SUBDIVISION PLAT APPROVAL
The following activities are not required to undertake or follow the City’s subdivision approval process.
However, lots created under these exemptions shall fulfill all of the dimensional, size and other zoning
requirements of this Ordinance. (Such as minimum lot sizes, road frontage, setbacks etc.) It is highly
recommended that all exceptions to the subdivision process be reviewed by the Planning and
Community Development Department for conformity with the City’s subdivision regulations. Failure
to do so may result in the recordation of non-conforming or illegal lots that may not be suitable for
new construction.
1. The division of land to settle an estate where the resultant lots are equal to or exceed the
standards of the City as shown in this Ordinance.
2-13 7/31/2007
2. The combination or recombination of portions of previously subdivided and recorded lots if
the total number of lots is not increased and the resultant lots are equal to or exceed the
standards of the City as shown in this Ordinance.
3. The division of land into parcels greater than 10 acres if no street right-of-way dedication is
involved.
4. The public acquisition by purchase of strips of land for widening or opening streets.
5. The division of a tract in single ownership the entire area of which is no greater than two acres,
into not more than three lots, if no street right-of-way dedication is involved and if the
resultant lots are equal to or exceed the standards of the City as shown in this Ordinance.
2.3.4 ACTION ON MAJOR SUBDIVISION PRELIMINARY PLATS
Preliminary subdivision plats subject to City Council approval shall be reviewed by the Planning
Commission prior to City Council action. After reviewing the recommendation of the Planning
Commission and City staff, the City Council shall approve or reject the application.
The City Council may approve a preliminary plat if it meets the standards and requirements of this
Ordinance and provides for the dedications and improvements, or payments and guarantees in lieu
thereof, required by this Ordinance.
The City Council may reject the preliminary plat on any of the following grounds:
1. That it fails to fully comply with all applicable requirements of this Ordinance;
2. That it fails to adequately protect other property, or residential uses located on the same or
adjacent property, from the potential adverse effects of a residential or non-residential use;
3. That it fails to provide harmony and unity with the development of nearby properties;
4. That it fails to provide safe conditions for pedestrians or motorists, such as a dangerous
arrangement of pedestrian and vehicular ways; or
5. That it fails to provide safe ingress and egress for emergency services to the site.
The City Council may require additional road widening, road construction, traffic signals, restricted
driveways, interconnectivity or other improvements if, in the opinion of the City Council, such
improvements are necessary to provide safe conditions for pedestrians, motorists or adjoining
properties.
The City Council may grant modifications to the road construction design standards and other
requirements of Chapter 7 (Subdivision Regulations) provided the modifications will not cause any
adverse impacts on the subject property or adjacent properties in the area.
2-14 7/31/2007
If the City Council rejects the preliminary plat, then the reasons therefore shall be stated in the record
of action on the plat.
2.3.5 CHANGES TO PREVIOUSLY APPROVED PRELIMINARY PLATS
The Planning and Community Development Director shall have the authority to approve revisions to a
previously approved preliminary plat, provided the following conditions are met:
1. That all changes conform to the minimum required standards for the zoning district in which
the property is located;
2. That the effect of the landscaping, buffers, or screening on the site, or on the approved
preliminary plat, is not diminished;
3. That the number of access points to public streets is neither increased nor substantially
relocated;
4. That the circulation pattern provides for the safe, controlled, and orderly flow of pedestrians
and vehicles;
5. That the changes do not otherwise violate any provision of this Ordinance, the City Code, or
other applicable laws; and
6. That the use and development of the property is otherwise in full compliance with the
requirements of this Ordinance.
The Director shall reserve the authority to refer any proposed changes to a preliminary plat to the City
Council if he feels any of the above standards are not being met.
2.3.6 FAILURE OF CITY COUNCIL TO ACT
Failure of the City Council to act on the preliminary plat within 90 days of receiving the preliminary plat
and recommendations from the Planning Commission shall be deemed denial of the preliminary plat.
2.3.7 EFFECT AND DURATION OF PRELIMINARY SUBDIVISION PLAT APPROVAL
Preliminary plat approval shall remain valid for two years from the date of approval, unless an
associated conditional use permit expires, in which case, the preliminary plat shall also expire.
Preliminary subdivision plans commenced within the two-year period shall have all phases of the
subdivision completed within five years of preliminary plat approval.

4. The entire tract to be subdivided is three acres or less in size.
The Planning and Community Development Director or his designee shall approve or disapprove
minor subdivision final plats in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance.
The applicant for minor subdivision plat approval, before complying with the subsection below, shall
submit a preliminary plan to the Planning and Community Development Director for a determination
of whether the approval process authorized by this Section may be and should be utilized. The Planning
and Community Development Director may require the applicant to submit whatever information is
necessary to make this determination, including, but not limited to, a copy of the tax map showing the
land being subdivided and all the lots previously subdivided from that tract within the previous five
years.
Applicants for minor subdivision approval shall submit to the Planning and Community Development
Director a copy of a minor subdivision plat conforming to the requirements set forth in Appendix A.
The Planning and Community Development Director shall take expeditious action on an application
for a minor subdivision plat approval. However, either the Planning and Community Development
Director or the applicant may at any time refer the application to the major subdivision approval
process.
Not more than three (3) lots shall be created out of one tract using the minor subdivision approval
process, regardless of whether the lots are created at one time or over an extended period of two (2)
years.
If the subdivision fulfills all the requirements of this Ordinance, the Planning and Community
Development Director shall approve it. If the subdivision does not fulfill one or more of the
requirements of this Ordinance, the Planning and Community Development Director shall furnish the
applicant with a written statement of the reasons for its disapproval.
2.3.9 MAJOR SUBDIVISION PLAT FINAL PLAT APPROVAL PROCESS
A major subdivision is defined as a subdivision where any one or more of the following exist:

2-16 7/31/2007
2. The entire tract to be subdivided is greater than three (3) acres; or
3. The resultant subdivision will create four (4) or more lots.
The Planning and Community Development Director or his designee shall approve the final plat unless
he finds that the plat or the proposed subdivision fails to comply with one or more of the requirements
of this Ordinance or that the final plat differs substantially from the plans and specifications approved
in conjunction with the preliminary plat that authorized the development of the subdivision.
Applicants for major subdivision approval shall submit to the Planning and Community Development
Director a copy of a major subdivision final plat conforming to the requirements set forth in Appendix
A. If the Planning and Community Development Director disapproves the final plat, the applicant shall
be furnished a written statement of the reasons for disapproval.
2.3.10 PLAT APPROVAL NOT ACCEPTANCE OF DEDICATION OFFERS
Approval of a final plat does not constitute acceptance by the City of the offer of dedication of any
streets, sidewalks, parks or other public facilities shown on a plat. However, the City may accept any
such offer of dedication by resolution of the Council or by actually exercising control over and
maintaining such facilities.
2.3.11 PLACEMENT OF PERMANENT REFERENCE POINTS
Prior to the approval of the final plat, permanent reference points shall have been placed in accordance
with the following requirements.
1. Subdivision corner tie - At least one control corner of the subdivision shall be designed by
course and distance (tie) from a readily discernible reference marker. If a corner is within 2,000
feet of a U.S. Coast and Geodetic Station or N. C. Grid System coordinated monument or City
coordinated system, then this corner shall be marked with a monument so designated by
computed X and Y coordinates which shall appear on the map with a statement identifying this
station or monument and to an accuracy of 1:10,000. When such a monument or station is not
available, the tie shall be made to a pertinent, readily recognizable landmark, identifiable point,
physical object or structure.

corners shall be installed. All monuments shall be constructed of concrete and shall be at least
four inches in diameter or square and not less than three feet in length. Each monument shall
be imbedded in the ground and flush with its top to serve as the point, a copper or bronze wire
at least four inches in length and not less than .3249 (#0) in diameter. Such monument shall be
set at least 30 inches in the ground with at least six inches exposed above the ground unless
this requirement is impractical because of traffic or other factors. The surveyor shall employ
additional monuments when required.
3. Property markers - A steel or wrought iron pipe or the equivalent not less than three-fourths
inches in diameter and at least 30 inches in length shall be set at all corners, except those
located by monuments. A marker shall be set at a point of curve, point of intersection, property
2-17 7/31/2007
corner, point of tangency, reference point and tangent unless a monument has already been
placed at these points. Additional markers shall be placed at other points of importance when
required.

dwellings, shall be approved by the City Council. The City Council shall not exercise the authority
granted in this Section, until the Planning Commission has made its recommendations. Residential
developments on parcels that disturb one (1) acre or less shall be approved by the Planning Director.
Notwithstanding the above, the Director shall at all times reserve the right to refer a new or revised site
plan to the City Council for action where either of the following conditions is met:
1. The site plan seeks allowable deviations from the standards of this Ordinance; or
2. Due to its size and/or location, the Director feels the project will have significant negative
impacts on the community.
The Director may also seek input from other boards and commissions to assist in making a decision on
whether to approve or deny a site plan request.
The Director shall reserve the authority to refer any site plan to the City Council for approval.
2.4.2 DEVELOPMENT REQUIRING SITE PLAN APPROVAL
The following development shall be required to secure site plan approval prior to the issuance of a
building permit or the initiation of site improvement:
1. Nonresidential, manufactured home park and multi-family development not otherwise required
to undergo the subdivision review process as defined in Section 2.3 (Subdivision Approval).
2.4.3 SITE PLANS ASSOCIATED WITH CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS
Where a use requiring site plan approval also requires the approval of a conditional use permit, the
same body (i.e. City Council) that approves the conditional use permit shall also approve the site plan.
Site plan approval for projects that are required to receive a conditional use permit shall follow the same
process as the conditional use permit process.
2-19 7/31/2007
2.4.4 ACTION ON SITE PLANS APPROVED BY THE PLANNING AND
COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT DIRECTOR
The Planning and Community Development Director shall approve the site plan provided that the

4. That it provides safe conditions for pedestrians or motorists and prevents a dangerous
arrangement of pedestrian and vehicular ways
5. That it provides safe ingress and egress for emergency services to site.
The Director may defer the decision on the site plan to the City Council when he or she deems that any
of the above standards may not be met by the proposed plan. The Director may also choose to seek
input from other Boards and Commissions to assist in making a final decision.
If the Planning and Community Development Director rejects the site plan, then the reasons therefore
shall be stated in the record of action on the site plan.
2.4.5 ACTION ON SITE PLANS APPROVED BY THE CITY COUNCIL
Site plans subject to City Council approval shall be reviewed by the Planning Commission prior to City
Council action. After reviewing the recommendation of the Planning Commission and City staff, the

site plan approval within 90 days of receiving the site plan shall be deemed denial of the site plan.
2.4.9 EFFECT AND DURATION OF SITE PLAN APPROVAL
Site plan approval shall remain valid for one year from the date of approval, unless the associated
conditional use permit expires, in which case, the site plan shall expire also. Site plans approved in
connection with a vested right shall be approved for a period not to exceed five (5) years.
2-22 7/31/2007
2.5 CONDITIONAL DISTRICT REZONING APPROVAL
2.5.1 PURPOSE
Conditional zoning districts (CD) are zoning districts in which the development and use of the property
is subject to predetermined ordinance standards and the rules, regulations, and conditions imposed as
part of the legislative decision creating the district and applying it to the particular property.
A conditional zoning district allows particular uses to be established only in accordance with specific
standards and conditions pertaining to each individual development project. Some land uses are of such
a nature or scale that they have significant impacts on both the immediately surrounding area and on
the entire community, which cannot be predetermined and controlled by general district standards.
There are also circumstances in which a general district designation allowing such a use by right would
not be appropriate for a particular property even though the use itself could, if properly planned, be
appropriate for the property consistent with the objectives of these regulations and the adopted
Comprehensive Land Use Plan. The review process established in this Part provides for the
accommodation of such uses by a reclassification of property into a conditional zoning district, subject
to specific conditions, which ensure compatibility of the use with the use and enjoyment of neighboring
properties.
2.5.2 CONDITIONAL DISTRICTS ESTABLISHED
A parallel conditional zoning district is a conditional zoning district in which the potential permitted use
or uses are, except as limited by the conditions imposed on the district, of the same character or type as
the use or uses permitted in a general district having a parallel designation or name. The following
parallel zoning district categories are conditional zoning districts:
Agricultural – AG CD Office-Residence – OR CD
Residential – R-40 CD Office and Institutional – O&I-1 CD
Residential – R-20A CD Office and Institutional – O&I-2 CD
Residential – R-20 CD Neighborhood Business – NB CD
Residential – R-16 CD Central Business District – CBD CD
Residential – R-12SF CD Highway Business – HB CD
Residential – R-12 CD Shopping Center – SC CD
Residential – R-9SF CD General Business – GB CD
Residential – R-9 CD Airport Business – AB CD
Residential – R-6SF CD Light Industry – I-1 CD
Residential – R-6 CD General Industry – I-2 CD
Residential – RM-9 CD
Residential – RM-8 CD
The Planned Industrial and Business Park districts do not have a corresponding CD.
2-23 7/31/2007
2.5.3 PROCEDURE
A rezoning to a CD shall be initiated only by an application signed by all the owners of the property or
by an agent who has written authorization from all of the owners to file such application for such
amendment.
The applicant shall submit an application for a CD along with a site plan that shall specify the use or
uses that are intended for the property, as well as any additional conditions on the use of the property
that the applicant proposes. The conditions may include, but shall not be limited to the location of uses
on the site; number of dwelling units; location and extent of accessory and support facilities, such as
sidewalks, parking, driveways, access streets; the extent and character of buffer areas; the location,
character and extent of open space; the height of any structure; or the timing of the development. The
City Council may waive the site plan requirement at the time of rezoning provided a site plan is
approved by the City Council prior to the issuance of any construction approvals. A public hearing is
not required for site plan approval unless specified as a condition of rezoning approval by the City
Council.
All applications for CD’s shall be submitted four weeks prior to the date of the next regularly scheduled
meeting at which public hearings are held and applications reviewed.
2.5.4 STAFF CONSULTATION BEFORE FORMAL APPLICATION
To minimize development and planning costs, avoid misunderstanding or misinterpretation and ensure
compliance with the requirements of this Ordinance, pre-application consultation between the
developer and the planning staff may be required as provided by this Section. The applicant is
encouraged to arrange a pre-application consultation at least ten days prior to the application deadline.
The Planning and Community Development Director or his designee shall meet with the developer as
soon as possible to review the conditional district application. Before submitting an application for any
other permit, developers are strongly encouraged to consult with the planning staff concerning the
application of this Ordinance to the proposed development.
2.5.5 STAFF REPORT
The planning staff shall review each CD rezoning request in light of the approval criteria listed in the
Section below and provide to the City Council and/or Planning Commission its recommendation
regarding whether to approve or deny the CD rezoning.
2.5.6 APPROVAL OF CONDITIONAL DISTRICT REZONING
Conditional zoning district decisions are a legislative process subject to judicial review using the same
procedures and standard of review as apply to general use district zoning decisions. Conditional zoning
district decisions shall be made in consideration of identified relevant adopted land use plans for the
area, including, but not limited to, comprehensive plans, strategic plans, district plans, area plans,
neighborhood plans, corridor plans, and other land-use policy documents. In considering any petition
for a conditional zoning district, the Council shall, after receiving the report and recommendation of
the Planning Commission, consider the reports and recommendations of the Planning Commission, the
Planning Commission staff, and other departments. Within ninety (90) days of the public hearing the
2-24 7/31/2007
City Council shall either reject the proposed amendment or adopt an ordinance enacting the proposed
amendment with or without modifications.
In approving an amendment to reclassify property to a conditional zoning district, and with the consent
of the petitioner, the City Council may change the existing classification of the property, or any part of
the property covered by the petition, to the classification requested, to a classification or classifications
between the existing and the requested classifications, or to any higher classification in the hierarchy of
zoning districts established in Section 5.1. This action may occur without the withdrawal or
modification of the petition or further public hearings.
In approving a petition for the reclassification of property to a conditional zoning district, the
Planning Commission may recommend, and the City Council request, that reasonable and appropriate
conditions be attached to approval of the petition. Any such conditions should relate to the relationship
of the proposed use to surrounding property, proposed support facilities such as parking areas and
driveways, pedestrian and vehicular circulation systems, screening and buffer areas, the timing of
development, street and right-of-way improvements, water and sewer improvements, storm water
drainage, the provision of open space, and other matters that the City Council may find appropriate or
the petitioner may propose. Such conditions to approval of the petition may include dedication to the
City, County or State, as appropriate, of any rights-of-way or easements for streets, water, sewer, or
other public utilities necessary to serve the proposed development. A rezoning to a CD is subject to the
protest petition provisions as detailed in Section 3.3.4 of this code.
2.5.7 EFFECT OF APPROVAL
(1) If a petition for conditional zoning is approved, the development and use of the property shall be
governed by the ordinance requirements of the parallel general zoning district except those
superseded by specific conditions, the approved site plan for the district, and any additional
approved rules, regulations, and conditions, all of which shall constitute the zoning regulations for
the approved district and are binding on the property as an amendment to these regulations and to
the Zoning Maps.
(2) If a petition is approved, the petitioner shall comply with all requirements for obtaining a building
permit and certificate of occupancy. Only those uses and structures indicated in the approved
petition and site plan shall be allowed on the subject property. A change of location of the
structures may be authorized pursuant to Section 2.5.13 (Alterations to Approval). The changes to
the site plan layout shall not increase the number of structures.
(3) Following the approval of the petition for a conditional zoning district, the subject property shall
be identified on the Zoning Maps by the appropriate district designation. A parallel conditional
zoning shall be identified by the same designation as the underlying general district followed by the
letters "CD" (for example "R-12 CD").
(4) Any conditional zoning district approved on or after October 1, 1991, shall have vested rights
pursuant to N.C.G.S. Section 160A-385.1 for the period of time established pursuant to this
Zoning Ordinance, except as such vested rights may be altered as allowed by N.C.G.S. Section
160A-385.1(e). Vested rights shall remain effective beyond the end of the period of time established
pursuant to Section 2.8 of this Ordinance for any buildings or uses for which a valid building
2-25 7/31/2007
permit had been issued during the vested rights period, so long as such building permit is valid.
Notwithstanding, the foregoing, property governed by this subsection shall not include as a
permitted use an adult establishment or sexually-oriented business, unless the approved site plan
explicitly provides that an adult establishment or sexually-oriented business is a permitted use.
(5) Properties that receive Conditional District approval shall commence construction within two years
of rezoning to a Conditional District. If no activity is commenced within two years of rezoning,
then the approvals associated with the Conditional District shall be considered null and void and a
new Conditional District shall be required to be approved by the City Council.
2.5.8 APPROVAL CRITERIA
In deciding whether to approve a Conditional District rezoning, the Planning Commission and the City
Council shall consider the following factors:
1. The proposed rezoning corrects an error or meets the challenge of some changing condition,
trend or fact;
2. The proposed rezoning is compatible with the City of Goldsboro Comprehensive Plan and
accompanying Land Use Plan Map;
3. The proposed rezoning and the range of uses permitted in the requested zoning district are
compatible with the surrounding zoning patterns and land uses;
4. The City or other service providers will be able to provide adequate public facilities and
services intended to serve the subject property, including but not limited to roadways, public
transportation, parks and recreational facilities, police and fire protection, schools, stormwater
drainage systems, water supplies, and wastewater treatment and garbage services;
5. The proposed reclassification will not adversely affect a known archaeological, environmental,
historical, or cultural resource; and
6. The proposed rezoning will not impair or injure the health, safety and general welfare of the
public.
2.5.9 PUBLIC HEARING REQUIRED
Before the City Council makes a final determination on any CD rezoning, a public hearing shall be held
in accordance with the procedures detailed in Section 3.3 (Legislative Hearing Procedures).
2.5.10 STAFF AND PLANNING COMMISSION REVIEW
The CD request shall be reviewed by the Planning Commission. At the Planning Commission’s
meeting, the staff shall present its recommendation. After taking into account the staff
recommendation, and reviewing all other pertinent information, the Planning Commission shall
formulate a recommendation for the City Council.
2-26 7/31/2007
2.5.11 CITY COUNCIL ACTION ON CONDITIONAL DISTRICTS
After reviewing the reports and recommendations of the City staff and Planning Commission and
considering the views discussed at the public hearing, the City Council shall take one of the following
actions within ninety days of the public hearing:
1. Approve the CD, or
2. Approve the CD, but to a more restrictive district. (See below); or
3. Approve the CD, but with an alteration in the area requested or with additional conditions; or
4. Approve the CD, with a combination of 2 and 3 above; or
5. Reject the proposed CD; or
6. Refer the proposed CD back to the Planning Commission and City staff for further
consideration.
The City Council, with or without a recommendation from the Planning Commission, may rezone the
property to any conditional use zoning district that is classified higher than the requested conditional
use zoning district in the application, but only with the written consent of the applicant. See Section 5.1
(General Use Zoning Districts) for a listing of districts from highest to lowest classification. An
application for rezoning to a general use district shall not be converted into an application for rezoning
to a conditional use district at any point in the application review process, nor shall an application for
rezoning to a conditional use district be converted into an application for rezoning to a general use
district. If such a conversion is desired, the applicant must submit a new application for rezoning to the
other type of district in accordance with the requirements of this ordinance.
2.5.12 REHEARING
No reapplication, connected to the same property or any part thereof, for a rezoning to a CD shall be
filed for a period of six month unless the City Council finds that there has been a substantial change in
the conditions or circumstances bearing on the application.
2.5.13 ALTERATIONS TO APPROVAL
(1) Except as provided in subsection two below, changes to an approved petition or to the
conditions attached to the approved petition shall be treated the same as amendments to these
regulations or to the Zoning Maps and shall be processed in accordance with the procedures in
this Chapter.
(2) The Planning Director or designee shall have the delegated authority to approve an
administrative amendment change to an approved site plan. The standard for approving or
denying such a requested change shall be that the change does not significantly alter the site
plan or its conditions and that the change does not have a significant impact upon abutting
properties as provided for in Section 2.4.6 of this Code. An administrative amendment shall
not be subject to a protest petition pursuant to Section 3.3. Any decision must be in writing
stating the grounds for approval or denial.
2-27 7/31/2007
(3) The Planning Director or designee, however, shall always have the discretion to decline to
exercise the delegated authority either because the designee is uncertain about approval of the
change pursuant to the standard or because a rezoning petition for a public hearing and City
Council consideration is deemed appropriate under the circumstances. If the Planning Director
or designee declines to exercise this authority, then the applicant can only file a rezoning
petition for a public hearing and Council decision.
(4) Any request for an administrative amendment shall be pursuant to a written letter, signed by
the property owner, to the Planning staff detailing the requested change. Upon request, the
applicant must provide any additional information that is requested. Accompanying the letter
shall be the applicable fee for administrative review. Upon an approval of an administrative
amendment, the applicant must file a sufficient number of copies of a revised site plan as
deemed necessary by the Planning Director.
(5) If the Planning Director or designee denies approval of the requested amendment, then the
applicant can appeal that decision to the City Council for its review and decision. An appeal to
Council will require filing a revised application and site plan, submittal of the required filing fee
and another public hearing.
(6) Changes to approved Special Use Permits associated with a Special Use District approved
prior to the adoption of the Unified Development Ordinance shall be treated as a Conditional
District as defined by the UDO and subject to the conditions of this chapter.
Any change that increases the intensity of the development or the residential density shall be approved
by the City Council after a new public hearing.

thirty days after the following occurs:
1. A written copy of the Council’s decision has been filed in the office of the Planning and
Community Development Department; and

2.8 ZONING VESTED RIGHTS CERTIFICATE APPROVAL
2.8.1 PURPOSE
The purpose of this Section is to provide for the establishment of certain vested rights in order to
ensure reasonable certainty, stability and fairness in the land-use planning process and to protect the
reasonable expectations of landowners in recognition that City approval typically follows significant
investment in the form of site evaluation, consultant fees and planning expenses.
2.8.2 ESTABLISHMENT
Pursuant to the provisions of GS 160A-385.1, a statutory zoning vested right is established upon the
approval of a site-specific development plan. A zoning vested right certificate grants the landowner a
right to undertake and complete the development and use of property under the terms and conditions
of an approved site-specific development plan.
A vested right shall be deemed established upon the valid approval or conditional approval, by the City
Council, of a site specific development plan following notice and a public hearing.
The approval of a site-specific development plan with the condition that a variance be obtained shall
not establish a zoning vested right unless and until the necessary variance is obtained. The effective date
of the establishment of the vested right shall be the date on which the variance was granted.
A zoning vested right is not a personal right, but shall attach and run with the land. After approval of a
site-specific development plan, all successors to the original owner shall be entitled to exercise such
rights while applicable.
The City Council may approve a site-specific development plan upon such terms and conditions as may
be reasonably necessary to protect the public health, safety and welfare.
2.8.3 APPROVAL PROCEDURE
A zoning vested right certificate shall be initiated only by an application signed by all the owners of the
property or by an agent authorized by all of the owners to file such application for such certificate.
In order for a zoning vested right certificate to be established upon approval of a site specific
development plan, the applicant must indicate at the time of application, on a form provided by the
City of Goldsboro, that a zoning vested right certificate is being sought.
Each map, plat site plan or other document evidencing a site specific development plan shall contain
the following notation: “Approval of this plan establishes a zoning vested right under GS 160A-385.1.
Unless terminated at an earlier date, the zoning vested right shall be valid until_______.”
All applications for zoning vested right certificates shall be submitted four weeks prior to the date of
the next regularly scheduled meeting at which public hearings are held and applications reviewed.
2-36 7/31/2007
A zoning vested right certificate application shall be processed in accordance with the procedures
established by this Ordinance and shall be considered by the designated issuing authority using the
prescribed process for the specific type of permit or approval for which the zoning vested right
certificate is requested.
Following approval or conditional approval of a site specific development plan, nothing in this
Ordinance shall exempt such a plan from subsequent reviews and approvals to ensure compliance with
the term and conditions of the original approval, provided that such reviews and approvals are not
inconsistent with the original approval.
The establishment of a zoning vested right shall not preclude the application of overlay zoning or
regulations that are general in nature and apply to all property within the City’s jurisdiction. Otherwise,
new or amended regulations shall not be applied to property that is subject to a site-specific
development plan until the expiration or termination of the vested right in accordance with this
Ordinance.
Nothing in this Ordinance shall prohibit the revocation of the original approval or other remedies for
failure to comply with all the applicable terms and conditions of the approval or the Unified
Development Ordinance.
2.8.4 PUBLIC HEARING REQUIRED
A public hearing shall be held in accordance with the procedures detailed in Section 3.3 (Legislative
Hearing Procedures).
2.8.5 STAFF AND PLANNING COMMISSION REVIEW
Following the public hearing, the vested rights certificate request shall be reviewed by the Planning
Commission. At the Planning Commission’s meeting, the staff shall present its recommendation. After
taking into account the staff recommendation, and reviewing all other pertinent information, the
Planning Commission shall formulate a recommendation for the City Council.
2.8.6 CITY COUNCIL ACTIONS ON ZONING VESTED RIGHTS CERTIFICATES
After reviewing the reports and recommendations of the City staff and the Planning Commission and
considering the views discussed at the public hearing, the City Council shall, within ninety days of the
public hearing, based on the information contained in the site specific development plan, do one of the
following:
1. Approve the site-specific development plan; or
2. Approve the site-specific development, with conditions; or
3. Reject the site specific development; or

stated in Section 2.2.20.

two years. This vesting shall not be extended by any amendments or modifications to a site-specific
development plan unless expressly provided by the approval authority at the time the amendment or
modification is approved.
The City of Goldsboro may provide that rights shall be vested for a period exceeding two years but not
exceeding five years where warranted, in light of all relevant circumstances including but not limited to
the size of the development, the level of investment, the need for or desirability of the development,
economic cycles, and market conditions.
A right that has been vested as provided in this Section shall terminate at the end of the vesting period
with respect to buildings and/or uses for which no valid building permits have been issued.
2.8.9 TERMINATION
A zoning right that has been vested as provided in this Ordinance shall terminate:

2. Upon findings by the City Council by ordinance after notice and a public hearing, that natural
or man-made hazards on or in the immediate vicinity of the property, if uncorrected, would
pose a serious threat to the public health, safety, and welfare if the project were to proceed as
contemplated in the site specific development plan; or
3. Upon payment to the affected landowner of compensation for all costs, expenses, and other
losses incurred by the landowner including but not limited to all fees paid in consideration of
financing and all architectural, planning, marketing, legal, and other consultants’ fee incurred
after approval by the City, together with interest thereon at the legal rate until paid.
Compensation shall not include any diminution in the value of the property which is caused by
such action; or
4. Upon findings by the City Council by ordinance after notice and a hearing, that the landowner
or his representative intentionally supplied inaccurate information or made material
misrepresentations that made a difference in the approval by the issuing authority of the site
specific development plan; or
5. Upon the enactment or promulgation of a state or federal law or regulation that precludes
development as contemplated in the site specific development plan, in which case the approval
authority may modify by ordinance after notice and a hearing the affected provisions upon a
finding that the change in state or federal law has a fundamental effect on the plan.

2.12 IMPROVEMENT GUARANTEES
2.12.1 AGREEMENT
In lieu of meeting the requirement for the completion, installation and dedication of any and all
improvements (e.g., landscaping, water, sewer, street lights, etc.) prior to final plat approval for
subdivisions or certificate of occupancy for zoning, vested rights, zoning compliance, special use and
conditional use permits, the City of Goldsboro or its authorized agent may enter into a written
agreement with the developer whereby the developer shall agree to complete and warrant all required
improvements. Once both parties sign the agreement and the security required herein is provided, the
final plat or certificate of occupancy may be approved by the issuing authority, Zoning Administrator or
authorized agent, if all other requirements of this Ordinance are met. To secure this agreement, the
developer shall provide either one or a combination of the following guarantees equal to the entire cost
of the improvements secured.
2.12.2 SURETY PERFORMANCE BOND(S)
The developer shall obtain a performance bond(s) from a surety bonding company authorized to do
business in North Carolina, and approved by the Planning Director. The bond shall be payable to the
City of Goldsboro (or its authorized agent) and shall be in an amount equal to the entire cost, as
estimated by the developer and verified by the City, of installing all required improvements. The
duration of the bond(s) shall be up to one year after the City accepts the improvements. Any expenses
associated with the cost verification by the City shall be paid entirely by the developer.
2.12.3 CASH OR EQUIVALENT SECURITY
The developer shall deposit cash, an irrevocable letter of credit or other instrument readily convertible
into cash at face value, either with the City or its authorized agent or in escrow with a financial
institution designated as an official depository of the City. The amount of deposit shall be equal to the
entire cost, as estimated by the developer, and verified by the City, of installing all required
improvements. Any expenses associated with the cost verification by the City shall be paid entirely by
the developer. If cash or other instrument is deposited in escrow with a financial institution as provided
above, then the developer shall file with the City of Goldsboro (or its authorized agent) an agreement
between the financial institution and himself guaranteeing the following:
1. That said escrow amount will be held in trust until released by the City of Goldsboro and may
not be used or pledged by the developer in any other transaction during the term of the
escrow; and
2. That in case of a failure on the part of the developer to complete said improvements, the
financial institution shall, upon notification of the City to the financial institution of an estimate
of the amount needed to complete the improvements, immediately pay to the City the funds
estimated to complete the improvements, up to the full balance of the escrow account, or
deliver to the City any other instruments fully endorsed or otherwise made payable in full to
the City.
2-46 7/31/2007

security posted which covers the cost of the approved improvements.
2.12.5 MAINTENANCE WARRANTY
The applicant shall warrant the improvements against defects in workmanship and materials for a
period of one year from the date of acceptance of such improvements. In exceptional situations, where
undue hardship would otherwise result and the shorter term would not be inconsistent with the
purposes of this Ordinance, the City Engineer may approve a shorter-term maintenance guarantee. The
maintenance guarantee shall be secured by a surety bond or cash escrow in an amount reflecting five
percent of the cost of the completed improvements.
If necessary, the applicant shall construct and pay for all costs of any temporary improvements required
by the City Engineer and shall maintain said temporary improvements for the period specified by the
City Engineer.
Thirty days prior to the expiration of the maintenance guarantee instrument, if any defects in
workmanship and/or materials are not repaired to the satisfaction of the City Engineer, the
applicant/developer shall be required to make all necessary repairs immediately.
2.12.6 DEFAULT
Upon default, meaning failure on the part of the developer to complete or warrant the required
improvements in the time required by this Ordinance or as spelled out in the performance bond or
escrow agreement, then the surety, or financial institution holding the escrow account, shall pay all or
any portion of the bond or escrow fund to the City of Goldsboro up to the amount needed to complete
the improvements based on an estimate by the City. Upon payment, the City, in its discretion, may
expend such portion of said funds, as it deems necessary to complete or repair all or any portion of the
required improvements. The City shall return to the developer any funds not spent in completing the
improvements.

2.13 WATERSHED PROTECTION APPROVALS
2.13.1 PERMITS REQUIRED
Within certain areas of the City designated as Watershed Areas - (Critical Area) or (Protected Area)
additional permits are needed for certain types of land disturbing activities. Except where a single
family residence is constructed on a lot deeded prior to the effective date of this ordinance, no building
or built-upon area shall be erected, moved, enlarged or structurally altered, nor shall any building permit
be issued nor shall any change in the use of any building or land be made until a Watershed Protection
Permit has been issued by the Watershed Administrator. No Watershed Protection Permit shall be
issued except in conformity with the provisions of Section 5.8 (Water Supply Watershed Protection
Overlay District).
Where development exceeds either two residential units per acre or 24 percent built upon area, a High
Density Development Permit shall be required. High Density Development Standards are outlined in
Sections 5.8.6 – 5.8.13 of this Ordinance.
No permit required under the North Carolina State Building Code shall be issued for any activity for
which a Watershed Protection Permit or High-Density Development Permit is required until that
permit has been issued.
The Watershed Administrator shall issue a Watershed Protection Occupancy Permit certifying that all
requirements of Section 5.8 of this ordinance have been met prior to the occupancy or use of a building
hereafter erected, altered or moved and/or prior to the change of use of any building or land.
Watershed Protection Permits are issued under this Ordinance only when the application and necessary
plans have been submitted and indicate that the development will comply with the provisions of this
Ordinance. Such plans and applications as are finally approved are incorporated into any permit issued.
All development shall occur strictly in accordance with approved plans and applications.
All permits shall be issued in the name of the applicant or the principal, if submitted by an agent. The
permit shall identify the property involved, the proposed use, incorporate by reference the plans
submitted and contain any special conditions or requirements lawfully imposed by the permit issuing
authority.
2.13.2 NO OCCUPANCY, USE OR SALE OF LOTS UNTIL REQUIREMENTS
FULFILLED
Issuance of a Watershed Protection Permit authorizes the applicant to commence the activity resulting
in a change in use of the land or, with a building permit, to construct, erect, move or alter buildings or
other structures or to make necessary improvements to a subdivision. However, except as provided in
Section 2.12 (Improvement Guarantees), the intended use shall not be commenced, no building shall be

2.13.3 WHO MAY SUBMIT PERMIT APPLICATIONS/SUBMISSION
REQUIREMENTS?
Applications for Watershed Protection Permits and High Density Development Permits will be
accepted only from persons having the legal authority to take action in accordance with the permit or
subdivision plat approval. By way of illustration, this means that applications should be made by the
owners, their agents, lessees or persons who have contracted to purchase the property contingent upon
permit approval. The Watershed Administrator may require an applicant to submit evidence of his
authority to make the application, whenever there appears to be a reasonable basis for questioning this
authority.
2.13.4 APPLICATION DEADLINES
All applications for permits requiring Planning Commission, City Council or Watershed Review Board
or administrative review shall be submitted to the Watershed Administrator four weeks prior to the date
of the meeting at which the application will be reviewed.
2.13.5 APPLICATIONS TO BE COMPLETE
All applications and accompanying plans for permits must be complete before the issuing authority will
consider the application. An application is complete when it contains all the information necessary for
the issuing authority to decide whether the development, if completed as proposed, will comply with all
the requirements of this Ordinance.
2.13.6 STAFF CONSULTATION BEFORE FORMAL APPLICATION
To minimize development planning costs, avoid misunderstanding or misinterpretation and ensure
compliance with the requirements of this Ordinance, pre-application consultation between the
developer and the planning staff may be required. The applicant is encouraged to arrange a preapplication
consultation at least ten days prior to the application deadline.
The Administrator shall meet with the developer as soon as possible to review the preliminary plan.
Before submitting an application for any other permit, developers are strongly encouraged to consult
with the planning staff concerning the application of this Ordinance to the proposed development.
2.13.7 STAFF CONSULTATION AFTER THE APPLICATION HAS BEEN SUBMITTED
Upon receipt of a formal application for a Watershed Protection Permit, the Administrator shall review
the application and confer with the applicant to ensure that he understands the planning staff’s
interpretation of the requirements of this Ordinance, that he has submitted all of the information that
he intends to, and that the application and accompanying plans represents precisely and completely
what he proposes to do. However, if the Administrator believes that the application is incomplete, he

Application for a High Density Development shall be approved by the City Council.
2.13.9 WATERSHED PROTECTION PERMITS CRITERIA FOR APPROVAL
A completed application form and the accompanying plans for a Watershed Protection Permit shall be
submitted by filing a copy of the application with the Watershed Administrator in the Planning and
Community Development Department. A Watershed Protection Occupancy Permit, either for the
whole or part of a building shall be applied for coincident with the application for the Watershed
Protection Permit, and shall be issued or denied within ten (10) days after the erection or structural
alterations of the building have been satisfactorily completed. The Watershed Administrator shall issue
the Watershed Protection Permit unless he finds, after reviewing the application and consulting with the
applicant that:
1) The permit request is not within his review authority according to the general thresholds for
approval; or
2) The application is incomplete; or
3) If completed as proposed in the application the development will not comply with one or more
requirements of this Ordinance, with special attention to Section 5.8 of this Ordinance.
2.13.10 COUNCIL ACTIONS ON HIGH DENSITY DEVELOPMENT PERMITS
In considering whether to approve an application for a High Density Development Permit, the Council
shall proceed according to the following format. The Council vote need only achieve a simply majority
to reach a decision.
2-50 7/31/2007
The Council shall consider whether the application complies with all the applicable requirements of this
Ordinance. If a motion to this effect passes, the Council need not make further findings concerning
such requirements and may issue the permit. If such a motion fails or is not made, a motion shall be
made that the application be found not in compliance with one or more of the requirements of this
Ordinance. Such a motion shall specify the requirements that have not been met.
If the Council concludes that the application complies with all other provisions of this Ordinance, it
may still deny the permit if it concludes, based upon information submitted, that, if completed as
proposed, the development:
1. Will materially endanger the public health or welfare; or
2. Will substantially injure the beneficial use of adjoining or abutting property; or
3. Will not be in harmony with existing development and uses within the area in which it is
located; or
4. Will not be in general conformity with the Comprehensive Plan, Thoroughfare Plan or other
plan officially adopted by the Council.
Such a motion shall propose specific findings, based upon the evidence submitted, justifying such a
conclusion.
2.13.11 WATERSHED REVIEW BOARD ACTIONS ON WATERSHED PROTECTION
PERMITS
The Watershed Review Board shall hear and decide appeals from any decision or determination made
by the Watershed Administrator in the enforcement of this ordinance. The Watershed Review Board
shall have the power to authorize, in specific cases as set forth in Section 5.8.4.7 of this ordinance,
minor variances from the terms of this Ordinance as will not be contrary to the public interests where,
owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of this Ordinance will result in practical difficulties or
unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of this Ordinance shall be observed, public safety and welfare
secured, and substantial justice done.
In considering whether to approve an application for a variance to a Watershed Protection Permit, the
Watershed Review Board shall proceed in the manner set forth in Section 5.8.4.7 of this Ordinance
2.13.12 EXPIRATION OF PERMITS
A Watershed Protection Permit shall expire if a Building Permit for such use is not obtained by the
applicant within one (1) year from the date of issuance.
2.13.13 EFFECTS OF PERMIT ON SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS
Watershed Protection Permits authorize the permittee to make use of the land and structures in a
particular way. Such permits are transferable. However, so long as the land, structures or any portion
2-51 7/31/2007
thereof covered under a permit continues to be used for the purposes for which the permit was
granted, then:
1. No person shall make use of the land or structures covered under the permit except in
accordance with all the terms and requirements of that permit; and
2. The terms and requirements of the permit apply to and restrict the use of the land or structures
covered under the permit, not only with respect to all persons having any interest in the
property at the time the permit was obtained, but also to persons who subsequently obtain an
interest in all or part of the covered property and want to use it for a purpose other than that
for which the permit was originally issued, so long as the person(s) who subsequently obtained
an interest in the property had actual or record notice (as provided for below) of the existence
of the permit at the time they acquired their interest.
2.13.14 HEARING
Whenever the Administrator denies a Watershed Protection Permit, on any basis other than a failure of
the applicant to submit a completed application, such action may be appealed to the Watershed Review
Board by the person aggrieved within thirty days of the notification to deny the permit by following the
procedures described in Section 5.8.4.7.
Whenever the Administrator or City Council denies a Watershed Protection Permit on any basis other
than the failure of the applicant to submit a completed application, such action shall not be
reconsidered by the respective issuing authority unless the applicant clearly demonstrates that:
1) Circumstances affecting the property have substantially changed; or
2) New information is available that could not, with reasonable diligence, have been presented at
the previous meeting. A request to be heard on this basis must be filed within thirty days of the
notification of the decision to deny the first application. However, such a request does not
extend the period within which an official legal appeal must be filed with the superior court.
(See Section 3.2.7 - Judicial review).
Notwithstanding the subsection above, the City Council, Watershed Review Board or Planning and
Community Development Director may at any time consider a new application affecting the same
property as an application previously denied. A new application is one that differs in some substantial
way from the one previously considered. For the purposes of determining fees, resubmission of an
application shall be treated as a new application subject to new fees.

3.1 APPEALS, VARIANCES AND INTERPRETATIONS
3.1.1 APPEALS
Any person aggrieved may appeal any order or decision of the Administrator, Building Inspector or
his designee to the Board of Adjustment or the Watershed Review Board, if applicable. An appeal is
taken by filing with the Zoning Administrator and the Board of Adjustment a written notice of
appeal specifying the reasons for the appeal. Procedures for applying to the Watershed “Review
Board are set forth in Section 5.8.4.7 of this Ordinance. A notice of appeal shall be considered filed
with the Administrator and the Board of Adjustment when delivered to the Planning and
Community Development Department. The date and time of the filing shall be entered on the notice
by the planning staff. An appeal must be taken within thirty days after the date of the decision or
order appealed from.
Whenever an appeal is filed, the Administrator shall transmit forthwith to the Board of Adjustment
all the papers constituting the record relating to the action appealed from.
An appeal stays all actions by the Administrator seeking enforcement of or compliance with the
order or decision appealed from, unless the Administrator certifies to the Board of Adjustment that a
stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In that case, proceedings shall not
be stayed except by order of the Board of Adjustment or a court, issued on application of the party
seeking the stay, for due cause shown, after notice to the Administrator.
The Board of Adjustment may reverse, affirm (wholly or partly) or may modify the order,
requirement, decision or determination appealed from and shall make any order, requirement,
decision or determination that in its opinion ought to be made in the case before it. To this end, the
Board shall have all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken.
A fee as established by resolution of the City Council shall accompany each Board of Adjustment
appeal. No appeal shall be accepted and no public hearing scheduled until the necessary fees have
been paid. No fee pursuant to this paragraph shall be refunded.
3.1.2 VARIANCES
An application for a variance shall be submitted to the Board of Adjustment by filing a copy of the
application with the Administrator in the Planning and Community Development Department.
Applications shall be handled in the same manner as applications for special use permits in
conformity with the provisions in Sections 2.2.3 (Who may submit permit applications), 2.2.5
(Applications to be complete), and 2.2.10 (Recommendations on special use permit applications).
Applications for variances from the Watershed Protection Permit requirements shall be filed with the
Watershed Review Board in the manner set forth in Section 5.8.4.7 of this Ordinance.
A variance may be granted by the Board of Adjustment if it concludes that strict enforcement of the
Ordinance would result in practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships for the applicant and that by
granting the variance, the spirit of the Ordinance is observed, public safety and welfare secured and
substantial justice done. It may reach theses conclusions if it finds that all of the following have been
met:
3-3
7/31/2007
1. If the applicant complies strictly with the provisions of the Ordinance, he can make no
reasonable use of his property;
2. The hardship relates to the applicant’s land, rather than personal circumstances;
3. The hardship is peculiar to the specific property involved;
4. The hardship is not the result of the applicant’s own actions; and
5. The variance will neither result in the extension of a nonconforming situation in violation of
Section 5.6 (Nonconforming situations) nor authorize the initiation of a nonconforming use
of the land.
In granting variances, the Board of Adjustment may impose such reasonable conditions as will
ensure that the use of the property will be as compatible as practicable with the surrounding
properties.
A variance may be issued for an indefinite duration or for a specified duration.
The nature of the variance and any conditions attached to it shall be entered on the face of the
building permit, or the permit may simply note the issuance of the variance and refer to the written
record for further information. All such conditions are enforceable in the same manner as any other
applicable requirement of this Ordinance.
3.1.3 VARIANCES LIMITED
A variance is authorized only for height, area and size of a structure or size of setbacks and open
spaces. Establishment or expansion of a use otherwise prohibited shall not be allowed by variance,
nor shall a variance be granted because of the presence of nonconformities in the zoning district or
uses in an adjoining zoning district.
3.1.4 INTERPRETATIONS
The Board of Adjustment is authorized to interpret the Zoning Map and to pass judgment upon
disputed questions of district boundary lines and similar questions. If such questions arise in the
context of an appeal from a decision of the Administrator, they shall be processed in accordance with
Section 3.1.1 (Appeals).
An application for a map interpretation shall be submitted to the Board of Adjustment by filing a
copy of the application in the office of the Administrator in the Planning and Community
Development Department. The application shall contain sufficient information to enable the Board
to make the necessary interpretation.

1. Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines of alleys, streets, highways,
streams or railroads shall be construed to follow such centerlines;
2. Boundaries indicated as approximately following lot lines, City limits or extraterritorial
jurisdiction boundary lines shall be construed as following such lines, limits or boundaries;
3. Boundaries indicated as following shorelines shall be construed to follow such shorelines,
and in the event of change in the shoreline shall be construed as following the new shoreline;
4. Where a district boundary divides a lot or where distances are not specifically indicated on
the Official Zoning Map, the boundary shall be determined by measurement, using the scale
of the Official Zoning Map; and
5. Where any street or alley is hereafter officially vacated or abandoned, the regulations
applicable to each parcel of abutting property shall apply to that portion of such street or
alley added thereto by virtue of the vacation or abandonment.
3.1.5 BURDEN OF PROOF IN APPEALS AND VARIANCES
When an appeal is taken to the Board of Adjustment in accordance with Section 3.1.1 (Appeals), the
Administrator shall have the initial burden of presenting to the Board sufficient evidence and
argument to justify the order or decision appealed from. The burden of presenting evidence and
argument to the contrary then shifts to the appellant, who shall also have the burden of persuasion.
The burden of presenting evidence sufficient to allow the Board of Adjustment to reach the
conclusions set forth in Section 3.1.2 (Variances), as well as the burden of persuasion on those issues,
remains with the applicant seeking the variance.
3.1.6 BOARD ACTION ON APPEALS AND VARIANCES
With respect to appeals, a motion to reverse, affirm or modify the order, requirement, decision or
determination appealed from shall include, insofar as practicable, a statement of the specific reasons
or findings of facts that support the motion. If a motion to reverse or modify is not made or fails to
receive the four-fifths vote necessary for adoption (See Section 8.2 - Board of Adjustment), then the
decision appealed from shall be upheld.
Before granting a variance, the Board must take a separate vote to affirm by a four-fifths majority on
each of the five required findings stated in Section 3.1.2 (Variances). Insofar as practicable, a motion
to make an affirmative finding on each of the requirements set forth in Section 3.1.2 (Variances) shall
include a statement of the specific reasons or findings of fact supporting such a motion.
A motion to deny a variance may be made on the basis that any one or more of the five criteria set
forth in Section 3.1.2 (Variances) are not satisfied or that the application is incomplete. Insofar as
practicable, such a motion shall include a statement of the specific reasons or findings of fact that
support it. This motion is adopted as the Board’s decision if supported by a simple majority of the
Board’s membership.

decision is made. No further notice of a continued hearing needs to be published unless a period of
six weeks or more elapses between hearing dates.
3.2.2 NOTICE OF HEARING
The Administrator shall give notice of any hearing required by Section 3.2.1 (above) as follows:

In response to questions or comments by persons appearing at the hearing or to suggestions by the
City Council, Planning Commission, Board of Adjustment or City Staff, the applicant may agree to
modify his application, including the plans and specifications submitted.
Unless such modifications are so substantial or extensive that the issuing authority cannot reasonably
be expected to perceive the nature and impact of the changes without revised plan review, the issuing
authority may approve the application with the stipulation that the permit will not be issued until
plans reflecting the agreed upon changes are submitted to and accepted by the planning staff.
3.2.5 RECORD
A record shall be made of all hearings required by Section 3.2.1 (Hearing required on applications

record and must be retained by the issuing authority.
3.3.4 PROTEST PETITIONS
A rezoning or other Ordinance amendment may be contested by the filing of a valid protest petition.
For a protest petition to be valid, it must:
1. Be signed by the owners of either twenty percent (20%) or more of the area included in the
proposed change or five percent (5%) of a 100-foot-wide buffer extending along the entire
boundary of each discrete or separate area proposed to be rezoned. A street right-of-way
shall not be considered in computing the 100-foot buffer area as long as that street right-ofway
is 100 feet wide or less. When less than an entire parcel of land is subject to the
proposed zoning map amendment, the 100-foot buffer shall be measured from the property
line of that parcel.
Note: The twenty percent or five percent requirement refers to the land area, not the
number of owners. For example if a single person owns twenty percent of the land in
one of the qualifying areas, that individual can file a valid protest petition.

of the City Council membership.
In accordance with GS 160A-385(a), protest petitions shall not apply to:
1. Any amendment, which initially zones property added to the territorial coverage of the
Ordinance because of annexation or otherwise.
2. Any amendment to an adopted conditional district (CD), if the amendment does not change
the types of uses that are permitted within the district or increase the approved density for
residential development, or increase the total approved size of a nonresidential development,
or reduce the size of any buffers or screening approved for the conditional district.

City Council, Planning Commission or City Staff, the applicant may agree to modify his application,
including the plans and specifications submitted.

expected to perceive the nature and impact of the changes without revised plan review, the issuing
authority may approve the application with the stipulation that the permit will not be issued until
plans reflecting the agreed upon changes are submitted to and accepted by the planning staff.
The City Council shall not permit an amendment to an application that would delete a portion of
land sufficient to change the voting requirements for approval of an application when a valid protest
petition has been filed.

4.0 ENFORCEMENT
Whenever the Zoning Enforcement Officer receives a complaint alleging a violation of this
Ordinance, he shall investigate the complaint and take whatever action is warranted.
4.2 PERSONS LIABLE
The owner, tenant or occupant of any building or land or part thereof and any architect, builder,
contractor, agent or other person who participates in, assists, directs, creates or maintains any
situation that is contrary to the requirements of this Ordinance may be held responsible for the
violation and suffer the penalties and be subject to the remedies herein provided.
4.3 PROCEDURES UPON DISCOVERY
If the Zoning Enforcement Officer finds that any provision of this Ordinance is being violated, he
may send a written notice to the person responsible for such violation, indicating the nature of the
violation and ordering the action necessary to correct it. Additional written notices may be sent at the
Administrator’s discretion.
The final written notice (the initial notice may be the final notice) shall state what action the
Administrator intends to take if the violation is not corrected and shall advise that the
Administrator’s decision or order may be appealed to the Board of Adjustment in accordance with
Section 3.1.1 (Appeals).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in cases when delay would seriously threaten the effective
enforcement of this Ordinance or pose a danger to the public health, safety or welfare, the
Administrator may seek enforcement without prior written notice by invoking any of the penalties or
remedies authorized in the following Section.
Prohibited or illegal temporary signs, as defined in Section 6-4, which are located within the road
right-of-way or illegally placed on private property may be removed by the Planning Director or his
designee.
4.4 PENALTIES AND REMEDIES FOR VIOLATIONS
Any act constituting a violation of the provisions of this Ordinance or a failure to comply with any of
its requirements, including violations of any conditions and safeguards established in connection with
the grants of variances or special and conditional use permits, shall also subject the offender to a civil
penalty as follows:
(1) In the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00) for each offense on the first day of such offense; and
(2) In the amount of one hundred dollars ($100.00) for each offense either (i) on the second day
of such offense or (ii) when the offense is a second offense within a twelve (12) month
period; and
4-3
7/31/2007
(3) In the amount of two hundred and fifty dollars ($250.00) for each offense either (i) on the
third day and on each subsequent day of such offense or (ii) when the offense is the
third or subsequent offense within a twelve (12) month period.
If the offender fails to pay the penalty within thirty days after being cited for a violation, the City in a
civil action in the nature of debt may recover the penalty. A civil penalty may not be appealed to the
Board of Adjustment if the offender was sent a final notice of violation, a civil penalty or received a
written warning in accordance with the previous Section and did not take an appeal to the Board of
Adjustment within thirty days from the date of the final notice, written warning or issuance of the
civil penalty. In lieu of a civil action to recover the debt, the City may turn unpaid penalties in to a
credit/collection agency for collection. The offender will be responsible for all reasonable monetary
damages as required by the collections agency to recover the debt. This section may also be enforced
by any appropriate, equitable action.
Each day that any violation continues after notification by the Zoning Enforcement Officer that such
a violation exists shall be considered a separate offense for purposes of the penalties and remedies
specified in this Section. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the zoning enforcement officer may invoke
the escalating civil penalties authorized by this section whenever the violation continues and there
has been sufficient time for the violation to be corrected after notification that such violation exists
or whenever the violation has occurred previously during a twelve (12) month period.
Any one, all or any combination of the forgoing penalties and remedies either cited in this Ordinance
or in GS 160A - 175 may be used to enforce this Ordinance.
4.5 PERMIT REVOCATION
A zoning compliance, Certificate of Occupancy, sign, special use or conditional use permit may be
revoked by the issuing authority in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance, if the permit
recipient fails to develop or maintain the property or building in accordance with the submitted
plans, the requirements of this Ordinance or any additional requirements lawfully imposed by the
permit issuing authority.
Before a conditional use or special use permit may be revoked, all of the notice and hearing and other
requirements of Section 3.2 (Quasi-Judicial Hearing Procedures) shall be complied with. The notice
shall inform the permit recipient of the alleged grounds for revocation.
1. The burden of presenting evidence sufficient to authorize the permit issuing authority to
conclude that a permit should be revoked for any of the reasons set forth in this Section
shall be upon the party advocating that position. The burden of persuasion shall also be
upon that party.
2. A motion to revoke a permit shall include, insofar as possible, a statement of the specific
reasons or findings of fact that support the motion.
Before a zoning compliance or sign permit, which is issued by the staff, may be revoked, the
Administrator shall give the permit recipient ten days notice of intent to revoke the permit and shall
inform the recipient of the alleged reasons for revocation and of his right to obtain a hearing on the
4-4
7/31/2007
allegations. If the permit is revoked, the Administrator shall provide to the permittee a written
statement of the decision and the reasons therefore.

zoning, sign, special use or conditional use permit after such a permit has been revoked in
accordance with this Section.

5.1.1 PURPOSE AND INTENT
The general use districts established and contained in this Section are intended to:
1. Provide appropriately located areas for residential development consistent with the
Comprehensive Plan and with standards of public health and safety established by this
Ordinance;
2. Protect sensitive environmental and cultural resources;
3. Protect existing neighborhoods and residents from the harmful effects of excessive noise,
population density, traffic congestion and other significant environmental impacts;
4. Ensure adequate light, air, privacy and open space for each residential dwelling;
5. Ensure the timely and efficient provision of public facilities and services;
6. Provide sites for public and semi-public uses such as schools, parks, churches and others as
needed to complement residential development;
7. Provide appropriately located areas for a full range of office, commercial and industrial uses
as needed by the City’s residents, businesses and workers;
8. Strengthen the City’s economic base and provide employment opportunities close to home
for residents of the City and surrounding communities; and
9. Minimize the impact of commercial and industrial development on adjacent residential
districts.
5.1.2 RELATIONSHIP TO CONDITIONAL AND OVERLAY DISTRICTS
Lands within the City’s jurisdiction may be classified into one of the general use districts set forth in
Section 5.1.3 (Districts established) of this Ordinance, one or more of the conditional districts set
forth in Section 2.5.2, and/or one or more of the overlay districts set forth in Sections 5.7 (Historic
Preservation Overlay District), 5.8 (Water Supply Watershed Protection Overlay District), 5.9 (Noise
Overlay District), and Accident Potential Zone (APZ). Where the property is located in an overlay
district, the regulations governing development in the overlay district shall apply in addition to the
regulations of the underlying general/Conditional District.
5-3 Updated: July 15, 2019
5.1.3 DISTRICTS ESTABLISHED
The following districts are ordered from the highest and more restrictive district to the lowest least
restrictive district.
Agricultural - AG
The AG district is established to accommodate rural residential densities, to ensure the
protection of open space and to allow agricultural operations. The district is intended to provide
for limited, dispersed single-family housing when located within the Accident Potential Zone
(APZ) of Seymour Johnson Air Force Base or the Noise Overlay District. The minimum lot size
is three acres.
Residential - R-40
The R-40 district is established to accommodate rural single-family residential densities, to ensure
the protection of open space and to exclude agricultural operations. The district is intended to
maintain low densities where the provision of City sewer and water may not be complete and to
permit limited housing development when located within the Accident Potential Zone (APZ) of
Seymour Johnson Air Force Base or the Noise Overlay District. The minimum lot size is forty
thousand square feet.
Residential - R-20A
The R-20A district is established to accommodate rural density, single-family residential uses, to
ensure the protection of open space and to allow limited agricultural operations. The district is
intended to maintain low densities where the provision of City sewer and water may not be
complete and promote a compatible mixture of single-family residential and agricultural uses in
areas where urbanization is occurring. The minimum lot size is twenty thousand square feet.
Residential - R-20
The R-20 district is established to accommodate rural density, single-family residential uses and
to ensure the protection of open space. This district is intended to maintain low densities where
the provision of City sewer and water may not be complete. It discourages any use that would
substantially interfere with the development, use and enjoyment of single-family dwellings and
that would be detrimental to the quiet residential nature of the district. The minimum lot size is
twenty thousand square feet.
Residential Holding – R-16H
The R-16H district allows for low-density single-family residential uses on lot sizes of 16,000 sq.
ft. This district also serves as a holding zone until sewer service is available and development for
commercial, office, industrial or residential development at higher densities is appropriate.
Residential - R-16
The R-16 district is established to accommodate low density, single-family residential uses and to
prohibit all activities of a commercial nature, except certain home occupations. It discourages
any use that would substantially interfere with the development, use and enjoyment of single5-
4 Updated: July 15, 2019
family dwellings and that would be detrimental to the quiet residential nature of the district. The
minimum lot size is sixteen thousand square feet.
Residential - R-12SF
The R-12SF district is established to accommodate low density, single-family residential uses and
to prohibit all activities of a commercial nature, except certain home occupations. The minimum
lot size is twelve thousand square feet.
Residential - R-12
The R-12 district is established to accommodate both single and multifamily residential uses and
to prohibit all activities of a commercial nature, except certain home occupations. The minimum
lot size is twelve thousand square feet for a detached single-family dwelling. Multi-family
dwellings shall have twelve thousand square feet of land area for the first unit with an additional
six thousand square feet of land area required for each additional dwelling unit.
Residential - R-9SF
The R-9SF district is established to accommodate medium density, single-family residential uses
and to prohibit all activities of a commercial nature, except certain home occupations. The
minimum lot size is nine thousand square feet.
Residential - R-9
The R-9 district is established to accommodate both single and multifamily residential uses and
to prohibit all activities of a commercial nature, except certain home occupations. The minimum
lot size is nine thousand square feet for a detached single-family dwelling. Multi-family dwellings
shall have nine thousand square feet of land area for the first unit with an additional four
thousand five hundred square feet of land area required for each additional dwelling unit.
Residential - R-6SF
The R-6SF district is established to accommodate high density, single-family residential uses and
to prohibit all activities of a commercial nature, except certain home occupations. The minimum
lot size is six thousand square feet.

5.3.7.5. USE AND PURPOSE OF A PUD
Use of the Planned Unit Development procedure is not mandatory for any development. Rather, this
process can provide a voluntary alternative development procedure for relatively large tracts of land
held under unified ownership that are planned and developed in a coordinated manner.
The objectives of creating the PUD are:
 Permit creative approaches to the development of land, reflecting changes in technology or
planning concepts.
 Accomplish a more desirable environment than would otherwise be possible, provide a
variety of housing types, design and arrangements.
 Provide for an efficient use of land that can result in smaller networks of streets and utilities,
thereby lowering housing costs.
 Enhance the appearance of neighborhoods through preservation of natural features, the
provision of underground utilities and recreational or open space.
 Provide an environment of stable character compatible with surrounding residential areas.
5.3.7.6 APPROVAL PROCESS
A PUD shall be considered a separate zoning district requiring rezoning approval. Preliminary and
final plat and site specific development plans and shall be processed in accordance with Sections 2.2
(Zoning, Special and Conditional Use Approval) and Section 2.4 (Site Plan Approval). A conceptual
plan is required at the time of PUD approval.
5.3.7.8 PERMITTED USES
The land use categories in the table below shall be permitted in a PUD. For each land use category,
there are one or more corresponding general use districts. The uses permitted in each list of
corresponding districts shall constitute the permitted uses of each land use category. No industrial
uses shall be permitted.
*Uses that are not allowed in NB but are allowed in GB must be specified at time of PUD
approval.
No conditional use permit shall be required for any conditional use listed for said districts in the
Table of Permitted Uses (Section 5.4), separate from that issued for the PUD itself.

5-43 Updated: July 15, 2019
5.5 SUPPLEMENTAL USE REGULATIONS
5.5.1 PURPOSE
The City of Goldsboro finds that there are certain uses that exist which may be constructed,
continued and/or expanded if they meet certain mitigating conditions specific to their design and/or
operation. Such conditions ensure compatibility among uses and building types so that different uses
may be located in proximity to one another without adverse effects to either. This Section specifies
those requirements that must be met by all the uses marked as special or conditional in the Table of
Permitted Uses for each district.
5.5.2 APPROVAL PROCEDURES
The nature and/or size of a particular use and its probable effect upon surrounding properties
determine the approval procedure that shall be followed in obtaining a permit. To determine which
approval authority is required, consult the Table of Permitted Uses (Section 5.4).
Where a proposed use will have a minimal effect upon neighboring uses and is proposed for a small
structure or tract of land, a special use permit will be required and is granted by the Board of
Adjustment. Where a proposed use would have a wider effect upon the entire community or involves
a large structure or tract of land, a conditional use permit is necessary and is granted by the City
Council. Before granting a conditional use permit, the City Council may request a review by and
recommendations from the Planning Commission.
The approval process for both special and conditional uses is described in Section 2.2 (Zoning,
Conditional and Special Use Approval.
5.5.3 APPROVAL CRITERIA
All of the special and conditional uses listed below shall fulfill all of the requirements of this
Ordinance including those in Sections 6.1 (Off-Street Parking, Loading and Stacking Standards), 6.3
(Landscaping, Screening, and Buffering Standards), 6.2 (Commercial Lighting Design Standards), and
6.4 (Signage Standards). In addition, if the use is located in any one of the overlay districts described
in Sections 5.7 through 5.10, that district’s additional regulations shall apply. The following sections
describe the additional approval criteria for each of the specified uses. However, the City Council,
Board of Adjustment or Planning Commission may require additional conditions if they feel the
impacts of a particular use on a particular site may adversely impact the public health, safety and
general welfare.
The site plan information requirements listed for each use are in addition to the standard
requirements for a site plan listed in Appendix A.

5.5.11 SECTION RESERVED
5-65 Updated: July 15, 2019
5.6 NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS
5.6.1 EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS ORDINANCE
Whenever this Section refers to the “effective date of this Ordinance,” the reference shall be deemed
to include the effective date of any amendments to this Ordinance, if the amendment rather than this
Ordinance as originally adopted, creates a nonconforming situation.
5.6.2 CONTINUATION OF NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS
If, within the district established by this Ordinance, or amendments to this Ordinance that may be
adopted, there exists lots, structures and use of land and structures which were lawful before this
Ordinance was passed or amended, but which would be prohibited under the terms of this
Ordinance or amendments, it is the intent of this Ordinance to permit these nonconformities to
continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival.
5.6.3 CONTINUATION OF NONCONFORMING SIGNS
Signs in existence on the effective date of this Ordinance which do not conform to the provisions of
this Ordinance, but which were constructed, erected, affixed or maintained in compliance with all
previous regulations shall be regarded as nonconforming signs. Although it is not the intent of this
Ordinance to encourage the continued use of nonconforming signs, nonconforming signs shall be
allowed to continue and a decision as to the continued existence and use or removal of such signs
shall be controlled by Section 5.6.12 (Nonconforming Signs).
5.6.4 COMPLETION OF NONCONFORMING PROJECTS
To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this Ordinance shall be deemed to require a change in plans,
construction or designated use of any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior
to the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance and upon which actual
construction has been diligently carried on. Actual construction is hereby defined to include the
placing of construction materials in permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner or the
demolition, removal or elimination of an existing structure in connection with such construction,
provided that actual construction work shall be begun and diligently carried on until the completion
of the building involved.
5.6.5 NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS
Nonconforming situations are subdivided into six separate categories, each defined in the appropriate
subsections that follow:
1. Nonconforming lots;
2. Nonconforming uses;
3. Nonconforming structures;
4. Nonconforming manufactured homes;
5. Nonconforming features; and
5-66 Updated: July 15, 2019
6. Nonconforming signs.
5.6.6 NONCONFORMING LOTS
In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, notwithstanding limitation imposed by
other provisions of this chapter, a single-family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be
erected on any single lot of record as of January 18, 1960, or on the date of amendment of this
chapter. Such lot must be in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots in
the same ownership. This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements
for area or width, or both, that are generally applicable in the district, provided that yard dimensions
and other requirements not involving area or width, or both of lot, shall conform to the regulations
for the district in which the lot is located. Variance of single-family residential yard requirements
shall be obtained only through the Board of Adjustment. No permit or variance shall be issued
under the provisions of this subsection until the Planning Director has certified that the lot has been
in single and separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots in the same
ownership since January 18, 1960, or the date of any subsequent amendment which rendered the lot
nonconforming.
If two or more lots or combination of lots and portions of lots with continuous frontage in single
ownership are of record on January 18, 1960, and if all or part of the lots do not meet the
requirements for lot width and areas for the zone in which they are located, as established by this
chapter, the lands involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the purpose of this
chapter, and no portion of the parcel shall be used or sold which does not meet width and area
requirements established by this chapter, nor shall any division of the parcel be made which leaves
the remaining lot width or area below the requirements stated in this chapter. Existing
nonconforming lots in the Central Business District that do not comply with the lot width or area
requirements to construct a single-family dwelling may construct a single-family dwelling provided it
complies with all front and rear setbacks and a side yard setback of five (5) ft.
5.6.7 NONCONFORMING USES
Nonconforming uses of land or structures and nonconforming structures that contain
nonconforming uses, may continue only in accordance with the provisions of this Section.
No nonconforming use shall be moved (in whole or in part); enlarged, increased or extended to
occupy a greater area of land than was occupied on the effective date of the Ordinance, revision or
amendment that rendered the use as nonconforming except as provided in Section 5.6.14.
If any nonconforming use of land ceases, discontinues or is abandoned for more than one hundred
and eighty consecutive days, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to all the applicable
provisions of this Ordinance. For purposes of determining whether a right to continue a
nonconforming use is lost pursuant to this Section, all of the buildings, activities and operations
maintained on a lot are generally to be considered as a whole. For example, the failure to rent one
apartment in a nonconforming apartment building for over one hundred and eighty days shall not
result in the loss of legal nonconforming status as long as the building as a whole is continuously
maintained. But if a nonconforming use is maintained in conjunction with a conforming use,
discontinuance of the nonconforming use for the required period shall terminate the right to
maintain it thereafter.
If a nonconforming use is damaged or partially destroyed by man-made or natural acts and the cost
of repairing the damage is less than fifty percent of the assessed value listed on the Wayne County
5-67 Updated: July 15, 2019
Tax Roll, the use may be reestablished with the approval of the Planning Director. A zoning permit
for reestablishment of such use must be secured no later than one hundred eighty (180) days from
the date of its destruction or damage. In issuance of the permit, the Planning Director shall follow
these standards:
1. If the structure can be rebuilt on the same lot and meet all setback requirements, it shall be.
2. If the structure cannot be rebuilt at the same size (ground floor area) in accordance with the
minimum standards of the district in which it is located, then it shall be placed on the lot in
as conforming a manner as possible.
3. A nonconforming use shall not be reestablished in a manner that increases its
nonconformity.
4. The reestablishment of a nonconforming use (at the same or smaller size) shall require the
installation of sufficient parking, landscaping or buffering.
5. In issuing the permit, the Board may affix other reasonable and appropriate conditions to
limit the adverse impact of the use on adjacent properties.
If a nonconforming use is damaged or partially destroyed by man-made or natural acts and the costs
of repairing to reestablish the use is greater than fifty percent (50%) of the assessed value listed on
the Wayne County Tax Roll, any reconstruction, repair or replacement of the use shall conform to all
the current requirements of this ordinance including the density provisions of the Airport Business
(AB) district, Accident Potential Zone (APZ) and the noise reduction standards and permitted uses
of the Noise Overlay District.
If no structural alterations are made, a nonconforming use may be changed to another equal or less
intense nonconforming use, if the Board of Adjustment finds via a special use permit that the
proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the existing
nonconforming use. In permitting such a change, the Board of Adjustment may require additional
conditions and safeguards in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance.
Any nonconforming use may be extended within the existing structure provided the Board of
Adjustment determines that the interior expansion will not have a negative impact upon surrounding
conforming uses. Any expansion of the nonconforming use to additional lands outside the building is
prohibited except as provided in Sections 5.5.4 and 5.6.15.
Once a nonconforming use has been changed to a conforming use, it shall not thereafter be used for
any nonconforming use.
5.6.8 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES
A nonconforming structure may be enlarged, increased or extended to occupy a greater amount of
gross floor area than was occupied on the effective date of the Ordinance, revision or amendment
that rendered the structure as nonconforming provided that it does not increase the nonconformity.
If a nonconforming structure is damaged or partially destroyed by man-made or natural acts and the
cost of repairing the damage is less than fifty percent of the assessed value listed on the Wayne
County Tax Roll, the structure may be rebuilt only after the issuance of a permit from the Planning
Director. A building permit for reconstruction of such structure must be secured no later than one
hundred and eighty days from the date of its destruction or damage. In issuance of the permit, the
Planning Director shall follow these standards:
5-68 Updated: July 15, 2019
1. If the structure can be rebuilt on the same lot and meet all setback requirements, it shall be.
2. If the structure cannot be rebuilt at the same size (ground floor area) in accordance with the
minimum standards of the district in which it is located, then it shall be placed on the lot in
as conforming a manner as possible.
3. A nonconforming structure shall not be rebuilt in a manner that increases its nonconformity.
4. The reconstruction of a nonconforming structure (at the same or smaller size) shall require
the installation of sufficient parking, landscaping or buffering.
5. In issuing the permit the Board may affix other reasonable and appropriate conditions to
limit the adverse impact of the structure or use on adjacent properties.
If a nonconforming structure is damaged or partially destroyed by man-made or natural acts and the
costs of repairing the damage is greater than fifty percent of the assessed value listed on the Wayne
County Tax Roll, any reconstruction, repair or replacement shall conform to all the current
requirements of this Ordinance except nonconforming single-family residential structures may be
rebuilt at any time regardless of the damage and as long as the extent of the nonconformity is not
increased. Nonconforming single-family residential structures shall not be rebuilt in the Airport
Business District or Accident Potential Zone (APZ). Nonconforming single-family residential
structures within the Noise Overlay District shall only be rebuilt in accordance with the standards of
Section 5.9 (Noise Overlay District).
No nonconforming accessory structure shall continue to be utilized after the principle use or
structure is terminated by abandonment, damage or destruction unless such accessory use or
structure thereafter is made to conform to the standards for the zoning district in which it is located.
No nonconforming accessory use or structure shall become or replace any terminated principle
nonconforming use or structure.
5.6.9 NONCONFORMING MANUFACTURED HOMES ON INDIVIDUAL LOTS
Nonconforming manufactured homes on individual lots may be removed and replaced provided:
1. The replacement manufactured home is placed on the property within 180 days following
the removal of the existing manufactured home;
2. The replacement manufactured home was built after July 1, 1976 and meets the wind zone
requirements contained in the North Carolina Building Code adopted in June, 1994.
3. The installation and placement of the manufactured home conforms to all RM-9 and Noise
Overlay District requirements.
Any nonconforming mobile home that is damaged or destroyed by arson may be repaired or replaced
if it is determined by the investigation into the arson, by the appropriate law enforcement official or
fire inspector, that the mobile home was not damaged or destroyed by the owner. Any application
for replacement of the mobile home shall be within one year of the event of the arson to allow
adequate time to investigate the arson.
Once a nonconforming manufactured home has been removed from a lot, it may not be replaced
except in conformance with the above requirements.
Existing pre-1976 manufactured homes on individual lots may continue in use, but if such use
discontinues, ceases or is abandoned for a minimum of one hundred and eighty days, the home must
be removed.
5-69 Updated: July 15, 2019
5.6.10 NONCONFORMING MANUFACTURED HOME PARKS
All manufactured home parks made nonconforming by this UDO on or before the adoption of this
UDO may continue provided the number of spaces shall not be increased. The arrangement of
spaces may only be altered to bring the park into conformance with this Ordinance. Nonconforming
mobile home parks that have less than an 80% occupancy rate based upon the number of occupied
lots on the effective date of this Ordinance (April 4, 2005), shall cease operation within 180 days of
notification from the City to bring the mobile home park into compliance with City zoning
standards.
Nonconforming manufactured homes within parks may be removed and replaced if the replacement
manufactured home was built after July 1, 1976, meets the wind zone requirements of the North
Carolina Building Code as adopted in June, 1994 and conforms to the provisions of Section 5.3.3.3
(RM-8 Manufactured Home Park design standards) and Section 5.9 (Noise Overlay District).
Existing pre-1976 manufactured homes in parks may continue in use, but if such use discontinues,
ceases or is abandoned for a minimum of one hundred and eighty days, the home must be removed.

5.7.10 APPROVAL PROCEDURE FOR NORMAL MAINTENANCE
Normal maintenance does not require a COA, since no change is made to the appearance of the
structure.
5.7.11 STAFF CONSULTATION BEFORE FORMAL APPLICATION
To minimize development and planning costs, avoid misunderstanding or misinterpretation and
ensure compliance with the requirements of this Ordinance, pre-application consultation between the
developer/owner and the planning staff may be required as provided by this Section. The applicant is
encouraged to arrange a pre-application consultation at least ten days prior to the application
deadline.
5.7.12 STAFF REPORT
The planning staff shall review each COA request in light of the approval criteria listed in the Section
below and provide to the Historic Preservation Commission its recommendation regarding whether
to approve or deny the COA at the public hearing.
5.7.13 APPROVAL CRITERIA
All buildings, structures, features, sites, objects or surroundings in a Historic District Overlay shall be
subject to the design standards adopted by the Historic Preservation Commission and contained in a
document entitled Design Guidelines for Downtown Goldsboro” dated April, 2009. Said document
is incorporated herein by reference. These standards shall be based upon the United States Secretary
of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation, which are as follows:
1. A property shall be used for its historical purpose or be placed in a new use that requires
minimal change to the defining characteristics of the building, its site and environment.
2. The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic
materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided.
3. Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time, place and use. Changes
that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or
architectural elements from other buildings, shall not be undertaken.
4. Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired historical significance in
their own right shall be retained and preserved.
5. Distinctive features, finishes and constructive techniques or examples of craftsmanship that
characterize a property shall be preserved.
6. Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of
deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new one shall match the old in
design, color, texture, and other visual qualities and where possible, materials. Replacement
of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical or pictorial evidence.
5-79 Updated: July 15, 2019
7. Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause damage to historic
materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of structures, if appropriate, shall be
undertaken using the gentlest means possible.
8. Significant archeological resources affected by a project shall be protected and preserved. If
such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures shall be undertaken.
9. New additions, exterior alterations or related new construction shall not destroy historical
materials that characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old
and shall be compatible with the massing, size and architectural features to protect the
historic integrity of the property and its environment.
10. New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in such a
manner that if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property
and its environment would be unimpaired.
5.7.14 PUBLIC HEARING REQUIRED
A public hearing shall be held in accordance with the procedures detailed in the bylaws and rules of
procedure adopted by the Commission.
5.7.15 HISTORIC PRESERVATION COMMISSION ACTIONS ON COA
APPLICATIONS
After reviewing the recommendations of the staff and considering the discussion of evidence
presented at the public hearing concerning the COA application, the Historic Preservation
Commission shall within sixty days:
1. Approve the application as made; or
2. Approve the application with modification; or
3. Reject the application.
5.7.16 REHEARING
If the Commission determines that a COA should not be issued, a new application affecting the same
property may be submitted only if substantial change is made in plans for the proposed construction,
reconstruction, alteration, restoration or moving.
5.7.17 APPEAL
An appeal may be taken to the Board of Adjustment from the Commission's action in granting or
denying any certificate, by any aggrieved party. The appeal shall be made within thirty days following
the decision of the Commission in accordance with the requirements of Section 3.0 (Appeals,
Variances and Interpretations) and shall be in the nature of certiorari.
Any appeal from the Board of Adjustment's decision in any such case shall be heard by the Superior
Court of Wayne County.
5-80 Updated: July 15, 2019
5.7.18 CERTAIN CHANGES NOT PROHIBITED
Nothing in this Ordinance shall be construed to prevent the ordinary maintenance or repair of any
exterior architectural feature in the historic district or to a historic landmark which does not involve a
change in design, material, color, or outer appearance thereof, nor to prevent the construction,
reconstruction, alteration, restoration, moving or demolition of any such feature which the building
inspector or similar official shall certify as required for public safety because of an unsafe or
dangerous condition.
Nothing in this Ordinance shall be construed to prevent the ordinary maintenance or repair of
streets, sidewalks, pavement markings, utility service lines, street signs, traffic signs and/or the
replacement of street light fixtures in the event of an equipment failure, accidental damage or natural
occurrences such as electrical storms, hurricanes, tornados, ice storms and the like.
5.7.19 DEMOLITION APPROVAL
An application for a COA authorizing the demolition of a building or structure within the historic
district or designated as a historic landmark may not be denied. The effective date of such a COA
may be delayed for a period up to six months from the date of approval. The Commission shall
reduce the maximum period where it finds that the owner would suffer extreme hardship or be
permanently deprived of all beneficial use or return from such property by virtue of delay. During
the period of delay, the Commission may negotiate with the owner, City departments and any other
parties involved in an effort to find a means of preserving the building. In the event that the
Commission finds that the building has no significance or value toward maintaining the character of
the District, it shall waive all or part of such period and authorize earlier demolition or removal.
If the Commission has voted to recommend designation of a property as a landmark or designation
of an area as a district and the final designation has not been made by the City Council, the
demolition of any building, site or structure located on the property of the proposed landmark or in
the proposed district may be delayed by the Commission for a period up to one hundred and eighty
days or until the City Council takes final action on the designation, whichever occurs first.

5.8.3.5 ESTABLISHMENT OF WATERSHED REVIEW BOARD
There shall be and hereby is created the Watershed Review Board consisting of the Board of
Adjustment appointed by the Goldsboro City Council and the Wayne County Board of
Commissioners.
5.8.3.6 RULES OF CONDUCT FOR MEMBERS
(See Board of Adjustment By-Laws and Rules of Procedure).
5.8.3.7 POWERS AND DUTIES OF THE WATERSHED REVIEW BOARD
1. Administrative Review. The Watershed Review Board shall hear and decide appeals from
any decision or determination made by the Watershed Administrator in the enforcement of
this ordinance.
2. Variances. The Watershed Review Board shall have the power to authorize, in specific cases,
minor variances from the terms of this Ordinance as will not be contrary to the public
interests where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of this Ordinance will
result in practical difficulties or unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of this Ordinance
shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. In
addition, the City of Goldsboro shall notify and allow a reasonable comment period for all
other local governments having jurisdiction in the designated watershed where the variance
is being considered.
A. Applications for a variance shall be made on the proper form obtainable from the
5-90 Updated: July 15, 2019
Watershed Administrator and shall include the following information:
(1) A site plan, drawn to a scale of at least one (1) inch to forty (40) feet, indicating the
property lines of the parcel upon which the use is proposed; any existing or
proposed structures; parking areas and other built-upon areas; surface water
drainage. The site plan shall be neatly drawn and indicate north point, name and
address of person who prepared the plan, date of the original drawing, and an
accurate record of any later revisions.
(2) A complete and detailed description of the proposed variance, together with any
other pertinent information which the applicant feels would be helpful to the
Watershed Review Board in considering the application.
(3) The Watershed Administrator shall notify in writing each local government having
jurisdiction in the watershed and the entity using the water supply for consumption.
Such notice shall include a description of the variance being requested. Local
governments receiving notice of the variance request may submit comments to the
Watershed Administrator prior to a decision by the Watershed Review Board. Such
comments shall become a part of the record of proceedings of the Watershed
Review Board.
B. Before the Watershed Review Board may grant a variance, it shall make the following
three findings, which shall be recorded in the permanent record of the case, and shall
include the factual reasons on which they are based:
(1) There are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the way of carrying out
the strict letter of the Ordinance. In order to determine that there are practical
difficulties or unnecessary hardships, the Board must find that the five following
conditions exist:
(a) If the applicant complies with the provisions of the Ordinance, the applicant
can secure no reasonable return from, nor make reasonable use of, his property.
Merely proving that the variance would permit a greater profit to be made from
the property will not be considered adequate to justify the Board in granting a
variance. Moreover, the Board shall consider whether the variance is the
minimum possible deviation from the terms of the Ordinance that will make
possible the reasonable use of the applicant’s property.
(b) The hardship results from the application of the Ordinance to the property
rather than from other factors such as deed restrictions or other hardship.
(c) The hardship is due to the physical nature of the applicant's property, such as its
size, shape, or topography, which is different from that of neighboring property.
(d) The hardship is not the result of the actions of an applicant who knowingly or
unknowingly violates the Ordinance, or who purchases the property after the
effective date of the Ordinance, and then comes to the Board for relief.
(e) The hardship is peculiar to the applicant's property, rather than the result of
conditions that are widespread. If other properties are equally subject to the
hardship created in the restriction, then granting a variance would be a special
privilege denied to others, and would not promote equal justice.
5-91 Updated: July 15, 2019
(2) The variance is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the Ordinance
and preserves its spirit.
(3) In the granting of the variance, the public safety and welfare have been assured and
substantial justice has been done. The Board shall not grant a variance if it finds
that doing so would in any respect impair the public health, safety, or general
welfare.
C. In granting the variance, the Board may attach thereto such conditions regarding the
location, character, and other features of the proposed building, structure, or use as it
may deem advisable in furtherance of the purpose of this ordinance. If a variance for
the construction, alteration or use of property is granted, such construction, alteration or
use shall be in accordance with the approved site plan.
D. The Watershed Review Board shall refuse to hear an appeal or an application for a
variance previously denied if it finds that there have been no substantial changes in
conditions or circumstances bearing on the appeal or application.
E. A variance issued in accordance with this Section shall be considered a Watershed
Protection Permit and shall expire if a Building Permit or Watershed Occupancy Permit
for such use is not obtained by the applicant within six (6) months from the date of the
decision.
F. If the application calls for the granting of a major variance, and if the Watershed Review
Board decides in favor of granting the variance, the Board shall prepare a preliminary
record of the hearing with all deliberate speed. The preliminary record of the hearing
shall include:
(1) The variance application;
(2) The hearing notices;
(3) The evidence presented;
(4) Motions, offers of proof, objections to evidence, and rulings on them;
(5) Proposed findings and exceptions;
(6) The proposed decision, including all conditions proposed to be added to the permit.
The preliminary record shall be sent to the Environmental Management Commission for its
review as follows:
(1) If the Commission concludes from the preliminary record that the variance qualifies
as a major variance and that (1) the property owner can secure no reasonable return
from, nor make any practical use of the property unless the proposed variance is
granted, and (2) the variance, if granted, will not result in a serious threat to the
water supply, then the Commission shall approve the variance as proposed or
approve the proposed variance with conditions and stipulations. The Commission
shall prepare a Commission decision and send it to the Watershed Review Board. If
the Commission approves the variance as proposed, the Board shall prepare a final
decision granting the proposed variance. If the Commission approves the variance
5-92 Updated: July 15, 2019
with conditions and stipulations, the Board shall prepare a final decision, including
such conditions and stipulations, granting the proposed variance.
(2) If the Commission concludes from the preliminary record that the variance qualifies
as a major variance and that (1) the property owner can secure a reasonable return
from or make a practical use of the property without the variance or (2) the
variance, if granted, will result in a serious threat to the water supply, then the
Commission shall deny approval of the variance as proposed. The Commission
shall prepare a Commission decision and send it to the Watershed Review Board.
The Board shall prepare a final decision denying the variance as proposed.
(3) Approval of all development greater than the low density option. (See Section 5.8.6,
High Density Development Standards.)
5.8.3.8 APPEALS FROM THE WATERSHED REVIEW BOARD
Appeals from the Watershed Review Board must be filed with the Superior Court within 30 days
from the date of the decision. Decisions by the Superior Court will be in the manner of certiorari.

comments and recommendations shall not delay the Board’s action within the prescribed
time limit.
4. The City Council shall either approve or disapprove each application for a High Density
Development Permit based on the applicable criteria contained in this Ordinance. The
Board shall take action on the application at its first consideration or within sixty-five (65)
days of its first consideration.
A. If the City Council approves the application based on its findings, such approval shall be
indicated on the permit and all copies of the site plan and the plans and specifications of
the stormwater control structure. A High Density Development Permit shall be issued
after the applicant posts a performance bond or other acceptable security as required in
subsection 5.8.9 and executes an Operation and Maintenance Agreement as required in
subsection 5.8.9. A copy of the permit and one copy of each set of plans shall be kept
on file at the Watershed Administrator’s office. The original permit and one copy of
each set of plans shall be delivered to the applicant by regular mail.

of this section.
5.8.7 STORMWATER CONTROL STRUCTURES
1. All stormwater control structures shall be designed by a North Carolina registered
professional with qualifications appropriate for the type of system required; these registered
professionals are defined as professional engineers, landscape architects, to the extent that
the General Statutes, Chapter 89A allow and land surveyors, to the extent that the design
represents incidental drainage within a subdivision, as provided in General Statutes 89 (C)-
3(7).
5-94 Updated: July 15, 2019
2. All stormwater controls shall use wet detention as a primary treatment system unless
alternative stormwater management measures, as outlined in subsection 3 are used. Wet
detention ponds shall be designed for specific pollutant removal according to modeling
techniques approved by the North Carolina Division of Water Quality. Specific
requirements for these systems shall be in accordance with the following design criteria:
A. Wet detention ponds shall be designed to remove 85% of total suspended solids in the
permanent pool and storage runoff from a one inch rainfall from the site above the
permanent pool;
B. The designed runoff storage volume shall be above the permanent pool;
C. The discharge rate from these systems following the one inch rainfall design storm shall
be such that the runoff does not draw down to the permanent pool level in less than
two (2) days and that the pond is drawn down to the permanent pool level within at
least five (5) days;
D. The mean permanent pool depth shall be a minimum of three (3) feet;
E. The inlet structure shall be designed to minimize turbulence using baffles or other
appropriate design features;
F. Vegetative filters shall be constructed for the overflow and discharge of all stormwater
wet detention ponds and shall be at least thirty feet in length. The slope and width of
the vegetative filter shall be determined so as to provide a non-erosive velocity of flowthrough
the filter for a 10-year, 24-hour storm with a 10-year, 1-hour intensity with a
slope of five percent or less. Vegetation in the filter shall be natural vegetation, grasses
or artificially planted wetland vegetation appropriate for the site characteristics;
3. Alternative stormwater management systems, consisting of one treatment option or a
combination of treatment options, may be used. The design criteria for approval shall be 85
percent average annual removal of Total Suspended Solids. Also, the discharge rate shall
meet one of the following criteria;
A. the discharge rate following the 1-inch design storm shall be such that the runoff draws
down to the pre-storm design stage within five days, but not less that two days; or
B. the post development peak discharge rate shall equal the predevelopment rate for the 1-
year, 24-hour storm.
4. In addition to the vegetative filters required in subsection 5.8.8, all land areas outside of the
pond shall be provided with a ground cover sufficient to restrain erosion within thirty (30)
days after any land disturbance. Upon completion of the stormwater control structure, a
permanent ground cover shall be established and maintained as part of the maintenance
agreement described in subsection 5.8.10.
5. A description of the area containing the stormwater control structure shall be prepared and
filed in compliance with subsection 5.8.12, as a separate deed with the Wayne County
Register of Deeds along with any easements necessary for general access to the stormwater
control structure. The deeded area shall include the stormwater control structure, vegetative
filters, all pipes and water control structures, berms, dikes, etc., and sufficient area to
perform inspections, maintenance, repairs, and reconstruction.
5-95 Updated: July 15, 2019
6. Qualifying areas of the stormwater control structure may be considered pervious when
computing total built-upon area. However, if the structure is used to compute the
percentage built-upon area for one site, it shall not be used to compute built-upon are for
any other site or area.
5.8.8 POSTING OF FINANCIAL SECURITY REQUIRED
1. All new stormwater control structures shall be conditioned on the posting of adequate
financial assurance for the purpose of maintenance, repairs, or reconstruction necessary for
adequate performance of the stormwater control structures.
2. Financial assurance shall be in the form of the following:
A. Security Performance Bond or other security. The permit applicant shall obtain either a
performance bond from a surety bonding company authorized to do business in North
Carolina, an irrevocable letter of credit, certified check or other instrument readily
convertible into cash at face value payable to the City of Goldsboro. The bond or other
instrument shall be in an amount equal to 1.25 times the total cost of the stormwater
control structure, as estimated by the applicant and approved by the City Engineer. The
total cost of the stormwater control structure shall include the value of all materials such
as piping and other structures; seeding and soil stabilization; design and engineering; and
grading, excavation, fill, etc. The cost shall not be prorated as part of a larger project,
but rather under the assumption of an independent mobilization.
B. Cash or Equivalent Security Deposited After the Release of the Performance Bond.
Consistent with subsection 5.8.12, the permit applicant shall deposit with the City of
Goldsboro either cash or other instrument approved by the City Attorney that is readily
convertible into cash at face value. The cash or security shall be in an amount equal to
fifteen percent (15%) of the total cost of the stormwater control structure or the
estimated cost of maintaining the stormwater control structure over a ten (10) year
period, whichever is greater. The estimated cost of maintaining the stormwater control
structure shall be consistent with the approved operation and maintenance plan or
manual provided by the developer under subsection 5.8.10. The amount shall be
computed by estimating the maintenance cost for twenty-five (25) years and multiplying
this amount by two-fifths or 0.4.
3. Consistent with subsection 5.8.10, the permit applicant shall enter into the binding
Operation and Maintenance Agreement between the City of Goldsboro and all interests in
the development. Said Agreement shall require the owning entity to maintain, repair, and if
necessary, reconstruct the stormwater control structure in the accordance with the operation
management plan or manual provided by the developer. The Operation and Maintenance
Agreement shall be filed with the Wayne County Register of Deeds by the Watershed
Administrator.
4. Default under the performance bond or other security. Upon default of the permit applicant
to complete and/or maintain the stormwater control structure as spelled out in the
performance bond or other security, the City may obtain and use all or any portion of the
funds necessary to complete the improvements based on an engineering estimate. The City
shall return any funds not spent in completing the improvements to the owning entity.
5-96 Updated: July 15, 2019
5. Default under the cash security. Upon default of the owning entity to maintain, repair and,
if necessary, reconstruct the stormwater control structure in accordance with the Operation
and Maintenance Agreement, the City shall obtain and use all or any portion of the cash
security to make necessary improvements based on an engineering estimate. Such
expenditure of funds shall only be made after exhausting all other reasonable remedies
seeking the owning entity to comply with the terms and conditions of the Operation and
Maintenance Agreement. The City shall not return any deposited cash funds.
5.8.9 MAINTENANCE AND UPKEEP
1. An operation and maintenance plan or manual shall be provided by the developer for each
stormwater control structure, indicating what operation and maintenance actions are needed,
what specific quantitative criteria will be used for determining when those actions are to be
taken and, consistent with the Operation and Maintenance Agreement, who is responsible
for those actions. The plan shall clearly indicate the steps that will be taken for restoring a
stormwater control structure to design specifications if a failure occurs.
2. Landscaping and grounds management shall be the responsibility of the owning entity.
However, vegetation shall not be established or allowed to mature to the extent that the
integrity of the control structure is diminished or threatened, or to the extent of interfering
with any easement or access to the stormwater control structure.
3. Except for general landscaping and grounds management, the owning entity shall notify the
City Engineer prior to any repair or reconstruction of the stormwater control structure. All
improvements shall be consistent with the approved plans and specifications of the
stormwater control structure and the operation and maintenance plan or manual. After

5.9 NOISE OVERLAY DISTRICT
5.9.1 PURPOSE
The purpose of the Noise Overlay District is to provide for compatible development of land in areas
subject to increased aircraft noise exposure and accident potential due to aircraft operations
surrounding Seymour Johnson Air Force Base. The district is designed to limit uses that could
increase risks to public health, safety and general welfare while also protecting military aircrafts from
encroachment and to mitigate the impacts of aircraft noise on existing and newly permitted uses. In
addition, the district is intended to require notification on plats and site plans to all present and
future owners that property within this district is exposed to aircraft noise potentially in excess of a
65 day – night average A – weighted sound level (DNL).
5.9.2 ESTABLISHMENT
The Goldsboro Noise Overlay District, known in this Section as the “noise overlay district or
district,” is hereby established as a district that overlaps and overlays existing zoning districts. The
district is further divided into four sub-districts corresponding to the 65-69 DNL, 70-74 DNL, 75-79
DNL, 80-84 DNL and 85+DNL noise contours of the Seymour Johnson AFB AICUZ Updated -
Air Installation Compatibility Use Zone report, a copy of which is kept on file in the Planning and
Community Development Department. The boundaries of the noise district and sub-districts are
indicated on the Official Zoning Map of the City.
5.9.3 APPLICABILITY
Nothing herein shall require any change in any lawfully constructed or established building, structure
or use in existence at the time of adoption or amendment of these regulations.
The provisions of this Section shall apply to any application for a building permit, certificate of
occupancy, zoning, conditional use permit, special use permits, zoning compliance certificates, vested
rights certificates and subdivision/site plan approvals.
The noise level reduction requirements of this Section shall apply to the construction, alteration,
moving, repair, replacement or new use of any building or occupied permanent structure within the
City located within the Noise Overlay District as defined in this Section. The provisions of this
Section shall apply to the following development activities:
1. New construction - shall comply with all the applicable provisions of this Section.
2. Moved building or structures – shall comply with all the applicable provisions of this
Section, except as provided in Section 5.9.13.
3. Existing structures - expansions to the building areas shall be required to comply with the
applicable noise attenuation requirements.
 If the expansion is less than fifty percent of the gross floor area of the original building,
only the expansion need comply with the noise attenuation requirements.
 If the expansion is greater than or equal to fifty percent of the gross floor area of the
original building, the entire building shall comply with all the noise attenuation
requirements.
5-100 Updated: July 15, 2019
 In addition, repairs and renovations, not resulting in an expansion of the building gross
floor area, but collectively costing more than fifty percent of the tax value recorded in
the Wayne County Tax Record at the date of application, shall be required to fully
comply with the noise attenuation requirements of this Ordinance.
5.9.4 LAND USE COMPATIBILITY AND NOISE EXPOSURE
The noise district contains several general use zoning districts. Uses permitted in such
districts, whether by right or as a conditional or special use, shall be permitted in the Noise

5.9.4.1 KEY TO LAND USE COMPATIBILITY NOISE EXPOSURE TABLE
SLUCUM – Standard Land Coding Manual, U.S. Department of Transportation.
Y (Yes) – Land Use and related structures are normally compatible without restriction.
N (No) - Land Use and related structures are normally not compatible and should be prohibited.
YX - Yes with restrictions. The land uses and related structures are generally compatible;
however, see notes indicated by the superscript.
NX - No with exceptions. The land uses and related structures are generally incompatible;
however, see notes indicated by the superscript.
25, 30, or 35 - The numbers refer to noise level reduction (NLR) levels. NLR (outdoor to
indoor) is achieved through the incorporation of noise attenuation into the design and
construction of a structure. Land use and related structures are generally compatible; however,
measures to achieve NLR of 25, 30, or 35 must be incorporated into design and construction of
structures. However, measures to achieve an overall noise reduction do not necessarily solve
noise difficulties outside the structure and additional evaluation is warranted. Also, see notes
indicated by superscripts where they appear with one of these numbers.
DNL - Day-Night Average Sound Level
5.9.4.1.2 NOTES TO LAND USE COMPATIBILITY NOISE EXPOSURE TABLE
1. General
a. Although local conditions regarding the need for housing may require residential use in these
zones, residential use is discouraged in DNL 65-69 and strongly discouraged in DNL 70-74.
Existing residential development is considered as pre-existing, nonconforming land uses.
b. Where these uses are allowed, measures to achieve outdoor to indoor NLR of at least 25
5-105 Updated: July 15, 2019
decibels (dB) in DNL 65-69 and 30 dB in DNL 70-74 must be incorporated.
c. Normal permanent construction can be expected to provide an NLR of 20 dB, thus the
reduction requirements are often stated as 5, 10, or 15 dB over standard construction and
normally assume mechanical ventilation, upgraded sound transmission class ratings in
windows and doors, and closed windows year round. Additional consideration will be given
to modifying NLR levels based on peak noise levels or vibrations.
d. NLR criteria will not eliminate outdoor noise problems. However, building location, site
planning, design, and use of berms and barriers can help mitigate outdoor noise exposure
particularly from ground level sources. Measures that reduce noise at a site should be used
wherever practical in preference to measures that only protect interior spaces.
2. Measures to achieve a NLR of 25 must be incorporated into the design and construction of
portions of these buildings where the public is received, office areas, noise sensitive areas, or
where the normal noise level is low.
3. Measures to achieve a NLR of 30 must be incorporated into the design and construction of
portions of these buildings where the public is received, office areas, noise sensitive areas, or
where the normal noise level is low.
4. Measures to achieve a NLR of 35 must be incorporated into the design and construction of
portions of these buildings where the public is received, office areas, noise sensitive areas, or
where the normal noise level is low.
5. If a projector or proposed development is noise sensitive, use indicated NLR; if not, land use
compatible without NLR.
6. Buildings are not permitted.
7. Land use is compatible provided special sound reinforcement systems are installed.
8. Residential buildings require a NLR of 25.
9. Residential buildings require a NLR of 30.
10. Residential buildings are not permitted.
11. Land use that involves outdoor activities is not recommended, but if the community allows such
activities, hearing protection devices should be worn when noise sources are present. Long-term
exposure (multiple hours per day over many years) to high noise levels can cause hearing loss in
some unprotected individuals.

5.10.4.1 KEY TO LAND USE COMPATIBILITY ACCIDENT POTENTIAL TABLE
SLUCM - Standard Land Use Coding Manual, U.S. Department of Transportation.
Y (Yes) - Land uses and related structures are normally compatible without restriction.
N (No) - Land uses and related structures are not normally compatible and should be prohibited.
YX - Yes with restrictions. The land uses and related structures are generally compatible; however, see
notes indicated by the superscript.
Nx - No with exceptions. The land uses and related structures are generally incompatible; however,
see notes indicated by the superscript.
FAR - Floor Area Ratio. A floor area ratio is the ratio between the square feet of floor area of the
building and the gross site area. It is customarily used to measure non-residential intensities.
Du/Ac - Dwelling Units per Acre. This is customarily used to measure residential densities.
5-126 Updated: July 15, 2019
5.10.4.2 NOTES TO LAND USE COMPATIBILITY ACCIDENT POTENTIAL TABLE
1. A "Yes" or a "No" designation for compatible land use is to be used only for general
comparison. Within each, uses exist where further evaluation may be needed in each category as
to whether it is clearly compatible, normally compatible, or not compatible due to the variation
of densities of people and structures. In order to assist air installations and local governments,
general suggestions as to FARs are provided as a guide to density in some categories. In general,
land use restrictions that limit occupants, including employees, of commercial, service, or
industrial buildings or structures to 25 per acre in APZ I and 50 per acre in APZ II are
considered to be low density. Outside events should normally be limited to assemblies of not
more than 25 people per acre in APZ I, and maximum assemblies of 50 people per acre in APZ
II. Recommended FARs are calculated using standard parking generation rates for various land
uses, vehicle occupancy rates, and desired density in APZ I and APZ II. For APZ I, the formula
is FAR = 25 people per acre/(Average Vehicle Occupancy x Average Parking Rate x
(43560/1000)). The formula for APZ II is FAR = 50/(Average Vehicle Occupancy x Average
Parking Rate x (43560/1000)).
2. The suggested maximum density for detached single-family housing is two Du/Ac. In a planned
unit development (PUD) of single family detached units where clustered housing development
results in large open areas, this density could possibly be increased slightly provided the amount
of surface area covered by structures does not exceed 20 percent of the PUD total area. PUD
encourages clustered development that leaves large open areas.
3. Other factors to be considered: Labor intensity, structural coverage, explosive characteristics, air
pollution, electronic interference with aircraft, height of structures, and potential glare to pilots.
4. No structures (except airfield lighting and navigational aids necessary for the safe operation of
the airfield when there are no other siting options), buildings, or above-ground utility and
communications lines should normally be located in Clear Zone areas on or off the air
installation. The Clear Zone is subject to the most severe restrictions.
5. Rights-of-way for fenced highways, without sidewalks or bicycle trails, are allowed.
6. No above-ground passenger terminals and no above-ground power transmission or distribution
lines. Prohibited power lines include high-voltage transmission lines and distribution lines that
provide power to cities, towns, or regional power for unincorporated areas.
7. Development of renewable energy resources, including solar and geothermal facilities and wind
turbines, may impact military operations through hazards to flight or electromagnetic
interference. Each new development should be analyzed for compatibility issues on a case-bycase
basis that considers both the proposal and potentially-affected mission.
8. Within SLUCM Code 52, maximum FARs for lumberyards (SLUCM Code 521) are 0.20 in APZ
I and 0.40 in APZ II. For hardware, paint, and farm equipment stores, SLUCM Code 525, the
maximum FARs are 0.12 in APZ I and 0.24 in APZ II.
9. A shopping center is an integrated group of commercial establishments that is planned,
developed, owned, or managed as a unit. Shopping center types include strip, neighborhood,
community, regional, and super-regional facilities anchored by small businesses, a supermarket or
drug store, discount retailer, department store, or several department stores, respectively.
5-127 Updated: July 15, 2019
Included in this category are such uses as big box discount clubs, home improvement
superstores, office supply superstores, and electronics superstores. The maximum
recommended FAR for SLUCM 53 should be applied to the gross leasable area of the shopping
center rather than attempting to use other recommended FARs listed in Table 1 under Retail or
Trade.
10. Ancillary uses such as meeting places, auditoriums, etc., are not recommended.
11. No chapels or houses of worship are allowed within APZ I or APZ II.
12. Big box home improvement stores are not included as part of this category.
13. Facilities must be low intensity, and provide no playgrounds, etc. Facilities such as clubs houses,
meeting places, auditoriums, large classes, etc., are not recommended.
14. Livestock grazing is a compatible land use, but feedlots and intensive animal husbandry are
excluded. Activities that attract concentrations of birds creating a hazard to aircraft operations
should be excluded.
15. Feedlots and intensive animal husbandry are included as compatible land uses.
16. Lumber and timber products removed due to establishment, expansion, or maintenance of Clear
Zone lands owned in fee will be disposed of in accordance with applicable Department of
Defense guidance.
17. Controlled hunting and fishing may be permitted for the purpose of wildlife management.
18. Surface mining operations that could create retention ponds that may attract waterfowl and
present bird/wildlife aircraft strike hazards (BASH), or operations that produce dust or light
emissions that could affect pilot vision are not compatible.
19. Naturally occurring water features (e.g., rivers, lakes, streams, wetlands) are pre-existing,
nonconforming land uses. Naturally occurring water features that attract waterfowl present a
potential BASH. Actions to expand naturally occurring water features or construction of new
water features should not be encouraged. If construction of new features is necessary for storm
water retention, such features should be designed so that they do not attract waterfowl.
5.10.5 APPROVAL PROCEDURE
All development activity and subdivisions regulated by the provisions of the Accident Potential Zone
are also required to follow all applicable general land use and subdivision approval procedures
contained in the Goldsboro Unified Development Code.
Each application for a building permit shall be accompanied by a plat or site plan, drawn to scale,
showing accurate dimensions of the lot to be built upon, accurate dimensions of the building to be
erected and its location on the lot.
5-128 Updated: July 15, 2019
5.10.6 REPLACEMENT, EXPANSION AND RECONSTRUCTION OF
NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES AND LAND USES IN THE ACCIDENT
POTENTIAL ZONE OVERLAY DISTRICT
a. Clear Zone: Any nonconforming land uses or structures within the clear zone portion of the
Accident Potential Zone (APZ) shall not be reconstructed, expanded or replaced if that use or
structure is destroyed or damaged greater than 50% of its tax value as shown on the Wayne
County tax roll.
b. APZ-I and APZ-II: Existing land uses and structures located in the APZ-I or APZ-II overlay
zones for Seymour Johnson Air Force Base shall be allowed to rebuild in the event the land use
or structure are destroyed or damaged greater than 50% of its tax value as shown on the Wayne
County tax roll provided such land use complies with the density requirements of the Airport
Business zoning district and Accident Potential Zone as defined in Sections 5.3.5.1 and 5.10.4.
Uses that do not comply with the density provisions of the Airport Business zoning district and
APZ overlay may rebuild if destroyed or damaged beyond fifty percent (50%) of its tax value as
shown on the Wayne County tax roll provided the size, area, density or occupancy load of the
new building does not exceed the size, area, density or occupancy load that existed at the time of
the building’s destruction. Under no circumstances shall be reconstructed building add any seats,
expand the square footage or alter the site in any way that would make the site more
nonconforming in regards to any zoning, noise overlay, APZ or AICUZ development regulation.
Nonconforming land uses within the APZ may receive a conditional Use Permit to expand the
building footprint one time in accordance with Sections 5.6.15 and 5.5.4 provided the City
Council finds the allowable density provisions, as defined in Section 5.10.4 are not increased
which would result in an increase in the nonconformity of the use.
All replacements, expansions and reconstructions of nonconforming situations, as listed in this
section shall follow the procedural requirements of Section 5.6 (Nonconforming Situations).

when corrective measure must be completed. The notice shall state that failure to correct the
violation within the specified time period will result in the assessment of civil penalties and other
enforcement action. If after the allotted time period has expired and after the hearing of an
appeal, if any by the Board of Adjustment, corrective action has not been completed, a civil
penalty shall be assessed in the amount of one hundred dollars ($100.00) per day of continuing
violation.
d. Any penalty, fines or fees may be waived or reduced at the discretion of the Planning Director IF
the property owner or other responsible party for the repairs thereof have substantially [herein
5-134 Updated: July 15, 2019
“substantially” or “substantial” as to repairs means that seventy-five percent (75%) or more of
the repairs that were previously ordered to be made have been so made] been accomplished.
e. If penalties, fines and/or fees total Three Thousand Dollars ($3,000.00) or more AND the
property has not been substantially improved/repaired pursuant to the order, then at the

6.1 OFF-STREET PARKING, LOADING AND STACKING STANDARDS
6.1.1 APPLICABILITY
The provisions of this Section shall apply to any application for a building permit, certificate of
occupancy, zoning, special/conditional use permits, zoning compliance certificates, vested rights
certificates and subdivision and site plan approvals. The off-street parking, loading and stacking
requirements of this Section shall apply when an existing structure or use is expanded, enlarged or
changed.
1. If the expansion is less than fifty percent of the gross floor area of the existing structure,
additional off-street parking and loading spaces shall be required to serve only the enlarged or
expanded area, provided that in all cases the number of off-street parking and loading spaces
provided for the entire use (pre-existing plus expansion) must equal at least seventy-five percent
of the required minimum spaces established in the Parking and Loading Requirements Table
(Table 6-1).
2. If the expansion is greater than fifty percent of the gross floor area of the existing structure,
additional off-street parking and loading must meet one hundred percent of the required
minimum number of spaces for the entire use (pre-existing plus expansion) established in the
Parking and Loading Requirements Table (Table 6-1).
3. Off-street parking and loading spaces must be provided for any change in uses or manner of
operation that would, based on the Parking and Loading Requirements Table (Table 6-1), result
in a requirement for more parking or loading spaces than the existing use.
The standards of this Section shall not apply in the Central Business District within an area bounded
by the south side of Ash Street, the east side of George Street, the north side of Chestnut Street and
the west side of William Street.
Also, off-site parking areas that constitute the principle use of the site shall comply with all the design
standards of this Section.
6.1 .2 OFF-STREET PARKING REQUIREMENTS
Table 6-1, Off-Street Parking Requirements, establishes the minimum and maximum number of
parking spaces permitted for the uses indicated. The following rules shall apply to the calculation of
the required parking.
1. Unless otherwise approved, lots containing more than one use must provide parking and loading
equal to the total amount required by all uses.
2. When measurements of the number of required spaces result in a fractional number, any fraction
.5 or greater shall be rounded to the nearest whole number.
3. Unless otherwise noted, all square footage based parking shall be computed based on gross floor
area.
4. For computing parking requirements based on employees, calculations shall be based on the
largest number of persons working on any single shift or the maximum fire rated capacity,
whichever is greater.
6-3 7/23/07
5. Requirements based on the number of seats shall be calculated on the design capacity of the
space where seating is located.
6. The Planning Director may waive the maximum parking space requirement when it is
demonstrated that a particular land use requires parking exceeding the maximum number of
spaces as listed in Table 6-1. The Planning Director may require any information as necessary
to evaluate if a modification to the maximum number of parking spaces should be granted.

6.2 COMMERCIAL LIGHTING DESIGN STANDARDS
6.2.1 PURPOSE
The standards established in this Section are intended to:
1. Secure the provision of light in public places where safety and security is a concern;
2. Prevent disabling glare from nonvehicular light sources shining into driver's and pedestrians' eyes
consequently impeding safe movements; and
3. Protect neighbors and the night sky from nuisance glare and stray light coming from poorly
aimed, placed, shielded or applied light sources.
6.2.2 APPLICABILITY
The provisions of this Section shall apply to any application for any non-residential building permit,
certificate of occupancy, zoning, special/conditional use permits, zoning compliance certificates,
vested rights certificates and subdivision or site plan approvals. A lighting plan shall only be required
for projects adjacent to residentially zoned or developed properties, commercial or residential
projects exceeding four acres in size or as required by the City Council. Projects not required to
submit a lighting plan may voluntarily submit a lighting plan or certify compliance of this section on
the submitted site plan. Projects that are not required to submit a lighting plan are still subject to the
requirements of Section 6.2 and may be required to submit a lighting plan or make other alterations
to demonstrate compliance if problems arise. The lighting requirements of this Section shall apply
when an existing structure or use is expanded, enlarged or changed as stated below.
1. If the expansion is less than fifty percent of the original building or parking area, collectively or
separately, only the expansion need comply with the requirements of this Section.
2. If the expansion is greater than or equal to fifty percent of the original building or parking area,
collectively or separately, the entire lot shall comply with the requirements of this Section.
3. Repairs and renovations, not resulting in an expansion of the parking or building area, but
collectively costing more than fifty percent of the tax value recorded in the Wayne County Tax
Record at the date of application, shall be required to fully comply with the lighting requirements
of this Ordinance.
4. If there is a change of use in a principle building, resulting in an intensification or expansion of
use, the entire lot shall fully comply with all the lighting requirements of this Ordinance.
5. In addition to the above sections, no replacement, extension or modification of outdoor lighting
fixtures shall be made unless it conforms to the provisions of this Section.
6.2.3 PLAN AND APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS
Lighting plans for commercial and residential developments submitted for review and approval to
the Planning and Community Development Department shall include:
1. A site plan showing landscaping, parking areas and the proposed fixture locations, heights and
mounting information for each light;
6-20 7/23/07
2. A photometric report (point-by-point or isolux diagram) showing light levels in footcandles
produced on the ground at points located on a ten foot by ten-foot illuminance grid. The
photometric report will indicate the minimum and maximum footcandle levels within the lighted
area of the site. The minimum is usually located at the outer edges of the illuminated area or
between two fixtures. Adding the footcandle value of all the points in the grid and dividing by
the total number of points determine the average light level. This type of report is normally
available from the manufacturer of the specified fixture, the electric utility, a professional
engineer or lighting designer;
3. A fixture schedule listing descriptions of the equipment, including fixture catalog specifications,
photometrics, glare reduction devices, and lamps.
6.2.4 ILLUMINATION LEVELS
Illumination levels shall be measured in footcandles and not exceed the recommended intensities and
uniformity ratios established by the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America (IESNA)
8'11 edition handbook with some modifications.
For lighted parking lots, the minimum light level shall be no less than 0.2 footcandles. All light levels
are measured at ground level. The minimum light level requirements vary depending on the activity
classification. The specified minimum FC value above 0.2 FC as outlined in the following table
means that the lowest light level point or location in the parking lot must not exceed the minimum
stated FC value in the table (i.e. 0.9 FC for medium vehicular/pedestrian activity). An average to
minimum uniformity ratio of 4:1 means that the average FC to minimum FC ratio cannot be worse
(higher) than 4:1. See the following table:
Table 6-5

Walkway, paths and bikeways 0.5 avg. 5:1
Building entrances 5.0 avg. n/a
Notes: Illumination levels are maintained horizontal footcandles on the task/activity, i.e. pavement
or surface area. Uniformity ratios dictate average illuminance values shall not exceed minimum values
6-21 7/23/07
by more than the product of the minimum value and the specified ratio, i.e. for medium activity
commercial parking, the average footcandles shall not exceed 3.6 (0.9 x 4).
The Planning Director or his/her designee shall be responsible for determining the activity level for a
development. Any project that requests a light level that exceeds the footcandle values outlined
above must demonstrate a need for a higher light level be approved by City Council and meet
lighting trespass limits described herein. Criteria that can justify a need for a higher light level or
other changes that may be required when higher levels are used include:
1. Safety and Security - The Illuminating Engineering Society of North America (IESNA)
provides guidance in its 9thedition of the Lighting Handbook in chapter 22. Footnote number 2
reads: "If personal security or vandalism is like and/or severe problem, a significant increase of
the Basic level (.2 FC horizontal) may be appropriate. Many retailers prefer even higher light
levels, with a specification of 10 lux (1 fc) minimum value." This means that with the 4:1 average
to minimum uniformity ratio requirement in this table, the maximum average FC value could
increase from 3.6 to 4.0 FC. This is only a guideline. The Goldsboro city council can allow up to
a 5.0 FC maximum average (or 1.25 FC minimum with a 4:1 avg to min ratio) for shopping
centers, retail strip malls, and other similar applications based on the project conditions.
2. Adjacent Uses - An adjacent use that is non-residential with a higher light level (light surround)
level may required more light to provide the same visibility than an adjacent property with less
light (dark surround).
3. Full Cutoff Fixtures - In cases where a higher light level is approved, full cutoff fixtures may
also be justified to better focus the lighting downward on the property to be lighted and reduce
the amount of glare coming out of the fixtures.
6.2.5 GENERAL LIGHTING REQUIREMENTS

maximum distribution of light intensity.
6.2.11 DEFINITIONS
Candela - A measure of luminous or light intensity in a certain direction. Useful in determining how
much light is shining out of a fixture and in what direction.
Fixture - An assembly that holds the lamp (bulb) in a lighting system. It includes the elements
designed to give light output control, such as a reflector (mirror) or refractor (lens), the ballast,
housing, and the attachment parts.
Flood Lamp - A form of lighting designed to direct its output in a specific direction with a reflector
formed from the glass envelope of the lamp itself. Such lamps are so designated by the
manufacturers and are typically used in residential outdoor area lighting.
Flood Light - A form of lighting designed to direct its output in a diffuse, more or less specific
direction, with reflecting or refracting elements located external to the lamp.
6-27 7/23/07
Footcandle (FC) - A quantitative unit measuring the amount of light (illumination) falling onto a
given point. One footcandle equals one lumen per square foot.
Glare - The effect produced by a light source within the visual field that is sufficiently brighter than
the level to which the eyes are adapted, to cause annoyance, discomfort, or loss of visual
performance and ability.
HID - High intensity discharge lighting is a bulb type including mercury vapor, metal halide, high
pressure or low-pressure sodium, which glow when an electric current is passed through a gas
mixture inside the bulb.
IESNA -The Illuminating Engineering Society of North America, a non-profit professional
organization of lighting specialists that has established recommended design standards for various
lighting applications.
Illuminance - The amount of light falling on a surface-measured in lux or footcandles.
Internal Refractive Lens - A glass or plastic lens installed between the lamp and the sections of the
outer fixture globe or enclosure. Refractive refers to the redirection (bending) of the light as it goes
through the lens, softening and spreading the light being distributed from the light source thereby
reducing direct glare.
Iso-Footcandle Curve - a demonstration of topographic of light levels over a given area.
Light Source - The element of a lighting fixture that is the point of origin of the lumens emitted by
the fixture.
Light Trespass - Light emitted by a lighting installation that falls outside the boundaries of the
property on which the installation is sited. This has adverse effects on residents, vehicle operators
and pedestrians, the natural environment.
Lumen - A quantitative unit used to identify the amount of light emitted by a light source. A lamp is
generally rated in lumens.
Maintained Footcandles - Illuminance of lighting fixtures adjusted for a maintenance factor

3. Drainage ditches - When a drainage ditch separates property lines, or is otherwise contained
within a lot or tract, all vegetation required by this Section shall still be provided. However, in
no case shall the required vegetation be located within five feet of the outer edge of the drainage
ditch.
4. Stormwater detention structures - All structures having a slope of greater than two horizontal
feet for every vertical foot or steeper shall not have any of the required vegetation within five
feet of the outer edge of the structure. Stormwater detention structures, excluding swales that do
not prevent the installation of landscaping, shall be prohibited in buffer areas. Stormwater
detention ponds shall be located at least 20 feet from the road right of way and shall be screened
with evergreen shrubs.
5. Easements - No landscaping materials required by this Section shall be located or planted on
property subject to utility or drainage easements without written consent of the City and/or the
easement holder.
6. Non-landscaped and non-constructed areas - All open space areas that are not landscaped shall
be at a minimum seeded with grass or other appropriate ground cover.
7. Foundation Plantings - Foundation plantings are encouraged adjacent to commercial, office and
industrial buildings and shall be incorporated into landscaping plans where appropriate.
6.3.6 INSTALLATION STANDARDS
All landscaping, including mulching and seeding shall be completed in accordance with approved
landscape plans before the issuance of a certificate of occupancy.
A written request to defer the installation of landscaping due to one of the following reasons may be
approved for no longer than six months if submitted to the Department of Planning and Community
development prior to a request for a certificate of occupancy or final plat approval.
1. Unavailability of plant materials;
2. Installation of the plant material at the time of the request would jeopardize the health of the
plants (Planting May 15th through September 15th is not encouraged);
3. Weather conditions prohibit the completion of the planting.
Whenever a certificate of occupancy is requested prior to the required landscaping being installed, an
improvement guarantee fulfilling the requirements of Section 2.12 (Improvement guarantees) must
be requested and executed.

installation, preservation, mulching, weeding and maintenance of all landscaping and physical
features required under this Section.
2. All dead, substandard and unhealthy plant materials shall be removed and replaced in
conformance with the standards of this Section and the approved landscape or site plan. In the
event that any vegetation required by this Section is damaged due to weather or a natural
catastrophe, the owner shall have one hundred eighty (180) days to replace the affected plant
materials.
3. Pruning shall consist of removal of dead, dying, diseased, interfering, obstructing and weak
branches as well as selective thinning to lessen wind resistance and improve appearance.
6-35 7/23/07
 All cuts shall be made close to the trunk or parent limb without leaving a protruding stem
and without cutting into the branch collar or the branch bark ridge.
 Directional pruning and drop crotch pruning shall be used to prune live branches.
 Tree limbs too heavy to handle by hand shall be precut above the final cut to prevent
splitting or peeling of the bark. Where necessary to prevent tree or property damage,
branches shall be lowered to the ground by ropes or equipment.
 Treatment of cuts and wounds with tree wound dressing is discouraged. If such treatment is
necessary, materials should be non-toxic to the cambium layer.
 Tree topping shall be prohibited on all public property and designated rights-of-way and for
all trees falling under the jurisdiction of this Ordinance, including both newly installed and
preserved trees.
4. Fertilizer shall not be applied to any vegetation within any riparian buffer required by this
Ordinance, and as required by 15A NC AC 2B.0233. Application of fertilizer should conform to
standards as established by the North Carolina Cooperative Extension Service. No fertilizer
shall be allowed to remain on sidewalks or driveways after application.
5. All landscaped planting areas shall be stabilized from soil erosion immediately upon planting and
shall be maintained for the duration of the use.
6.3.9 BUFFER YARD DESIGN STANDARDS
The purpose of a buffer yard is to provide a physical transition between uses that may differ in
development use, intensity and/or density. The buffer yard reduces the objectionable impact of one
use upon another caused by lighting, noise, visual character, or other site - or ·use-related effects.
These landscaped planting yards are intended to insure that a natural or landscaped area of
appropriate size and density of plantings is planted or preserved between zoning districts or uses.
Buffer yards shall be of different types, based upon the relationship between the two adjacent uses.
1. Prohibited uses- The construction of any building, parking or drive area, outdoor storage or
display or the placement of any mechanical equipment within the landscaped buffer yard is not
permitted except as provided in Section 6.3.9.9. To allow utility connections to adjoining
properties, utilities may cross a buffer at a perpendicular angle and shall not be allowed to pass
parallel through a buffer. Signs may be placed within the buffer yard consistent with the
regulations of Section 6.4 (Signage Standards). Active recreational uses, such as play fields,
swimming pools, tennis courts etc. or circulation drives, loading areas and parking lots shall not
be permitted in the buffer yard.
2. Permitted uses - The following uses may be permitted in a buffer yard provided that none of the
required plant material is eliminated, the intended screening is accomplished, the total width of
the buffer yard is not reduced and all other requirements of this Section are met:
 Passive recreation
 Sculpture, outdoor furniture, picnic areas
 Pedestrian or bike trails
 Golf courses
6-36 7/23/07
3. Reduction in the required buffer yard - Where a dedicated buffer yard exists on an abutting
property, a reduction or elimination of a buffer yard for a property to be developed may be
permitted subject to the following:
 The adjacent property owners have provided a written, legally-binding agreement, such as a
recorded easement or deed restriction, restricting the use of the dedicated buffer yard to uses
provided for in this Section; and
 The "net" buffer yard satisfies the minimum buffer yard requirements of this Section. The
net buffer yard shall include the cumulative total for both the required buffer yards.
4. Existing vegetation - Existing healthy vegetation may be counted toward the required
landscaping if it fulfills all the requirements of Section 6.3.4 (Tree preservation requirements). To
do so, the landscape plan shall indicate the type, number and size of the existing plants that are
sufficient to comply with the requirements of the respective yard type. It is not necessary to
indicate the total inventory of existing plants, only those intended to meet the requirements of
this Ordinance shall be required to be listed.
5. Application toward setback requirements - Buffer yard areas may be counted toward the required
building setbacks. However, the required buffer width may not be a simple setback, but is to be
planted to meet the requirements of this Section. The plants comprising the buffer shall be
arrayed across the entire width of the buffer in a manner designed to achieve a suitable buffering
effect, and not just planted in a row or rows.
6. Designation of buffer yard as landscaped area for non-residential property - Buffer yards shall be
designated as landscape buffer yard easements on the application for development approval and
on the subdivision plat. The buffer yard shall be recorded with the title of the property as a
landscape buffer yard easement.
7. Ownership of buffer yards in residential subdivisions - The required buffer yards in a residential
subdivision shall not be wholly owned (in fee simple absolute) by the owner of an individual lot.
But rather that the buffers be owned by a property or homeowner’s association, third party or
shall otherwise be divided so that the buffer is not removed, modified or damaged. However,
buffer yards may be left under the control of the lot owner provided that the width of the buffer
yard is doubled and each lot contain a deed restriction that the buffer yard be left undisturbed.
Any required buffer (including those required as a zoning condition) for residential
developments shall not be credited toward meeting the lot size requirements - whatever its
ownership status, but may be credited toward meeting the open space requirements.
8. Buffer yard on a property line - when platting abutting lots, the applicant may dedicate a buffer
yard that straddles the property line, provided the cumulative buffer width is maintained for both
yards.
9. Common Access Drives - A shared ingress-egress easement driveway may relocate a nonvisual
separation buffer yard to provide efficient access between properties provided the required
buffer yard is planted adjacent to the proposed access easement and all landscaping is installed
pursuant to this section.
10. Walls, fences or berms - A wall, earthen berm, or fence, a minimum of six feet high to a
maximum of eight feet high (constructed of vinyl masonry, cedar, redwood or pressure treated
lumber) may be used to reduce the minimum width of an opaque buffer by 50 percent. All
fences shall be constructed with two identical sides/faces or so that the nonstructural
"good"
side/face is directed toward the adjacent property or the public right of way. Fences/located on
6-37 7/23/07
both sides of the fence/wall. Earthen berms may vary in height from four to six feet, shall not
have a slope greater than three to one and must be covered with turf grasses or other appropriate
planting material. Berms must be at least 6 feet tall in order to reduce a screening buffer yard by
50 percent.
Yard types: There shall be four different buffer yard types - A, B, C, D. The type to be used will be
determined by the relationship between the adjacent land use classes. There shall be five land use
classes based upon the specific land use to be developed, which is permitted by right or
conditionally, in the following groupings of zoning district or land use groupings as listed in the
Table of Permitted Uses (Section 5.4) of this Ordinance.
Class 1 Class 2

The Buffer Yard Type (Table 6-8) identifies the type required for a given development, based on the
relationship between adjacent land uses. If an adjacent parcel is undeveloped, the minimum buffer
shall be determined solely based on the zoning of the adjacent parcel. Otherwise, the required buffer
yard type will be based on the specific land use of the proposed development. The Buffer Yard
Landscaping Requirements (Table 6-9) contains the required plantings and dimensions for the
6-38 7/23/07
respective buffer yards. The width of the buffer yard and the density of plantings increase as the
difference in the nature and intensity of development in the respective adjacent land uses increase.

Notes:
1. Complete visual separation is required using densely planted, evergreen landscaping that will
provide complete visual separation within three years of planting.
2. New single-family subdivisions shall provide the required buffer yard if they abut existing nonresidential
developments, which were constructed before the adoption of this Ordinance and
lack the required buffer yard. If the adjacent non-residential development includes the required
buffer yard, none shall be required of the residential subdivisions.
3. Semi-opaque visual separation is required using densely planted evergreen landscaping that will
provide visual separation within 3 years of planting.

provide complete visual separation within three years of planting, or a six foot fence
(constructed of masonry or pressure treated lumber).
2. New single-family subdivisions shall provide the required buffer yard if they abut existing nonresidential
developments, which were constructed before the adoption of this Ordinance and
lack the required buffer yard. If the adjacent non-residential development includes the required
buffer yard, none shall be required of the residential subdivisions.
6-39 7/23/07
3. When visual separation is required, the Administrator may, during inspection, require additional
landscaping if the existing or proposed landscaping does not provide complete visual separation.
4. A Type A buffer yard may be reduced to five (5) feet for properties less than four (4) acres in
size.
5. Type A landscaping materials may be relocated outside required buffer areas with the approval of
the Planning Director when overall appearance of the site would be improved by relocation of
the landscaping material.
6.3.10 STREET YARD DESIGN STANDARDS
1. Protected street yards - A protected street yard is required along each property frontage that
abuts a public or private street. The yard shall be a minimum eight feet in depth, measured
perpendicular from the right of way/property line and extend the length of the linear frontage of
the property line.
2. Impervious surface restrictions - No more than fifteen percent of the protected street yard may
contain impervious material. Access drives to the property are excluded from this requirement.
3. Plantings in the protected street yard - The area is to contain, at a minimum, grass or ground
cover. Parking lot buffers and street trees may be planted in the protected street yard.
4. Prohibited uses - Parking, off street loading and merchandise display and storage are prohibited
in the protected street yard.
5. Street tree landscaping required - Street trees shall be required along each property frontage that
abuts a private or public street. It is not the intent of this Section to form a continual
landscaped planting area; however, at a minimum, trees shall be planted and mulched according
to acceptable City standards.
6. Street tree location - Required street trees shall be planted in an area from the property line to a
maximum distance of twenty-five feet from the property line. No planted or existing tree
located more than twenty-five feet from the property line shall count toward the street tree
requirement. All required street trees must meet the placement standards of Table 6-6 (Tree
installation, minimum separation distances). Required street trees - Street trees shall be planted
according to one of the following requirements:
 Large trees, where feasible, shall be planted at a rate of one tree for every forty feet of linear
street frontage, with a minimum of one tree on any street frontage less than forty feet.
 In the case of conflict with utility lines, overhead or underground, or other prohibiting
factors two small trees shall be planted for every required large tree or a combination of large
and small trees where at least one half of the large tree requirement is installed and one small
tree is installed for every remaining large tree required. (A minimum of at least two large
trees is required).
7. Street tree distribution - Trees shall be equally distributed along the street frontage, but they are
not required to be at absolute equal intervals. This allows for flexibility in design and for building
identification while discouraging long intervals without trees.
6-40 7/23/07
8. Sight triangles - No street tree shall be planted within a sight triangle without prior approval
from the City Engineering Division.
9. Street tree pruning - For security, accessibility and visual identification, tree limbs shall be pruned
up to seven feet in the street yard in the second year after installation.
10. Shrubbery is encouraged to supplement required street trees and is recommended to be
incorporated into all submitted landscape plans.
6.3.11 VEHICULAR SURFACE AREA (VSA) DESIGN STANDARDS
Landscaping requirements of this section shall be applicable as required in Section 6.3.2. However,
lots that have a proposed impervious surface ratio (ISR) of less than 0.20 (20%) are exempt from the
requirements of this section except all parking spaces shall be located within 60 ft. of a parking lot
tree.
The following landscaping standards shall apply to all VSA landscaping:
(1) Vehicle accommodations shall be shaded by medium to large trees, either preserved or planted;
(2) All planting shall be distributed throughout the VSA; All vehicular surface areas shall be located
within 60 ft. of a parking lot tree.
(3) A minimum of 50% of the required landscaping of this section shall be provided in the interior
of the VSA, such as landscaping islands, at the end of parking bays, inside medians, or between
parking spaces;
(4) Trees and shrubs that are required for landscape buffers and are located within 25 ft. of the
vehicular surface area may count towards the VSA landscaping requirement. Street trees shall not
count towards the VSA landscaping requirement.
(5) If a vehicular surface buffer is required, the shrubs required to meet the vehicular surface buffer
requirement may count toward the VSA landscaping requirement.
(6) 50% of VSA landscaping shall be of an evergreen species.
(7) Any shrub or tree planted within ten (10) feet of a building does not qualify for meeting the VSA
landscaping requirements.
The amount of landscaping required is determined by the amount and intensity of the proposed
impervious surface on the lot. The impervious surface ratio (ISR) is determined by the following
formula:
(a) Total amount of impervious surface area on the lot
including building area (sq.ft.)……….………………………..…..
(b) Total lot area (sq. ft.)………………………………………….........
(c) ISR (Divide impervious surface area by total lot area) ….………....

If ISR is 0.70 to 0.85 ………………………………….……….ISI is moderately high
If ISR is 0.40 to 0.69 .………………………………………….ISI is moderate
If ISR is 0.20 to 0.39 …………………………………………..ISI is low
If ISR is less than 0.20 stop here …………………………… No landscaping is required
(d) Total impervious surface area not including the building area (sq. ft.)

If the amount of proposed parking spaces is twenty five percent or more than the minimum required
spaces as delineated in Table 6-1 (Off Street Parking Requirements), an increase in the amount of
required vehicular surface area landscaping is required. The amount of increase is determined as
follows:

The total amount of required trees and shrubs equals the amount determined through the
Impervious Surface Intensity calculation plus, if necessary, the additional amount required by the
Percent Increase calculation.
Exceptions and deductions to required landscaping – As an incentive to create innovative design, the
following standards may be applied to reduce the required amount of VSA landscaping for a total
reduction not to exceed twenty percent. For each standard incorporated into the VSA design, you
may reduce the required number of trees and shrubs by five percent.
1. A minimum of fifty percent of the parking is provided to the side or rear of the building.
2. Shared parking is provided per Section 6.1.7 (Shared parking).
3. A minimum of twenty-five percent of the total parking lot is paved using paving grids or other
approved pervious materials.
4. An undisturbed natural area, wholly within the parking area and a minimum size of five percent
of the total parking area, is preserved according to Section 6.3.4 (Tree preservation
requirements). The preservation of this area will not reduce the required landscaping beyond
the five percent credit awarded here. No preserved trees in this natural area will be counted
against any of the landscaping required by this Section.
6.3.12 VEHICULAR SURFACE BUFFER
If proposed parking or any part of a VSA is within fifteen (15) feet of the right-of-way, as measured
perpendicularly from the right-of-way/property line, a vehicular surface buffer (VSB) is required.
Landscaping requirements – Evergreen shrubs shall be planted along the peripheral edge of the
parking area that is within fifteen feet of the right of way. The shrubs are expected to have mature
height and width of three and one half feet within three years, except for the display areas of
automobile sales lots, which shall have a mature height of two and one half feet.
Screen Location – All shrubbery shall be planted three feet on center and no closer than three feet
from the curb or edge of the parking area.
To calculate the amount of shrubbery required, the following formula shall be applied:
Total linear footage of VSA within 15 feet of right-of-way
Divide line (a.) by 3 _____________
Total Shrubs required is the sum of line (b.) _____________
Sight distance triangle – No shrubbery shall block or be located within the sight distance triangles
established for the respective rights of way.
6-43 7/23/07
6.3.13 MISCELLANEOUS SCREENING DESIGN STANDARDS
Service areas, loading and delivery docks, dumpsters, trash/recycling containers, HVAC units and
outdoor storage areas shall be screened from off-site views to achieve a complete visual barrier. This
opaque screen may consist of fencing, walls, evergreen landscaping, berms, raised roofs (for roofmounted
HVAC) or other methods approved by the Planning and Community Development
Director. This shall apply to all nonresidential and multi-family development as well as instances
where a change of use takes place. Dumpster screening shall be at least 6 ft. in height and provide
opaque gates that also serve to screen the dumpster. Dumpsters exceeding six ft. in height shall be
screened by fencing, walls, landscaping and other methods equal to the height of the dumpster.
Dumpster lids shall remain closed and not be allowed to be overfilled. All commercial, office and
industrial dumpsters not complying with the screening standards of this section that are visible from
a public street right-of-way or residentially zoned or developed property shall be brought into
compliance with this section within one year of adoption of this Ordinance. The Planning Director
may waive or modify this requirement if the dumpster's location, orientation or other factors make
screening impractical.
6.3.14 RESIDENTIAL YARD DESIGN STANDARDS
As a requirement of residential subdivision approval, the subdivider shall plant trees in the front
setback of each lot and in any side or rear lot abutting an existing or proposed right-of-way in the
subdivision.
Residential street yard requirements - Each lot, including open space/recreational areas and storm
water retention areas, that abuts a private or public street in a residential subdivision must have one
large street tree for every forty feet of street frontage or two small trees for every thirty feet of lot
frontage. At a minimum, each lot shall have one large tree or two small trees in fulfillment of this
requirement.
Street tree location - The required street trees shall be planted within the area that measures eight feet
perpendicularly from the edge of the street right of way and extends the length of the linear frontage
of the lot.
6.3.15 ALTERNATIVE METHODS OF COMPLIANCE
Use of alternate plan, material or methods - Alternate landscaping plans, plant materials or planting
methods may be used where unreasonable or impractical situations would result from strict
application of landscaping requirements or where necessary to protect existing vegetation. Such
situations may result from streams, natural rock formations, topography, protected riparian buffer
locations, other physical conditions; or from lot configuration, utility easements or unusual site
conditions.
Approval of alternate plan - For site plans that are not reviewed by the City Council, the Planning
Director may approve alternate landscaping plans that propose different plant materials, methods
and locations if the quality, effectiveness, durability and performance are equivalent to that required
by this Ordinance. The Planning Director may require that sufficient evidence or proof be submitted
to substantiate any claim that may be made regarding its use.

Surface area - The surface area of a sign shall be computed as including the entire area within a
regular geometric form or combination of regular geometric forms comprising all of the display area
of the sign and including all of the elements of the matter displayed. Frames and structural members
not bearing advertising matter shall not be included in computation of surface area. Freestanding
signs shall be computed on the basis of one surface only, provided the opposite surface is identical
size and shape, not necessarily in copy or advertisement. The allowable sign area computed by
applying the square feet/linear feet multiplier shall cover all signs on the building or structure and
freestanding signs, except where high rise signs are specifically added to the allowable signs.
Height - The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance to the highest point of the sign or
sign structure, measured from the base of the sign at normal grade. Normal grade shall be
considered to be existing grade prior to construction; or newly established grade after construction,
exclusive of any filling, berming, mounding or excavating solely for the purpose of locating the sign.
In cases where normal grade cannot reasonably be determined, sign height shall be computed on the
assumption that the elevation of the normal grade is equal to the elevation of the nearest point of the
crown of a public street.
Number of Signs - For the purposes of determining the number of signs, a sign shall be considered
to be a single display surf ace or display device containing elements organized, related and composed
to form a cohesive unit. Where matter is displayed in a random manner without an organized
relationship of elements or where there is doubt about the organization of elements, each element
shall be considered a single sign. A two-sided sign shall be regarded as one sign.
Maximum allowable sign area - The maximum allowable sign area computed by applying the square
feet to linear feet multiplier shall cover all signs on the building/structure and ground signs, except
where high-rise signs are specifically added to the allowable signs.
Lots with more than one building wall with public street frontage - If a building has frontage on
more than one public street, then the total sign surface permitted on that lot shall be the sum of the
sign surface area allotments for each public street on which the building wall has frontage.
Building frontage - Building frontage shall mean the horizontal length of a building wall facing a
public street or public parking area, whichever is greater. If that side is not a straight wall, being
concave, convex or having projections, the building frontage shall be the horizontal distance from
the corner at one end of the wall facing the public street to the corner at the opposite end of the wall
facing the same public street.

6.5 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT FOR NEW DEVELOPMENT
6.5.1 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION
The Legislature of the State of North Carolina has, in Chapter (T15A), Article (02B), Section (.0235),
entitled Neuse River Basin-Nutrient Sensitive Waters Management Strategy; Basinwide Stormwater
Requirements, designated specific local governments for the development of new stormwater
management requirements as part of the Neuse River Nutrient Sensitive Waters stormwater
management strategy. The requirements of this Chapter shall apply to property located within the
Neuse River Basin.
6.5.2 ABBREVIATIONS
For purposes of this chapter, the following abbreviations are utilized and incorporated.
BMP Best Management Practices
DWQ North Carolina Division of Water Quality
G.S. North Carolina General Statute
MD State of Maryland
NC State of North Carolina
NCAC North Carolina Administrative Code
NPDES National Pollution Discharge Elimination System
TN Total Nitrogen

6.5.3 NUTRIENT REDUCTION REQUIREMENTS
Definition of new development/land disturbance. For purposes of this chapter, DEVELOPMENT
OR LAND DISTURBANCE shall be defined to include the following:
1. Any activity that disturbs greater than one acre of land in order to establish, expand or modify a
single-family or duplex residential development or a recreational facility;
2. Any activity that disturbs greater than one-half acre of land in order to establish, expand or
modify a multi-family residential development or a commercial, industrial or institutional facility;
3. Any grubbing, stump removal and/or grading activity.
4. Exemptions. Agriculture, mining or forestry activities are not subject to the new development
requirements of this chapter.
6.5.4 VESTED RIGHTS
1. Property owners who can demonstrate that they have vested rights as of March 1, 2001 will not
be subject to the requirements of this Chapter for new development. Vested rights may be
based on at least one of the following:
 Substantial expenditures of resources as determined by the Engineering Department (time,
labor, and money) based on a good faith reliance upon having received a valid local
government approval to proceed with the project, or
6-60 7/23/07
 Having an outstanding valid building permit in compliance with G. S. 153-344.1 or G.S.
160A-38 5.1, or
 Having an approved site specific or phased development plan in compliance with G.S.
153A-344.1 or G. S. 160A-385.1.
2. Projects that require state permits, such as landfills, NPDES wastewater discharges, land
application of residuals and road construction activities shall be considered to have vested rights
if a state permit was issued prior to November 20, 2000.
6.5.5 CALCULATION OF NITROGEN EXPORT
The nitrogen export from each development must be calculated. This export will be calculated in
pounds per acre per year lb/ac/yr). The following methodologies will be used for calculating
nitrogen export from new development (refer to the City of Goldsboro Stormwater Management
Program for Nitrogen Control in the Neuse River Basin for calculating nitrogen export loading):
1. Method 1 is intended for residential developments where lots are shown, but the actual
footprints of buildings are not shown on the plans.
2. Method 2 is for residential, commercial, and industrial developments when the entire footprint
of the roads, parking lots, buildings, and any other built-upon area is shown on the site plans.
3. For nonresidential subdivisions where the impervious surfaces are not shown on the plans at the
time of submittal, the developer or builder will specify areas of impervious surface, undisturbed
open space, and managed open space in their building permit application, assuming the
maximum impervious surfaces and minimum open space for the project design. The developer
or builder will then use Method 2 for their calculation.
4. For redevelopment projects, the procedure as described in the City of Goldsboro Stormwater
Management Program for Nitrogen Control in the Neuse River Basin will be used to determine
the total change in nitrogen loading.
6.5.6 NITROGEN EXPORT STANDARDS
All new development will be limited to a nitrogen export of 3.6 pounds per acre per year lbs/ac/yr).
Property owners will have the option to partially offset projected nitrogen loads by funding wetland
or riparian area restoration through the NC Wetlands Restoration Program. As established by Rule
15A NCAC 2B .0240, the rate shall be $11/lb/yr, at an amount sufficient to fund 30 years of
nitrogen reduction. The result is a one-time offset payment of $330/lb/ac, which must be paid prior
to approval of the development plan. However, no new residential development will be permitted to
exceed a total nitrogen loading rate of 6.0 lbs/ac/yr, and no new nonresidential development will be
permitted to exceed 10.0 lbs/ac/yr.
If the development contributes greater than 3.6 lbs/ac/yr of nitrogen, then Table 6-10 summarizes
the options available, depending upon whether the development is residential or nonresidential. Any
changes to the nitrogen export standards approved by the Environmental Management Commission
will be adopted by reference.
6-61 7/23/07
Table 6-10
Nitrogen Export Reduction Options
Residential Commercial/Industrial
If the computed export is less than 6.0 lbs/ac/yr then
the owner may either:
If the computed export is less than 10.0 lbs/ac/yr then
the owner may either:
Install BMPs to remove enough nitrogen to bring the
development down to 3.6 lb/ac/yr.
Install BMPs to remove enough nitrogen to bring the
development down to 3.6 lbs/ac/yr.
Pay a one-time offset payment of $330/lb to bring the
nitrogen down to the 3.6 lbs/ac/yr.
Pay a one-time offset payment of $330/lb to bring the
nitrogen down to the 3.6 lbs/ac/yr.
Do a combination of BMPs and offset payment to
achieve a 3.6 lbs/ac/yr export.
Do a combination of BMPs and offset payment to
achieve a 3.6 lbs/ac/yr export.
If the computed export is greater than 6.0 lbs/ac/yr.,
the owner must use on-site BMPs to bring the
development’s export down to 6.0 lbs/ac/yr. Then,
the owner may use one of the three options above to
achieve the reduction between 6.0 and 3.6 lbs/ac/yr.
If the computed export is greater than 10.0 lbs/ac/yr.,
the owner must use on-site BMPs to bring the
development’s export down to 10.0 lbs/ac/yr. Then,
the owner may use one of the three options above to
achieve the reduction between 10.0 and 3.6 lbs/ac/yr.
If an offset payment is being made to the Wetlands Restoration Program, the owner must provide
the City with evidence that DWQ has received payment prior to the City's issuance of a building
permit.
6.5.7 PEAK RUN-OFF CONTROL
There shall be no net increase in peak stormwater runoff flow leaving a new development site from
the pre-development conditions for the 1-year, 24-hour storm as determined by calculating the preand
post-development runoff in accordance with the City of Goldsboro Stormwater Management Program
for Nitrogen Control in The Neuse River Basin.
The Rational Method is the most common method for computing the peak rate of runoff from small
drainage basins (up to 150 acres) and will be used to determine the peak flow from both the
predevelopment
(performed prior to issuance of the building permit) and post-development
(performed prior to issuance of the certificate of occupancy) conditions. If peak runoff needs to be
calculated for a larger drainage area (more than 150 acres), the peak discharge method as described in
the USDA Soil Conservation Service's Technical Release Number 55 (TR-55) will be employed for
computing the pre- and post-development conditions.
6.5.8 PROTECTING RIPARIAN BUFFERS
6.5.9 ESTABLISHMENT OF BUFFER
Riparian areas must be protected on new developments in accordance with the Riparian Buffer Rule
(15A NCAC 2B .0233). The rule requires for protecting and maintaining the 50-foot riparian buffers
on all sides of intermittent and perennial streams, ponds, lakes, and estuaries in the Neuse River
Basin. These waters must be shown on the most recent version of either a Natural Resources
6-62 7/23/07
Conservation Service (NRCS) soil survey county map or a 1:24,000 scale (7.5-minute quadrangle)
topographic map prepared by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). The City will refrain from issuing
local approvals for any new development activity that is proposed to take place within the first 50
feet adjacent to an affected water body, unless:
1. The person requesting the approval does not propose to impact the riparian buffer of a
surface water indicated on the NRCS or USGS map s listed above, or
2. The property owner had received approval by DWQ. DWQ approval could be:
a. An on-site determination from DWQ that surface waters are not present;
b. An authorization certificate for a use designated as allowable;
c. An authorization certificate and approval on a mitigation plan for a use designated as
allowable with mitigation ; or
d. A variance.
6.5.10 DESCRIPTION OF BUFFERS ON DEVELOPMENT PLANS
Riparian areas to be protected will be recorded on new or modified plats. If the plat shows an
encroachment in to a riparian buffer, the appropriate DWQ approval must accompany the
preliminary and final plat submissions.
6.5.11 ALLOWABLE BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES
The following best management practices may be utilized for nitrogen reduction:
1. Wet detention ponds;
2. Constructed wetlands
3. Open channel practices;
4. Riparian buffers;
5. Bioretention;
6. Vegetated filter strips with level spreader;
7. Sand filters;
8. Proprietary Best Management Practices (BMPs).
The total nitrogen (TN) BMP removal rates to be used in calculating nitrogen reductions are
provided in Table 6-11, below. Any state-approved modifications or additions to the list of BMPs
available for nitrogen reduction and/or determinations of TN removal rates are adopted by
reference.
If more than one BMP is installed in series on a development, then the removal rate shall be
determined through serial rather than additive calculations. For example, if a wet detention pond
6-63 7/23/07
discharges through a riparian buffer, then the removal rate shall be estimated to be 47.5 percent. The
pond removes 25 percent of the nitrogen and discharges 75 percent into the buffer. The buffer then
removes 30 percent of the nitrogen discharged from the pond, which is 22.5 percent. The sum of 25
and 22.5 is 47.5. The removal rate is not 25 percent plus 30 percent.

6.5.12 MAINTENANCE OF BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES
All best management practices that are implemented to achieve nitrogen reduction and flow
attenuation will require a maintenance plan. For the purposes of this Chapter, refer to:
1. Section 96.40, Improperly Operating BMPs (Stormwater Control Facilities) are Prohibited;
Responsibility for Maintenance.
2. Section 96.41, Compliance with Provisions.
3. Section 96.42, Inspections and Annual Inspection Fee.
6.5.13 BUILDING PERMIT AND BUILDING PERMIT REVIEW FEES
As of March 1, 2001, any builder applying for a building permit must submit his calculations for
nitrogen loading and peak runoff with both the preliminary and final plats. Application for a
building permit constitutes a certification by the developer or builder that all provisions of this
Chapter have been fully met and that the calculations for nitrogen loading and peak runoff, as shown
on the preliminary and final plats, are correct. Any BMP requiring engineering design will have the
engineer's seal and signature affixed to the design drawing, and the engineer's seal will attest that the
design for the BMP was completed in accordance with good engineering practices.
The City Council may set a fee structure for the cost of reviewing all building permit applications for
compliance with this Chapter, and the fee schedule will be as shown in the City of Goldsboro
Stormwater Management Program for Nitrogen Control in the Neuse River Basin.

the result of impoundment of waters of the state, are not waters of the state.
6.6.2 FINDINGS OF FACT
1. Water quality has been an issue in the Neuse River Basin for over a century. Despite a number
of initiatives between 1950 and 1995, the Neuse River Basin has continued to have water quality
problems. Although environmental conditions in the Neuse River are driven by complex
interactions between rainfall, flows, temperatures, biological factors, and chemistry, the long
history of problems with nutrient pollution and algal blooms provides evidence that immediate
control measures are necessary.
2. In August 1998, the final comprehensive Neuse River Nutrient Sensitive Waters Strategy was
adopted. The goal of the strategy is to achieve a 30 percent nitrogen reduction from each
controllable and quantifiable source of nitrogen in the basin. The City was one of the 15 largest
and fastest-growing local governments in the Neuse River basin which was required to comply
with the Neuse Stormwater Rule. This rule contains four program elements, one of which
pertains to illegal discharges.
3. Illegal discharges are substances deposited in storm sewers (which lead directly to streams) that
really should be handled as wastewater discharges. Depending on the source, illegal discharges
may contain nitrogen. Local governments that must comply with the Neuse Stormwater Rule,
including the City, must identify and remove illegal discharges.
6.6.3 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE
1. The purpose of this Chapter is to:
 Protect the public health, safety and welfare by controlling the discharge of pollutants into
the stormwater conveyance system;
 Promote activities directed toward the maintenance and improvement of surface and ground
water quality ;
6-70 7/23/07
 Satisfy the requirements imposed upon the City under its National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) discharge
permit issued by the State; and
 Establish administration and enforcement procedures through which these purposes can be
fulfilled.
The provisions of this Chapter are supplemental to regulations administered by federal and state
governments.
6.6.4 OBJECTIVES
The objectives of this Chapter are to:
1. Regulate the discharge of substances which may contaminate or cause pollution of stormwater,
stormwater conveyances, or waters of the State;
2. Regulate connections to the stormwater conveyance system;
3. Provide for the proper handling of spills; and
4. Provide for the enforcement of same.
6.6.5 APPLICATION OF PROVISIONS
This Chapter shall apply within the territorial jurisdiction of the City, with the following exclusions:
1. Federal, State, and local governments, including their agencies, unless intergovernmental
agreements have been established giving the City enforcement authority.
6.6.6 BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THIS LEGAL AUTHORITY
The Neuse River Basin: Model Stormwater Program for Nitrogen Control, dated August 30, 1999, requires
that local governments establish the legal authority to control illegal discharges. By March 2001, each
local government is required to show that it has established the legal authority to do the following:
1. Control the contribution of pollutants to the stormwater collection system associated with
industrial activity;
2. Prohibit illegal discharges to the stormwater collection system;
3. Prohibit discharge of spills and disposal of materials other than stormwater to the stormwater
collection system;
4. Determine compliance and non -compliance; and
5. Require compliance and undertake enforcement measures in cases of non-compliance.
6-71 7/23/07
6.6.7 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTION
This Chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants or deed
restrictions. However, where this Chapter and another conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the
more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
6.6.8 INTERPRETATION
In the interpretation and application of this Chapter all provisions shall be considered as minimum
requirements; liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and, deemed n either to limit not
repeal any other powers granted under State statutes.
6.6.9 ILLICIT DISCHARGES
No person shall cause or allow the discharge, emission, disposal, pouring, or pumping directly or
indirectly to any stormwater conveyance, the waters of the State, or upon the land in such proximity
to the same (such that the substance is likely to reach a Stormwater conveyance or the waters of the
State), any fluid, solid, gas, or other substance, other than stormwater; provided that non-stormwater
discharges associated with the following activities are allowed provided that they do not significantly
impact water quality:
1. Filter backwash and draining associated with swimming pools;
2. Filter backwash and draining associated with raw water intake screening and filtering devices;
3. Condensate from residential or commercial air conditioning;
4. Residential vehicle washing;
5. Flushing and hydrostatic testing water associated with utility distribution systems;

does not pose an environmental or health threat; and
6-72 7/23/07
15. Other non-stormwater discharges for which a valid NPDES discharge permit has been approved
and issued by DENR and provided that any such discharges to the municipal separate storm
sewer system shall be authorized by the City.
Prohibited substances include but are not limited to: oil, anti-freeze, chemicals, animal and human
waste, paints, garbage, litter, and other pollutants.
6.6.10 ILLICIT CONNECTIONS
1. Connections to a stormwater conveyance or stormwater conveyance system which allow the
discharge of non-stormwater, other than the exclusions described in §6.6.9, are unlawful.
Prohibited connections include, but are not limited to: floor drains, wastewater discharge from
washing machines or sanitary sewers, wash water discharge from commercial vehicle washing or
steam cleaning, and waste water discharge from septic systems.
2. Where such connections exist in violation of §6.6.9, that were made prior to the adoption of this
provision or any other ordinance prohibiting such connections, the property owner or the
person using the connection is allowed one year to remove the connection following application
of this regulation; provided that, this grace period shall not apply to connections which may
result in the discharge of hazardous materials or other discharges which pose an immediate
threat to health and safety, or are likely to result in immediate injury and harm to real or personal
property, natural resources, wildlife, or habitat.
3. Where it is determined that the connection:
 May result in the discharge of hazardous materials or may pose an immediate threat to the
health and safety, or is likely to result in immediate injury and harm to real or personal
property, natural resources, wildlife, or habitat; or
 Was made in violation of any applicable regulation or ordinance,
The City Manager or his designee shall designate the time within which the connection shall
be removed. In setting the time limit for compliance, the City shall take into consideration:
 The quantity and complexity of the work;
 The consequences of delay;
 The potential harm to the environment, to the public health, and to public and private
property ; and
 The cost of remedying the damage.
4. In regard to removing illicit connections, the responsible party must consider that permits are
required by the Inspections Department for connections to or modification of storm sewers
located in City owned rights-of-way. The costs of such permits will be borne by the responsible
party.
6-73 7/23/07
6.6.11 SPILLS
1. Spills or leaks of polluting substances discharged to, or having the potential to be indirectly
transported to the stormwater conveyance system, shall be contained, controlled, collected, and
removed promptly. All affected areas shall be restored to their preexisting condition.
2. Persons associated with the spill or leak shall immediately notify the City Fire Chief or his
designee of all spills or leaks of polluting substances. Notification shall not relieve any person of
any expenses related to the clean up, restoration, loss, damage, or any other liability which may
be incurred as a result of the spill or leak, nor shall such notification relieve any person from
other liability which may be imposed by State or other law.
6.6.12 INSPECTIONS
1. The Building Inspector (or other authorized agent of the City) has full power and authority to
enter upon a premise for the purpose of investigating an illegal discharge. Should the owner or
occupant of any property refuse to permit such reasonable access, the Chief Building Inspector
or his designee may obtain an administrative search warrant pursuant to G.S. §15-27.2 or its
successor.
2. No person shall obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while carrying out his
official duties.

No penalty shall be assessed until the person alleged to be in violation is served written notice of
the violation by registered mail, certified mail-return receipt requested, or personal service (such
as express mail service or courier). Refusal to accept the notice shall not relieve the violator of
the obligation to pay the penalty. The City Manager or his designee shall make written demand
for payment upon the person in violation. If the payment is not received or equitable settlement
reached within 30 days after demand for payment is made, the matter shall be referred to the

7.0 SUBDIVISION DESIGN STANDARDS
7.1 GENERAL DESIGN STANDARDS
7.1.1 STREETS
The location and width of all proposed streets shall be in conformity with official plans of the City
and with existing or amended plans of the Planning Commission. The proposed street layout shall be
coordinated with the street system of the surrounding area and, where possible, existing principle
streets shall be extended. Where in the opinion of the City Council it is desirable to provide for street
access to an adjoining property, proposed streets shall be extended by dedication to the boundary of
such property.
Permanent dead end streets or cul-de-sacs shall not exceed eight hundred feet in length and shall be
provided with a turnaround having a paving diameter of at least eighty feet and a right of way
diameter of at least one hundred feet. Temporary dead-end streets shall be provided with a turn
around having a radius of at least one half of the street right of way. Rural cul-de-sac access streets
shall have a maximum length of eight hundred feet and shall be provided with turnarounds with a
minimum right of way diameter of one hundred and twenty feet and a minimum paving diameter of
eighty feet.
Alleys of at least twenty feet in width shall be provided to the rear of all lots used for business
purposes. All dead end alleys shall provide a turn around with a paving diameter of eighty feet.
There shall be no reserve strips platted in any subdivision. All streets shall comply with the
construction standards as detailed in Section 7.2. Private streets shall be permitted provided they
comply with the right-of-way and all construction standards of a publicly-dedicated street.
7.1.2 STREET INTERSECTIONS
Insofar as practical, streets shall intersect at an angle of ninety degrees for a minimum of fifty feet
from the roadway intersection. In no case shall the angle of intersection be less than seventy-five
degrees. Intersections having more than four corners shall be prohibited.
Proposed streets that intersect at opposite sides of another street (either existing or proposed) shall
be laid out to intersect directly opposite from each other. A minimum length of one hundred and
fifty feet between survey centerlines shall separate intersections that cannot be aligned.
Intersections with a major thoroughfare shall be at least one thousand and three hundred feet apart,
measured centerline to centerline.

existing street. In no case shall the name for a proposed street duplicate or be phonetically similar to
existing street names, irrespective of the use of the suffix street, avenue, boulevard, drive, place or
court.
7.1.4 STREET SIGNS
Street signs shall be installed by the City. The developer shall reimburse the City for the full costs of
installation.
7.1.5 STREET LIGHTS
The developer shall install streetlights within subdivisions in accordance with City standards. In
instances where underground wiring is required, the developer shall pay to the applicable power
company the charges for underground terminal facilities for all street lighting. If the developer desires
a different lighting design, other than the City standards, the developer shall pay the City an amount
equal to the difference in material and installation cost.
7.1.6 SIDEWALKS
Sidewalks, walkways and other pedestrian ways shall be provided by the developer within and/or
adjacent to any major subdivision. All sidewalks shall be located within the public right of way, be
installed to City standards and shall be approved by the City Engineer.

1. Sidewalks shall be provided along both sides of all major thoroughfares as shown on the
official Thoroughfare or Transportation Plan.
2. Sidewalks shall be provided along one side of all minor streets, including cul-de-sacs.
When sidewalk construction is required by the Unified Development Ordinance, the City Council for
site plans requiring City Council approval or the Planning Director for plans requiring staff approval,
may allow the developer the option of paying a fee in lieu for sidewalk construction. The fees
acquired from this ordinance shall be used for sidewalk projects within the city of Goldsboro and its
extra-territorial jurisdiction. The City of Goldsboro reserves the right to require sidewalk
construction and not allow a fee in lieu. The fee for sidewalk construction shall be $15.00 a lineal
foot. Driveways shall be subtracted from the lineal frontage of the property.

employed, in addition to meeting the minimum size of this Ordinance, such lots shall have to meet
the minimum size requirements of the Wayne County Health Department for the installation of the
aforementioned utility systems.
Lot lines shall be substantially at right or radial angles to the street lines. All lot lines characterized by
subdividing an existing or proposed building or portion thereof shall meet all the applicable North
Carolina State Building Code regulations including, but not limited to, fire walls.
Lots subject to flooding and lots deemed to be uninhabitable shall not be platted for residential
occupancy nor for other such uses as may increase danger to health, life or property or aggravate the
flood hazard.
Lots shall be of such configuration to provide adequate building sites. All remnants of lots or residual
parcels of a larger tract must be added to adjacent lots, rather than allowed to remain as an unusable
parcel.
Corner lots for residential purposes shall have an extra width to permit appropriate building setback
from and orientation to both adjacent streets.
Double frontage lots shall be avoided except where necessary to provide residential separation from
highways, traffic arteries, railroads or other incompatible uses. Where double frontage lots are
allowed, the depth of said lots shall be increased by a minimum of twenty feet to provide an
7-5 7-23-07
additional separation between the residence and the highway, traffic artery, railroad or other noncompatible
use.
Where land is subdivided into parcels larger than ordinary building lots, such lots shall be so arranged
as to allow for the opening of future streets and further logical subdivision.
All lots shall be provided access in accordance with City standards. All lots shall have a minimum
frontage along a public or private street of at least 50 feet except that the frontage of a cul de sac lot
may be reduced to 35 feet.
7.1.10 EASEMENTS
Utility easements shall be centered on the rear or side lot lines and shall be at least fifteen feet in
width.
Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainage way, channel or stream, there shall be
provided a storm water easement or drainage right of way conforming substantially with the lines of
such watercourse and such further width or construction as will be adequate for the purpose of
storm water drainage. Parallel streets or parkways may be required in connection therewith.
Rural access streets and cul-de-sacs shall have a minimum easement of ten feet on either side of the
right of way. Wider easements may be necessary as determined by the City Engineer to facilitate
proper grading of cross sections and storm drainage systems.
The developer, as necessary to accommodate future utilities and adequate drainage, shall provide
additional easements.
All access easements shall include a recorded instrument that provides for perpetual maintenance in a
condition that permits access by emergency vehicles to all the properties served. The cost of
maintenance is to be shared equally by all of the owners served by such easement. All access
easements shall be installed prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy by the City Inspections
Department.
All easements are to be cleared and stabilized as approved by the City Engineer.
7.1.11 UTILITIES
Electric, cable, telephone and other communication lines within the subdivision and serving the
subdivision shall be installed underground according to City standards and without expense to the
City. The Council may grant modifications to these requirements upon recommendation from the
City Engineer that topography, soil conditions or other practicable difficulties would result in an
undue hardship.
7-6 7-23-07
7.1.12 WATER AND SEWER
Water and sanitary sewer mains shall be installed in accordance with City standards and shall be
approved by the Goldsboro City Engineer and the State of North Carolina, when such utilities are

3. Pruning Trees
The following guidelines are recommended to protect your investment. Proper pruning improves the health
and appearance of trees and prolongs their useful life be removing undesirable branches which are dead,
weakened, diseased or insect-infested.
Types of Pruning –
The National Arborist Association recognizes four classes of pruning which define the type and degree of
recommended pruning.
Class1: Fine Pruning – the thorough removal of undesirable branches over ½’” in diameter. This includes
selective thinning to lessen wind resistance. See Drawing.
Class 2: Standard Pruning – the removal of undesirable branches over 1” in diameter.
Class 3: Hazard Pruning - the removal of undesirable branches over 2” in diameter. This class is
recommended where safety considerations are paramount.
Class 4: Crown Reduction Pruning – the reduction in the size of the tree canopy.
Topping V.S. Thinning –
Proper pruning is not to be confused with the disfiguring practice of topping, which is prohibited. Topping
is the indiscriminate removal of a tree’s main leader and branches resulting in stubs.
The cut surfaces of the stubs do not close readily and internal decay develops. The resulting flush of multiple
water sprouts from the stubbed branches form terminals that are very weak. Topping leaves a tree highly
susceptible to damage from strong winds, winter injury, insects and diseases.
Thinning is the correct method for removal of branches to their point of attachment to the trunk or another
branch. This method eliminates unhealthy and unsightly stubs, resulting in an open, airy, natural appearance
to trees. Thinning requires more skill and time to perform than does topping. Trees that are properly pruned
and thinned will live longer and should not need to be pruned as often as trees that have been topped.
When To Prune –
Maintenance pruning of most shade trees can be done anytime. Severe pruning, however, should be done in
late winter or early spring before new growth begins. Pruning of “bleeder”, that is, trees like birch and maple
which seep profusely from cut surfaces in the spring , is sometimes delayed until the fall, although the loss of
sap is seldom injurious unless the cuts are large. Pruning of trees susceptible to certain vascular diseases, like
American elm and red oak, should be avoided during the activity period of beetles which spread the diseases.
HOW TO PRUNE TREES –
The objective of pruning is to produce strong, healthy, attractive plants. By understanding how, when and
why to prune, and by following a few simple principles, this objective can be achieved.
Pruning cuts should be made so that only branch tissue is removed and stem tissue is not damaged. At the
point where the branch attaches to the stem, branch and stem tissues remain separate, but are contiguous. If
only branch tissues are cut when pruning, the stem tissue of the tree will probably not become decayed, and
the wound will seal more effectively.
5
Pruning Living Branches –
To find the proper place to cut a branch, look for the branch collar that grows from the stem tissue at the
underside of the base of the branch. On the upper surface, there is usually a branch bark ridge that runs
(more or less) parallel to the branch angle, along the stem of the tree. A proper pruning cut does not damage
either the branch bark ridge or the branch collar.
A proper cut begins just outside the
branch bark ridge and angles down away
from the stem of the tree, avoiding injury
to the branch collar. Make the cut as
close as possible to the stem in the branch
axil, but outside the branch bark ridge, so
that stem tissue is not injured and the
wound can seal in the shortest time
possible. If the cut is too far from the
stem, leaving a branch stub, the branch
tissue usually dies and woundwood forms
from the stem tissue.
The quality of prune cuts can be
evaluated by examining pruning wounds
after one growing season. A concentric ring of woundwood will form from proper pruning
cuts.
When pruning small branches with hand pruners, make sure the tools are sharp enough to cut the branches
cleanly without tearing. Branches large enough to require saws should be supported with one
hand while the cuts are made. If the branch is too large to support, make a three-step pruning cut to
prevent bark ripping.
1. The first cut is a shallow notch
made on the underside of the
branch, outside the branch collar.
This cut will prevent a falling
branch from tearing the stem tissue
as it pulls away from the tree.
2. The second cut should be outside
the first cut, all the way through the
branch, leaving a short stub.
3. The stub is then cut just outside the
branch bark ridge/branch collar,
completing the
operation.
Pruning Dead Branches –
Prune dead branches in much the same way as live branches. Making the correct cut is usually
easy because the branch collar and the branch bark ridge can be distinguished from the dead
branch.
Drop Crotch Cuts –
A proper cut begins just above the branch bark ridge and extends through the stem parallel to the branch bark ridge.
Usually, the stem being removed is too large to be supported with one hand, so the three cut method should be used.
6
1. With the first cut, make a notch on the side of the stem
away from the branch to be retained, well above the
branch crotch.
2. Begin the second cut inside the branch crotch, staying
well above the branch bark ridge, and cut through the
stem above the notch.
3. Cut the remaining stub just inside the branch bark ridge
through the stem parallel to the branch bark ridge.
To prevent the abundant growth of sprouts on the stem
below the cut, make the cut at a lateral branch that is at least
one-third of the diameter of the stem of their union.
Guidelines –
Crown Thinning:
 Assess how a tree will be pruned from the top down.
 Favor branches with strong, U-shaped angles of attachment. Remove Branches with weak, V-shaped
angles of attachment.
 Ideally, lateral branches should be evenly spaced on the main stem of young trees.
 Remove any branches that rub or cross another branch.
 Make sure that lateral branches are no more than one-half to three-quarters of the diameter of the stem
to discourage the development of co-dominant stems.
 Do not remove more than one-quarter of the living crown of a tree at one time. If it is necessary to
remove more, do it over successive years.
Crown Raising:
 Always maintain live branches on at least two-thirds of a tree’s total height. Removing too many lower
branches will hinder the development of a strong stem.
 Remove basal sprouts.
Crown Reduction:
 Use crown reduction pruning only when absolutely necessary. Make the pruning cut at a lateral branch
that is at least one-third the diameter of the stem to be removed.
 If it is necessary to remove more than half of the foliage from a branch, remove the entire branch.

4. PLANTING GUIDELINES
The following guidelines to tree planting will help reduce transplanting shock and ensure that trees adapt to
the new site. Keep in mind that spring and fall are the best times of the year to plant trees.
Planting the Tree –
The tree should be planted at the same depth or slightly higher than it was growing at the nursery. A high
mound should be avoided as the soils can dry out quickly in the summer and freeze in the winter.
The hole should be dug shallow and wide. It should not be any deeper than the root ball but should be a
wide hole, allowing for amendments, if necessary, or for loosening heavy soil to allow for improved oxygen
availability and root penetration.
The backfill soil should be added gradually and watered carefully to settle the soil but not to saturate it.
Balled and burlapped trees should have any untreated burlap pulled away from the top of the root ball and
cut away, not buried, so that none of the burlap is exposed at the soil surface. Otherwise, the burlap can wick
moisture away from the roots of the freshly planted tree.
Staking the Tree –
Stakes should only be necessary to support trees on windy sites or for smaller trees with weak trunks. The
stakes should be placed before the backfill is added to avoid damaging any large roots. A stake is meant to
provide temporary support and should be removed within a year or two to allow the tree to develop trunk
strength and to limit the potential for physical damage from the stakes and support ties.
Anything used for a tie should have a flat, smooth surface and be somewhat elastic to allow for slight
movement for the tree. Suitable materials include rubber strips or webbing and belting. Wire covered with a
hose or tubing should NOT be used.
Water –
Because a newly transplanted tree may have lost much of its root system, watering is critical for successful
establishment. Initial watering at planting should be followed with weekly watering, at a minimum,
particularly during dry periods. A newly planted tree will benefit from at least an inch of water a week.
Mulch –
Newly planted trees respond well to mulch placed around the tree. This reduces initial root competition with
turf and limits the possibility of physical damage by mowers. Mulch material also allows for the exchange of
gases between the atmosphere and soil; helps provide for better water penetration into soil; and, reduces
evaporation of soil water, conserving soil moisture for optimal root growth. These factors contribute to the
health of the trees and increase the likelihood of survival.
The mulch should NOT be piled around the tree and should not actually touch the tree trunk. No more than
a 2-3 inch depth of mulch should be added with it being no more than ½ inch deep closest to the tree.
Effects of too much mulch in planting areas include excessive moisture, reduced oxygen, and fungal growth.
The ideal mulch pattern tapers from a two – four inch depth of well-composted organic matter at the dripline
of trees and shrubs to bare soil at the trunk. Sandy soils need deeper mulch layers over the new root-zone
than clay soils.
Pruning –
When planting a tree, only dead or broken branches should be removed. All living branches should be left on
the tree to help promote tree establishment. Once the tree has been established on the site training pruning
can be done to promote good branching patterns, but no more than ¼ of the branches should be removed at
any one time.
Fertilizer –
9
Fertilizer is not generally necessary at the time of planting and, indeed, if placed improperly in the planting
hole can injure roots. However, the addition of nitrogen, if applied as recommended on the product label,
can benefit a newly planted tree.
