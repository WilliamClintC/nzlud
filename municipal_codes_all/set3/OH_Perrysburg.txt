affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative provision
prior to the effective date of such enactment, or an action or proceeding for
the enforcement of such right or liability. Such enactment shall not be
construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in
violation of any such legislative provision, nor to affect an indictment or

continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the purpose of revision
and recodification.
   (b)    The repeal provided above shall not affect:

EDITOR'S NOTE
   The numbering system used in these Codified Ordinances is similar to that
used in the Ohio Revised Code and is consistent with general practice. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 238.02 indicates that the code number is 2, the chapter number is 238
(or the 38th chapter within code 2), and the section number is .02. The code
and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding
the first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being the
first two digits left of the decimal. The section number appears to the right
of the decimal. As another example, 408.01 indicates that the code number is 4,
the chapter number is 408 (or the 8th chapter within code 4), and the section
number is .01.
   With this numbering system the Codified Ordinances may be expanded almost
endlessly. Codes, titles and chapters are initially even-numbered, thus
reserving the use of odd numbers for future legislation. Sections within
chapters are consecutively numbered, except that penalty provisions are usually
assigned the number .99, as in the Revised Code. Exceptions are the Traffic and
General Offenses Codes, where the penalties are either grouped in one chapter
in each Code or are included as part of the sections. Newly created sections
subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right
of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively
numbered sections. For example, newly created 660.061, 660.062 and 660.063
follow 660.06 and precede 660.07 to be placed in their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections and subsections without
histories or with the words "Adopting Ordinance" at the end thereof are or
contain new matter ordained by the Adopting Ordinance that enacts these
Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance and resolution included in these Codified Ordinances. It indicates
whether a given ordinance or resolution was consolidated with another into one
section or split into two or more sections. Cross references direct the user to
subject matter reasonably related to material contained within a given chapter.

204.01  DATUM LINE ESTABLISHED.
   The datum line, from which all elevations and grades for future public
improvements shall be determined, is hereby established as the United States
Geological Survey bench mark located at the southwest corner of the Way Public
Library property at the intersection of Indiana and Louisiana Avenues. The
bench mark herein referred to has an established elevation of 632 feet above
sea level.
(Ord. 24-64. Passed 10-27-64.)
204.02  OFFICIAL SEAL.
   (a)   There is hereby established a Seal for the City of Perrysburg to be
used on stationery, equipment and other public displays.
   (b)   The design of such seal shall consist of:
   A circular disk with a rope running adjacent to the outside edge. Such rope
is spliced at the bottom of the Seal by weaving them together in such a manner
that both ends are exposed on the front surface and lashed together in four
equally spaced places. The strands of the rope are clearly shown and the rope
has a right hand lay. The thickness of such rope is 4.16 percent of the outside
diameter of the Seal. In the center of the Seal is a detailed upright figure of
Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry, similar to the statue of him at Front and
Louisiana Avenues. The height of such figure is 51.6 percent of the outside
diameter of the Seal. A thin line circumscribes the vertical figure and its
diameter is 57.5 percent of the outside diameter of the Seal. Surrounding the
inner circle are sixty-six equally spaced disks with a diameter of 2.08 percent
of the distance from the center of the Seal to the outer edge of the Seal. On
the upper part of the Seal, spaced equally between the solid disks and the
aforesaid rope in Cheltenham bold face capital letters with a height
approximately 9.2 percent of the outside diameter of the Seal, are the words
"CITY OF PERRYSBURG." Such words start ten degrees below a horizontal line
drawn through the center of the Seal and end ten degrees below such line on the
opposite side of such Seal, subtending 200 degrees in all. Also equally placed
between such solid disks and rope in numbers equal in height to such letters
and of the same style are the numbers "1816," the year Perrysburg was laid out
by the Federal government. Such numbers are placed at the bottom of the Seal.
In the two spaces between the numbers and the letters there are single disks of
the same size as those previously described and such disks are spaced equally
between such rope and the previously described disks and the letters and
numbers.
   (c)   The Seal, the design of which is governed by this section, shall not
be used as a substitute for either the seal of the Mayor of the City or the
seal of the Clerk of the City, which letter seals shall be used respectively on
documents and attestations executed by the Mayor or by the Clerk. (Ord. 6-65.
Passed 2-9-65.)

except that during the months of July and August, Council may dispense with one
of its regular meetings. Council may, by majority vote, change the day and hour
of holding any regular meeting, or adjourn the same to a day and hour
determined by a like vote of the members present if constituting a quorum. All
meetings of Council, whether regular or special, shall be open to the public.
(Ord. 4-2016.  Passed 1-19-16.)
   (b)    Special Meetings. Council shall hold such special meetings as may be
found necessary, which may be called by a vote of Council taken at any regular
or special meeting thereof, or which shall be called by the Clerk upon the
written request of the Mayor or President of Council or of three members of
Council. Any such vote or request shall state the time, place and date thereof
and the subject or subjects to be considered at the meeting, and no other
subject or subjects shall be considered except upon the approval of five or
more of the members of Council in attendance at such special meeting. Notice in
writing of each such special meeting called at the request of the Mayor, the
President of Council or three members of Council shall be given to each member
of Council and the Mayor by serving the same on each of them personally or by
leaving a copy thereof at his or her usual place of residence not less than
twenty-four hours preceding the date and hour of such meeting. Service of such
notice may be waived in writing or by attendance at such special meeting.
Failure of service of notice shall not invalidate any special meeting, provided
a quorum is present. Council may sit in executive session for lawful reasons.
However, any action resulting therefrom must be taken in public session.
Rule II. Executive Session; The Chair; Powers and Duties.
   (a)    Roll Call. The Mayor, or in his or her absence, the President of
Council, shall take the Chair at the hour appointed for Council to meet and

who shall enter in the Journal of each meeting the names of members present
thereat. In the absence of a quorum at the time appointed for a meeting, the
members present may, by a majority vote, take a recess or recesses and cause
the Clerk to procure the attendance of absent members.
   (b)    Temporary Chairman. In the absence of the Mayor and the President of
Council, the Clerk shall call Council to order. The Clerk shall call the roll
and if a quorum is found to be present, Council shall proceed to elect, by a
majority vote, a Temporary Chairman of the meeting until the appearance of the
Mayor or President of Council.
   (c)    Appeals From Decisions of the Chair. The Chair shall preserve decorum
and decide all questions of order, subject to appeal to Council. If any member
transgresses the Rules of Council, the Chair shall, or any member may, call him
or her to order and, in the latter instance, the Chair shall render a decision
as to the point of order. In case of an appeal from a ruling of the Chair, the
question shall be: "Shall the decision of the Chair stand as the decision of

Should one or more Council members oppose such action the following procedure
shall be followed:
   Committees shall be formed on a preference basis beginning with selection of
the Chairperson.  On roll call, each member shall indicate which committee he
or she would like to chair.  Should more than one member request the same
committee, a vote will be required with the majority of Council determining
which member shall be Chairperson.  Votes shall be taken on all such conflicts
until all Council members chair a committee.
   On second roll call, each Council member shall designate first choice for
another committee.  If there are more applicants than there are positions
available, a vote by all the members of Council shall determine the choice.  No
more than one seat per committee may be filled on this round of voting.
   A third roll call shall produce the last committee position for each Council
member.  As far as possible, individual preference shall determine the
committee assignment.  Any conflict shall be decided by a vote of Council as a
whole.  If conflict still results, the Chairperson shall arbitrarily decide the
conflict so that all committees are filled with three different individuals.
(Ord. 1-98.  Passed 1-5-98.)

times as necessary with the President of Council presiding.

request of two members, communicated to the City Clerk.

quorum.
   (g)   Temporary Chairperson.  In the absence of the Chairperson, the member
named next shall act as the Temporary Chairperson.
   (h)   Committee Reports.  Reports of Committees shall be the personal
responsibility of the Chairperson of the Committee and shall be submitted in
typewritten form to Council.  All documents referred shall be returned to
Council with the report of the Committee.  Upon motion, Council may relieve a
Committee of further reconsideration of any question and order it placed on the
calendar or transfer it to the Committee of the Whole for its consideration.
Rule VI. Motions; Rules
   (a)   Motions.  Robert’s Rules of Order, Revised, shall prevail except as
may otherwise be provided herein.
   (b)   Rule on Readings and Suspension of Rules.  Every ordinance or
resolution shall be fully and distinctly read at three different meetings of
Council.  Rules may be suspended upon the affirmative vote of five members of
Council to:

      (2)   Dispense with the full reading of an ordinance or resolution, i.e.

affirmative vote of five members of Council on the emergency clause is
required.  The emergency clause is debatable.

quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting of Council, but a number
less than a quorum may adjourn the meeting from time to time and compel the
attendance of absent members in such a manner and under such penalties as may
be prescribed by ordinance, resolution or rules of Council.  At any meeting at
which a quorum is present, any action may be taken by the affirmative vote of a
majority of the members of Council present, unless a larger number is required
by the provisions of the Charter or the laws of the State not in conflict
therewith.
   (e)   Call for Vote.  The Clerk shall alternate the rotation of the members
of Council when calling for a vote on ordinances and resolutions.
   (f)   Amending Rules.  A majority vote is required to alter, amend, rescind
or supplement these Rules.  Any proposed alteration, amendment or supplement
shall be submitted in writing at a regular meeting and placed on the calendar
for the next regular meeting under new business.  By unanimous recorded vote of
all members elected to Council, such proposed alteration, amendment or
supplement may be adopted at the meeting at which the same is submitted.
   (g)   Receipt of Ordinances and Resolutions.  Ordinances and/or resolutions
shall be received by individual Council members at least twenty-four hours in
advance of the meeting in order to be considered.  Certain emergency criteria
may require the waiving of this Rule which may be accomplished by a majority
vote of the members present.

266.03-1  DISPUTE SETTLEMENT STEPS.
   It is the desire of the City to provide for the prompt adjustment of
disputes in a fair and reasonable manner, with a minimum amount of interruption
of work schedules.  Every reasonable effort shall be made by the City and the
aggrieved staff members to effect resolution of disputes at the earliest step
possible.
   A dispute shall mean any difference which arises between the City and any
staff member below the Executive or Senior Administrative Staff Level covered
by this Personnel Policy regarding the meaning or application of the provisions
of this Personnel Policy or work rules.  The dispute settlement procedure under
this Personnel Policy shall take the place of any appeal to the State Personnel
Board of Review.  Disputes shall be processed in the following manner:
(Ord. 78-97.  Passed 6-3-97.)
   STEP 1: The staff member shall first present the dispute orally with that
staff member’s Division Head or his/her designee.  If a satisfactory settlement
is not achieved within five working days, the staff member shall reduce the
dispute to writing and present it to the Human Resources Manager within five
additional working days.
   STEP 2: Within ten working days of when the dispute is reduced to writing
and referred to Step 2, the staff member with a dispute shall meet with the
Human Resources Manager or his/her designee and the Division Head.  The City
will provide the staff member with its answer in writing within five working
days of the date of the Step 2 meeting.
   STEP 3:  If appealed to Step 3 by the staff member within five working days
of when the City gives its Step 2 answer, within an additional ten working days
the staff member with a dispute and a personal representative of the staff
member, who shall be a staff member of the City, shall meet with the Mayor or
the Mayor’s designee, the City Administrator, the Human Resources Manager, and
such other City officials as the Mayor or the Mayor’s designee deems
appropriate.  The City will provide the staff member with its final answer in
writing within five working days of the date of the Step 3 meeting.  The City’s
final answer shall be final and binding upon the staff member with a dispute
and all other affected staff members unless appealed to Step 4 by the staff
member with a dispute in writing and received by the City within five working
days of the City’s Step 3 answer.  (Ord. 110-2003.  Passed 6-17-03.)
   STEP 4:  If no satisfactory settlement is achieved between the City and the
staff member with a dispute at Step 3 and timely appeal is made by the staff
member with a dispute, the dispute may be submitted to arbitration.  Within ten
(10) working days after the City receives the timely appeal to Step 4,
representatives of the City and the staff member with a dispute or his/her
personal representative shall attempt to select a neutral arbitrator to hear
and determine the matter being referred to arbitration. If the representatives
of the City and the staff member with a dispute or his/her personal
representative are unable to agree upon a neutral arbitrator within the ten
(10) working day period mentioned above, the City and the staff member with a
dispute shall jointly petition the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service
no later than ten (10) working days after the City receives the timely appeal
to Step 4.  The Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service shall submit a panel
of seven (7) arbitrators from which panel an arbitrator shall be selected by
striking names or by mutual agreement of the City and the staff member with a
dispute.  Subsequent panels of arbitrators may be requested where either the
City or the staff member with a dispute determines none of the arbitrators on
the panel is acceptable.  The City or the staff member with a dispute, or both,
shall notify the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service of the name of the
arbitrator selected. 
(Ord. 105-91.  Passed 11-5-91.)
266.03-2  POWERS OF ARBITRATOR AND COSTS OF ARBITRATION.
   The arbitrator shall only have jurisdiction and authority to interpret,
apply and determine compliance with the provisions of this Personnel Policy,
but shall not have jurisdiction or authority to add to, detract from or alter
the terms of this Personnel Policy in any manner nor shall the Arbitrator have
the jurisdiction or authority to assess a penalty or to determine any matter
which might be construed as an interest arbitration.  Inadvertent errors in
application of the provisions of this Personnel Policy by the City shall not be
construed to be an enforceable practice.  The decision of the arbitrator shall
adequately set forth the issue or issues to be decided, the positions of the
parties, specific findings of fact, conclusions of law, and the award.  The
arbitrator's decision and award shall be binding upon the City, the staff
member with a dispute and all other affected staff members unless set aside or
modified by a court of competent jurisdiction.  The arbitrator shall render
his/her award within thirty (30) days of the date of the hearing or within
thirty (30) days of the date briefs are filed, whichever is later.  Each party
shall bear the cost of its own presentation.  The cost of any transcript and
attendance free shall be borne by the party arranging for the court reporter. 
The expense of the arbitrator shall be borne by the City if the City loses the
arbitration or equally by the City and the staff member with a dispute if the
staff member with a dispute loses the arbitration.
   Any agreement reached between the City and the staff member with a dispute
in resolution of a dispute prior to arbitration shall be final and binding upon
the City, the staff member with a dispute and all other affected staff members;
provided, however, that nothing herein shall prohibit the staff member with a
dispute and the City from agreeing that a particular resolution of a dispute
shall not be used as a precedent in any future cases of any kind.
(Ord. 105-91.  Passed 11-5-91.)
266.03-3  TIME LIMITS FOR FILING DISPUTES.
   Disputes concerning discharge of a staff member shall be submitted in
writing at Step 4 of the Dispute Settlement Procedure within three (3) working
days of the date of the discharge or the date the City issues its final
decision following a discharge hearing, whichever is later.  Copies of the
dispute will be provided to the City.  Any other dispute shall be submitted at
Step 1 of the Dispute Settlement Procedure within five (5) working days of the
date the alleged violation occurred.  For purposes of the Dispute Settlement
Procedure, working days shall mean Monday through Friday, excluding holidays
celebrated during that period.
(Ord. 105-91.  Passed 11-5-91.)
266.03-4  DISCIPLINE AND SEPARATION FROM EMPLOYMENT.
   A.   GENERALLY:
      Violation of City rules governing the safety, health and/or conduct of
staff members covered by this Personnel Policy shall be among the causes for
separation from employment or other disciplinary action.  Separation from
employment or other disciplinary action may be subject to the Dispute
Settlement Procedure under this Personnel Policy for staff members below the
level of Executive or Senior Administrative Staff provided the staff member has
completed his/her probation period.
   B.   MAJOR VIOLATION:
      A violation of major City rules governing safety, conduct and/or health
of staff members may be among the causes for involuntary separation from
employment.  Major violations by way of example and not by way of limitation,
may be falsification of any documents required by the City; unauthorized
disclosure of sensitive or confidential information such as tax returns; being
under the influence of and/or the unauthorized possession, sale or purchase of
alcohol or illicit drugs during working hours; physical violence; engaging in
gross insubordination; conviction of a felony; embezzlement of public funds;
theft, pilferage or unauthorized possession of property; engaging in conduct or
encouraging others to engage in conduct in violation of this Personnel Policy,
including but not limited to, the no strike provision; or any offense involving
gross misconduct.
   C.   LESSER VIOLATIONS:
      With respect to non-probationary staff members below the level of
Executive or Senior Administrative Staff level, for violations of lesser City
rules governing safety, conduct and/or health of staff members, progressive
discipline will be used, consistent with the seriousness of the offense and the
work record of the staff member.
   D.   NOTICE OF DISCIPLINARY ACTION:
      Every counselling memo, suspension notice or separation from employment
notice shall be in writing and shall contain at a minimum the date given, the
name of the individual issuing it, the name of the staff member receiving the
warning, the nature of the alleged violation and the date or dates upon which
the alleged violation occurred.  A non-probationary staff member shall receive
a copy within five (5) days of the City's gaining knowledge of the infraction
unless the nature of the infraction requires additional investigation time to
be determined by the City.  The investigation time shall be reasonable.  A copy
shall be retained by the City in the staff member's personnel file.  Executive
or Senior Administrative Staff Members will have a verbal discussion with
Management in cases of discipline short of suspension of employment, although
the file documentation will be similar to the formal method described above.
   E.   CLEARING OF STAFF MEMBER'S RECORD:
      Disciplinary action will expire from a non-probationary staff member's
work record in accordance with the following schedule:
      1.   ORAL COUNSELLING MEMO - one (1) year from the date of the reprimand.
      2.   WRITTEN COUNSELLING MEMO - two (2) years from the date of the
reprimand.
      3.   SUSPENSION COUNSELLING MEMO OF THREE (3) DAYS OR LESS - three (3)
years from the date of the suspension.
      4.   SUSPENSION COUNSELLING MEMO OF FOUR (4) DAYS OR MORE - four (4)
years from the date of the suspension.
   F.   HEARING:
      No staff member will be involuntarily separated from employment or
suspended for more than three (3) days from employment with the City without
first being given the opportunity for a hearing before the Mayor or the Mayor's
designee.  The burden shall be on the City in all involuntary separation cases,
except those where the staff member is considered separated for overstaying a
leave of absence or for being absent for three (3) consecutive work days
without reporting such absence to the City or for failure to report or work
within five (5) working days after receipt of a certified letter notifying the
staff member of a recall to work following a layoff.
   The City and the staff member shall have the right to support of their
respective positions.  All public records pertinent to the proceedings shall be
made available unless disclosure is prohibited by law.  The City shall issue
its final determination to the affected staff member within seven (7) calendar
days following the close of the hearing.  If the employment separation or
suspension is sustained as a result of the hearing, the staff member shall have
three (3) work days following the date of the City's final determination in
which to file a dispute at Step 4 of the dispute settlement procedure.
   G.   VOLUNTARY SEPARATION IN LIEU OF INVOLUNTARY SEPARATION:
      A staff member may resign at any time prior to a final employment
separation decision and his/her personnel file shall show a voluntary
separation from employment.  If a staff member resigns in accordance with this
provision, the staff member shall not thereafter file for unemployment
compensation in a manner which will cause the City liability; and if the staff
member does so, the City will have the right to contend before the OBES that
the staff member was involuntarily separated from employment.
(Ord. 105-91.  Passed 11-5-91.)
266.03-5  PERSONNEL FILES.
   A  staff member may be permitted to review the staff member’s own personnel
file and copy any material found therein at any reasonable time and place
(excluding weekends and holidays).  Should the staff member, upon review of
his/her personnel file come across material of negative or derogatory nature,
the staff member may provide a written and signed comment in rebuttal,
mitigation or explanation of such material, which comment shall remain in the
staff member’s file so long as the negative material remains.  Reviews will be
on the staff member’s own time.  Any material copied from the file will be at
the expense of the staff member.
(Ord. 157-2006.  Passed 8-1-06.)
266.03-6  RIGHTS OF STAFF MEMBERS.
   Staff Members of the Police and Fire Divisions below the Senior
Administrative Staff level and subject to this Personnel Policy shall be
entitled to the following rights as they relate to non-criminal charges against
a staff member for violation of Division policies, rules, and regulations.  A
staff member being investigated for possible criminal charges shall be afforded
the same constitutional rights as are required to be provided to any other
citizen.
   A.   In any disciplinary hearing arising out of an investigation under
266.06-3, the City and the staff member shall have the right to question the
other party's witnesses.  Complaints against a staff member for violation of
division policy and procedure shall be reduced to writing and signed by the
Complainant.
   B.   A staff member who is to be questioned as a suspect in any
investigation of any criminal charge against the staff member shall be advised
of their constitutional rights before any questioning starts.  Any internal
division questioning of the staff member named in the criminal complaint and
any administrative charge against that staff member may be delayed until after
the trial stage of the criminal case at the discretion of the Division Head and
shall be delayed until after the trial stage of the criminal case provided: 
(1)  the staff member involved declines to participate in the administrative
investigation and (2)  the staff member removes himself/herself from duty
without pay. (Ord. 78-97.  Passed 6-3-97.)
   C.   Before a staff member may be charged with any violation of Division
rules and regulations for a refusal to answer questions or participate in an
investigation, the staff member shall be advised that his/her refusal to answer
questions or participate in such investigation may be made a basis for such a
charge.
   D.   Any interrogation, questioning or interview shall be conducted at a
reasonable hour, preferably while the staff member to be interrogated or
interviewed is working.  Such sessions shall be for reasonable periods of time
and time shall be allowed for rest periods and other physical necessities.  No
more than two interrogators at a time will interrogate, question or interview
the staff member.
   E.   The staff member shall be informed of the nature of the investigation
prior to any questioning. 
(Ord. 110-94.  Passed 9-20-94.)
   F.   When an anonymous complaint is made against a staff member, the staff
member shall be apprised of the circumstance.  When a single anonymous
complaint is made against a staff member and there is no corroborative evidence
of any kind the staff member accused shall not be required to submit to
interrogation or make a report.  In the event there is corroborative evidence,
the staff member shall be required to submit to interrogation and/or make a
report or statement.  A confidential complaint shall not be considered as an
anonymous complaint, except in those instances in which the person making the
complaint is unwilling to testify in any subsequent hearing.  Where no
compliant has been received and there is no reason to suspect a violation, City
administrators, command officers, and/or supervisors shall not initiate
solicitation of complaints. 
(Ord. 78-97.  Passed 6-3-97.)
   G.   The City may divulge the fact that a particular staff member is under
investigation, but there shall be no release of any additional information by
the City or the staff member regarding the staff member under investigation
until such investigation is completed and the staff member is either cleared or
charged.
   H.   When a staff member suspected of a violation of Division Policies,
rules or regulations is being interrogated, such interrogation shall be
recorded at the request of the staff member or the City.  The party requesting
the recording shall be responsible for the cost unless both parties desire a
copy, wherein the cost shall be equally shared.  In addition, the party
requesting the recording shall be responsible for providing the appropriate
recording equipment.
   I.   A staff member who has been charged with a violation of any Division
Policy, rule or regulation, shall, upon request, be provided the opportunity to
inspect and obtain copies, at current reproduction cost, of transcripts,
recordings, written statements and any other material relating to the charges
as a condition of its use at a hearing on such charge.  Such requests must be
made not less than twenty-four hours prior to the scheduled hearing; however,
the parties may waive the twenty-four hour provision in the event of
extenuating circumstances.
   J.   Any evidence obtained in the course of an internal investigation
through the use of administrative pressures, threats or promises made to the
staff member shall not be used by the City in any subsequent court action.
   K.   In the course of an internal investigation, a polygraph examination
will be administered consistent with applicable law.  When such a polygraph
examination is conducted, upon the consent of the staff member under
investigation, the result of such examination shall not be used by either party
for any purpose in a subsequent court action.
   L.   When a staff member is to be interviewed in an investigation of any
other staff member of the City employee, such interview shall be conducted in
accordance with the procedure established herein.
   M.   If the rights of the staff member who is under investigation as
provided herein have been violated, the violation shall be subject to the
dispute settlement procedure specified in
266.03-1, but commencing at the third step of such procedure.
(Ord. 110-94.  Passed 9-20-94.)
   N.   Internal investigations with regard to minor violations shall be
completed within forty-five calendar days after the filing of the complaint.
   Major complaint investigations, other than criminal complaints involving
felony violations, shall be completed within one hundred calendar days after
filing of the original complaint unless, upon request of the Safety Director,
an extension of time for such investigation to be completed is granted.  The
staff member must be notified of the Safety Director’s decision upon the
granting of the extension request.
   An additional fifteen calendar days shall be provided beyond the forty-five
or one hundred day limits above in cases where the investigation is not
initiated by internal investigation.
   Criminal complaints involving felony investigations shall be investigated
and completed in accordance with the statute of limitations set out in the Ohio
Revised Code.  Such complaints may be referred for investigation by Bureau of
Criminal Identification and Investigation.
(Ord. 110-2003.  Passed 6-17-03.)
266.04-1  LENGTH OF SERVICE.
   Length of Service or City-wide length of service shall be measured from the
staff member's most recent date of hire with the City.
   Classification length of service shall be measured from the staff member's
most recent date of employment in employee's regularly assigned classification.
(Ord. 105-91.  Passed 11-5-91.)
266.04-2  PROBATIONARY PERIOD.
   All non-fire and non-police division staff members below the Executive or
Senior Administrative Staff level covered by this Personnel Policy shall be
considered probationary staff members during the first six months of their most
recent employment with the City.  The probationary period may be extended an
additional ninety calendar days by the City upon written notice to the staff
member before the end of the initial probationary period.  Extension of the
probationary period shall be subject to the dispute settlement procedure.  Fire
Division and Police Division staff members and staff members of the Executive
or Senior Administrative Staff Level, and the Human Resources Manager shall be
considered probationary staff members for the first year of their most recent
employment with the City with an evaluation being given at or near the end of
the first six months.  During probation, staff members covered by the Personnel
Policy may be separated from employment or disciplined without recourse to the
dispute settlement procedure for any reason and will receive no benefits other
than health insurance benefits except as may be statutorily required.  Upon
successful completion of the probationary period a staff member will receive
length of service credit retroactive to the staff members’ most recent date of
hire.
(Ord.  13-01.  Passed 1-16-01.)
266.04-3  LOSS OF LENGTH OF SERVICE CREDIT.
   Length of Service shall be considered broken and the staff member shall be
considered separated from employment when the staff member is involuntarily
separated from employment, voluntarily separated from employment, overstays an
approved leave of absence or any extension thereof, engages in gainful
employment while on an approved leave of absence without the knowledge and
written approval of the City, is absent for three (3) consecutive work days
without reporting such absence to the City, is laid off for a period of time
equal to the staff member's length of service at the time of the layoff not to
exceed a period of eighteen (18) consecutive months, or fails to report for
work within five (5) working days after receipt of a certified letter notifying
the staff member of a recall to work following a layoff.
(Ord. 105-91.  Passed 11-5-91.)
266.04-4  VACANCIES.
   When the City determines there is a vacancy in a new or existing
classification, the City may temporarily assign a staff member to work in that
classification pending the filling of the vacancy.  The City may post a vacancy
for a period of five (5) calendar days during which period staff members in
lower rated classifications may sign the posting.  The City may choose to have
the Civil Service Commission provide the City with an eligibility list of three
individuals from among those who signed the posting and/or who are external
candidates or the City may fill the vacancy.
   A current City staff member chosen to fill the vacancy will have a trial
period up to a maximum of thirty (30) calendar days.  During the trial period a
current staff member may be disqualified or may disqualify himself/herself.  A
staff member who is disqualified or who self-disqualifies during the trial
period shall return to his/her former classification, if still vacant or be
laid off until a vacancy occurs.  A staff member hired to fill a vacancy shall
be governed by the Probationary Period provisions under
266.04-2 of this Personnel Policy.
(Ord. 105-91.  Passed 11-5-91.)
   Effective December 17, 1991, when any individual is promoted to any staff
position, other than a Senior Administrative staff position, such individual
will be placed at the step level that will give such individual a rate higher
than the rate for the step two steps higher than the individual's current step
in the classification from which the individual is promoted.
   Effective May 1, 2000, when any individual is promoted to a Senior
Administrative Staff Position or a person is newly hired to such position, that
person will be placed at the appropriate step as determined by the City.
   A newly hired staff member will be placed at the appropriate step as
determined by the City.  (Ord. 37-92.  Passed 4-7-92; Ord. 87-2000.  Passed 6-

Executive and Senior Administrative Staff level, all work actually performed in
excess of eight (8) hours in a day or forty (40) in a week will be paid at one
and one-half (1-1/2) times a staff member's normal rate of pay.  Unless
specified, unworked time shall not be considered as hours worked for purposes
of this Personnel Policy, except that paid time off work on holidays, vacation

computing overtime.  Work actually performed on Saturdays or Sundays which are
outside the employee's normal work week, or on holidays which are not normally

time in lieu of pay for overtime hours worked in a calendar year.  The election
shall be in writing and must be made immediately following the end of the work
week in which the overtime is worked.  Each overtime hour worked shall be equal
to one and one-half (1 ½) hours of compensatory time.  No staff member may
accumulate more than eighty (80) hours of compensatory time and when a staff
member is at the maximum accumulation limit for compensatory time; all overtime
worked shall be paid.  So long as it will not unduly disrupt the operations of
the City, a staff member will be permitted to take compensatory time off within
a reasonable time after requesting it.  Compensatory time off may be used in
increments of not less than one (1) hour.  Pay for accrued compensatory time
shall be at the regular rate of the staff member at the time payment is made,
except for cases of termination of employment where pay shall be at the average
regular rate of the staff member during the last three (3) years of employment
or the regular rate of the staff member at the time the payment is made,
whichever is higher.  Employees shall be permitted to cash in up to forty (40)
hours of accumulated compensatory time two (2) times in a calendar year. 
Requests shall be submitted at least two (2) pay periods in advance and shall

266.05-4  TRADING TIME.  (REPEALED)
   (EDITOR’S NOTE:  Former Section
266.05-4 was repealed by Ordinance 161-2006.)
266.06-1  SICKNESS, ACCIDENT, DISABILITY AND PREGNANCY LEAVES.
   Leaves under this section for purposes authorized by the Family and Medical
Leave Act shall be charged against eligibility for leaves under Section
266.06-7, Family and Medical Leaves of Absence, until the same has been
exhausted.
   Leaves of absence for sickness, accident or disability (including pregnancy)
shall be granted in writing when the City is presented with a physician’s
certificate indicating the reason the staff member is unable to work and the
anticipated duration of the leave.  Such leaves of absence shall be for a
minimum of seven calendar days and a maximum of thirty calendar day periods up
to a maximum of one hundred eighty (180) days within a twenty-four month period
or three hundred sixty-five (365) days within a twenty-four month period for a
Workers’ Compensation Disability.  Any request for extension must be
accompanied by a physician’s certificate setting forth the same type of
information as is required by the original leave of absence.
   The City may require a more detailed explanation of a staff member’s
disability or at any time(s) during a leave of absence or any extension thereof
or at the end of a leave of absence, the City may require the staff member to
be examined by the City’s physician to determine whether or not the staff
member is able to work.  If the City’s physician and the staff member’s
physician are unable to agree on whether the staff member is able to work the
City shall choose a third physician who shall forthwith examine the staff
member and whose written decision shall be final and binding upon the City and
the staff member.  The examination by the City physician and third physician
shall be at City expense.  If it is determined by the staff member’s physician
or by the third physician that the staff member is able to work, the staff
member shall report for work for the following day after being notified by the
City to do so.  Failure of the staff member to report for work shall be
considered as overstaying an approved leave of absence.  A staff member on a
leave of absence under this part must exhaust accrued, but unused sick leave
and may then use accrued but unused vacation pay.  When sick leave and vacation
pay are exhausted, the staff member will be on an unpaid leave.  Staff members
eligible for accident compensation benefits under
266.09-3 will not be eligible to use accrued but unused sick leave or vacation
pay.  The City will continue to pay health insurance premiums on behalf of the
employee for the first sixty days of an unpaid leave under this section and/or
Section
266.06-7 is exhausted, whichever is later and thereafter the employee must pay
the full premium rate to the City to maintain health insurance in effect. 
(Ord.  37-2004.  Passed 4-20-04.)
266.06-2  JURY DUTY AND WITNESS LEAVES.
   A staff member called for Jury Duty must notify his/her supervisor the next
workday following such notification.  The City will pay the staff member full
pay while the staff member is on jury duty provided the staff member endorses
any jury duty pay he/she receives over to the City.  The provisions with
respect to jury duty shall apply to a staff member subpoenaed as a witness in
any matter arising out of his/her official capacity with the City.  It is the
intent of
266.06-2 that the City pay the difference between an eligible staff member's
straight time wage rate and what the staff member received as a juror or
witness for work time lost due to jury duty or witness duty during the staff
member's regular work day.
(Ord. 105-91.  Passed 11-5-91.)
266.06-3  BEREAVEMENT LEAVE.
   In case of death of a staff member's child, current spouse, mother, father,
brother or sister, grandmother, grandfather or any other relative residing in
the household of the staff member, the Mayor or the Mayor's designee may upon
request grant a leave of absence from the day of death until and including the
day after the funeral not to exceed three (3) working days.  Full-time staff
members will receive eight (8) hours pay or twenty-four (24) hours pay at the
applicable straight rate for each day of funeral leave.  Less than full-time
staff members will receive the leave time off with seventy-five (75%) percent
of full pay.
   In case of death of a mother-in-law, father-in-law, daughter-in-law, son-in-
law, stepmother, stepfather or grandchild, the staff member will be granted a
leave of absence from the date of death until and including the day after the
funeral not to exceed two (2) working days.  Full-time staff members will
receive eight (8) hours of pay or twenty-four (24) hours pay as applicable at
the applicable straight time rate for each day of funeral leave, provided that
the second day of such leave shall be charged as paid sick leave.  In case of
death of an aunt or uncle the staff member will be granted a one day leave of
absence as described above in this paragraph, and full-time staff members will
receive eight (8) hours of pay or twenty-four hours pay as applicable at the
applicable straight time rate.  Less than full-time staff members will receive
the leave time off with seventy-five (75%) percent of full pay.
   If a holiday occurs while a staff member is on funeral leave, the staff
member will be paid for the funeral leave or the holiday, but not for both.
   In case the funeral or burial is one hundred fifty (150) miles or more from
the City of Perrysburg, a full-time staff member will be entitled to one (1)
additional workday of paid sick leave, if the staff member is scheduled to work
that day.  Less than full-time staff will receive the leave time off with
prorated pay.  (Ord. 78-97.  Passed 6-3-97.)
266.06-4  MILITARY LEAVE.
   A.   A staff member shall be on leave of absence while in military service
for such period of time as the law requires.  Upon discharge the staff member
shall have ninety calendar days to report back to the City to be reassigned in
accordance with the law.  The staff member shall accrue “Length of Service”
credit during a military leave as if the staff member had continued to work for
the City during such military leave.  A staff member on this or any other
unpaid leave of absence shall neither accrue nor be entitled to any other
contractual benefits.  Vacancies created by Military Leave may temporarily be
filled by the City.
   Effective September 18, 1997, a staff member required to go on temporary
active status with the federal or state military service shall be entitled to a
leave of absence without loss of pay for scheduled regular work hours during
such service, not to exceed twenty-two eight-hour days or one hundred seventy-
six work hours within one calendar year.  To qualify for temporary active
status compensation the appropriate orders from the federal or state military
service must be presented to the Mayor or the Mayor’s designee.  Contractual
benefits will continue while a staff member is on annual temporary active
status.
      (1)   While on temporary active status the City will continue to provide
the same health insurance benefits that the staff member was provided under
this personnel policy.
      (2)   While on temporary active status beyond the time period specified
earlier in this section, the City will pay the staff member the difference
between gross military pay and their gross straight time City pay.  A staff
member must first exhaust accrued, but unused vacation and compensatory time
before the pay differential provision will apply.
      
   B.   Employees who are members of the National Disaster Medical Systems
(NDMS) Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) shall be entitled to a
military leave of absence from their duties without loss of pay for such time
as they are in service on field training or active duty.  (Ord. 120-2015. 
Passed 12-15-15.)
266.06-5  PERSONAL LEAVE OF ABSENCE.
   The Mayor or the Mayor’s designee may grant a staff member a leave of
absence without pay for such purposes, periods of time and under such
conditions that the Mayor or the Mayor’s designee may specify.  A staff member
must submit written application to the Mayor or the Mayor’s designee.  Such
leaves will be considered with due regard to the needs of the staff member.
   Leaves granted under this section for purposes authorized by the Family and
Medical Leave Act shall be charged against eligibility for leaves thereunder
until the same has been exhausted consistent with Section
266.06-7.
(Ord. 38-2004.  Passed 4-20-04.)
266.06-6  FATAL FORCE LEAVE.
   When a Police Division staff member has to administer such force as to fall
into the category of Fatal Force, the staff member may request, or the Chief of
Police may require, the staff member to have necessary time off or a
reassignment to an office detail if available, to relieve the stress resulting
from the use of Fatal Force.  Necessary time off or reassignment shall not
initially exceed seven (7) calendar days per incident, unless extended by the
Chief where additional leave is necessary.  To qualify for Fatal Force leave,
the staff member must be evaluated by a qualified practitioner, chosen by the
City, and determined to be in need of such leave; and if a course of treatment
is required, the staff member must agree to undergo same with a practitioner
chosen by the City.  The City will pay the difference in cost between what the
health insurance covers and the staff member's liability for up to five (5) one
hour counselling sessions.  A staff member off work on a Fatal Force leave will
receive his/her regular wages for work missed during the staff member's regular
work day.  Such leave shall not be charged against the staff member's sick
leave credit.
(Ord. 105-91.  Passed 11-5-91.)
266.06-7  FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVES.
   An employee who has been employed by the City for one year or more and who
has worked at least 1250 hours within the previous twelve month period will be
granted a leave of up to twelve weeks in any rolling twelve month period for
birth or adoption of a child or to care for a child, spouse or parent with a
serious medical condition.  Any employee who has a serious medical condition
which prevents the employee from working will be granted the leave without
qualifying year or minimum hour requirements.
   To be eligible for a leave to care for a child, spouse or parent with a
serious health condition, an employee must provide, at the time the leave is
requested, a certificate from a doctor or other health care provider setting
forth the beginning date of the serious health condition for which the leave is
sought, the probable duration of the condition, appropriate medical facts
concerning the condition, a statement of why the employee is needed to care for
the child, spouse or parent with an estimate of the time required.  To be
eligible for a leave because the employee has a serious health condition which
prevents the employee from working, the employee must present, at the time the
leave is requested, a certificate from a doctor or other health care provider
setting forth the same kinds of information as for leaves to care for a family
member, except that instead of a statement concerning the need to care for the
family member, the certificate must state why the employee is unable to perform
the functions of his/her position.  If medically necessary that an intermittent
leave be required, the doctor's or other health care provider's certificate
will also show the dates and duration of the treatment to be given.  The City
has the right to require a second opinion from an examining doctor of its own
choosing; and in the event of conflicting  opinions between the doctor who
issued the certificate and the doctor selected by the City, the City will
select a third examining doctor or other health care provider whose opinion
will be binding upon the employee and the City.  The employee and members of
the employee's family must render timely cooperation with the examining doctor
chosen by the City and with the third examining doctor or other health care
provider.  Examination fees by the City's selected doctor or other health care
provider and any third doctor will be paid by the City.  The City may require
recertification every four weeks.  The City will provide the certification
forms.
   An employee must give thirty days advance notice of a request for leave for
birth or adoption of a child or for planned medical treatment for the serious
illness of a child, spouse or parent.  If such advance notice is not possible
due to unforeseeable circumstances, the employee must give as much notice as
he/she can.  The employee will make every effort to schedule planned medical
treatment so as not to disrupt the City's operations.
   If the employee and the employee's spouse work for the City, both of them
together are entitled to only twelve weeks leave in a twelve month period to
care for a newly arried child or seriously ill parent.  Leave to care for a
newly arrived child must be taken within twelve months of the arrival of the
child.
   Health insurance and life insurance coverage will continue during the leave
under this section, under the same conditions as it would have continued had
the employee been working, including any employee premium contributions.
   At the end of a leave under this section, the employee is entitled to the
same job or one which is equivalent in terms of benefits, pay and other terms
and conditions of employment.
   The provisions of this section are to be construed so as to conform to the
Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 and applicable regulations under that Act.

advance shall mean that the staff member notifies his/her supervisor of that
absence within thirty (30) minutes before the scheduled start of the staff

year of employment with the City (measured from the most recent date of hire). 
A staff member must work 2080 hours during his/her anniversary year to be
eligible for a full paid vacation.  A staff member must work at least 1040
hours, but less than 2080 hours, during his/her anniversary year to be eligible
for a pro-rated paid vacation, based upon a pro-ration formula of actual hours
worked versus 2080 hours.  For purposes of computing hours worked under this
Part and overtime or premium hours counts as one hour worked, paid time off
work on vacation and holidays shall be considered as hours worked, and paid
time off work on either sick leaves or leaves of absence up to a minimum of 120
lost work hours shall be considered as hours worked.
   The Mayor may waive the one-year of employment eligibility requirement for
newly hired Executive, Senior Administrative or Administrative Staff, in which
event the employee may be extended up to fifteen working days of vacation as
determined by the Mayor.  The Mayor, with the concurrence of a majority of
Council, may place as Executive, Senior Administrative or Administrative Staff
employee with prior qualified public service at Step B, C, or D of the vacation

based on year of experience substantially similar to the duties and
responsibilities set forth in the employee’s City position description for
those hired in from the private sector.
   Staff members hired after July 5, 1987, will have prior service with the
City counted for determining the amount of vacation time off and their
anniversary date will be their current Length of Service date.  Staff members
hired before July 5, 1987, will have prior service with the State of Ohio or
its political subdivisions counted for determining the amount of vacation time
and the anniversary date for those staff members will be the staff member’s

of employment, other than for disciplinary reasons, after fifteen years of
service with the City of Perrysburg, an employee will be paid for accumulated,
unused sick pay as follows:

      (2)   An employee will be paid for one-fourth (1/4) the first 1000 hours
of sick  pay accrued and unused or on after September 14, 1976, one-half of the
next 1250 hours of accrued and unused sick pay minus any hours of sick pay

hours.

regular base pay for up to one (1) year.  Accident compensation will be
available for Workers’ Compensation leaves under Section
266.06-7 of this Personnel Policy.  (Ord. 98-2003.  Passed 6-17-03.)
   (B)   To be qualified for accident compensation or continued accident
compensation, the City may require the same types of proof of continuing
disability as are required for sickness, accident or disability leave under

 266.09-7, whichever is applicable.
(Ord. 159-93.  Passed 11-16-93.)
   (C)   The City may, at its option, require the staff member to be assigned
other duties during the period he/she is disabled, provided he/she is capable

of the disability and the employee shall receive his her regular rate of pay
during the temporary assignment.

Service Rulings 77-462 and 81-36, although they shall continue to be designated
as staff member contributions as permitted by Attorney General Opinion 82-097,
in order that the amount of the staff member's income reported by the Board as
subject to federal and Ohio income tax shall be the staff member's total gross
income reduced by their current percentage amount of the staff member's
mandatory retirement system contribution which has been designated as "picked
up" by the City, and that the amount designated as "picked up" by the City
shall be included in computing final average salary, provided that no staff
member's total salary is increased by such "pick up", nor is the City's total
contribution to the applicable retirement system increased thereby.  The above
language shall be applicable to the Police Relief and Pension Fund and the Ohio
Fire Relief and Pension Fund and to the Ohio Public Employee Retirement System.

with paragraph E.  Any sample which has been adulterated or is shown to be a
substance other than urine shall be reported as such.  All samples which test
positive on a screening test shall be confirmed by gas chromatography-mass
spectrophotometry, and no records or unconfirmed positive tests shall be
released or retained by the laboratory.  Testing shall be conducted in a manner

in paragraph C. and provides a copy of their findings directly to the City. 
They must sign an authorization to release such findings prior to the sample
being delivered to the lab.
   F.   A staff member found to be under the influence through positive testing
will be offered rehabilitation. If the staff member refuses such offer of

capacity of the persons examined to discharge the duties of the position to
which appointment is sought.  Such examinations may include an evaluation of
such factors as education, training, knowledge, manual dexterity, and physical
and psychological fitness.  Examinations shall consist of one or more tests in
any combination.  Tests may be written, oral, physical, demonstration of skill,
or an evaluation of training and experiences and shall be designed to fairly
test the relative capacity of the examinees to discharge the particular duties
of the position for which the appointment is sought.  All examinations shall be
validated so as to conform to applicable law or regulation.
   (b)   Type of Examinations.  The Commission shall determine and state in the
announcement of each examination whether it will be competitive or non-
competitive, assembled or unassembled, open or promotional.
      (1)   Competitive examinations are those given for the purpose of
determining the relative rank of examinees and establishing an eligibility list
in the order of the marks allowed to each candidate.
      (2)   Non-competitive examinations are those given for appointments to
positions requiring peculiar and exceptional qualifications of a scientific,
professional, educational, or managerial character in which the eligible list
consists of all examinees who are successful in the examination without regard
to marks received.

or a number of examination centers.

examination the parts or subjects into which it shall be divided and the weight
to be assigned to each part.  No oral practical examination shall be held
except in the presence of the chief examiner or such assistant examiner
designated by him or the Commission.  The Secretary of the Commission will
assist the Commission in determining questions which may be asked and will also
assist with special circumstances which may require modification of the
examination to conform with the requirements of applicable law.  Veterans
receiving a passing grade of seventy percent (70%) on each individual test
shall have five percent (5%) added to their final score.
(Ord. 72-2004.  Passed 6-15-04.)
270.05  PROMOTIONS.
   (a)   Definition.  The term “promotion” shall be used to designate an
advancement from one classification to a higher classification.
   (b)   Commission to Determine Previous Experience.    The Commission shall,
in each case, determine that persons are eligible to compete for promotion by
reason of direct experience in work which would be a natural preparation for
the higher position.
   (c)   Basic Requirements.  No person shall be eligible for examination for
promotion who lacks any of the preliminary requirements prescribed by statute,
rule, or regulation for the position to be filled.
   (d)   Types of Examination.  Examination for promotion shall consist of
ratings for seniority and may additionally consist of written or practical
tests, education, past performance, documented performance concerns,
attendance, experience and oral interviews.  Prior to any examination of any
type being given for promotion purposes, the Commission shall determine both
the type or types of examinations to be given and the weight to be assigned to
each type of examination.  The types of examination and the weight to be
assigned to each such type shall be disclosed on the notice of promotional
examination.
   Notice of promotional examinations will be made in accordance with
applicable Collective Bargaining Agreements, and where applicable, Chapter
266 of the Perrysburg Municipal Code.
   (e)   Credit for Seniority.  The credit for seniority shall be determined as
follows:
      (1)   Each full year of the first four years of service with this
Municipality, one (1) percentage point;
      (2)   Each full year of the next ten (10) years of service with this
Municipality, six tenths (0.6) percentage points.
   (f)   Final Grade.  The final grade of a person in a promotional examination
shall be determined as follows:
The grade of the various examinations shall be added to the number of
percentage points as determined above for seniority credit. A minimum grade of
seventy percent (70%) must be achieved on each of the examinations.  The sum
thus secured constitutes the final or complete grade of the person.  In the
cases where the examination consists of more than one part, each part shall be
assigned a relative weight, expressed as decimal, and to the sum of products
thus attained shall be added the seniority credit percentage point.
   (g)   Time of Promotion.  When an examination for promotion has been
completed, the Civil Service Commission shall certify to the appointing
authority the three candidates for such promotion having the highest ranking
on, and who have passed, such examination.  The appointing authority shall then
select one of such candidates for promotion.
(Ord. 33-2008.  Passed 3-4-08.)
   (h)   Emergency Action.  In the case where legislation makes necessary the
restoration of a large number of names to an eligibility list at once, the
Commission may make such provision for the placing of such persons on the
eligibility list as it may deem just and equitable to all concerned, which
provision shall be recorded in the minutes.
(Ord. 73-2004.  Passed 6-15-04.)

408.991 COMMITTING AN OFFENSE WHILE DISTRACTED PENALTY.
   (a)   As used in this section and each section of the Traffic Code where
specified, all of the following apply:
      (1)   “Distracted” means doing either of the following while operating a
vehicle:
         A.   Using a handheld electronic wireless communications device, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4511.204 except when utilizing any of the following:
            1.   The device’s speakerphone function;
            2.   A wireless technology standard for exchanging data over short

            3.   A “voice-operated or hands-free” device that allows the person
to use the electronic wireless communications device without the use of either
hand except to activate, deactivate, or initiate a feature or function;
            4.   Any device that is physically or electronically integrated
into the motor vehicle.
         B.   Engaging in any activity that is not necessary to the operation
of a vehicle and impairs, or reasonably would be expected to impair, the
ability of the operator to drive the vehicle safely.
      (2)   “Distracted” does not include operating a motor vehicle while
wearing an earphone or earplug over or in both ears at the same time.  A person
who so wears earphones or earplugs may be charged with a violation of Section
432.40.
      (3)   “Distracted” does not include conducting any activity while
operating a utility service vehicle or a vehicle for or on behalf of a utility,
provided that the driver of the vehicle is acting in response to an emergency,
power outage or a circumstance affecting the health or safety of individuals.
As used in subsection (a)(3) of this section:
         A.   “Utility” means an entity specified in division (A), (C), (D),
(E) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 4905.03.
         B.   “Utility service vehicle” means a vehicle owned or operated by a

and, notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 2929.28, is subject to an additional fine of not
more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) as follows:
      (1)   Subject to Traffic Rule 13, if a law enforcement officer issues an
offender a ticket, citation or summons for a violation of any section of the
Traffic Code that indicates that the offender was distracted while committing
the violation and that the distracting activity was a contributing factor to
the commission of the violation, the offender may enter a written plea of
guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), the
offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety course, the
duration and contents of which shall be established by the Ohio Director of
Public Safety.  If the offender attends and successfully completes the course,
the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender successfully
completed the course.  The offender shall be required to pay the total amount
of the fine established for the violation, but shall not be required to pay the
additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender
submits to the court both the offender’s payment in full and such written
evidence.
      (2)   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket, citation
or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is convicted of the
violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may
impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may impose the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the violation
and an additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the
court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section.  If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course.  The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence.

414.01  OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer. 
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person.  Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place. 
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.  If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree.  If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.
   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the distracting
activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense, the
offender is subject to the additional fine established under Section
408.991 of the Traffic Code.
(ORC 4511.12)
414.02  THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section.  Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations.  When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction.  Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of
that proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing
or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways.  For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway
or portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical
terminus of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at
which vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or
yield to traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence
districts the Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway,
or portion thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected
residence district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. 
Where two or more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b)
intersect and no traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield
signs shall be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department
of Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop.  Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the
operator of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.  (ORC
4511.65)
414.03  TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device.  Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.

vehicle-related the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn and
analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may be
admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation.  The three-hour time limit
specified in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not
extend or affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as
the maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test
or tests as described in that section.
   The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of

combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma.  This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens.  A person
authorized to withdraw blood under this subsection may refuse to withdraw blood
under this subsection, if in that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the
person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under subsection (e)(1)B.  hereof shall be
analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.  This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
         If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. 
hereof, the person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a
qualified technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing
administer a chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to
any administered at the request of a law enforcement officer.  If the person
was under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own
expense.  If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)
(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as
required under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an
independent test performed at the person’s expense.  The failure or inability
to obtain an additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the
admission of evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the
request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section.  (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports. 
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)

      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the  defendant or
the defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the
report.  The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the
interest of justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood.  Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified

         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days.  As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours.  The court may sentence an offender
to both an intervention program and a jail term.  The court may impose a jail
term in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program. 
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. 
The court may require the offender, as a condition of community control and in
addition to the required attendance at a drivers’ intervention program, to
attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or education programs that
comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by
the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services that the operators of the
drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender should attend and to
report periodically to the court on the offender’s progress in the programs. 
The court also may impose on the offender any other conditions of community
control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.

drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38. 
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours.  If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days. 
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education  programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs.  The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).

this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree.  The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days.  The court shall impose the ten-day mandatory jail term under
this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring.  The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term.  The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall
not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider.  The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted.  Upon the request of the
court, the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the
court, including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related
to alcohol use.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days.  The

unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead imposes
a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term and a term of
house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or
with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring.  The court
may impose a jail term in addition to the twenty-day mandatory jail term.  The
cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic

noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a

Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is

or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor.  If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously was convicted of or pleaded guilty to three or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal

person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.

route within the Municipality, except pursuant to special written permit issued
by the Ohio Director of Transportation. Every such permit shall be carried in
the vehicle or combination of vehicles to which it refers and shall be open to
inspection by any police officer.
   No holder of a permit issued by the Ohio Director of Transportation shall be
required to obtain any local permit or license or pay any local fee or charge
for movement on any State route within the Municipality. However, no person
shall operate any such vehicle or combination of vehicles upon any roadway
within the Municipality which is not a State route, except as may be otherwise
provided in any local ordinance or regulation or elsewhere in this Traffic
Code.

limits.
   (c)    Local Permit and Conditions. Upon application and for good cause, the
Director of Public Service-Safety may issue a local permit authorizing an
applicant to move an oversize or overweight vehicle or combination of vehicles
upon local streets and highways.
No permittee shall be required to obtain a special permit from the Ohio
Director of Transportation for the movement of the vehicle or combination of
vehicles on streets or highways under local jurisdiction. However, the approval
of the Ohio Director of Transportation shall be required for movement upon
State routes as provided in subsection (a) hereof.
   The Director may grant a permit for a single or round trip, or for such
period of time, not to exceed one year, as the Director in his discretion deems
advisable, or for the duration of any construction project. The Director may
limit or prescribe terms or conditions of operation for such vehicle or
combination of vehicles by designating the route, hours, speed or such other
restrictions as may be necessary for the preservation of the public peace,
property, health and safety. The Director may require the posting of bond or
other security necessary to compensate for any damage to a roadway or road
structure.
   For each such permit, the Director shall charge five dollars ($5.00), and
for each hour of time or any part thereof spent by the Police Division in
supervising the movement of such vehicle, the applicant shall pay the sum of
ten dollars ($10.00).
   Except as provided in subsections (a) and (b) hereof, streets and highways
shall be posted with signs indicating "no thru trucks - gross weight 5 tons" or
words of similar import to apprise drivers of the limitations imposed by this
section. No driver shall disobey the instructions indicated on any such sign.

to a weighing of it by means of a compact, self-contained, portable, sealed
scale specially adapted to determine the wheel loads of vehicles on highways; a
sealed scale permanently installed in a fixed location, having a load-
receiving element specially adapted to determining the wheel loads of highway
vehicles; a sealed scale permanently installed in a fixed location, having a
load-receiving element specially adapted to determining the combined load of
all wheels on a single axle or on successive axles of a highway vehicle; or a
sealed scale adapted to weighing highway vehicles, loaded or unloaded.
   The driver of such vehicle shall, if necessary, be directed to proceed to
the nearest available of such sealed scales to accomplish the weighing,
provided such scales are within three miles of the point where such vehicle is
stopped. Any vehicle stopped in accordance with this section may be held by the
police officer for a reasonable time only to accomplish the weighing as
prescribed by this section. All scales used in determining the lawful weight of
a vehicle and its load shall be annually compared by a municipal, county or
State sealer with the State standards or standards approved by the State, and
such scales shall not be sealed if they do not conform to the State standards
or standards approved by the State.
   At each end of a permanently installed scale, there shall be a straight
approach in the same plane as the platform, of sufficient length and width to
insure the level positioning of vehicles during weight determinations. Methods,
procedures and standards for determining weight using compact, self-contained
portable sealed scales shall be as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.33.
   Whenever such officer, upon weighing a vehicle and load, determines that the
weight is unlawful, he may require the driver to stop the vehicle in a suitable
place and remain standing until such portion of the load is removed as is
necessary to reduce the weight of such vehicle to the limit permitted under
Ohio R.C. 5577.01 to 5577.14, inclusive, and this chapter.

      (5)    Having a fair market value of two hundred dollars ($200.00) or
less.
   (b)    The Police Chief shall order any abandoned junk motor vehicle to be
photographed by a law enforcement officer. The officer shall record the make of
motor vehicle, the serial number when available and shall also detail the
damage or missing equipment to substantiate the value of two hundred dollars
($200.00) or less. The Chief of Police shall thereupon immediately dispose of
the abandoned junk motor vehicle to a junk yard or scrap metal processing
facility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4737.05, or to any other facility owned by or
under contract with the City for the disposal of such motor vehicles. A copy of
the records and photographs relating to the abandoned junk motor vehicle shall
be retained by the Police Division for a period of at least two years and the
Police Division shall execute an affidavit that all requirements of this
section have been complied with and file the same with the Clerk of Courts of
Wood County. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the Clerk of Courts shall,
without charge, issue a certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and
encumbrances, to the Chief of Police. Any moneys arising from the disposal of
the abandoned junk motor vehicle shall be deposited in the Municipal General
Fund.
   (c)    Notwithstanding Section
448.05, any motor vehicle meeting the requirements of subparagraphs (a)(3), (4)
and (6) hereof which has remained unclaimed by the owner or lienholder for a
period of ten days or longer following notification as provided in Section
448.05 may be disposed of as provided in this section.
448.02  LEAVING ABANDONED JUNK MOTOR VEHICLES ON PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PROPERTY.
   (a)    No person shall willfully leave an abandoned junk motor vehicle, as
defined in Section
448.01, on private property for more than seventy-two hours without the
permission of the person having the right to the possession of the property, or
on a public street or other property open to the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the right of way of any road or
highway, for forty-eight hours or longer, without notification to the Police
Chief of the reasons for leaving the motor vehicle in such place.
   (b)    For purposes of this section, the fact that a motor vehicle has been
so left without permission or notification is prima-facie evidence of
abandonment. (ORC 4513.64)
   (c)    Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and
shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the City in disposing of such
abandoned junk motor vehicle, less any moneys accruing to the City from such
disposal. Punishment shall be as provided in Section
408.01. (ORC 4513.99(D); Ord. 53-74. Passed 7-23-74.)
448.03  STORAGE OF JUNK VEHICLES.
   (a)    As used in this section "junk motor vehicle" means any motor vehicle
meeting the requirements of subparagraphs (a)(2), (3), (4) and (6) of Section
448.01 that is left uncovered in the open on private property for more than
seventy-two hours with the permission of the person having the right to the
possession of the property, except if the person is operating a junk yard or
scrap metal processing facility licensed under authority of Ohio R.C. 4737.05
to 4737.12; or regulated under the authority of the Municipality; or if the
property on which the motor vehicle is left is not subject to licensure or
regulation by any governmental authority, unless the person having the right to
the possession of the property can establish that the motor vehicle is part of
a bona fide commercial operation; or if the motor vehicle is a collector's
vehicle, as defined in Ohio R.C. 4501.01(F).
   (b)    No person shall be prevented from storing or keeping, or restricted
in the method of storing or keeping, any collector's vehicle on private
property with the permission of the person having the right to the possession
of the property, except that a person having such permission may be required to
conceal, by means of buildings, fences, vegetation, terrain or other suitable
obstruction, any unlicensed collector's vehicle stored in the open.
   (c)    The Chief of Police may send notice, by certified mail with return
receipt requested, to the person having the right to the possession of the
property on which a junk motor vehicle is left, that within ten days of receipt
of the notice, the junk motor vehicle either shall be covered by being housed
in a garage or other suitable structure or shall be removed from the property.
   (d)    No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in the
open for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this
section. The fact that a junk motor vehicle is so left is prima-facie evidence
of willful failure to comply with the notice, and each subsequent period of
thirty days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a
separate offense. (ORC 4513.65)
   (e)    Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor on a
first offense; on a second offense such person is guilty of a misdemeanor of
the fourth degree; on each subsequent offense such person is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree. Punishment shall be as provided in Section
408.01.

   (b)   If the owner or operator of a motor vehicle that has been ordered into
storage pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section arrives after the motor
vehicle has been prepared for removal, but prior to its actual removal from the
property, the towing service shall give the owner or operator oral or written
notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle under subsection (d)(1) of this section in order to obtain release of
the motor vehicle.  Upon payment of that fee, the towing service shall give the
vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator.  Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private
agricultural property without the permission of the person having the right to
possession of the property, or is not at the garage or place of storage without
the permission of the owner, whichever is applicable.
   (c)   (1)   The Chief of Police shall maintain a record of motor vehicles

section.  The record shall include an entry for each such motor vehicle that
identifies the motor vehicle’s license number, make, model and color, the
location from which it was removed, the date and time of the removal, the
telephone number of the person from whom it may be recovered, and the address
of the place to which it has been taken and from which it may be recovered. 
The Chief of Police shall provide any information in the record that pertains

to a telephone call, identifies self as the owner or operator of the motor
vehicle and requests information pertaining to its location.
      (2)   Any person who registers a complaint that is the basis of the
Police Chief’s order for the removal and storage of a motor vehicle under
subsection (a)(1) of this section shall provide the identity of the law
enforcement agency with which the complaint was registered to any person who
identifies self as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests
information pertaining to its location.
   (d)   (1)   The owner or lienholder of a motor vehicle that is ordered into
storage pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section may reclaim it upon both
of the following:
         A.   Payment of the following fees:
            1.   Not more than ninety dollars ($90.00) for the removal of the
motor vehicle.  However, if the motor vehicle has a manufacturer’s gross
vehicle weight rating in excess of ten thousand pounds, and is a truck, bus or
a combination of a commercial tractor and trailer or semitrailer, not more than
one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) for the removal.
            2.   Not more than twelve dollars ($12.00) per twenty-four hour

subsection (d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is
ordered into storage under subsection (a)(1) of this section may retrieve any
personal items from the motor vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and
without paying any fee.  However, the owner may not retrieve any personal item
that has been determined by the Chief of Police, as applicable, to be necessary
to a criminal investigation.  For purposes of subsection (d)(2) of this
section, “personal items” do not include any items that are attached to the
motor vehicle.
      (3)   If a motor vehicle that is ordered into storage pursuant to
subsection (a)(1) of this section remains unclaimed by the owner for thirty
days, the procedures established by Ohio R.C. 4513.61 and 4513.62 apply.
   (e)   (1)   No person shall remove, or cause the removal of, any motor
vehicle from any private residential or private agricultural property other
than in accordance with subsection (a)(1) of this section or Ohio R.C. 4513.61
to 4513.65.
      (2)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with the
requirements of this section.
   (f)   This section does not apply to any private residential or private
agricultural property that is established as a private tow-away zone in

448.05  IMPOUNDING OF VEHICLES LEFT ON PUBLIC PROPERTY;     RECLAMATION;
DISPOSAL OF VEHICLE.
   The Chief of Police, within his territorial jurisdiction, may order into
storage any motor vehicle, other than an abandoned junk motor vehicle, as

vehicle in such place. The Chief of Police shall designate the place of storage
of any motor vehicle ordered removed by him.
   The Chief of Police shall immediately cause a search to be made of the
records of the Bureau of Motor Vehicles to ascertain the owner and any
lienholder of a motor vehicle ordered into storage by the Chief of Police and,
if known, shall send notice to the owner or lienholder at his last known
address by certified mail with return receipt requested, that the motor vehicle
will be declared a nuisance and disposed of if not claimed within ten days of
the date of mailing of the notice. The owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle
may reclaim it upon payment of any expenses or charges incurred in its removal
and storage, and presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by
a certificate of title to the motor vehicle.
   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within ten
days of the date of mailing of the notice, and if the vehicle is to be disposed
of at public auction as provided in Section
448.06, the Chief of Police shall file with the Clerk of Courts of the county
in which the place of storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with
the requirements of this section. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the Clerk
of Courts shall, without charge, issue a certificate of title, free and clear

the junk yard or other facility. Upon presentation of a copy of the affidavit
by the owner of the junk yard or other facility, the Clerk of Courts shall
issue to such owner a certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and
encumbrances.
   Whenever the owner of a junk yard or other facility receives an affidavit
for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, such owner
shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title to the motor
vehicle in his own name if, within ten days of the receipt of the affidavit,
the vehicle is dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are
delivered to the Clerk of Courts. (ORC 4513.61; Ord. 53-74. Passed 7-23-74.)

   (b)   Except as provided in subsection (d) of this section, a bicycle
operator or electric bicycle operator who violates any section of this Traffic
Code described in subsection (a) of this section that is applicable to bicycles
or electric bicycles may be issued a ticket, citation or summons by a law
enforcement officer for the violation in the same manner as the operator of a
motor vehicle would be cited for the same violation.  A person who commits any
such violation while operating a bicycle or electric bicycle shall not have any
points assessed against the person’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s

this section by a bicycle operator, electric bicycle operator, or motor vehicle
operator when the trier of fact finds that the violation by the motor vehicle
operator endangered the lives of bicycle riders or electric bicycle riders at
the time of the violation, the court, notwithstanding any provision of this
Traffic Code to the contrary, may require the bicycle operator, electric
bicycle operator or motor vehicle operator to take and successfully complete a
bicycling skills course approved by the court in addition to or in lieu of any
penalty otherwise prescribed by the Traffic Code for that violation.

against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature.  A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. 
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature.  A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature.  A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element.  When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element.  When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element. 
(ORC 2901.22)

other ordinance or resolution, rule or regulation of the Municipality.

under an existing or former law of this State, another state, or the United
States or under an existing or former municipal ordinance.
   (d)   Any provision of the Codified Ordinances that refers to a section, or

former law of this State, another state, or the United States, to an existing
or former municipal ordinance, or to an existing or former division of any such
existing or former law or ordinance that defines or specifies, or that defined
or specified, a substantially equivalent offense.  (ORC 2901.04)

barred unless it is commenced within the following periods after an offense is
committed:
      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has

fraud or breach of a fiduciary duty, within one year after discovery of the
offense either by an aggrieved person, or by his legal representative who is
not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a  public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or

offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
606.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs.  In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first.  A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same.  A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution.  Proof that the accused absented himself

against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect

disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin
to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred.  (ORC 2901.13)

606.07  REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense.  Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense.  Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
606.02.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug. 
         (ORC 2901.21)
606.08  ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission.  This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity.  "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.  (ORC 2901.23)
606.09  PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)    An officer, agent or employee of an organization may be prosecuted
for an offense committed by such organization if he acts with the kind of
culpability required for the commission of the offense and any of the following
applies:
      (1)    In the name of the organization or in its behalf he engages in
conduct constituting the offense or causes another to engage in such conduct or
tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf.  (ORC
2901.24)
606.10  FALSIFICATION.
   (a)   No person shall knowingly make a false statement, or knowingly swear
or affirm the truth of a false statement previously made, when any of the
following applies:
      (1)   The statement is made in any official proceeding.
      (2)   The statement is made with purpose to incriminate another.
      (3)   The statement is made with purpose to mislead a public official in
performing the public official’s official function.
      (4)   The statement is made with purpose to secure the payment of
unemployment compensation; Ohio works first; prevention, retention and

governmental agency of a license, permit, authorization, certificate,
registration, release or provider agreement.
      (6)   The statement is sworn or affirmed before a notary public or
another person empowered to administer oaths.
      (7)   The statement is in writing on or in connection with a report or
return that is required or authorized by law.
      (8)   The statement is in writing, and is made with purpose to induce
another to extend credit to or employ the offender, or to confer any degree,
diploma, certificate of attainment, award of excellence or honor on the
offender, or to extend to or bestow upon the offender any other valuable
benefit or distinction, when the person to whom the statement is directed
relies upon it to that person’s detriment.
      (9)   The statement is made with purpose to commit or facilitate the
commission of a theft offense.

petition, complaint or other pleading, or an inventory, account or report.
      (11)   The statement is made on an account, form, record, stamp, label or
other writing that is required by law.
      (12)   The statement is made in a document or instrument of writing that
purports to be a judgment, lien, or claim of indebtedness and is filed or
recorded with the Secretary of State, a county recorder, or the clerk of a
court of record.
      (13)   The statement is required under Ohio R.C. 5743.71 in connection
with the person’s purchase of cigarettes or tobacco products in a delivery
sale.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under subsection (a)(6) hereof that the
oath or affirmation was administered or taken in an irregular manner.
   (c)   If contradictory statements relating to the same fact are made by the
offender within the period of the statute of limitations for falsification, it
is not necessary for the prosecution to prove which statement was false, but
only that one or the other was false.
   (d)   (1)   Whoever violates any provision of subsection (a)(1) to (8) or
(10) to (13) hereof is guilty of falsification, a misdemeanor of the first
degree.
      (2)    Whoever violates subsection (a)(9) hereof is guilty of
falsification in a theft offense, a misdemeanor of the first degree.  If the
value of the property or services stolen is one thousand dollars ($1,000) or
more, falsification in a theft offense is a felony and shall be prosecuted
under appropriate State law. 
   (e)   A person who violates this section is liable in a civil action to any
person harmed by the violation for injury, death, or loss to person or property
incurred as a result of the commission of the offense and for reasonable
attorney’s fees, court costs, and other expenses incurred as a result of
prosecuting the civil action commenced under this section.  A civil action
under this section is not the exclusive remedy of a person who incurs injury,
death, or loss to person or property as a result of a violation of this
section.

under subsection (b) hereof, such abandonment or agreement in no way binds the
Municipality to abandoning the prosecution.
   (d)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of compounding a crime, a
misdemeanor of the first degree.  Punishment shall be as provided in Section
698.02.
(ORC 2921.21)

knowing that a felony has been or is being committed, shall knowingly fail to
report such information to law enforcement authorities.
      (2)   No person, knowing that a violation of division (B) of Ohio R.C.
2913.04 has been, or is being committed or that the person has received
information derived from such a violation, shall knowingly fail to report the

   (b)   Except for conditions that are within the scope of subsection (e) of

persons that the person knows or has reasonable cause to believe resulted from
an offense of violence.
   (c)   No person who discovers the body or acquires the first knowledge of
the death of a person shall fail to report the death immediately to a physician
or advanced practice registered nurse whom the person knows to be treating the
deceased for a condition from which death at such time would not be unexpected,
or to a law enforcement officer, an ambulance service, an emergency squad, or
the coroner in a political subdivision in which the body is discovered, the
death is believed to have occurred, or knowledge concerning the death is
obtained.  For purposes of this subsection (c), “advanced practice registered
nurse” does not include a certified registered nurse anesthetist.
   (d)   No person shall fail to provide upon request of the person to whom a
report required by subsection (c) of this section was made, or to any law
enforcement officer who has reasonable cause to assert the authority to
investigate the circumstances surrounding the death, any facts within the

inflicted in a violent, malicious, or criminal manner, shall fail to report the
burn injury immediately to the local arson, or fire and explosion
investigation, bureau, if there is a bureau of this type in the jurisdiction in
which the person is attended or treated, or otherwise to local law enforcement

      (5)   Anyone participating in the making of reports under subsection (e)
of this section or anyone participating in a judicial proceeding resulting from
the reports is immune from any civil or criminal liability that otherwise might
be incurred or imposed as a result of such actions.  Notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 
4731.22, the physician-patient relationship or advanced practice registered

person’s burn injury or the cause of the burn injury in any judicial proceeding
resulting from a report submitted under subsection (e) of this section.

R.C. 3113.31, shall note that knowledge or belief and the basis for it in the
patient’s or client’s records.

relay service call.
      (2)   The information would tend to incriminate a member of the actor’s
immediate family.

source, privileged under Ohio R.C. 2739.04 or 2739.12.

program of treatment or services for drug dependent persons or persons in
danger of drug dependence, which program is maintained or conducted by a
hospital, clinic, person, agency, or community addiction services provider

violations of Ohio R.C. 2907.02 or 2907.05 or to victims of felonious sexual
penetration in violation of former Ohio R.C. 2907.12.  As used in this
subsection, “counseling services” include services provided in an informal
setting by a person who, by education or experience, is competent to provide
those services.
   (h)   No disclosure of information pursuant to this section gives rise to
any liability or recrimination for a breach of privilege or confidence.

sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,

abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was

R.C. 2923.01 (Conspiracy);
      (4)    Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.

whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)    No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
606.21.
   (d)    If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of, or an attempt to commit, an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense, or an offense, the court, when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
or her complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or
claimed complicity of a witness may affect his or her credibility and make his
or her testimony subject to grave suspicion and require that it be weighed with
great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)    It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.

commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were
the principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section or in terms of the principal offense.

hereof, may commence a civil action for injury or damages, including mental and
physical pain and suffering, that result from the hazing. The action may be
brought against any participants in the hazing, any organization whose local or
national directors, trustees or officers authorized, requested, commanded or
tolerated the hazing, and any local or national director, trustee or officer of
the organization who authorized, requested, commanded or tolerated the hazing.

school, university, college or any other educational institution, an action may
also be brought against any administrator, employee or faculty member of the
school, university, college or other educational institution who knew or
reasonably should have known of the hazing and who did not make reasonable
attempts to prevent it and against the school, university, college or other

repealed by Sub. Sen. Bill 183, effective September 26, 1984.  See Section
642.01(a), (q) and 642.02.)
642.24  DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
642.02 or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
642.02,
642.04 or
642.05
642.15(b)(1) or (2), or Section
642.19 or
642.32 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense.  When a series of offenses under Section
642.02, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
642.02 or
 642.19 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense.  The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
642.02 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
642.02,
642.04 or
642.05, Section
642.15(b)(1) or (2), or Section
642.19 or
 642.32, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim,
involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a
scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single
offense.  If the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or
complicity in violations of Section
642.02 or
642.19, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)    In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series. 
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section.  While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services.  As used in this section, "fair
market value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting ina
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.

642.25  DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
642.09.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
642.24(c)(3).
   (c)   Prima-facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Section
642.24(d), may be used to establish the value of property pursuant to this
section.

   (a)   No person shall possess or have under the person’s control any
substance, device, instrument, or article, with purpose to use it criminally.
   (b)   Each of the following constitutes prima-facie evidence of criminal
purpose:

or parts for making dangerous ordnance, in the absence of circumstances
indicating the dangerous ordnance, materials, or parts are intended for
legitimate use;
      (2)   Possession or control of any substance, device, instrument, or
article designed or specially adapted for criminal use;

   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of possessing criminal tools,
a misdemeanor of the first degree.  Punishment shall be as provided in Section
698.02.  If the circumstances indicate that the substance, device, instrument,
or article involved in the offense was intended for use in the commission of a
felony, possessing criminal tools is a felony and shall be prosecuted under
appropriate State law.

   (b)    Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.
Punishment shall be as provided in Section
698.02. (ORC 1547.99(C))
670.05  OPERATING REGULATIONS.
   (a)    The following rules for preventing collisions shall be followed in
the navigation of all public and private watercraft operating upon the waters
in this City:
      (1)    Every watercraft which is underway propelled by sail alone shall
be considered a sailboat. Every watercraft which is underway propelled by sail
and machinery shall be considered a powercraft. Every watercraft shall be
considered underway when it is not at anchor or made fast to the shore or
aground. In addition to any other situation, "risk of collision" shall be
determined to exist whenever the compass bearing of the approaching watercraft
remains substantially the same.
      (2)    When two sailboats are approaching one another so as to involve
the risk of collision, one of them shall keep out of the way of the other as
follows, namely:
         A.    When one sailboat has the wind on the port side and the other
has the wind on the starboard side, the sailboat with the wind on the port side
shall keep out of the way of the sailboat with the wind on the starboard side.
         B.    When both sailboats have the wind on the same side, the sailboat
which is to be windward shall keep out of the way of the sailboat which is to
the leeward.
         C.    When a sailboat with the wind on the port side sees a sailboat
to windward and cannot determine with certainty whether the other sailboat has
the wind on the port or the starboard side, it shall keep out of the way of the
other sailboat.
      (3)    When two powercraft are meeting on reciprocal or nearly reciprocal
courses, so as to involve the risk of collision, each shall alter its course to
starboard, so that each shall pass on the port side of the other.
      (4)    When two powercraft are crossing at right angles or obliquely so
as to involve the risk of collision, the powercraft which has the other on its
own starboard side shall keep out of the way and shall, if possible, avoid
crossing ahead of the other.
      (5)    When a powercraft and a sailboat are proceeding in such directions
as to involve the risk of collision, the powercraft shall yield the right of
way to the sailboat, except when the sailboat is overtaking the powercraft.
      (6)    Every watercraft which is directed by these rules to yield the
right of way to another watercraft shall, on approaching such other watercraft,
if necessary, slacken its speed, stop, reverse or alter course. Where, by any
of the rules prescribed by this chapter, one of two watercraft shall yield the
right of way, the other shall keep its course and speed.
      (7)    Notwithstanding anything contained in these rules, every
watercraft overtaking another shall yield the right of way to the overtaken
watercraft. Every watercraft coming up with another watercraft from any
direction more than 22.5 degrees abaft the other's beam, that is, at such a
position with reference to the watercraft which it is overtaking that at night
it would be unable to see either of the other's side or combination bow lights,
is an overtaking watercraft, and no subsequent alteration of bearing between
the two watercraft shall make the overtaking watercraft a crossing watercraft
within the meaning of these rules, or relieve it of the duty of keeping clear
of the overtaken watercraft until it is finally passed and clear. If the
overtaking watercraft is in doubt as to whether it is forward of or abaft this
direction from the other watercraft, it should assume that it is an overtaking
watercraft and yield the right of way.
      (8)    In rivers and streams or other areas in which there is a water
current, the descending watercraft shall have the right of way over a
watercraft which is ascending.
      (9)    When a powercraft and a rowboat are proceeding in such direction
as to involve the risk of collision, such powercraft shall yield the right of
way to such rowboat.
      (10)    Watercraft leaving a dock, boat slip or tie-up space shall yield
the right of way to all watercraft approaching such dock, boat slip or tie-up
space.
      (11)    At all times, the operator of a watercraft shall maintain a
proper lookout required by the ordinary practice of seamen and by the special
circumstances of the case.
      (12)    In obeying and construing these rules, due regard shall be had to
all dangers of navigation and collision and to any special circumstances which
may render a departure from the above rules necessary in order to avoid
immediate danger. (ORC 1547.05)
   (b)    Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.
Punishment shall be as provided in Section
698.02. (ORC 1547.99(C))
670.06  CHILD OPERATOR PROHIBITED.
   (a)    No person under twelve years of age shall operate any watercraft upon
the waters in this City unless such person is under the direct visual and
audible supervision, during such operation, of a parent, guardian or other
person over the age of sixteen years. No supervising parent, guardian or other
person over sixteen years of age shall permit any person under twelve years of
age operating a watercraft upon the waters in the City to violate any of the
provisions of this chapter. (ORC 1547.06)
   (b)    Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.
Punishment shall be as provided in Section
698.02. (ORC 1547.99(C))
670.07  RECKLESS OPERATION,
   (a)    No person shall operate any watercraft, or manipulate any water skis,
aquaplane or similar device upon the waters in this City carelessly or
heedlessly, or in disregard of the rights or safety of any person, watercraft
or property, or without due caution, at a rate of speed or in a manner so as to
endanger any person, watercraft or property. (ORC 1547.07)
   (b)    Whoever violates this section, without causing injury to persons or
damage to property, is guilty of a minor misdemeanor on a first offense. On
each subsequent offense that does not cause injury to persons or damage to
property within one year after the first offense, such person is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the fourth degree.
   Whoever violates this section causing injury to persons or damage to
property is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree.
   Punishment shall be as provided in Section
698.02.
670.08  MARKING OF BATHING AND WATERCRAFT AREAS.
   (a)    No person shall operate a watercraft within or through a designated
bathing area or within or through any area which has been buoyed off
designating it as an area in which watercraft are prohibited.
   (b)    No person shall operate a watercraft at greater than idle speed or at
a speed that creates a wake near any marina, boat docking facility, boat
gasoline dock, launch ramp, recreational boat harbor or harbor entrance or
within any area buoyed or marked as a no wake area.
   (c)    No person shall operate a watercraft in any area of restricted or
controlled operation in violation of the designated restriction.
   (d)    No person shall operate a watercraft within 150 feet of an official
diver's flag unless he or she is tendering the diving operation.
   (e)    All areas of restricted or controlled operation as described in
subsection (a) hereof or as provided for in Section 670.13 or Ohio R.C. 1547.
61 shall be marked by a buoy or sign designating the restriction. All waters
surrounded by or lying between such a buoy or sign and the closest shoreline
are thereby designated as an area in which the designated restrictions shall
apply in the operation of any watercraft.
   Markings on buoys designating areas of restricted or controlled operation

the defendant's blood, urine or breath at the time of the alleged violation as
shown by chemical analysis of the defendant's blood, urine or breath taken
within two hours of the time of the alleged violation.
   When a person submits to a blood test, only a physician, registered nurse or
a qualified technician or chemist shall withdraw blood for the purpose of
determining its alcohol or drug of abuse content. This limitation does not
apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens. A physician, registered nurse
or qualified technician or chemist may refuse to withdraw blood for the purpose
of determining its alcohol or drug of abuse content if, in his or her opinion,
the physical welfare of the person would be endangered by the withdrawing of
blood.
   The blood, urine or breath shall be analyzed in accordance with methods
approved by the Ohio Director of Health by an individual possessing a valid
permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3701.143.

in the defendant's blood, less than fourteen- hundredths of one gram by weight
of alcohol per 100 milliliters of his or her urine or less than ten- hundredths
of one gram by weight of alcohol per 210 liters of his or her breath, such fact
may be considered with other competent evidence in determining the guilt or
innocence of the defendant.
   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the test shall
be made available to him or her or his or her attorney or agent, immediately
upon the completion of the test analysis.
   The person tested may have a physician, registered nurse or qualified
technician or chemist of his or her own choosing administer a chemical test or
tests in addition to any administered at the direction of a law enforcement
officer and shall be so advised. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional test by a person shall not preclude the admission of evidence
relating to the test or tests taken at the direction of a law enforcement
officer.
   A physician, registered nurse or qualified technician or chemist who
withdraws blood from a person pursuant to this section, and a hospital, first-
aid station or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to
this section, is immune from criminal liability, and from civil liability that
is based upon a claim of assault and battery or based upon any other claim that
is not in the nature of a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in
withdrawing blood from the person. (ORC 1547.11)

in lieu of the suspended term of imprisonment, places the offender on probation
and requires the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers'
intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3720.06. The court
also may suspend the execution of any part of the mandatory three consecutive

court may require the offender to attend a drivers' intervention program that
is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3720.06.
      (3)    If, within five years of the offense, the offender has been

influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse or alcohol and a drug of abuse, of a
municipal ordinance relating to operating a watercraft or manipulating any
water skis, aquaplane or similar device with a prohibited concentration of

ability of an offender sentenced pursuant to paragraph (c)(1), (2) or (3)
hereof to continue his or her employment, the court may authorize that the
offender be granted work release from imprisonment after the offender has
served the three, ten or thirty consecutive days of imprisonment that the court
is required by paragraph (c)(1), (2) or (3) hereof to impose. No court shall
authorize work release from imprisonment during the three, ten or thirty
consecutive days of imprisonment that the court is required by paragraph (c)
(1), (2) or (3) hereof to impose. The duration of the work release shall not
exceed the time necessary each day for the offender to commute to and from the

he commits a subsequent theft offense;
      (4)    Having been convicted of one or more felony drug abuse offenses,

      (5)    Having been convicted of two or more felonies, and having been

   (b)    "Dangerous offender" means a person who has committed an offense,

698.02  PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions.  In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section.  If the court in its
discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to,
the following:
      (1)   Restitution.  Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor
or could be disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court
under Traffic Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the
offender’s crime or any survivor of the victim, in an amount based on the
victim’s economic loss.  The court may not impose restitution as a sanction
pursuant to this section if the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13.  If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
   If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine the amount of
restitution to be paid by the offender.  If the court imposes restitution, the
court may base the amount of restitution it orders on an amount recommended by
the victim, the offender, a presentence investigation report, estimates or
receipts indicating the cost of repairing or replacing property, and other
information, provided that the amount the court orders as restitution shall not
exceed the amount of the economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and
proximate result of the commission of the offense.  If the court decides to
impose restitution, the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution
if the offender, victim or survivor disputes the amount of restitution.  If the
court holds an evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the victim or survivor has
the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the amount of
restitution sought from the offender.
All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery of economic
loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any survivor of the victim
against the offender.  No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the offender pay a
surcharge, of not more than five per cent of the amount of the restitution
otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and processing
restitution payments.
The victim or survivor may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered.  If the court grants the motion, it may
modify the payment terms as it determines appropriate.
      (2)   Fines.  A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions.  The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection.  If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37.  In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms. 
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B).  The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case.  The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program.  During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations.  Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections
(a) and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.08 shall be fined, in accordance with this section.  The court shall fix
the fine as follows:
 
 
Type of Misdemeanor                            Maximum Fine
First degree                                   $5000.00

Misdemeanor not specifically classified          2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not  specifically classified  1000.00
 
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
606.08 , either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this

         (ORC 2929.31)
698.03  IMPOSING SENTENCE FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)    In determining whether to impose imprisonment or a fine, or both, for
misdemeanor, and in determining the term of imprisonment and the amount and
method of payment of a fine, the court shall consider the risk that the
offender will commit another offense and the need for protecting the public
therefrom, the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history, character
and condition of the offender and his need for correctional or rehabilitative
treatment, and the ability and resources of the offender and the nature of the
burden that payment of a fine will impose on him.
   (b)    The following do not control the court's discretion, but shall be
considered in favor of imposing imprisonment for misdemeanor:
      (1)    The offender is a repeat or dangerous offender;

victim, the victim of the offense was sixty-five years of age or older or
permanently and totally disabled at the time of the commission of the offense.
   (c)    The criteria listed in Ohio R.C. 2929.12, favoring shorter terms of
imprisonment for felony, do not control the court's discretion, but shall be
considered against imposing imprisonment for misdemeanor.
   (d)    The criteria listed in subsections (b) and (c) hereof shall not be
construed to limit the matters which may be considered in determining whether
to impose imprisonment for misdemeanor.
   (e)    The court shall not impose a fine in addition to imprisonment for
misdemeanor, unless a fine is specially adapted to deterrence of the offense or
the correction of the offender, or the offense has proximately resulted in
physical harm to the person or property of another, or the offense was
committed for hire or for purpose of gain.
   (f)    The court shall not impose a fine or fines which, in the aggregate
and to the extent not suspended by the court, exceeds the amount which the

making restitution or reparation to the victim of his offense.
   (g)    At the time of sentencing or as soon as possible after sentencing,

purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon organizations, then
such penalty shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty provided in this section.
   (c)    When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than that provided

appealed from shall be final. (1964 Code Sec. 701.08)

890.03  IMPOSITION OF TAX.
   Subject to the provisions of Section
890.16, an annual tax for the purposes specified in Section
890.01 hereof shall be imposed on and after January 1, 1971, at the rate of one
and one-half percent (1 1/2%) per year upon the following:
   (a)   On all income, qualifying wages, commissions, and other compensation
earned and/or received, including tips, by residents of the City.
   (b)   On all income, qualifying wages, commissions, and other compensation
earned and/or received, including tips, during the effective period of this
chapter by non-residents for work done or services performed or rendered in the
City.  Separation pay, termination pay, reduction-in-force pay, and other
compensation paid as a result of an employee leaving the service of an employer
shall be allocable only to the City.
      (1)   Perrysburg shall not, however, tax the compensation of a non-
resident individual who will be deemed to be an occasional entrant if all of
the following apply:
         A.   The compensation is paid for personal services performed by the
individual in the City on twelve or fewer days during the calendar year, in
which case the individual shall be considered an occasional entrant for
purposes of the City income tax.  A day is a full day or any fractional part of
a day.
         B.   In the case of an individual who is an employee, the principal
place of business of the individual's employer is located outside the City and
the individual pays tax on compensation described in Section
890.03(b) to the municipality, if any, in which the employer's principal place
of business is located, and no portion of that tax is refunded to the
individual.
         C.   The individual is not a professional entertainer or professional
athlete, the promoter of a professional entertainment or sports event, or an
employee of such a promoter, all as may be reasonably defined by the City.
      (2)   Beginning with the thirteenth day an individual deemed to have been
an occasional entrant to the City performs services within the City, the
employer of said individual shall begin withholding the City income tax from
remuneration paid by the employer to the individual, and shall remit the
withheld income tax to the City in accordance with the requirements of this
ordinance.  Since the individual can no longer be considered to have been an
occasional entrant, the employer is further required to remit taxes on income
earned in the City by the individual for the first twelve days.
      (3)   If the individual is self-employed, it shall be the responsibility
of the individual to remit the appropriate income tax to the City.
   (c)   On the portion attributable to Perrysburg of the net profits earned
during the effective period of this chapter of all resident unincorporated
businesses, professions, associations, or other entities, derived from sales
made, work done, services performed or rendered and business or other
activities conducted in Perrysburg.
   (d)   On the portion of the distributive share of the net profits earned
and/or received during the effective period of this chapter of a resident
partner or owner of a resident unincorporated business entity not attributable
to Perrysburg and not levied against such unincorporated business entity.
   (e)   On the portion attributable to Perrysburg of the net profits earned
during the effective period of this chapter of all nonresident unincorporated
businesses, professions, associations, or other entities, derived from sales
made, work done or services performed or rendered and business or other
activities conducted in Perrysburg, whether or not such unincorporated business
entity has an office or place of business in Perrysburg.
   (f)   On the portion of the distributive share of the net profits earned by
a resident individual from a Subchapter S Corporation.  This policy was
ratified by the passage of a Perrysburg ballot issue on November 4, 2003.
   (g)   On that portion of the distributive share of the net profits of a
resident individual, partner or owner of a nonresident unincorporated business
entity.
   (h)   On the portion attributed to Perrysburg of the net profits earned
during the effective period of this chapter of all corporations derived from
sales made, work done or services performed or rendered and business or other
activities conducted in Perrysburg whether or not such corporations have an
office or place of business in Perrysburg.
   (i)   On all income derived anywhere from gaming, wagering, lotteries, or
games of chance by residents of Perrysburg or by nonresidents of Perrysburg
when the income derived anywhere from gaming, wagering, lotteries, or games of
chance is won or received as a result of transactions conducted in Perrysburg. 
No deductions shall be permitted against these types of income.
   (j)   On covenants not to compete and on cancellation of indebtedness to the
extent includable on the taxpayer's federal tax return.
   (k)   Determination of Net Profits Attributable to the City.
      (1)   The portion of the net profits attributable to Perrysburg of a
taxpayer conducting a business, profession or other activity both within and
without the boundaries of Perrysburg shall be determined as provided in Ohio
R.C. 718.02.  However, if the apportionment formula provided therein does not
produce an equitable result then another basis may be substituted, including
the use of the books and records method.
      (2)   Beginning with the tax year commencing after December 31, 1987, the
net operating loss from a business entity may not be used to offset salaries,
wages, commissions, or the net profit from any other entity or activity. 
However, like schedules can be netted, provided that net profit from a resident
business is not offset by a loss from a non-resident business.
      (3)   A joint return may be filed but the tax imposed on each spouse's
income will be calculated separately.  Each W-2, schedule or other source of
income will be calculated separately and no offsets against the other spouse's
income will be allowed.  A tax return may not be amended to change the form of
filing from joint to separate or vice versa. Tax returns must be filed under
the same status until a change in marital status occurs.
   (l)   Net Operating Loss Carry-Forward.
      (1)   The portion of a net operating loss sustained in any taxable year
subsequent to the effective date of this chapter allocable to Perrysburg may be
applied against the portion of the net profit of succeeding years allocable to
Perrysburg, until exhausted, but in no event for more than five (5) taxable
years. No portion of a net operating loss shall be carried back against net
profits of any prior year.  However, each business net profit that exceeds
losses carried forward from the same entity must be included in taxable income.
      (2)   The portion of net operating loss sustained shall be allocated to
Perrysburg in the same manner as provided for allocating net profits to
Perrysburg. Losses sustained in another taxing municipality shall be first
allocated to that other taxing municipality to the same extent that net profits
would have been allocated had there been a net profit.
   (m)   Consolidated Returns.
      (1)   Any affiliated group which files a consolidated return for federal
income tax purposes pursuant to Section 1501 of the Internal Revenue Code may
file a consolidated return with the City.

      (6)   Spousal support received.

allocated in the same manner as the income to which the expenses are related.
      (13)   The income of a public utility, when that public utility is

      (1)   The amount of Perrysburg income tax deducted or withheld at the
source pursuant to Section

taxpayer pursuant to Section

provisions of this chapter, such overpayment shall first be applied against any
existing penalty or interest and then tax liability (beginning with the oldest
delinquencies), and the balance, if any, at the election of the taxpayer
communicated to the Commissioner, shall be refunded or transferred against any
subsequent liability.  This application of payments may be adjusted by the

890.11 and

   (g)   The officer or employee of such employer having control or supervision
or charged with the responsibility of filing the return and making the payment,
shall be personally liable for failure to file the return or pay the tax,
penalties or interest due as requested herein. The dissolution, bankruptcy or
reorganization of any such employer does not discharge an officer's or
employee's liability for a prior failure of such business to file a return or
pay taxes, penalties or interest due.
   (h)   The tax return is considered received if mailed on the date postmarked
by the United States Postal Service or on the date delivered without mailing to
the Perrysburg Tax Office.
   (i)   Extension of Time for Filing Returns.
      (1)   Taxpayers granted extensions of time for filing their federal
income tax returns may have an extension for filing their Perrysburg tax
return, provided that a copy of the federal extension is filed with the
Commissioner on or before the original date of the Perrysburg return.  The
Commissioner may deny the extension if the taxpayer fails to file the request
timely, fails to file a copy of the federal extension request, or if the
taxpayer's income tax account with Perrysburg is delinquent in any way.
      (2)   The extended time for filing the Perrysburg Tax Return will be the
last day of the month following the month of the due date for the Federal
Income Tax Return regardless of the original due date of the tax return. For
businesses, if the extension is filed through the Ohio Business Gateway the
extended due date shall be the last day of the month to which the due date of
the federal income tax return has been extended. Statutory interest will be
charged from the original due date of the return until date of actual payment.
      (3)   If a taxpayer wishes to extend the time for filing the Perrysburg
Tax Return to a date other than that provided by the automatic federal
extension, the taxpayer must file such a request in writing to the Commissioner
prior to the due date of the automatic extension. The extension may be granted
by the Commissioner upon terms and conditions set forth by him or her. The
extension does not extend the date for paying the tax due.  The Commissioner
may deny the extension if the taxpayer fails to file the request timely, fails
to file a copy of the federal extension request, or if the taxpayer's income
tax account with Perrysburg is delinquent in any way.
   (j)   The failure of any taxpayer to receive or procure a return,
declaration or other required form shall not excuse the taxpayer from filing
such forms or from paying the tax due.
   (k)   Payments received for taxes due shall be allocated first to penalties
due, then to interest due, and then to taxes due, beginning with the oldest
delinquencies.
   (l)   The Commissioner is authorized, but not required, to arrange for the
payment of unpaid taxes, interest and penalties on a schedule of installment
payments, when the taxpayer has proved to the Commissioner that due to certain
hardship conditions, he is unable to pay the full amount of tax due. Such
authorization shall not be granted until proper returns are filed by the
taxpayer for all amounts owed by him under the Codified Ordinances.
(Ord. 104-2015.  Passed 11-17-15.)
890.06  COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (a)   Each employer within or doing business within the City of Perrysburg
who employs one or more persons on an income, qualifying wage, commission or
other compensation basis shall, at the time of payment thereof, deduct the tax
of one and one-half percent (1½%) from the income, qualifying wages, commission
or other compensation basis earned and/or received by residents of the City
regardless of where compensation is earned and/or received and qualifying
wages, commissions or other compensation earned and/or received within this
City by non-residents.
   (b)   For those employers with the tax due of less than five hundred dollars
($500.00) per month, based on the previous tax year's monthly average, such
employer shall, on quarterly basis, make a return and remit to the City the tax
hereby required to be withheld.  The return shall be on a form or forms
prescribed by or acceptable to the Commissioner.  The employer shall be liable
for the payment of the tax required to be deducted and withheld whether or not
such taxes have in fact been withheld as follows:
      (1)   For the 3 months ending March 31, on or before April 25;
      (2)   For the 3 months ending June 30, on or before July 25;
      (3)   For the 3 months ending September 30, on or before October 25;
      (4)   For the 3 months ending December 31, on or before January 25.
   (c)   For those employers with the tax due of five hundred dollars ($500.00)
per month or more, based on the previous tax year's monthly average, or
withholding in the prior calendar year of six thousand dollars ($6,000) or
more, all taxes due shall be paid to the City within twenty days following the
reporting period.  The reporting period for purposes of this paragraph shall be
one calendar month.  Effective January 1, 2007 payments of withheld tax shall
be deposited electronically, unless exemption from this requirement is given by
the Commissioner.
   (d)   Every employer required to deduct and withhold tax from the
compensation of an employee under this chapter in collecting the tax shall be
deemed to hold the same, until payment is made by such employer to this City,
as a trustee for the benefit of this City.  Any such tax collected by such
employer from its employees shall, until the same is paid to this City, be
deemed a trust fund in the hand of such employer.
      (1)   Every such employer required to deduct and withhold the tax at the
source is primarily liable directly to this City for the payment of the tax,
whether actually collected by the employer or not.
      (2)   The failure of any employer residing either within or outside this
City, to collect the amounts prescribed herein, shall not relieve the employee
from the payment of the tax in compliance with this chapter respecting the
making of returns and the payment of taxes.
   (e)   No person shall be required to withhold the tax on wages or other
compensation paid domestic servants employed by him exclusively in or about the
person's residence, even though the residence is in this City, but the employee
shall be subject to all of the requirements of this chapter.
   (f)   The officer or the employee having control or supervision of or
charged with the responsibility of withholding the tax, and/or of filing the
report and making payment, is personally liable for failure to file the report
or pay the tax due as required by this section. The dissolution of a
corporation or limited partnership does not discharge an officer's or
employee's liability for a prior failure of the corporation or limited
partnership to file returns or pay the tax due.
   (g)   On the last day of February, each employer shall file a withholding
reconciliation setting forth the names, addresses and social security numbers
of all employees from whose compensation the tax was withheld during the
preceding calendar year and the amount of tax withheld from his/her employees
and other information as may be required by the Commissioner.  All payments not
subject to withholding shall be reported on a form required by the
Commissioner.  Beginning with tax year 2007, employers with more than 25
employees are required to submit W-2's electronically to the Commissioner in
the same format thereon as provided to the Social Security Administration.
   (h)   The Commissioner for good cause may require immediate returns and
payments to be submitted to his office.
   (i)   All individuals, businesses, employers, brokers or others who are
required under the Internal Revenue Code to furnish forms 1099 to the IRS for
resident individuals or businesses and non-resident individuals or businesses
to whom or which they have non-employee compensation, shall furnish on or
before the last day of February copies of said form 1099's to the Commissioner
or in lieu thereof, a list containing the same information as required by the
Internal Revenue Service on the 1099's.  Failure to provide the foregoing
information may result in any deduction for payment by the taxpayer taken on
the taxpayer's return to be disallowed.
   (j)   Every employer shall retain all records necessary to compute
withholding taxes due Perrysburg for a period of six (6) years from the date
the Reconciliation Form, W-2 forms, and 1099 forms are filed.
   (k)   All returns and forms required to be filed by an employer are
considered received on the date postmarked by the United States Postal Service
or on the date delivered without mailing by the taxpayer in the Perrysburg Tax
Office.
   (l)   The failure of any employer to receive or procure a return, or other
required form shall not excuse the employer from preparing any information
return, withholding tax reconciliation or from filing such forms or from paying
the tax due.
   (m)   Each person who applies for a zoning permit pursuant to Chapter
1280 shall provide to the Commissioner, within thirty (30) days thereafter, a
complete list of names, addresses and federal identification number or social
security number (if used in lieu of a federal identification number) of all
contractors and sub-contractors who will be performing or are expected to
perform work within the City of Perrysburg pursuant to a proposed building,
building addition, structural modification or new use of vacant land. This
obligation to report such names and addresses is a continuing obligation on the
part of the person applying for a zoning permit and shall require such
applicant to provide the names and addresses of all contractors and sub-
contractors subsequently hired within thirty (30) days of their hiring. Whoever
violates or fails to comply with the provision of this section is guilty of a
minor misdemeanor and shall be fined not more than one hundred dollars
($100.00). A separate offense shall be deemed committed each day during or on
which a violation or noncompliance occurs or continues.
(Ord. 104-2015.  Passed 11-17-15.)
890.07  DECLARATIONS; ESTIMATED TAX PAYMENTS.
   (a)   Every person who anticipates any taxable income on which the annual
tax due is in excess of two hundred dollars ($200.00) and which is not subject
to Section
890.06 in whole or in part, or who engages in any business, profession,
enterprise or activity subject to the tax imposed by Section
890.03, shall file a declaration setting forth such estimated income or the
estimated profit or loss from such business activity together with the
estimated tax due thereon, if any. However, if a person's income is wholly from
wages from which tax will be withheld and remitted to the City of Perrysburg in
accordance with Section
890.06, such person need not file a declaration.
   (b)   Such declaration shall be filed on or before April 15 of each year, or
on or before the federal filing date if it is other than April 15th, so long as
this chapter is effective, or within four (4) months of the date the taxpayer
becomes subject to tax for the first time.
   (c)   Those taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a
declaration on the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth (4th) month after the
beginning of each fiscal year or period, or on or before the federal filing
date if it is other than the 15th day of the fourth month from the end of such
fiscal year or period.
   (d)   Such declaration shall be filed upon a form furnished by, or
obtainable from, the Commissioner, or on an acceptable generic form as defined
in this Chapter. Credit shall be taken for Perrysburg Income Tax to be
withheld, if any, from any portion of such income. In addition, credit may be
taken for the tax payable to other taxing municipalities in accordance with the
provisions of Section
890.14 or tax withheld from the source pursuant to Section
890.06 or any overpayment of the previous year's tax liability which has not
been refunded.
   (e)   The original declaration, or any subsequent amendment thereof, may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment date as
provided herein.
   (f)   The taxpayer making the declaration shall, at the time of the filing
thereof, pay to the Commissioner at least twenty-two and one-half percent
(22½%) of the estimated annual tax due.
   (g)   At least a similar amount shall be paid on or before the last day of
the seventh (7th), tenth (l0th) and thirteenth (13th) months after the
beginning of the taxpayer's taxable year, provided that in case an amended
declaration has been duly filed, or the taxpayer is taxable for a portion of
the year only, the unpaid balance shall be paid in equal installments on or
before the remaining payment dates.
   (h)   The declarations for the second (2nd), third (3rd) and fourth (4th)
quarters shall be due on July 31st and October 31st of the current year and on
January 31st of the subsequent year. The amounts due on those dates are at
least forty-five percent (45%), sixty-seven and one- half percent (67½%) and
ninety percent (90%) respectively of the tax estimated to be due.  (ORC 718.08)
   (i)   Effective January 1, 2003, no penalty or interest will be assessed for
late payment or nonpayment of estimated taxes if the taxpayer was not domiciled
in Perrysburg on the first day of January of the current calendar year or if
the taxpayer had paid estimate payments equaling one hundred percent (100%) of
the taxpayer's tax liability for the immediately preceding tax year, providing
that the immediately preceding tax year reflected a twelve month tax period and
the taxpayer filed a return for the immediately preceding year. (ORC 718.08).
   (j)   On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth (4th) month of the
year following that for which such declaration or amended declaration was
filed, or on or before the federal filing date if it is other than April 15th,
an annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due for the City
of Perrysburg shall be paid therewith in accordance with the provisions of
Section
890.05.  In the case of a fiscal year taxpayer, on or before the fifteenth day
of the fourth month after the close of the fiscal year for which a declaration
was filed, or on or before the federal filing date if it is other than the 15th
day of the fourth month from the end of such fiscal year or period, an annual
return shall be filed and any balance which may be due the City shall be paid
therewith in accordance with the provisions of Section
890.05.
   (k)   Any money due the City because of failure to pay an installment of
estimated tax, or the proper amount of underestimation or otherwise, is subject
to the interest and penalties provided for in Section
890.10.
   (l)   No interest and penalty shall be assessed if the taxpayer bases his or
her estimate on the preceding three-month period, annualized for the remainder
of the year, and updates this estimate by amendment as necessary each
succeeding three-month period so that at least ninety percent (90%) of the
annual liability to be ultimately determined has been paid by estimate by the
close of each period as applicable. If the taxpayer files in this manner, but
fails to have ninety percent (90%) of the ultimate tax liability paid in the
fashion so described, interest and penalty shall be assessed on the portion of
the estimated tax not equal to at least ninety percent (90%) of the final tax
due when paid by the installment due date.
   (m)   If a taxpayer's total quarterly estimate payments do not equal at
least ninety percent (90%) of the total tax liability as estimated on the
taxpayer's annual tax return or if the taxpayers total quarterly estimate
payments do not equal one hundred percent (100%) of the taxpayer's tax
liability for the immediately preceding year, provided that such immediately
preceding year's liability reflected as twelve-month tax period on the return
filed by the taxpayer, interest and penalty shall be assessed at the following
rates and in the following manner:
      (1)   The taxpayer's annual tax liability as estimated on the taxpayer's
annual return shall be divided by four (4) to determine the amount of tax which
should have been paid quarterly on an estimated basis. The difference between
the amount of tax which should have been paid quarterly on an estimated basis
and the amount of tax actually paid quarterly on an estimated basis shall be
subject to a penalty of one percent (1%), or fraction thereof, at a minimum of
ten percent (10%) per quarter, and interest of one percent (1%) per month or
fraction thereof from the due date of each quarterly installment to the date
the annual return is due or the tax paid thereon, whichever is earlier.
      (2)   In the event the taxpayer provides satisfactory evidence to the
Commissioner that the taxpayer's annual income fluctuated in such a manner that
the penalty and/or interest as specified in paragraph (1) hereof should not be
imposed, the Commissioner may waive any portion of such penalty and/or interest
upon request of the taxpayer and submission of evidence of such fluctuation to
the Commissioner.
      (3)   Any credits from a previous year carrying over to the current year
would reduce the estimates due and applied to the first quarter of the current
year, with any excess then applied to subsequent quarters of the current year
to reduce the liability thereon.
         (Ord. 104-2015.  Passed 11-17-15.)
890.08  DUTIES OF COMMISSIONER.
   (a)   It shall be the duty of the Commissioner to receive the tax imposed by
this chapter in the manner prescribed herein from the taxpayers; to keep an
accurate record thereof, and to report all moneys so received.
   (b)   It shall be the duty of the Commissioner to enforce payment of all
taxes owing Perrysburg; to keep accurate records for a minimum of six (6) years
showing the amount due from each taxpayer required to file a declaration and/or
make any return, including taxes withheld; and to show the dates and amounts of

   (c)   The Commissioner is hereby charged with the enforcement of the
provisions of this chapter.
   (d)   In any case where a taxpayer has failed to file a return or has filed
a return which does not show the proper amount of tax due, the Commissioner may
assess the amount of tax appearing to be due the City from the taxpayer and
shall send to such taxpayer by certified mail a written statement showing the
amount of tax, if any, so determined, together with interest and penalties
thereon. Such determination may be modified or amended based upon information
or data subsequently secured by or made available to the Commissioner. If the
taxpayer fails to respond to the assessment within thirty (30) days, the tax,
penalties, and interest assessed shall become due and payable and collectible,
as are other unpaid taxes.
   (e)   Subject to the consent of the Board of Review or pursuant to
regulation approved by the Board, the Commissioner shall have the power to
compromise any interest or penalty, or both, imposed by Section
890.10.
   (f)   The Commissioner shall be appointed by the Mayor, subject to the
approval of Council. He or she may be removed at any time with or without cause
by a two-thirds vote of Council. He or she shall give bond in such sum and
shall receive such compensation as may be determined from time to time by
Council. Subject to the approval of Council he/she shall have authority to
employ such assistants, clerks, investigators and other help on full or part
time basis as he/she may determine is necessary for proper performance of
duties under this chapter. Such assistants, clerks, investigators and other
help shall receive such compensation as may be determined from time to time by
Council.
   (g)   The Commissioner is authorized to arrange for installment payments in
accordance with Section
890.05(l).
(Ord. 104-2015.  Passed 11-17-15.)
890.09  INVESTIGATIVE POWERS OF COMMISSIONER; DIVULGING CONFIDENTIAL
INFORMATION.
   (a)   The Commissioner, Director of Finance, or any authorized employee, is
hereby authorized to examine the books, papers, records and federal and/or
State income tax returns of any employer or of any taxpayer or person subject
to, or whom the Commissioner believes is subject to, the provisions of this
chapter, for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made, or if no
return was made, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Every such
employer, supposed employer, taxpayer or supposed taxpayer, is hereby directed
and required to furnish within ten (10) calendar days following a written
request by the Commissioner, or his/her duly authorized agent or employee, the
means, facilities and opportunity for making such examination and
investigations as are hereby authorized.
   (b)   The Commissioner is hereby authorized to order any person presumed to
have knowledge of the facts to appear before him/her and may examine such
person, under oath, concerning any income which was or should have been
reported for taxation or any transaction tending to affect such income, and for
this purpose may compel the production of books, papers, records and Federal
and/or State income tax returns and the attendance of all persons before him/
her, whether as parties or witnesses, whenever he/she believes such persons
have knowledge of such income or information pertinent to such inquiry.
   (c)   The refusal to produce books, papers, records and Federal and/or State
income tax returns, or the refusal to submit to such examination by any
employer or person subject or presumed to be subject to the tax, or by any
officer, agent or employee of a person subject to the tax or required to
withhold tax, or the failure of any person to comply with the provisions of
this section or with an order or subpoena of the Commissioner authorized hereby
shall be deemed a violation of this chapter punishable as provided in Section
890.99.
   (d)   Any information gained as the result of any returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications as authorized by this chapter shall be confidential,
except for official purposes, which include the exchange of information with
other tax authorities, or except in accordance with proper judicial order. Any
person divulging such information shall be subject to prosecution as provided
in Sections
890.17 and
890.99.

liability for a period of six (6) years from the date his return is filed, or

industrial or other rental property who rent to tenants, shall file with the
Commissioner a report showing the names, addresses, telephone numbers and, if
known, places of employment of each such tenant who occupies residential,
commercial, industrial or other rental premises within the corporation limits
of the City.  For tenants who have vacated a rental or leased residential,
commercial, industrial or other rental property located within the City, the
report shall also include the date of vacating from the rental or leased
residential, commercial, industrial or other rental property and identifying
such vacating tenant and, if known, the forwarding address.
(Ord. 104-2015.  Passed 11-17-15.)
890.10  INTEREST AND PENALTIES.
   (a)   Beginning January 1, 1982 all taxes, including estimated taxes,
imposed and all money withheld or required to be withheld by employers under
this chapter and remaining unpaid after they become due shall bear interest at
the rate of one percent (1%) per month or fraction of a month thereof.
   (b)   Beginning January 1, 1982, and in addition to interest as provided in
subsection (a) hereof, penalties based upon the unpaid tax are hereby imposed
as follows:
      (1)   For failure to pay tax due, other than tax withheld, one percent
(1%) per month or fraction of a month thereof, with a minimum of ten percent
(10%);
      (2)   For failure to remit taxes withheld from employee, three percent
(3%) per month or fraction of a month thereof, with a minimum of ten percent
(10%);
      (3)   For failure to file a return in cases where an office subpoena of
the Commissioner is authorized, as authorized by Section
890.09(b), twenty- five dollars ($25.00).
      (4)   For failure to file a timely return when there is a tax liability,
the amount of the tax liability or twenty-five dollars ($25.00), whichever is
less.
      (5)   When any check or other negotiable instrument used in the payment
of any tax liability due pursuant to this chapter is dishonored, an additional
charge shall be added to the tax liability of the person owing the same. The
amount of such charge shall be determined by Council from time to time.
   (c)   A penalty shall not be assessed on an additional tax assessment made
by the Commissioner when a return has been filed in good faith and the tax paid
therein within the time prescribed by the Commissioner. In the absence of
fraud, neither penalty nor interest shall be assessed on any additional tax
assessment resulting from a federal audit, provided an amended return is filed
and the additional tax is paid within three (3) months after final
determination of the federal tax liability.
   (d)   Upon recommendation of the Commissioner, the Board of Review may abate
penalty or interest, or both, or upon an appeal from the refusal of the
Commissioner to recommend abatement of penalty and interest, the Board may
nevertheless abate penalty or interest, or both.
(Ord. 104-2015.  Passed 11-17-15.)
890.11  COLLECTION OF UNPAID TAXES BY LITIGATION; REFUNDS OF OVERPAYMENTS.
   (a)   All taxes imposed by this chapter shall be collectible by the City of
Perrysburg Income Tax Division or its authorized agent, together with any
interest, penalties and administrative fees thereon, by suit or by other means,
as other debts of like amount are recoverable, provided suit shall be brought
within three (3) years after the tax was due or the return was filed, whichever
is later as specified by Ohio R.C. 718.12(A).  No additional assessment shall
be made after three years from the time of payment of any tax due hereunder,
provided, however, that in the case of a return that omits gross income of
twenty-five percent (25%) or more of that required to be reported or in the
case of the filing of false or fraudulent return with the intent to evade the
tax, or in the case of failure to file a return, suit shall be brought within
six (6) years after the tax was due or the return was filed, whichever is
later.
An administrative fee equal to thirty-five percent (35%) of the total
delinquent amount shall be added to the delinquent amount if such delinquent
amount is assigned to an authorized agent of the City for collection.
   (b)   Taxes erroneously paid shall not be refunded unless a claim for refund
is made within three years after the tax was paid or the return was filed,
whichever is later.  In addition, the following shall apply regarding refunds
of tax withheld from non-qualified deferred compensation plans (NDCP):
      (1)   A taxpayer may be eligible for a refund if the taxpayer has
suffered a loss from a NDCP.  The loss will be considered sustained only in the
taxable year in which the taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and
property pursuant to the NDCP.  Full loss is sustained if no distribution of
money and property will be made by the NDCP.
      (2)   A taxpayer who receives income as a result of payments from a NDCP,
and that income is less than the amount of income deferred to the NDCP and upon
which municipal tax was withheld, then a refund will be issued on the amount
representing the difference between the deferred income that was taxed and the
income received from the NDCP.  If different tax rates applied to the tax years
in which deferrals, a weighted average of the different tax rates will be used
to compute the refund amount.
      (3)   Refunds shall be allowed only if the loss is attributable to the
bankruptcy of the employer who had established the NDCP, or the employee's
failure or inability to satisfy all of the employer's terms and conditions
necessary to receive the nonqualified compensation.
   (c)   Refunds to non-residents for tax withheld from income attributable to
days not worked in Perrysburg shall be computed by dividing wages by total days
worked in order to determine an average daily wage.  The work year shall be
considered two hundred sixty (260) days.  Saturdays and Sundays shall not
normally be considered work days.  Wage continuation plans of any type
(including, but not limited to, vacation days, holidays, personal days, and
sick days) are deemed to be days spent in Perrysburg for purposes of the refund
calculation.  Refunds shall be approved only after receipt by the Commissioner
of all documents necessary to verify the accuracy of the refund request.  The
tax on stock options is considered taxable to Perrysburg, but is subject to
reduction for days worked out of Perrysburg.  Additions, deletions, or other
changes to the method for calculating refunds shall be at the discretion of the
Commissioner.
   (d)   Income tax that has been deposited with the City of Perrysburg, but
should have been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by the City
of Perrysburg as a refund but is subject to the three-year limitation on
refunds.  Income tax that should have been deposited with the City of
Perrysburg, but was deposited with another municipality, shall be subject to
recovery by the City of Perrysburg.  The City of Perrysburg will allow a non-
refundable credit for any amount owed the City of Perrysburg that is in excess
of the amount to be refunded by the other municipality, as long as the tax rate
of the other municipality is the same or higher than the City of Perrysburg's
tax rate.  If the City of Perrysburg's tax rate is higher, the tax representing
the net difference of the rates is also subject to collection by the City of
Perrysburg.
   (e)   Payments on delinquent amounts shall be applied in the following
manner:
      (1)   To unpaid penalty and interest assessments in the order in which
such assessments became due.
      (2)   To the taxes owed for any previous year in the order in which such
taxes became due.
      (3)   To the taxpayer's current estimated tax liability.
   (f)   Amounts of less than five dollars ($5.00) shall not be refunded.
Amounts of less than five dollars ($5.00) shall not be collected. Amounts of
less than five dollars ($5.00) shall be carried forward as a credit towards the
following year's tax liability. In case of a final return with less than five
dollars ($5.00) as a credit balance, the credit will be refunded.
(Ord. 104-2015.  Passed 11-17-15.)
890.12  BOARD OF REVIEW.
   (a)   (1)   A Board of Review consisting of the City Law Director as
chairman and two other individuals to be appointed by the Mayor with the
consent of Council is hereby created.  Each member of the Board of Review shall
exercise one vote.  Two members shall constitute a quorum.  The initial
appointments made by the Mayor shall provide one member for a two-year term
ending December 31, 2005, and one member for a four-year term ending December
31, 2007.  Subsequent to the initial appointments, all appointments to the
Board by the Mayor shall be for a term of four years.
      (2)   A vacancy occurring during the term of any member of the Board of
Review shall be filled for the unexpired term in the manner authorized for an
initial appointment.  The Board shall adopt its own procedural rules and shall
keep a record of its transactions.  Any hearing of the Board shall be conducted
privately and the provisions of Section
890.09 with reference to the confidential character of information to be
disclosed by this chapter shall apply to such matters as may be heard before
the Board on appeal.  The Board's records are not open to public inspection nor
are the meetings subject to the State open meeting law.
   (b)   Any member who misses more than three consecutive meetings or more
than half of the meetings in any calendar year shall be deemed to have vacated
his/her position and shall be replaced.
   (c)   The Board shall hear and pass on appeals from any ruling or decision
of the Commissioner, and at the request of the taxpayer or Commissioner, is
empowered to substitute alternate methods of allocation.
   (d)   Whenever the Commissioner issues a decision that is appealable to the
Board, the taxpayer must be informed of their right to appeal and the manner in
which the appeal is to be filed.
   (e)   Any person dissatisfied with any ruling or decision of the
Commissioner which is made under the authority conferred by this chapter (see
890.08(c)) may appeal therefrom in writing to the Board of Review within thirty
(30) calendar days from the issuance of such ruling or decision by the
Commissioner.  The appeal shall be in writing and shall state why the decision
should be deemed incorrect or unlawful. The Board must schedule a hearing
within forty-five (45) calendar days of receiving the appeal unless the
taxpayer expressly waives the hearing and chooses instead to let the Board
render its decision on the writings submitted by the Commissioner and the
Appellant. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled
to appear before the Board and bring with him or her representation of his or
her choosing. The Board must issue a written decision within ninety (90) days
after the final hearing and send a notice of its decision to the taxpayer
within fifteen (15) days after rendering its decision. If the Board fails to
comply with the provisions of this section, the taxpayer's appeal will default

890.13  ALLOCATION OF FUNDS.
   (EDITOR'S NOTE:  Ordinance 31-70, passed May 12, 1970, provided funds for
the purposes of debt retirement, general municipal operations, maintenance, new
equipment, extension and enlargement of Municipal services including the sum of
forty-five thousand dollars ($45,000) per annum to apply to the construction of
a secondary sewer treatment plant; thirty-five thousand dollars ($35,000) per
annum for refuse collection and fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000) for parks
and recreation and other capital improvements.)
   The funds collected under the provisions of this chapter shall be applied
for the following purposes:
   (a)   Such part thereof as shall be necessary to defray all costs of
collecting the taxes levied by this chapter and the cost of administering and
enforcing the provisions thereof;
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the sum of thirty
thousand dollars ($30,000) from the collections in each year shall be used for
the purpose of meeting principal and interest charges on such indebtedness of
the City which are secured by general obligation bonds of the City, or which
are payable by special assessment against all taxable real estate within the
corporate limits of the City at the time such assessment was made, in such
proportions or amount as Council may from time to time direct. However, if the
aggregate of such indebtedness which can be paid in any year is less than
thirty thousand dollars ($30,000) the excess over such aggregate may be
transferred to the General Fund.
   (c)   The sum of forty thousand dollars ($40,000) per year, or such part
thereof as may be appropriated by Council, into special funds which are hereby
established for the following purposes
      (1)   Purchase and maintenance of new and additional equipment for the
Department of Public Service-Safety;
      (2)   Extension, enlargement or improvement of Municipal services and
facilities;
      (3)   Street improvement and repair;
      (4)   Construction, remodeling or enlargement of public buildings;
      (5)   Recreation program; and
      (6)   Additional bond or note retirement.
   (d)   The balance of the funds collected each year under the provisions of
this chapter shall be paid to the General Fund for general operating expenses.
      (Ord. 104-2015.  Passed 11-17-15.)
890.14  CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO OTHER MUNICIPALITIES.
   It is the intent of this section that a resident taxpayer, subject to tax in
more than one municipality on the same income, be granted a credit toward tax
paid in other municipalities. Accordingly, notwithstanding any other provisions
of this chapter:
   (a)   When the taxable income of a resident of the City is subject to a
municipal income tax in another municipality, on the same income taxable under
this chapter, such resident shall be allowed a credit of the amount of income
tax paid on such taxable income to the other municipality equal to fifty
percent (50%) of the amount obtained by multiplying the lower of the tax rate
of such other municipality, or of this municipality, by the taxable income
earned in or attributable to the municipality of employment or business
activity. For the purpose of this section, taxable income includes the
distributive share of net profits of a resident partner or owner of an
unincorporated business entity. In cases where the tax withheld or paid was in
excess of the other city's rate, the rate allowed would be the maximum
allowable by the other city. Likewise in the event of tax withheld or paid at
less than the other city's rate, the taxable income toward the calculation of
the credit would be based on the income actually taxed.
   (b)   Perrysburg resident individuals entitled to such credit shall file a
return indicating the kind, amount and source of such income, the amount, if
any, of personal exemption to which they are entitled, and the amount of tax
paid to such other municipality.
   (c)   No credit will be given unless the taxpayer claims such credit on his
final return or other form prescribed by the Commissioner and presents such
evidence of the payment of a similar tax to another municipality as the
Commissioner may require.
   (d)   The Commissioner, or any duly authorized agent or employee, may
exchange information with the Commissioner or his/her authorized employee of
other taxing jurisdictions for the purpose of verifying any claim for credit by
Perrysburg residents, or for the purpose of verifying any claims for credit for
taxes paid to the City of Perrysburg by residents of such other taxing
jurisdictions and may enter into agreements for such purpose.
   (e)   No credit shall be given for tax paid to a school district.
      (Ord. 104-2015.  Passed 11-7-15.)
890.15  SEPARABILITY.
   If any sentence, clause, section or part of this chapter, or any tax against
any individual or any of the several groups specified herein, is found to be
unconstitutional, illegal or invalid, such unconstitutionality, illegality or
invalidity shall affect only such clause, sentence, section or part of this
chapter and shall not affect or impair any of the remaining provisions,
sentences, clauses, sections or other parts of this chapter. It is hereby
declared to be the intention of Council that this chapter would have been
adopted had such unconstitutional, illegal or invalid sentence, clause, section
or part thereof not been included herein.
(Ord. 104-2015.  Passed 11-17-15.)
890.16  COLLECTION OF TAX AFTER TERMINATION OF CHAPTER.
   This chapter shall continue effective insofar as the levy of taxes is
concerned until repealed in accordance with law, and insofar as the collection
of taxes levied hereunder and actions or proceedings for collecting any tax so
levied or enforcing any provisions of this chapter are concerned, it shall
continue effective until all of such taxes levied in the aforesaid period are
fully paid and any and all suits and prosecutions for the collection of such
taxes or for the punishment of violations of this chapter have been fully
terminated, subject to the limitations contained in Sections
890.11,
890.17, and
890.99.

imposed by this chapter;
      (4)   Fail, neglect or refuse to withhold the tax from his employees or
remit such withholding to the Commissioner;

accordance with Ohio R.C. 718.12(B).
   (c)   The failure of any employer or person to receive or procure a return,
declaration or other required form shall not excuse him from making any
information return, return or declaration, from filing such form or from paying
the tax.
(Ord. 104-2015.  Passed 11-17-15.)
890.99  PENALTY.
   (a)   Whoever violates any of the provisions of this chapter, for which no
penalty is otherwise provided, is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree,
which is a fine of not more than five hundred dollars ($500) or imprisonment of
not more than sixty (60) days, or both.
   (b)   Whoever violates Section

891.014 STATEMENT OF PROCEDURAL HISTORY; STATE MANDATED CHANGES TO MUNICIPAL

   (A)   Significant and wide-ranging amendments to ORC 718 were enacted by Am
Sub HB 5, passed by the 130th General Assembly, and signed by Governor Kasich
on December 19, 2014, and H.B. 5 required municipal corporations to conform to
and adopt the provisions of ORC 718 in order to have the authority to impose,
enforce, administer and collect a municipal income tax.
   (B)   As mandated by H.B. 5, municipal income tax Ordinance 104-2015,
effective January 1, 2016, amends Chapter
890 and adopts Chapter
891 in accordance with the provisions of ORC 718 to allow the Municipality to
continue the income tax and withholding tax administration and collection
efforts on behalf of the Municipality.
(Ord. 104-2015.  Passed 11-17-15.)
891.02  EFFECTIVE DATE.

resolutions existed before January 1, 2016.
(Ord. 104-2015.  Passed 11-17-15.)
891.03  DEFINITIONS.
   Any term used in this chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter
has the same meaning as when used in a comparable context in laws of the United
States relating to federal income taxation or in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised
Code, unless a different meaning is clearly required. If a term used in this
chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a comparable
context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax
and in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised Code and the use is not consistent, then
the use of the term in the laws of the United States relating to federal income
tax shall control over the use of the term in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised
Code.
   For purposes of this Section, the singular shall include the plural, and the
masculine shall include the feminine and the gender-neutral.
   As used in this chapter:
   (1)   "ADJUSTED FEDERAL TAXABLE INCOME," for a person required to file as a
C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation
under division 23(D) of this section, means a C corporation's federal taxable
income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined under
the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
      (A)   Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal taxable
income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the intangible
income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
      (B)   Add an amount equal to five per cent of intangible income deducted
under division (1)(A) of this section, but excluding that portion of intangible
income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property
described in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code;
      (C)   Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal
taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other
disposition of an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code;
      (D)   (i)   Except as provided in division (1)(D)(ii) of this section,
deduct income and gain included in federal taxable income to the extent the
income and gain directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of
an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code;
         (ii)   Division (1)(D)(i) of this section does not apply to the extent
the income or gain is income or gain described in section 1245 or 1250 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (E)   Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction in
the computation of federal taxable income;
      (F)   In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated
investment company, add all amounts with respect to dividends to, distributions
to, or amounts set aside for or credited to the benefit of investors and
allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal taxable income;
      (G)   Deduct, to the extent not otherwise deducted or excluded in
computing federal taxable income, any income derived from a transfer agreement
or from the enterprise transferred under that agreement under section 4313.02
of the Ohio Revised Code;
      (H)   (i)   Except as limited by divisions (1)(H)(ii), (iii) and (iv) of
this section, deduct any net operating loss incurred by the person in a taxable
year beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
The amount of such net operating loss shall be deducted from net profit that is
reduced by exempt income to the extent necessary to reduce municipal taxable
income to zero, with any remaining unused portion of the net operating loss
carried forward to not more than five consecutive taxable years following the
taxable year in which the loss was incurred, but in no case for more years than
necessary for the deduction to be fully utilized.
         (ii)   No person shall use the deduction allowed by division (1)(H) of
this section to offset qualifying wages.
         (iii)   (a)   For taxable years beginning in 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021,
or 2022, a person may not deduct, for purposes of an income tax levied by a
municipal corporation that levies an income tax before January 1, 2016, more
than fifty per cent of the amount of the deduction otherwise allowed by
division (1)(H)(i)  of this section.
            (b)   For taxable years beginning in 2023 or thereafter, a person
may deduct, for purposes of an income tax levied by a municipal corporation
that levies an income tax before January 1, 2016, the full amount allowed by
division (1)(H)(i)  of this section.
         (iv)   Any pre-2017 net operating loss carryforward deduction that is
available must be utilized before a taxpayer may deduct any amount pursuant to
division (1)(H) of this section.
         (v)   Nothing in division (1)(H)(iii)(a) of this section precludes a
person from carrying forward, for use with respect to any return filed for a
taxable year beginning after 2018, any amount of net operating loss that was
not fully utilized by operation of division (1)(H)(iii)(a) of this section.  To
the extent that an amount of net operating loss that was not fully utilized in
one or more taxable years by operation of division (1)(H)(iii)(a) of this
section is carried forward for use with respect to a return filed for a taxable
year beginning in 2019, 2020, 2021, or 2022, the limitation described in
division (1)(H)(iii)(a) of this section shall apply to the amount carried
forward.
      (I)   Deduct any net profit of a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that net profit in
the group's federal taxable income in accordance with division (E)(3)(b) of
Section
891.063 of this Chapter.
      (J)   Add any loss incurred by a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that loss in the
group's federal taxable income in accordance with division (E)(3)(b) of Section
891.063 of this Chapter.
If the taxpayer is not a C corporation, is not a disregarded entity that has
made the election described in division (47)(B) of this section, is not a
publicly traded partnership that has made the election described in division
(23)(D) of this section, and is not an individual, the taxpayer shall compute
adjusted federal taxable income under this section as if the taxpayer were a C
corporation, except guaranteed payments and other similar amounts paid or
accrued to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member,
or former member shall not be allowed as a deductible expense unless such
payments are in consideration for the use of capital and treated as payment of
interest under section 469 of the Internal Revenue Code or United States
treasury regulations. Amounts paid or accrued to a qualified self-employed
retirement plan with respect to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former
shareholder, member, or former member of the taxpayer, amounts paid or accrued
to or for health insurance for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former
shareholder, member, or former member, and amounts paid or accrued to or for
life insurance for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder,
member, or former member shall not be allowed as a deduction.
Nothing in division (1) of this section shall be construed as allowing the
taxpayer to add or deduct any amount more than once or shall be construed as
allowing any taxpayer to deduct any amount paid to or accrued for purposes of
federal self-employment tax.
   (2)   (A)   "ASSESSMENT" means any of the following:
         (i)   A written finding by the Tax Administrator that a person has
underpaid municipal income tax, or owes penalty and interest, or any
combination of tax, penalty, or interest, to the municipal corporation;

Municipality multiplied by the applicable rate of the Municipality's income
tax, except for qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under
Section

         (b)   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the municipal corporation in the preceding calendar year exceeded two
thousand three hundred ninety-nine dollars, or if the total amount of taxes
deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf of the
Municipality in any month of the preceding calendar quarter exceeded two

   (C)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and file
a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or other
payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator.  A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the

other payer, unless the Municipality requires all resident individual taxpayers
to file a tax return under Section
891.091 of this Chapter.

successor entity.
   (E)   (1)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required  under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to
remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability
for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other
payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (F)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (G)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall

other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (J)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax on
tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (K)   A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this Chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the

shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other

of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent

employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer

for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
891.03 of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for

refinery located in a municipal corporation that imposes a tax on income, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on the qualifying
wages of such a person if the person performs those services on twelve or fewer

days and the person is not liable to that other municipal corporation for tax
on the compensation paid for such services. For the purposes of this division,

3772.01 of the Ohio Revised Code, respectively, or a lottery sales agent
conducting video lottery terminals sales on behalf of the state to withhold and
remit municipal income tax with respect to amounts other than qualifying wages
as provided in this section.
   (B)   If a person's winnings at a casino facility are an amount for which
reporting to the internal revenue service of the amount is required by section
6041 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the casino operator shall deduct
and withhold municipal income tax from the person's winnings at the rate of the
tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the casino facility is
located.
   (C)   Amounts deducted and withheld by a casino operator are held in trust
for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is owed.
      (1)   On or before the tenth day of each month, the casino operator shall
file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of the Municipality,
providing the name, address, and social security number of the person from
whose winnings amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount of each such
deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the amount of
the winnings from which each such amount was withheld, the type of casino
gaming that resulted in such winnings, and any other information required by
the Tax Administrator.  With this return, the casino operator shall remit
electronically to the Municipality all amounts deducted and withheld during the
preceding month.
      (2)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a casino
operator shall file an annual return electronically with the Tax Administrator
of the municipal corporation in which the casino facility is located,
indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar
year.  The casino operator shall remit electronically with the annual return
any amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not previously
remitted.  If the name, address, or social security number of a person or the
amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was omitted on a
monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall be indicated
on the annual return.
      (3)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a casino
operator shall issue an information return to each person with respect to whom
an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar year. 
The information return shall show the total amount of municipal income tax
deducted from the person's winnings during the preceding year.  The casino
operator shall provide to the Tax Administrator a copy of each information
return issued under this division.  The administrator may require that such
copies be transmitted electronically.
      (4)   A casino operator that fails to file a return and remit the amounts
deducted and withheld shall be personally liable for the amount withheld and
not remitted.  Such personal liability extends to any penalty and interest
imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax deducted and
withheld.
      (5)   If a casino operator sells the casino facility or otherwise quits
the casino business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties
and interest thereon are immediately due and payable.  The successor shall
withhold an amount of the purchase money that is sufficient to cover the
amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and interest thereon
until the predecessor casino operator produces either of the following:
         (a)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         (b)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is personally
liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and
interest thereon.
      (6)   The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (D)   If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the internal revenue service is required by section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall
deduct and withhold municipal income tax from the person's prize award at the
rate of the tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the video lottery
terminal facility is located.
   (E)   Amounts deducted and withheld by a video lottery sales agent are held
in trust for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is owed.
      (1)   The video lottery sales agent shall issue to a person from whose
prize award an amount has been deducted and withheld a receipt for the amount
deducted and withheld, and shall obtain from the person receiving a prize award
the person's name, address, and social security number in order to facilitate
the preparation of returns required by this section.
      (2)   On or before the tenth day of each month, the video lottery sales
agent shall file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality providing the names, addresses, and social security numbers of the
persons from whose prize awards amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount
of each such deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the
amount of the prize award from which each such amount was withheld, and any
other information required by the Tax Administrator.  With the return, the
video lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax Administrator
all amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (3)   A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all receipts
issued under division (E) of this section and shall make those records
available to the Tax Administrator upon request.  Such records shall be
maintained in accordance with section 5747.17 of the Ohio Revised Code and any
rules adopted pursuant thereto.
      (4)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, each video
lottery terminal sales agent shall file an annual return electronically with
the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the facility is
located indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year.  The video lottery sales agent shall remit electronically with
the annual return any amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not
previously remitted.  If the name, address, or social security number of a
person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was
omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall
be indicated on the annual return.
      (5)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a video
lottery sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with
respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year.  The information return shall show the total amount of municipal
income tax deducted and withheld from the person's prize award by the video
lottery sales agent during the preceding year.  A video lottery sales agent
shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of
each information return issued under this division.  The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
      (6)   A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit
the amounts deducted and withheld is personally liable for the amount deducted
and withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty
and interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
   (F)   If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable.  The successor of the video
lottery sales agent that purchases the video lottery terminals from the agent
shall withhold an amount from the purchase money that is sufficient to cover
the amounts deducted and withheld and any penalties and interest thereon until
the predecessor video lottery sales agent operator produces either of the
following:
      (1)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
      (2)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no amounts
are due.
If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is personally
liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and
interest thereon.
   (G)   The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (H)   If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late, fails
to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to remit
amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may impose the following applicable
penalty:
      (1)   For the late remittance of, or failure to remit, tax deducted and
withheld under this section, a penalty equal to fifty per cent of the tax
deducted and withheld;
      (2)   For the failure to file, or the late filing of, a monthly or annual
return, a penalty of five hundred dollars for each return not filed or filed

   (I)   Amounts deducted and withheld on behalf of a municipal corporation
shall be allowed as a credit against payment of the tax imposed by the

amount is deducted and withheld.
   (J)   The Tax Administrator shall prescribe the forms of the receipts and
returns required under this section.

Municipality is calculated as follows:
   (A)   "Income" reduced by "Exempt Income" to the extent otherwise included
in income, multiplied by apportionment, further reduced by any "Pre-2017 Net
Operating Loss Carryforward" equals "Municipal Taxable Income".
      (1)   "Income" for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the "Net
Profit" of the taxpayer.
         (i)   "Net Profit" for a person other than an individual is defined in
Section
891.03(23).
         (ii)   "Adjusted Federal Taxable Income" is defined in Section
891.03(1) of this Chapter.

APPORTIONMENT.
   This section applies to any taxpayer engaged in a business or profession in
the Municipality unless the taxpayer is an individual who resides in the
Municipality or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company, or
telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under Chapter
5745 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (A)   Net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a

the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,

      (3)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B)   (1)   If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
         (a)   Separate accounting;
         (b)   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
Municipality;
         (d)   A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an

891.19 of this Chapter.
      (3)   A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of Section
891.19 of this Chapter.
      (4)   Nothing in division (B) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
   (C)   As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and

         (b)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability.  If
a Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)   For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal
corporation as follows:
      (1)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated.  For the
purposes of this division, a sale of property originates in a municipal

         (a)   The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         (b)   The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from

sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
         (c)   The property is shipped from a place within the municipal
corporation to purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the
taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the
solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (E)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in

accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this
division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
   (F)   (1)   Except as provided in division (F)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation

agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
      (2)   An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation.  The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section
891.081 of this Chapter.
   (G)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (11)(L) and (34)(A)(iv) of Section
891.03 of this Chapter, by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has
apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that
is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to
that municipal corporation.  In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to
its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount
other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were
the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation.
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.
   (H)   When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section

consideration of net operating losses or special deductions.  "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (A)
(1) of this section.

income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.
         (a)   The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with
the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under federal law.

Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election period in

period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (C)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation.  A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year

"a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under division (1) of
891.03 of this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
891.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation.  If the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section

the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation.  If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
891.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.

make the computations required under Section
891.062 of this Chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)   Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is

member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.

into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may

provided in this section.
   (C)   (1)   The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the Municipality or
Tax Administrator, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes
and withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:

liability for the taxable year;
         (b)   On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five per cent of the tax liability for the
taxable year;
         (c)   On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the

must be filed on the next applicable due date as outlined in (C)(1)(a) through
(d) of this section.
      (3)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section
891.091 of this Chapter.
         (a)   For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals
and  are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return

extended pursuant to division (G) of section 5747.08 of the Revised Code.
         (b)   For taxpayers who are not individuals, and are reporting and

      (4)   An amended declaration is required whenever the taxpayer's

   (D)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
891.10 of this Chapter upon the amount of underpayment for the period of

payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made.  For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least ninety
per cent of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by
annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the municipal corporation under Section
891.091 of this Chapter for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Municipality but
was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that

(Ord. 104-2015.  Passed 11-17-15.)
891.08  CREDIT FOR TAX PAID.
891.081 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO ANOTHER MUNICIPALITY.
   It is the intent of this section that a resident taxpayer, subject to tax in
more than one municipality on the same income, be granted a credit toward tax
paid in other municipalities.  Accordingly, notwithstanding any other
provisions of this chapter:
   (A)   When taxable income of a resident of the Municipality is subject to a
municipal income tax in another municipality, on the same income taxable under
this chapter, such resident shall be allowed a credit of the amount of income
tax paid on such taxable income to the other municipality equal to fifty
percent (50%) of the amount obtained by multiplying the lower of the tax rate
of such other municipality, or of this Municipality, by the taxable income
earned in or attributable to the municipality of employment or business
activity.  For the purpose of this section, taxable income includes the
distributive share of net profits of a resident partner or owner of an
unincorporated business entity.  In cases where the tax withheld or paid was in
excess of the other city's rate, the rate allowed would be the maximum
allowable by the other city.  Likewise in the event of tax withheld or paid at
less than the other city's rate, the taxable income toward the calculation of
the credit would be based on the income actually taxed.
   (B)   Perrysburg resident individuals entitled to such credit shall file a
return indicating the kind, amount and source of such income, the amount, if
any, of the personal exemption to which they are entitled, and the amount of
tax paid to such other municipality.
   (C)   No credit will be applied unless the taxpayer claims such credit on
his final return or other form prescribed by the Tax Administrator and presents
such evidence of the payment of a similar tax to another municipality as the
Tax Administrator may require.
   (D)   The Tax Administrator, or any duly authorized agent or employee, may
exchange information with the Tax Administrator or his/her authorized employee
of other taxing jurisdictions for the purpose of verifying any claim for credit
by Perrysburg residents, or for the purpose of verifying any claims for credit
for taxes paid to the City of Perrysburg by residents of such other taxing
jurisdictions and may enter into agreements for such purpose.
   (E)   No credit shall be applied for tax paid to a school district.
      (Ord. 104-2015.  Passed 11-17-15.)
891.082 REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR QUALIFYING LOSS.
   (A)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation plan
described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   (a)   Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.  If
different tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying
tax rate" is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted
average shall be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a refundable
credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a municipal
corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during the taxable
year.  The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the qualifying
loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)   (1)   For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (D)   The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
         (Ord. 104-2015.  Passed 11-17-15.)
891.083 CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.
   A Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created
under section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the Ohio Revised Code to the same extent
that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are
employed in another municipal corporation, pursuant to Section
891.081 of this Chapter.
(Ord. 104-2015.  Passed 11-17-15.)
891.084 CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.
   (A)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
891.096 of this Chapter.
   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality.  To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in Section
891.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (C)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
891.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   Nothing in this section requires a Municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation.  Section
891.081 of this Chapter regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail. 
(Ord. 104-2015.  Passed 11-17-15.)

891.091 RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (A)   (1)   An annual return with respect to the income tax levied on

individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or

      (5)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or

municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (6)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be

   (G)   (1)   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under division

         (c)   In the case of individual income tax return required to be filed
by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed by a
taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
891.092 of this Chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this
division conflicts with any provision in Section
891.092 of this Chapter, the provision in Section
891.092 of this Chapter prevails.
   (H)   (1)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the

before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period or
that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)   If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment.  For purposes of this
section, "submitted the payment" means the date which the taxpayer has
designated for the delivery of payment, which may or may  not  be the same date
as the date the payment was initiated by the taxpayer.
   (J)   The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent of
an employer, or other payer as described in Section
891.051 of this Chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation

with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person.    Authorization by the taxpayer
of another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)   The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter and of the
Municipality's Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (M)   When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.

meaning as in Section
891.052 of this chapter.
      (2)   A person may notify a tax administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (a)   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. 
The tax administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer
who has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly explains
the person's circumstances, including the location of the previous worksite
location and the last date on which the person performed services or made any
sales within the municipal corporation.  The affidavit also shall include the
following statement:  "The affiant has no plans to perform any services within
the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal corporation, or
otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation during
the taxable year.  If the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by the
municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered
a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with the municipal
corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal corporation's
resolutions, ordinances, or rules."  The person shall sign the affidavit under
penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2) of
this section, the tax administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the tax administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year.  It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with
the provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of
municipal taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an
affidavit has been filed with the tax administrator for the taxable year. 
Nothing in division (N) of this section prohibits the tax administrator from
performing an audit of the person.

tax administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,

the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension of
that date.

filing state income tax returns under division (G) of section 5747.08 of the

overpayment is ten dollars or less.
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return.  Except as
provided under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the

also filed within the time prescribed in Section
891.096 of this Chapter.  Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund

documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing.  Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and / or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment.  Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied.  The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
891.18 of this Chapter.

any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund.  For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return.  Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in

any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter.  Upon written request by
the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal

years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction

Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
891.10 of this Chapter.

section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with

disclose such information except in accordance with a proper judicial order or
in connection with the performance of that person's official duties or the
official business of the Municipality as authorized by ORC 718 or the charter
or ordinance authorizing the levy.  The Tax Administrator of the Municipality
or a designee thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received
under this chapter and other related tax information to the Internal Revenue
Service, the State Tax Commissioner, and Tax Administrators of other municipal
corporations.
   (B)   This section does not prohibit the Municipality from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.

   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by municipal corporation ordinance or
state law to be filed with  the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,

(Ord. 104-2015.  Passed 11-17-15.)
891.16  OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   (A)   An "opinion of the Tax Administrator" means an opinion issued under
this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability.  It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (B)   A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed.  The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an "opinion of the Tax Administrator" and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (C), (G), and (H) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)   The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in
accordance with this Chapter.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax Administrator
and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."
   (C)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)   The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax Administrator
sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested.  The
effective date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or one
year after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)   The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the Municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)   The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the Municipality's income tax ordinance;
      (4)   If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)   The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)   The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (D)   (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of Section
891.15 of this Chapter.
   (E)   If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section, the
opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)   The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to change
for any of the reasons stated in division (C) of this section;
      (2)   It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (F)   A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (G)   This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)   An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)   A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential.  In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under subsection (F) may not be appealed.
(Ord. 104-2015.  Passed 11-17-15.)
891.17  ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)   The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service.  The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)   (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division.  A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail.  For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address.  For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person.  Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
         (Ord. 104-2015.  Passed 11-17-15.)
891.18  LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (A)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio Revised Code
Chapter 718.
      (2)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members.  The
three members of the Local Board of Tax Review must be domiciled in the
Municipality.  Two members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of
the Municipality, and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors
with the Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years
immediately preceding the date of appointment.  One member shall be appointed
by the top administrative official of the Municipality.  This member may be an
employee of the Municipality, but may not be the director of finance or
equivalent officer, or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an
employee directly involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate
thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years.  There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority.  The board member appointed by the
top administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion
of the administrative official.
      (4)   Members of the board of tax review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Section
718.11(A)(4) of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (5)   A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created. 
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term.  No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place.  This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)   No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the board.
   (B)   Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)   Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the assessment
to the board by filing a request with the board.  The request shall be in
writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing.  If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative.  The board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties.  In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)   The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment.  The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination.  The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's
final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions.  The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review.  Such records are not public records
available for inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code.  For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator.  No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing.  Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code.  For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing.
(Ord. 104-2015.  Passed 11-17-15.)
891.19  ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            (i)   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension.  Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the
time limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
891.18 of this Chapter.  That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five per cent or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)   A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought within
the time limitation provided in Section
891.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal.  The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
891.18 of this Chapter, of the Ohio board of tax appeals, or any court to which
the decision of the Ohio board of tax appeals has been appealed, so that the
amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than
the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's
assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as
provided by Section
891.096 of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division
(D) of this section.
   (E)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 104-2015.  Passed 11-17-15.)
891.20  ADOPTION OF RULES.
   (A)   Pursuant to Section 718.30 of the Revised Code, the Municipality,
pursuant to this Chapter, grants authority to the Tax Administrator, to adopt
rules to administer the income tax imposed by the Municipality.
   (B)   All rules adopted under this section shall be published and posted on
the internet.
(Ord. 104-2015.  Passed 11-17-15.)
891.30  LANDLORD REPORTING.
   On or before the end of the month following the end of each calendar
quarter, all property owners of rental or leased residential, commercial,
industrial or other rental property who rent to tenants, shall file with the
Tax Administrator a report showing the names, addresses, telephone numbers and,
if known, places of employment of each such tenant who occupies residential,
commercial, industrial or other rental premises within the corporation limits
of the Municipality.  For tenants who have vacated a rental or leased
residential, commercial, industrial or other rental property located within the
Municipality, the report shall also include the date of vacating from the
rental or leased residential, commercial, industrial or other rental property
and identifying such vacating tenant and, if known, the forwarding address.
(Ord. 104-2015.  Passed 11-17-15.)

   Beginning with tax year 2007, each employer filing an annual withholding
reconciliation with more than 25 employees is required to submit W-2 forms
electronically to the Tax Administrator in the same format thereon as provided

(Ord. 104-2015.  Passed 11-17-15.)
891.80  FILING NET PROFIT TAXES; ELECTION TO BE SUBJECT TO  PROVISIONS OF
CHAPTER.
   (A)    A taxpayer may elect to be subject to sections
 891.80 to
891.95 of the Codified Ordinances in lieu of the provisions set forth in the
remainder of this chapter. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter,
upon the taxpayer's election, both of the following shall apply:
      (1)    The state tax commissioner shall serve as the sole administrator
of the municipal net profit tax for which the taxpayer as defined in
891.81(C) of the Codified Ordinances is liable for the term of the election;
      (2)    The commissioner shall administer the tax pursuant to sections
718.80 to 718.95 of the Revised Code, sections
891.80 to
891.95 of the Codified Ordinances, and any applicable provision of Chapter 5703
of the Revised Code.
   (B)   (1)    A taxpayer shall make the initial election on or before the
first day of the third month after the beginning of the taxpayer's taxable year
by notifying the tax commissioner and the Municipality, on a form prescribed by

      (2)   (a)    The election, once made by the taxpayer, applies to the
taxable year in which the election is made and to each subsequent taxable year

termination of the election.
         (b)    A notification of termination shall be made, on a form
prescribed by the tax commissioner, on or before the first day of the third
month of any taxable year.
         (c)    Upon a timely and valid termination of the election, the
taxpayer is no longer subject to sections
891.80 to
891.95 of the Codified Ordinances, and is instead subject to the provisions set
forth in the remainder of this chapter.
   (C)    The tax commissioner shall enforce and administer sections
891.80 to
891.95 of the Codified Ordinances. In addition to any other powers conferred
upon the tax commissioner by law, the tax commissioner may:
      (1)    Prescribe all forms necessary to administer those sections;
      (2)    Adopt such rules as the tax commissioner finds necessary to carry
out those sections;
      (3)    Appoint and employ such personnel as are necessary to carry out
the duties imposed upon the tax commissioner by those sections.
   (D)    The tax commissioner shall not be considered a tax administrator, as
that term is defined in section 718.01 of the Revised Code and Section
891.03 of the Municipality Codified Ordinances.  (Ord. 111-2018.  Passed 9-18-
18.)
891.81  DEFINITIONS.
   If a term used in sections
891.80 to
 891.95 of the Codified Ordinances that is not otherwise defined in this
chapter is used in a comparable context in both the laws of the United States
relating to federal income tax and in Title LVII of the Revised Code and the
use is not consistent, then the use of the term in the laws of the United
States relating to federal income tax shall have control over the use of the
term in Title LVII of the Revised Code, unless the term is defined in Chapter
5703. of the Revised Code, in which case the definition in that chapter shall
control. Any reference in this chapter to the Internal Revenue Code includes
other laws of the United States related to federal income taxes. If a term is
defined in both this section and section
891.03 of the Codified Ordinances, the definition in this section shall control
for all uses of that term in sections
 891.80 to
891.95 of the Codified Ordinances.
   As used in sections
 891.80 to
891.95 of the Codified Ordinances only:
   (A)    "Municipal taxable income" means income apportioned or sitused to the
municipal corporation under section
 891.82 of the Codified Ordinances, as applicable, reduced by any pre-2017 net
operating loss carryforward available to the person for the municipal
corporation.
   (B)    "Adjusted federal taxable income," for a person required to file as a
C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation
as described in division (D)(5) of section 718.01 of the Revised Code and
section
 891.03 of the Codified Ordinances, means a C corporation's federal taxable
income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined under
the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
      (1)    Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal taxable
income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the intangible
income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
      (2)    Add an amount equal to five per cent of intangible income deducted
under division (B)(1) of this section, but excluding that portion of intangible
income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property
described in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of
federal taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or
other disposition of an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code.
      (4)   (a)    Except as provided in division (B)(4)(b) of this section,
deduct income and gain included in federal taxable income to the extent the
income and gain directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of
an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code.
         (b)    Division (B)(4)(a) of this section does not apply to the extent
the income or gain is income or gain described in section 1245 or 1250 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (5)    Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction in
the computation of federal taxable income.
      (6)    In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated
investment company, add all amounts with respect to dividends to, distributions
to, or amounts set aside for or credited to the benefit of investors and
allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal taxable income.
      (7)    Deduct, to the extent not otherwise deducted or excluded in
computing federal taxable income, any income derived from a transfer agreement
or from the enterprise transferred under that agreement under section 4313.02
of the Revised Code.
      (8)    Deduct exempt income to the extent not otherwise deducted or
excluded in computing adjusted federal taxable income.
      (9)    Deduct any net profit of a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that net profit in
the group's federal taxable income in accordance with division (E)(3)(b) of
section
 891.86 of the Codified Ordinances.
      (10)    Add any loss incurred by a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that loss in the
group's federal taxable income in accordance with division (E)(3)(b) of section
891.86 of the Codified Ordinances.
If the taxpayer is not a C corporation, is not a disregarded entity that has
made the election described in division (47)(B) of section
891.03 of the Codified Ordinances, and is not a publicly traded partnership
that has made the election described in division (23)(D) of section
891.03 of the Codified Ordinances, the taxpayer shall compute adjusted federal
taxable income under this section as if the taxpayer were a C corporation,
except guaranteed payments and other similar amounts paid or accrued to a
partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former
member shall not be allowed as a deductible expense unless such payments are in
consideration for the use of capital and treated as payment of interest under
section 469 of the Internal Revenue Code or United States treasury regulations.
Amounts paid or accrued to a qualified self-employed retirement plan with
respect to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member,
or former member of the taxpayer, amounts paid or accrued to or for health
insurance for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder,
member, or former member, and amounts paid or accrued to or for life insurance
for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or
former member shall not be allowed as a deduction.
Nothing in division (B) of this section shall be construed as allowing the
taxpayer to add or deduct any amount more than once or shall be construed as
allowing any taxpayer to deduct any amount paid to or accrued for purposes of
federal self-employment tax.
   (C)    "Taxpayer" has the same meaning as in section
891.03(47) of the Codified Ordinances, except that "taxpayer" does not include
natural persons or entities subject to the tax imposed under Chapter 5745. of
the Revised Code. "Taxpayer" may include receivers, assignees, or trustees in
bankruptcy when such persons are required to assume the role of a taxpayer.
   (D)    "Tax return" or "return" means the notifications and reports required
to be filed pursuant to sections
 891.80 to
891.95 of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of reporting municipal income
taxes, and includes declarations of estimated tax.
   (E)   "Taxable year" means the calendar year or the taxpayer's fiscal year
ending during the calendar year, or fractional part thereof, upon which the
calculation of the taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income is based pursuant
to this chapter. If a taxpayer's taxable year is changed for federal income tax
purposes, the taxable year for purposes of sections
 891.80 to
891.95 of the Codified Ordinances is changed accordingly but may consist of an
aggregation of more than one taxable year for federal income tax purposes. The
tax commissioner may prescribe by rule an appropriate period as the taxable
year for a taxpayer that has had a change of its taxable year for federal
income tax purposes, for a taxpayer that has two or more short taxable years
for federal income tax purposes as the result of a change of ownership, or for
a new taxpayer that would otherwise have no taxable year.
   (F)    "Assessment" means a notice of underpayment or nonpayment of a tax
issued pursuant to section
891.90 of the Codified Ordinances.
      (Ord. 111-2018.  Passed 9-18-18.)
891.82  APPLICABILITY; TAXABLE SITUS; APPORTIONMENT.
   This section applies to any taxpayer that is engaged in a business or
profession in the Municipality and that has made the election under section
 891.80 of the Codified Ordinances.
   (A)    Except as otherwise provided in division (B) of this section, net
profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a taxable situs in
the Municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same
proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)    The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,
wherever the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from
which taxes are not required to be withheld under section
 891.052 of the Codified Ordinances;
      (3)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B)   (1)    If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the tax commissioner may
require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion of the
income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving one or
more of the following:
         (a)    Separate accounting;
         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
         (d)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)    A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the tax commissioner denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of section
 891.90 of the Codified Ordinances.
      (3)    The tax commissioner may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of section
891.90 of the Codified Ordinances.
   (C)    As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)    A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         (a)    The employer;
         (b)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)    Any other location, if the tax commissioner determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If
the tax commissioner makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the tax
commissioner's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)    For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to the
Municipality as follows:
      (1)    Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall
be sitused to the Municipality only if, regardless of where title passes, the
property meets either of the following criteria:
         (a)    The property is shipped to or delivered within the Municipality
from a stock of goods located within the Municipality.
         (b)    The property is delivered within the Municipality from a
location outside the Municipality, provided the taxpayer is regularly engaged
through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the
Municipality and the sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
      (2)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
Municipality to the extent that such services are performed in the
Municipality.
      (3)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the Municipality shall be sitused to the Municipality.
      (4)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the Municipality shall be sitused to
the Municipality.
      (5)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the Municipality based upon the extent to which
the tangible personal property is used in the Municipality.
   (E)    Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the
sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the Municipality in
which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate agent
or broker shall be allocated to the Municipality based upon the ratio of the
commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase, or lease of
real estate located in the Municipality to the commissions received from the
sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the taxable year.
   (F)    If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (11)(L) and (34)(1)(iv) of section 891.03 of the
Codified Ordinances by the Municipality or substantially similar provision of
the codified ordinances of another municipal corporation, the taxpayer shall
add the amount that is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that
was apportioned to the Municipality. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to
add to its net profit that was apportioned to the Municipality any amount other
than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were the
amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation.
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to the Municipality
under this section.
   (G)    When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.

 891.80 of the Codified Ordinances. The tax administrator shall review these
returns and information, as well as the information received pursuant to
divisions (B) and (C) of this section, and has discretion to refer any taxpayer

prescribed by the commissioner and shall include any information that forms the
basis for the referral.
      (2)    If the tax commissioner declines to audit a taxpayer referred by
the tax administrator under this section, the Municipality reserves its right
to pursue any and all remedies, whether at law or in equity, to ensure that the
correct tax liability has been calculated and paid by the taxpayer.
         (Ord. 111-2018.  Passed 9-18-18.)
891.84  FILING OF ANNUAL RETURN; REMITTANCE; DISPOSITION OF FUNDS.
   (A)   (1)    For each taxable year, every taxpayer shall file an annual

on a form and in the manner prescribed by the commissioner, on or before the
fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end of the taxpayer's taxable

      (2)    If a taxpayer has multiple taxable years ending within one
calendar year, the taxpayer shall aggregate the facts and figures necessary to

         (b)    A taxpayer that files an annual tax return electronically
through the Ohio business gateway or in another manner as prescribed by the tax
commissioner shall either submit the documents required under this division
electronically as prescribed at the time of filing or, if electronic submission

taxation shall publish a method of electronically submitting the documents
required under this division on or before January 1, 2019.
      (3)    After a taxpayer files a tax return, the tax commissioner may

extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of a tax return with the
commissioner under this section. The extended due date of the return shall be
the fifteenth day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates.
         (b)    A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that
the commissioner grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for
filing the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the commissioner receives
the request on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due, the
commissioner shall grant the taxpayer's extension request.
         (c)    An extension of time to file under division (D)(1) of this
section is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the tax
commissioner grants an extension of that date.
      (2)    If the commissioner considers it necessary in order to ensure
payment of a tax imposed in accordance with section
891.01 of the Codified Ordinances, the commissioner may require taxpayers to
file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided in this section,
including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual returns.
   (E)    Each return required to be filed in accordance with this section
shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize another person,

the tax commissioner about matters pertaining to the return. The return or
instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by checking the box
the taxpayer authorizes the commissioner to contact the preparer or other
person concerning questions that arise during the examination or other review
of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only to provide the
commissioner with information that is missing from the return, to contact the
commissioner for information about the examination or other review of the
return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or payments, and to respond to
notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or return preparation that the
taxpayer has received from the commissioner and has shown to the preparer or

tax return preparer, the tax commissioner shall accept a facsimile or
electronic version of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
(Ord. 111-2018.  Passed 9-18-18.)
891.85  ELECTRONIC FILING.
   (A)    All taxpayers that have made the election allowed under section
891.80 of the Codified Ordinances shall file any tax return or extension for
filing a tax return, and shall make payment of amounts shown to be due on such

manner as prescribed by the tax commissioner.
   (B)    A taxpayer may apply to the commissioner, on a form prescribed by the

891.86  CONSOLIDATED RETURNS.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)    "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (A)
(1) of this section.
      (4)    "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
section 4927.01 of the Revised Code.
      (5)    "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
section 5727.01 of the Revised Code.
   (B)   (1)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of
corporations may elect to file a consolidated tax return for a taxable year if
at least one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to
municipal income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of
corporations filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to
that taxable year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning
with the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the
reporting method is required under federal law. The election continues to be
binding for each subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to
discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under division (B)(2) of this
section or a taxpayer receives permission from the tax commissioner. The tax
commissioner shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under
this section must be made on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of
the year following the last year of a five-year consolidated tax return
election period in effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election
to discontinue filing a consolidated tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)    An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)    When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under section
891.80 of the Codified Ordinances, a valid election made by the taxpayer under
division (B)(1) or (2) of section
891.063 of the Codified Ordinances is binding upon the tax commissioner for the
remainder of the five-year period.
      (5)    When an election made under section
891.80 of the Codified Ordinances is terminated, a valid election made under
this section is binding upon the tax administrator for the remainder of the
five-year period.
   (C)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated tax return for that taxable year if the tax commissioner
determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany transactions
have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a distortive
shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net profits to a
municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated tax
return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated tax return for all
subsequent taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written
permission from the commissioner to file a separate return or a taxpayer has
experienced a change in circumstances.
   (D)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated tax return in the same manner
as is required under the United States department of treasury regulations that

return required to be filed by the common parent of the affiliated group of
which the taxpayer is a member.
   (E)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated tax return shall compute
adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in section
891.81 of the Codified Ordinances, by substituting "consolidated federal
taxable income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income"
appears in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of
corporation's" for "a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in
that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall make any
adjustment otherwise required under division (B) of section
891.81 of the Codified Ordinances to the extent that the item of income or
deduction otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or
consolidated in the computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall do one of the following
with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for that taxable
year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in section
 891.82 of the Codified Ordinances, exclude the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net
profit or loss is so excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a
separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise
be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in section
891.82 of the Codified Ordinances, include the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net
profit or loss is so included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a
separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in
the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated tax return shall
exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the purposes of making
the computations required in section
 891.82 of the Codified Ordinances, exclude the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with sections
891.80 to
891.95 of the Codified Ordinances on the basis of the entity's net profits that
would otherwise be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the
affiliated group.
   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated tax return shall make the
computations required under section
891.82 of the Codified Ordinances by substituting "consolidated federal taxable
income attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from"
appears in that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations"
for "taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated tax return is jointly and
severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges, or other
amounts applicable under sections
891.80 to
891.95 of the Codified Ordinances or Chapter 5703. of the Revised Code to the
corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any
portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated
group.
(Ord. 111-2018.  Passed 9-18-18.)
891.87  FAILURE TO PAY TAX.

sections
891.80 to
891.95 of the Codified Ordinances, or any portion of that tax, on or before the
date prescribed for its payment, interest shall be assessed, collected, and
paid, in the same manner as the tax, upon such unpaid amount at the rate per
annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the date
prescribed for its payment until it is paid or until the date an assessment is
issued under section

year, on the form prescribed by the tax commissioner, if the amount payable as
estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars.
      (2)    Except as provided in division (B)(4) of this section, a taxpayer
having a taxable year of less than twelve months shall make a declaration under
rules prescribed by the commissioner.
      (3)    The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of the taxable year or on
or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the taxpayer becomes
subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)    The tax commissioner may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.
   (C)   Each taxpayer shall file the declaration of estimated taxes with, and
remit estimated taxes to, the tax commissioner at the times and in the amounts
prescribed in division (C)(1) of this section. Remitted taxes shall be made
payable to the treasurer of state.
      (1)    The required portion of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year that shall be paid through estimated taxes shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the

the taxpayer shall increase or decrease, as appropriate, its subsequent
payments in equal installments to result in a more accurate payment of
estimated taxes.
      (3)   (a)    Each taxpayer shall report on the declaration of estimated
taxes the portion of the remittance that the taxpayer estimates that it owes to
each municipal corporation for the taxable year.
         (b)    Upon receiving a payment of estimated taxes under this section,
the commissioner shall immediately forward the payment to the treasurer of
state. The treasurer shall credit the payment in the same manner as in division

period of underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as
described in division (E) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall
be determined as follows:

and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the
date prescribed for that payment;

cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently due.
      (3)    All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as
taxes collected under sections 891.80 to 891.95 of the Codified Ordinances and
shall be credited and distributed to municipal corporations in accordance with
section 718.83 of the Revised Code.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of a combined tax liability shall be
due to reasonable cause and the penalty imposed by this section shall not be
added to the taxes for the taxable year if any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety per cent of the combined tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a municipal
income tax return for that year.
         (Ord. 111-2018.  Passed 9-18-18.)
891.89  ADDITIONAL PENALTIES.
   (A)    In addition to any other penalty imposed by sections
891.80 to
891.95 of the Codified Ordinances or Chapter 5703. of the Revised Code, the
following penalties shall apply:
      (1)    If a taxpayer required to file a tax return under sections
891.80 to
 891.95 of the Codified Ordinances fails to make and file the return within the
time prescribed, including any extensions of time granted by the tax
commissioner, the commissioner may impose a penalty not exceeding twenty-five
dollars per month or fraction of a month, for each month or fraction of a month
elapsing between the due date, including extensions of the due date, and the
date on which the return is filed. The aggregate penalty, per instance, under
this division shall not exceed one hundred fifty dollars.
      (2)    If a person required to file a tax return electronically under
sections
891.80 to
891.95 of the Codified Ordinances fails to do so, the commissioner may impose a
penalty not to exceed the following:
         (a)    For each of the first two failures, five per cent of the amount
required to be reported on the return;
         (b)    For the third and any subsequent failure, ten per cent of the
amount required to be reported on the return.
      (3)    If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under section
891.80 of the Codified Ordinances fails to timely pay an amount of tax required
to be paid under this chapter, the commissioner may impose a penalty equal to
fifteen per cent of the amount not timely paid.
      (4)    If a taxpayer files what purports to be a tax return required by
sections
891.80 to
891.95 of the Codified Ordinances that does not contain information upon which
the substantial correctness of the return may be judged or contains information
that on its face indicates that the return is substantially incorrect, and the
filing of the return in that manner is due to a position that is frivolous or a
desire that is apparent from the return to delay or impede the administration
of sections
891.80 to
891.95 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty of up to five hundred dollars may
be imposed.
      (5)   If a taxpayer makes a fraudulent attempt to evade the reporting or
payment of the tax required to be shown on any return required under sections
 891.80 to
891.95 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the
greater of one thousand dollars or one hundred per cent of the tax required to
be shown on the return.
      (6)    If any person makes a false or fraudulent claim for a refund under
section
891.91 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the
greater of one thousand dollars or one hundred per cent of the claim. Any
penalty imposed under this division, any refund issued on the claim, and
interest on any refund from the date of the refund, may be assessed under
section
891.90 of the Codified Ordinances without regard to any time limitation for the
assessment imposed by division (A) of that section.
   (B)    For purposes of this section, the tax required to be shown on a tax
return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax paid on or before
the date, including any extensions of the date, prescribed for filing the
return.
   (C)    Each penalty imposed under this section shall be in addition to any
other penalty imposed under this section. All or part of any penalty imposed
under this section may be abated by the tax commissioner. The commissioner may
adopt rules governing the imposition and abatement of such penalties.
   (D)    All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as taxes
collected under sections
891.80 to
891.95 of the Codified Ordinances and shall be credited and distributed to
municipal corporations in the same proportion as the underlying tax liability
is required to be distributed to such municipal corporations under section
718.83 of the Revised Code.
(Ord. 111-2018.  Passed 9-18-18.)
891.90  ASSESSMENTS AGAINST TAXPAYER.
   (A)    If any taxpayer required to file a return under sections
 891.80 to
 891.95 of the Codified Ordinances fails to file the return within the time
prescribed, files an incorrect return, or fails to remit the full amount of the
tax due for the period covered by the return, the tax commissioner may make an
assessment against the taxpayer for any deficiency for the period for which the
return or tax is due, based upon any information in the commissioner's
possession.
   The tax commissioner shall not make or issue an assessment against a
taxpayer more than three years after the later of the date the return subject
to assessment was required to be filed or the date the return was filed. Such
time limit may be extended if both the taxpayer and the commissioner consent in
writing to the extension. Any such extension shall extend the three-year time
limit in section
891.91 of the Codified Ordinances for the same period of time. There shall be
no bar or limit to an assessment against a taxpayer that fails to file a return
subject to assessment as required by sections
891.80 to
891.95 of the Codified Ordinances, or that files a fraudulent return. The
commissioner shall give the taxpayer assessed written notice of the assessment
as provided in section 5703.37 of the Revised Code. With the notice, the
commissioner shall provide instructions on how to petition for reassessment and
request a hearing on the petition.
   (B)    Unless the taxpayer assessed files with the tax commissioner within
sixty days after service of the notice of assessment, either personally or by
certified mail, a written petition for reassessment signed by the authorized
agent of the taxpayer assessed having knowledge of the facts, the assessment
becomes final, and the amount of the assessment is due and payable from the
taxpayer to the treasurer of state. The petition shall indicate the taxpayer's
objections, but additional objections may be raised in writing if received by
the commissioner prior to the date shown on the final determination. If the
petition has been properly filed, the commissioner shall proceed under section
5703.60 of the Revised Code.
   (C)    After an assessment becomes final, if any portion of the assessment
remains unpaid, including accrued interest, a certified copy of the tax
commissioner's entry making the assessment final may be filed in the office of
the clerk of the court of common pleas in the county in which the taxpayer has
an office or place of business in this state, the county in which the
taxpayer's statutory agent is located, or Franklin county.
   Immediately upon the filing of the entry, the clerk shall enter a judgment
against the taxpayer assessed in the amount shown on the entry. The judgment
may be filed by the clerk in a loose-leaf book entitled "special judgments for
municipal income taxes," and shall have the same effect as other judgments.
Execution shall issue upon the judgment upon the request of the tax
commissioner, and all laws applicable to sales on execution shall apply to
sales made under the judgment.
   If the assessment is not paid in its entirety within sixty days after the
day the assessment was issued, the portion of the assessment consisting of tax
due shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of
the Revised Code from the day the commissioner issues the assessment until the
assessment is paid or until it is certified to the attorney general for
collection under section 131.02 of the Revised Code, whichever comes first. If
the unpaid portion of the assessment is certified to the attorney general for
collection, the entire unpaid portion of the assessment shall bear interest at
the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the
date of certification until the date it is paid in its entirety. Interest shall
be paid in the same manner as the tax and may be collected by issuing an
assessment under this section.
   (D)    All money collected under this section shall be credited to the
municipal income tax fund and distributed to the municipal corporation to which
the money is owed based on the assessment issued under this section.
   (E)    If the tax commissioner believes that collection of the tax will be
jeopardized unless proceedings to collect or secure collection of the tax are
instituted without delay, the commissioner may issue a jeopardy assessment
against the taxpayer liable for the tax. Immediately upon the issuance of the
jeopardy assessment, the commissioner shall file an entry with the clerk of the
court of common pleas in the manner prescribed by division (C) of this section.
Notice of the jeopardy assessment shall be served on the taxpayer assessed or
the taxpayer's legal representative in the manner provided in section 5703.37
of the Revised Code within five days of the filing of the entry with the clerk.
The total amount assessed is immediately due and payable, unless the taxpayer
assessed files a petition for reassessment in accordance with division (B) of
this section and provides security in a form satisfactory to the commissioner
and in an amount sufficient to satisfy the unpaid balance of the assessment.
Full or partial payment of the assessment does not prejudice the commissioner's
consideration of the petition for reassessment.
   (F)    Notwithstanding the fact that a petition for reassessment is pending,
the taxpayer may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the petition. The acceptance of a payment by the treasurer of state does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the petition.
   If upon final determination of the petition an error in the assessment is
corrected by the tax commissioner, upon petition so filed or pursuant to a
decision of the board of tax appeals or any court to which the determination or
decision has been appealed, so that the amount due from the taxpayer under the
corrected assessment is less than the portion paid, there shall be issued to
the taxpayer, its assigns, or legal representative a refund in the amount of
the overpayment as provided by section
891.91 of the Codified Ordinances, with interest on that amount as provided by
that section.  (Ord. 111-2018.  Passed 9-18-18.)
891.91  REFUND APPLICATIONS.
   (A)    An application to refund to a taxpayer the amount of taxes paid on
any illegal, erroneous, or excessive payment of tax under sections
891.80 to
891.95 of the Codified Ordinances, including assessments, shall be filed with
the tax commissioner within three years after the date of the illegal,
erroneous, or excessive payment of the tax, or within any additional period
allowed by division (A) of section
891.90 of the Codified Ordinances. The application shall be filed in the form
prescribed by the tax commissioner.
   (B)   (1)    On the filing of a refund application, the tax commissioner
shall determine the amount of refund to which the applicant is entitled. The
amount determined shall be based on the amount overpaid per return or
assessment. If the amount is greater than ten dollars and not less than that
claimed, the commissioner shall certify that amount to the director of budget
and management and the treasurer of state for payment from the tax refund fund
created in section 5703.052 of the Revised Code. If the amount is greater than
ten dollars but less than that claimed, the commissioner shall proceed in
accordance with section 5703.70 of the Revised Code.
      (2)    Upon issuance of a refund under this section, the commissioner
shall notify each municipal corporation of the amount refunded to the taxpayer
attributable to that municipal corporation, which shall be deducted from the
municipal corporation's next distribution under section 718.83 of the Revised
Code.
   (C)    Any portion of a refund determined under division (B) of this section
that is not issued within ninety days after such determination shall bear
interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised
Code from the ninety-first day after such determination until the day the
refund is paid or credited. On an illegal or erroneous assessment, interest
shall be paid at that rate from the date of payment on the illegal or erroneous
assessment until the day the refund is paid or credited.
(Ord. 111-2018.  Passed 9-18-18.)
891.92  AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)    If any of the facts, figures, computations, or attachments required
in an annual return filed by a taxpayer that has made the election allowed
under section
891.80 of the Codified Ordinances and used to determine the tax due under
sections
891.80 to
 891.95 of the Codified Ordinances must be altered as the result of an
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax return, whether initiated by
the taxpayer or the internal revenue service, and such alteration affects the
taxpayer's tax liability under those sections, the taxpayer shall file an
amended return with the tax commissioner in such form as the commissioner
requires. The amended return shall be filed not later than sixty days after the
adjustment is agreed upon or finally determined for federal income tax purposes
or after any federal income tax deficiency or refund, or the abatement or
credit resulting therefrom, has been assessed or paid, whichever occurs first.
If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal income tax
return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a consolidated
return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax return, the
taxpayer shall notify the commissioner before filing the amended return.
   (B)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. An amended return required by this section is a
return subject to assessment under section
891.90 of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of assessing any additional
tax due under this section, together with any applicable penalty and interest.
The amended return shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments from a previously filed return no longer subject to assessment that
are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal tax return.
   (C)    In the case of an overpayment, an application for refund may be filed
under this division within the sixty-day period prescribed for filing the
amended return, even if that period extends beyond the period prescribed in
section
891.91 of the Codified Ordinances, if the application otherwise conforms to the
requirements of that section. An application filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal income tax return unless it is also filed within the time
prescribed in section
891.91 of the Codified Ordinances. The application shall not reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments that are not affected, either
directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax
return.
(Ord. 111-2018.  Passed 9-18-18.)
891.93  EXAMINATION OF RECORDS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS AND PERSONS.
   (A)    The tax commissioner, or any authorized agent or employee thereof,
may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax
returns of any taxpayer or other person that is subject to sections
891.80 to
 891.95 of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of
any return made or, if no return was filed, to ascertain the tax due as
required under those sections. Upon written request by the commissioner or a
duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every taxpayer or other person
subject to this section is required to furnish the opportunity for the
commissioner, authorized agent, or employee to investigate and examine such
books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns at a
reasonable time and place designated in the request.
   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer or other person that
is subject to sections
 891.80 to
891.95 of the Codified Ordinances shall be open to the tax commissioner's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the commissioner, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The
commissioner may require any person, by notice served on that person, to keep
such records as the commissioner determines necessary to show whether or not
that person is liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax
levied by a municipal corporation.
   (C)    The tax commissioner may examine under oath any person that the
commissioner reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The commissioner may, for this purpose, compel any such person to
attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers, records, and
federal income tax returns in such person's possession or control. The person
may be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other
tax practitioner at any such hearing or examination. This division does not
authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.
   (D)    No person issued written notice by the tax commissioner compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal income tax returns under this section shall fail to comply.

credit is to be applied.
      (2)    Such documentation shall be provided in the form prescribed by the
tax commissioner.
      (3)    Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the tax
commissioner to enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to grant a credit, to
determine if a taxpayer meets the conditions of a tax credit agreement entered
into by the Municipality and taxpayer under section
891.064 or
 891.065 of the Codified Ordinances, or to modify the terms or conditions of

   (c)   “Transient Guests” means persons occupying a room or rooms for
sleeping accommodations for less than thirty (30) consecutive days.
   (d)   “Vendor” means the person who is the owner or operator of the hotel or

      (Ord. 38-2007.  Passed 3-20-07.)
896.02  IMPOSITION AND USE OF TAX.
   (a)   For the purpose of providing revenue with which to meet the needs of
the City for the use of the general fund of the City, for the advancement of
the cultural development of the community, for promotion and publicizing of the
City of Perrysburg as a desirable location for conventions, trade shows and
similar events, to encourage the patronage and business of cultural,
educational, religious, professional, sports and other organizations to utilize
the City of Perrysburg and its facilities for such events, all for the benefit
of the citizens of the City of Perrysburg, an excise tax of three percent (3%)
is hereby levied on transactions by which the lodging by a hotel or transient
accommodations is or is to be furnished to transient guests.
   (b)   For the purpose of the proper administration of this chapter and to
prevent evasion of the tax it is presumed that the lodging furnished by hotels
to transient guests is subject to the tax until the contrary is established.
   (c)   An amount equal to 50% of the revenue from the tax levied pursuant to
this chapter shall be deposited in a separate fund which shall be used solely
to make contributions to convention and visitors bureau operating within the
City.  The balance of such revenue shall be deposited in the General Fund.
   The tax imposed by this chapter shall be paid by the transient guest to the
vendor, and each vendor shall collect from the transient guest the full and
exact amount of the tax payable on each taxable lodging.
   If the transaction is claimed to be exempt, the transient guest must furnish
to the vendor, and the vendor must obtain from the transient guest, written
proof of exempt status.  If no such proof of exemption is obtained it shall be
presumed the tax applies.
(Ord. 38-2007.  Passed 3-20-07.)
896.03  RESERVED.
   EDITOR’S NOTE:  This section is reserved for future legislation.
896.04  TAX PAID TRANSIENT GUEST; FALSE EVIDENCE OF TAX EXEMPT STATUS.
   No transient guest shall refuse to pay the full and exact tax as required by
this chapter or present to the vendor false evidence indicating that the
lodging as furnished is not subject to the tax. 
(Ord. 38-2007.  Passed 3-20-07.)
 
896.05  REQUIRED RECORDS; INSPECTION AND DESTRUCTION.
   Each vendor shall keep complete and accurate records of lodging furnished,
together with a record of the tax collected thereon, which shall be the amount
due under this chapter, and shall keep all invoices and such other pertinent
documents.  If the vendor furnishes lodging not subject to the tax, the
vendor’s records shall show the identity of the transient guest, if the sale
was exempted by reason of such identity, or the nature of the transaction if
exempted by any other reason.  Such records and other documents shall be open
during business hours to the inspection of the Director of Finance of the City
of Perrysburg, and shall be preserved for a period of four (4) years, unless
the Director of Finance, in writing, consents to their destruction within that
period, or by order requires that they be kept longer.
(Ord. 38-2007.  Passed 3-20-07.)
896.06  RETURNS REQUIRED.
   (a)   Each vendor shall on or before the twentieth (20th) day of each month
make and file a return for the preceding month, on forms prescribed by the
Director of Finance, showing the receipts from lodging furnished, the amount of
tax due from the vendor to the City for the period covered by the return and
such other information as the Director of Finance deems necessary for the
proper administration of the excise tax.  The return shall be signed by the
vendor or an authorized agent thereof.  Returns shall be filed by mailing same
to the division of income tax, together with payment to the City Treasurer in
the amount of tax shown to be due thereon.  Failure to timely file and pay
shall result in the assessment of a penalty as set forth in Section
896.08.
   (b)   The Director of Finance may extend the time for making and filing
returns.  Additionally, the Director of Finance, if it is deemed necessary in
order to ensure the payment of the tax imposed by this chapter, may require
returns and payment to be made for other than monthly periods.
   (c)   The Director of Finance may authorize vendors whose tax liability is
not such as to merit monthly returns as determined by the Director of Finance,
upon the basis of administrative costs to the City, to make and file returns at
less frequent intervals.  Such authorization shall be in writing and shall
indicate the intervals at which returns are to be filed.
   (d)   All returns shall bear the mark of the date received and shall also
reflect the amount of payment received therewith.
(Ord. 38-2007.  Passed 3-20-07.)
896.07  LIABILITY.
   (a)   The vendor or authorized agent having control of or charged with the
responsibility of making and filing the return and making payment is personally
liable for failure to file the return or pay the tax due as required by this
chapter.
   (b)   If any vendor corporation required to file returns and to remit tax
due to the City under the provisions of this chapter, fails for any reason to
make such filing or payment, any of its officers or employees having control or
supervision of or charged with the responsibility of filing returns and making
payments, shall be personally liable for such failure.  The dissolution of a
corporation shall not discharge an officer’s or employee’s liability for a
prior failure of the corporation to file returns or remit the tax due.  The sum
due for such liability may be collected by assessment in the manner provided in
this chapter.
   (c)   If the vendor fails to collect the tax or any transient guest fails to
pay the tax imposed by or pursuant to this chapter on any transaction subject
to the tax, such vendor or transient guest shall be personally liable for the
amount of the tax applicable to the transaction.  The Director of Finance may
make an assessment against either the vendor or transient guest, as the facts
may require, based upon any information in his possession.
   (d)   An assessment against a vendor in cases where the tax imposed by or
pursuant to this chapter has not been collected or paid, shall not discharge
the transient guest’s liability to reimburse the vendor for the tax applicable
to such transaction.
   (e)   In each case, the Director of Finance shall give to the vendor or
transient guest assessed written notice of such assessment.  Such notice may be
served upon the vendor or transient guest assessed personally or by registered
or certified mail.  As assessment issued against either, pursuant to the
provisions of this chapter, shall not be considered an election of remedies, or
a bar to an assessment against the other for the tax applicable to the same
transaction, provided that no assessment shall be issued against any vendor or
transient guest for the tax due on a particular transaction if said tax has
actually been paid by another.
(Ord. 38-2007.  Passed 3-20-07.)
896.08  ASSESSMENT OF TAX AND PETITION FOR REASSESSMENT OF TAX.
   (a)   The Director of Finance may make an assessment of the tax against any
vendor who fails to file a return required by this chapter or fails to remit
the proper amount of tax in accordance with this chapter.  When information in
possession of the Director of Finance indicates that the amount required to be
collected is or should be, greater than the amount remitted by the vendor, the
Director of Finance may upon the basis of test checks of a vendor’s business
for a representative period which are hereby authorized, determine the ratio
which the tax required to be collected under this chapter bears to the hotel’s
or transient accommodation’s lodging which determination shall be the basis of
an assessment as herein provided in this chapter.  Notice of such assessment of
tax shall be made in the manner prescribed in this chapter.
   (b)   Unless the vendor or transient guest, to whom said notice of
assessment of tax is directed, files within thirty (30) days after service
thereof, either personally or by registered or certified mail a petition in
writing, verified under oath by said vendor, transient guest, or his authorized
agent, having knowledge of the facts, setting forth in particularity the terms
of said tax assessment objected to, together with the reasons for such
objections, said assessment shall become conclusive and the amount thereof
shall be due and payable, from the vendor or transient guest so assessed, to
the City of Perrysburg, Ohio.  When a petition for reassessment of tax is
filed, the Director of Finance shall assign a time and place for the hearing of
same and shall notify the petitioner thereof by registered or certified mail,
but the Director of Finance may continue the hearings from time to time if
necessary.
   (c)   A penalty of fifteen percent (15%) shall be added to the amount of
every assessment of tax made under this chapter.  The Director of Finance may
adopt and promulgate rules and regulations providing for the remission of
penalties added to such tax assessments made under this chapter.
   (d)   When any vendor or transient guest files a petition for reassessment
of tax as provided in this chapter, the tax assessment made by the Director of
Finance, together with penalties thereon, shall become due and payable within
three (3) days after notice of the finding made at the hearing has been served,
either personally or by certified mail, upon the party assessed.  (Ord. 38-
2007.  Passed 3-20-07.)
896.09  FOUR YEAR LIMITATION FOR ASSESSMENT OF TAX; EXCEPTIONS.
   No assessment shall be made or issued against a vendor or transient guest
for any tax imposed by or pursuant this chapter more than four (4) years after
the return date for the period in which the lodging was furnished, or more than
four (4) years after the return for such a period is filed, whichever is
later.  This section does not bar an assessment:
   (a)   When the Director of Finance has substantial evidence of amounts of
taxes collected by a vendor from transient guests’ lodging which were not
returned to the City.
   (b)   When the vendor assessed failed to file a return as required.
      (Ord. 38-2007.  Passed 3-20-07.)
896.10  REFUND OF ERRONEOUS PAYMENTS.
   The City shall refund to a vendor the amount of tax erroneously paid where
the vendor has not been reimbursed from the transient guest.  When such
erroneous payment or tax assessment was not paid to a vendor, but was paid by
the transient guest directly to the City Treasurer or its agent, it shall be
refunded to the transient guest.  Applications for refund shall be filed with
Director of Finance, on the form so prescribed, within ninety (90) days from
the date it is ascertained that the assessment or payment was erroneous;
provided, however, that in any event such applications for refund must be filed
with the Director of Finance within four (4) years from the date of the
erroneous payment of the tax.  On filing of such application, the Director of
Finance shall determine the amount of refund due to certify such amount.
(Ord. 38-2007.  Passed 3-20-07.)
896.11  REQUIRED RECORDS; INSPECTION AND DESTRUCTION.
   Each vendor shall keep complete and accurate records of lodging furnished,
together with a record of the tax collected thereon, which shall be the amount
due under this chapter, and shall keep all invoices and such other pertinent
documents.  If the vendor furnishes lodging not subject to the tax, the
vendor’s records shall show the identity of the transient guest, if the sale
was exempted by reason of such identity, or the nature of the transaction if
excused for any other reason.  Such records and other documents shall be open
during business hours to the inspection of the Director of Finance of the City
of Perrysburg, and shall be preserved for a period of four (4) years, unless
the Director of Finance, in writing, consents to their destruction within that
period, or by order requires that they be kept longer.

accept waiver of State statutes of limitations.

896.13  VENDOR TO COLLECT TAX; PROHIBITION AGAINST REBATES.
   No vendor shall fail to collect the full and exact tax as required by this
chapter.  No vendor shall refund or rebate to a transient guest, either
directly or indirectly, any of the tax levied pursuant to this chapter, or make
in any form of advertising, verbal or otherwise, any statements which might
imply that he is absorbing the tax, or paying the tax for the transient guest
by an adjustment of prices, or furnishing lodging at the price including the
tax or rebating the tax in any other manner. 
(Ord. 38-2007.  Passed 3-20-07.)
896.14  REPORTS MUST BE FILED; FRAUDULENT REPORTS.
   (a)   No person, including any officer of a corporation or employee of an
entity having control or supervision of or charged with the responsibility of
filing returns, shall fail to file any return or report required to be filed by
this chapter, or file or cause to be filed any incomplete, false or fraudulent
return, report or statement, or aid or abet another in the filing of any false
or fraudulent return, report or statement.
   (b)   (1)   If any vendor required to file monthly returns under this
chapter fails on two (2) consecutive months or on three (3) or more months
within a twelve- month period, to file such returns when due or to pay the tax
on two or more occasions within a twenty-four month period, to file such
returns when due or to pay the tax due thereon, the Director of Finance may:
      (2)   Require such vendor to furnish security in an amount equal to the
average tax liability of the vendor for a period of one (1) year, as determined
by the Director of Finance from a review of returns or other information
pertaining to such vendor, which amount shall in no event be less than one
hundred dollars ($100.00).  The security may be in the form of an advance tax
payment to be applied to pay the tax due on subsequent returns, or a corporate
surety bond, satisfactory to the Director of Finance, conditioned upon payment
of the tax due with the returns from the vendor.  The security must be filed
within ten (10) days following the vendor’s receipt of the notice from the
Director of Finance of its requirements.
   (c)   A corporate surety bond filed under this section shall be returned to
the vendor if, for a period of twelve (12) consecutive months following the
date the bond was filed, the vendor has filed all returns and remitted payment
therewith within the time prescribed in this chapter.
(Ord. 38-2007.  Passed 3-20-07.)

   (b)    All walks and driveways shall be constructed or reconstructed to
conform to the grade on the right of way where the grade has been established.
   (c)    The surface of all walks shall have a transverse slope of one-fourth
inch to one- half inch per foot with the low side nearest to the curb line.
   (d)    Whenever permission is requested and granted to construct or
reconstruct a walk where the surface of such walk has a transverse slope of a
rate of more than one-half inch to the foot, the permit shall be granted and
received only on the condition that Council may at any time thereafter order
such walks to be reconstructed to the established grade of the right of way,
entirely at the expense of the abutting property owner.
   (e)    In all cases where sidewalks cross a driveway or runway, the full
width of the sidewalk shall conform to the established grade of the sidewalk
adjoining both sides of such driveway or runway, unless permission has been

foot width of sidewalk shall conform to the grade of the sidewalks adjoining
both sides of the driveway or runway.
   (f)    Upon a right of way where the grade has been established but where
the street has not been improved by paving or grading to such grade, walks
shall be constructed in conformity with the established grade or as specified
in the legislation providing for the construction or reconstruction of such
walks, driveways and curb openings. However, when walks are ordered by Council
or are constructed or reconstructed without such order by the owner of property
abutting on a right of way where no grade is established, such walks may be
constructed or reconstructed at such levels and inclinations as may be
prescribed by the Director. When such permission is requested of and granted by
the Director to construct or reconstruct a walk on such right of way, it shall
be granted and the walk shall be constructed or reconstructed only on condition

to the grade which may thereafter be established by the Director for such
street, entirely at the expense of the owner of the property abutting on such
street.

level so that the wearing surface thereof is uniform and even throughout the
right of way; and all walks in the City shall be maintained in such repair by
the owner of property abutting the right of way that the surface of the walk in
front of all abutting property on any right of way is uniform and even
throughout its length and width with the adjoining and connecting walk. All new

Director. The owner or contractor shall preserve the work to the lines
furnished by the Director and such stakes for line or grades which are
disturbed or destroyed through the carelessness of the owner or contractor

durability, etc., and to determine that the same meets the requirements of the
specifications for the construction or reconstruction of walks and driveways as
established by the Director of Public Service-Safety.

alley and it may assess the cost thereof, equally or otherwise, upon the owners
of the property abutting on both sides of such street or alley. The assessed
cost shall constitute a lien on such property from the date the amount thereof

days thereafter, the Clerk shall certify it, with a forfeiture of five percent
thereon, to the Wood County Auditor, who shall place it upon the tax duplicate

1040.07  RULES.
   (a)   Definitions.  As used in this section:
      (1)   “Director” means the City’s Director of Public Utilities.
      (2)   “Division” means the City’s Division of Public Utilities
Operations.
      (3)   “Employees” means all necessary persons appointed by the Mayor upon
recommendation of the Director and with the concurrence of Council, or

any other just cause in accordance with the applicable civil service
regulations.
   (b)   Office Hours.  Office hours of the Division shall be from 7:00 a.m. to
3:30 p.m. daily except Saturday and Sunday.
   (c)   Rules.
Rule 1.  These Rules shall be considered a part of the contract with every
person that is provided sanitary sewer service with the City, and every person
provided such service shall be considered to have expressed his or her consent
to be governed thereby.
No house sewer shall be constructed to connect with a public sewer, nor shall
any connection be made to a public sewer, in the City until a sanitary sewer
permit has been obtained by the person employed to perform the work.
Such permit must be obtained at the office of the Division before a tap can be
made into a sanitary sewer.  An application for such permit shall be signed by
the owner of the property for which the connection is to be made, or by the
owner’s agent, and by the person employed to perform the work; shall described
the property to be connected; and shall be accompanied by a fee of fifty
dollars ($50.00).  A tap can be made only by a licensed sewer tapper.
Rule 2.  All sewers or sewer improvements that have been constructed or sewers
or sewer improvements constructed by the City after the effective date of this
subsection shall be for sanitary sewerage only and shall include all sewers or
sewer improvements for main sanitary drainage or local sanitary drainage in the
City sewer districts now established and approved by the Ohio Environmental
Protection Agency. All sanitary sewage shall be discharged into the sanitary
sewer without passing through a private sewage treatment device. Whenever a
sanitary sewer is made available within 200 feet of an existing building, any
sewage treatment device or equipment on adjacent property shall be abandoned in
accordance with the current County Health Department regulations, and the
sanitary sewage shall be discharged directly from the building to the sanitary
sewer through a properly constructed house service sewer per the current
standard construction specifications of the Director, to a point three feet
from the outside wall of the building foundation. In no case shall sanitary
sewage be discharged into a storm sewer. Any other public or private utility
service structure or line shall be maintained at a minimum of five feet
horizontal clearance between such sanitary sewer and such utility except for
water line installations. Water lines shall be maintained at a ten foot minimum
horizontal clearance unless written approval is secured by the contractor from
the Director. No other utilities shall be permitted in the same trench as the
sanitary sewer.
Rule 3.  No person shall construct or cause to be constructed a storm water
connection in a drain or pipe line connected with or intended to be connected
with a sewer or sewer improvement set forth in Rule 2 hereof.
Rule 4.  Only a person of proven ability and approved by the City and the
Director shall be permitted to construct building sewer lines and sewer
connections as outlined in Rule 2 hereof.  Such person shall obtain a yearly
license therefore and shall further obtain a permit for the construction of any
building sewer line or sewer connection as outlined in Rule 2 hereof, from the
office of the Director.  All procedures shall be in accordance with Chapter
1020.
Rule 5.  The license required in Rule 4 hereof shall be approved and signed by
the Director or his or her agent and shall expire on December 31 of the year in
which it was issued.  The license may be revoked at any time by the Director
for a violation of the regulations governing sewer contractors.  The fee for
such license is twenty-five dollars ($25.00).
Rule 6.  An application for a sewer connection shall be signed by the certified
owner or agent. When property is owned by a company or corporation, the
application shall be signed by an officer of the company or corporation. When
the property is a joint ownership, both parties shall sign the application.
Rule 7.  The City cannot guarantee the exact location of any wye, riser or
crossover, as all measurements are approximate. If a connection is not located
in the line to be connected to, the sewer contractor shall make the necessary
tap as directed by the Division in accordance with applicable standards.
Rule  8.   A charge of fifty dollars ($50.00) shall be paid at the time of the
issuance of the sewer permit to cover the cost of inspection. This amount shall
be paid to the office of the Division and credited to the Sewer Revenue Fund.
Excessive construction time or contractor caused delays may result in
additional charges. The contractor shall be informed at the time of such
additional charges.
Rule  9.  No sewer contractor shall open a street or highway on any public or
private property without first receiving written permission from both the
Director of Public Utilities and the Director of Public Service, as well as all
other property authorities.
Rule 10.  The entire length of service lines from a structure to the City main
sewer line shall be the obligation of the owner to maintain or repair at his or
her own expense. Provided, however, the City shall be responsible for repairs
to such part of those service lines requiring repair that lie within the City
right of way. If necessary repairs involve paved streets, alleys or sidewalks,
proper permits must be obtained from the Director before any excavation is
started. For purposes of this Rule "maintain" means to clean and keep the sewer
service line free from obstructions of whatever nature. To "repair" means to
restore a sewer service line from breakage which is no fault of the property
owner. A "service line" is defined as a sewer which extends from a City main
sewer line adjacent to the property served on a direct route to not more than
two structures. Sewers not meeting this definition shall be considered private
sewers in accordance with Section
1048.04.
Rule 11.  No permit shall be deemed to authorize anything not stated on its
face, and any misrepresentation by the sewer contractor, if the same appears to
be willful, may subject the offender to a revocation of his or her license and
all applicable civil and criminal penalties.  On appeal from such revocation, a
hearing shall be had before Council.
Rules 12.  Before making connection to any wye, tee or vee, a sewer contractor
shall uncover both appurtenances to the same to ascertain the condition.  No
header shall be removed nor any pipe laid before the Director or his or her
designee views the job.  A sewer contractor shall always lay the pipe starting
at the connection to the main sewer.  Permits shall be posted on the job.
Rule 13.  The Division must be notified forty-eight hours before the tap and
inspection are to be made. All notifications shall include the permit number
and location. Cancellation or postponement made within one hour of the schedule
time will result in the forfeiture of the charge stated in Rule 8. The office
must then be notified forty-eight hours before the rescheduled time of the tap
and inspection. The inspection shall then be made on an hourly rate basis
consisting of the inspector's hourly wage plus benefits.
Rule 14.  The sewer connecting the house or building to the City sewer or any
other sewer main shall be constructed in accordance with Section
1040.04.
Rule 15.  All material used shall be new and of first quality acceptable to the
Director, in accordance with the current standard construction specifications
of the City.
Rule 16.  (EDITOR'S NOTE: Former Rule 16 was repealed by Ordinance 7-89, passed
January 17, 1989.)
Rule 17.  The sewer contractor must fill and ram the trench in six-inch layers
to a level with the former grade in streets and alleys in cases where they are
not improved. Where streets and alleys are paved and within five feet of all
paved areas, it is necessary to make fill with a granular material, preferably
No. 67 stone or approved berm stone. Such No. 67 stone or approved berm stone
must be placed in six-inch layers and mechanically tamped or flooded. Street
cut permits must be obtained from the Director. All trench areas shall be
graded and seeded upon completion of work.
Rule 18.  Sewer contractors must use care not to break any tile pipe
subdrainage in street foundations, and they shall restore the subdrainage in as
good condition as found.
Rule 19.  At all joints where house connections pass under another sewer or
drainage pipe, the sewer passed under must be supported by substantial brick or
concrete masonry, and extra precaution is required in filling and tamping the
trench in order to avoid any danger of a break, settlement or crack in the
sewer passed under.
Rule 20.  Pipe must be laid in a trench carefully made, with the bottom trimmed
to a perfect grade, and having depressions for pipe joints, so that each length
of pipe shall be evenly supported throughout the entire drain. Pipe embedment
shall be required for all sewers including service connections and shall
consist of No. 67 stone or approved berm stone placed six inches beneath,
around and over the pipe. Pipe embedment shall extend to a point three feet
outside the building wall. The interior of each length is to be made perfectly
clean and free of foreign material before the next length is laid down.
Rule 21.  A sewer contractor must enclose openings which he or she may make in
a public street or alley with sufficient barriers; must maintain electric
flasher lights at night and take all other necessary precautions to guard the
public effectively against all accidents from the beginning to the end of the
work; and can secure a permit only on the condition that he or she is to be
held responsible for all damages that may result from his or her neglect of any
or all reasonable precautions against injury or damage to persons, vehicles or
property of any kind. Braces must be used in trenches to prevent caving. If
lights or barricades must be provided by the City due to the contractor's
oversight, the contractor shall be billed appropriately.
Rule 22.  Trenching through paved roads, streets and alleys is only permitted
in cases where it is not feasible to make crossings by boring or tunneling.
Where  the trench method is used, the fill must be made with a granular
material, preferably No. 67 stone or approved berm stone. The fill must be well
tamped and  rammed to a compaction which meets with the approval of the
Director or his or  her agent. Where open cuts are permitted, it shall be
necessary to make fill  with the materials mentioned in this Rule, placed in
layers of not more than six  inches and tamped with a mechanical tamp or
flooded to complete inundation.  Pavement replacement shall be as follows:
      A.   The pavement shall be cut back nine inches from undisturbed edges of
the opening, using a saw to ensure square and vertical edges.
      B.   An eight-inch thick spanning slab of 3,000 psi high early strength
concrete shall be poured, reaching from nine inches beyond the undisturbed
subgrade on one side to nine inches beyond the undisturbed subgrade on the
other side.
      C.   Concrete shall be level with the surface of concrete pavement to
within two inches of the surface of the asphalt.
      D.   Patching of asphalt pavement shall be hot mix for all permanent
patches, it being required that the entire opening be coated with liquid
asphalt. Hot mix shall be put in place and rolled, and the joints between the
patched area and the street surface shall be sealed with liquid asphalt.
      E.   If the restoration of an opening, whether in a pavement or in a
treelawn, is performed by the City, the cost of all labor and materials shall
be charged against and deducted from a deposit made by the company or other
person, as required by the Director prior to commencing the work.
      F.   All surplus excavation must be removed from the site, leaving the
berms and pavement in substantially the same condition as they were before
construction was started. The time limit allowed for the completion of the work
shall be specified when the permit is granted. All of the work and material
referred to in this Rule shall be in accordance with the standard
specifications of the Ohio Department of Transportation and the City or other
proper authorities.
Rule 23.  If a sewer contractor neglects or refuses to comply with the rules
and regulations set forth in this subsection within twenty-four hours after
receiving written notice thereof from the Director, the City shall proceed with
the work, and the cost involved will be charged to the sewer contractor or his
or her surety. In cases where it is necessary for the City to proceed with the
work, no further permits shall be granted to the sewer contractor until he or
she has satisfactorily complied with the orders of the Director or completely
reimbursed the City for any cost involved.
Rule 24.  The sewer contractor shall be required, for two years after the
completion of the work, to make all necessary repairs, including filling and
seeding if settlement occurs.
Rule 25.  The Director or another person authorized by him or her must be
permitted at all times to inspect all work, material and fixtures.
Rule 26.  Before a sewer permit is issued, the applicant shall be required to
pay the inspection fee as provided by Council or in the current rules and
regulations.
Rule 27.  A sewer contractor shall maintain in force Worker's Compensation
Insurance coverage during the life of his or her obligation to the City. The
contractor shall provide proof of compliance with the Worker's Compensation
laws and Social Security laws to the City.
Rule 28.  Whenever a person, either for himself or herself, or as the
contractor, architect, engineer, trustee, director, officer, agent or employee
of a person, violates any of the rules and regulations provided in this
subsection, or obstructs or interferes with the execution of any such order, or
willfully or illegally omits to obey any such order, such person shall be
liable for prosecution for a violation of Ohio R.C. 6117.45.
Rule 29.  All sewer construction pertaining to County sewer lines connected to
the City water pollution control system are subject to County requirements in
matters not spelled out in this subsection, and may be subject to other local
or state requirements as applicable.
Rule 30.  A sewer contractor applying for a sewer permit, as required under
this subsection, shall deliver to the Director with his or her application a
bond a form acceptable to the Director and with sufficient sureties thereon and
ain an amount to be established by the Director to ensure the completion of the
work in accordance with this subsection.
Rule 31.  Delinquent charges for water pollution control shall be assessed
against the property to which the service is rendered, and shall be a lien
against such property, collectible in the same manner as other taxes and
assessments.  A person purchasing such property shall ascertain if there is any
unpaid water pollution control bill standing against the property.
Rule 32.  If the owner of any premises elects to have his or her tenant or
lessee pay the water pollution control charges as they accrue, such tenant or
lessee does so as the agent of the owner and such owner shall not thereby be
relieved from the payment of any delinquency that might occur. 
Rule 33.  No sanitary sewer service shall be extended to any sanitary sewer
users outside the corporate limits of the City except under the conditions set
forth in Rules 34, 35 and 36.  Provided, further, that any person presently
receiving sanitary sewer service from the City shall, upon notice from the
City, immediately comply with the provisions of Rules 34(c), (d), and (e). 
Failure to comply with such policy shall result in the sanitary sewer service
being terminated 60 days from the date of notice.
Rule 34.  The City may extend sanitary sewer service to land which is outside
of the corporate limits of the City but within the City's sanitary sewer
service area provided that before such sanitary sewer service is extended, the
owner of such land will comply with the following:
      A.   Compliance with the comprehensive plan as adopted by the City of
Perrysburg pursuant to Resolution No. 24-87, and as hereafter amended or
revised.
      B.   If applicable, compliance with the SSOE plan adopted by the

requested by the City, signing an annexation petition.  In the case of an
agreement to annex to the City, the owner of such land must also agree to
require a similar agreement from anyone to whom he or she sells all or any part
of his or her land.
      F.   The sanitary sewer service area is described as follows:

      H.   All sanitary sewer main extensions that have been extended pursuant
to and subject to this Rule shall be dedicated to the City of Perrysburg. 
Rule 35.  Consistent with otherwise applicable legal requirements, the Planning
and Zoning Administrator or in his absence the Director of Public Utilities
shall review and make a recommendation to the Mayor or his designee regarding
proposed extension of sanitary sewer service, who shall approve or disapprove
the request for service.  The request for extension of sanitary sewer service
shall be disapproved if the criteria set forth in Rule 34 are not met in full.
The City shall consult with the Township Zoning Inspector and the joint City/
Township Planning body on requests for the extension of service outside the
City.  In addition, the City may consult and seek the advice of the City
Planning Commission when he deems it appropriate.
In the event a request for extension of such service is disapproved, the
applicant may request that Council review the Mayor’s disapproval.  Council may
affirm, modify or reverse the Mayor’s decision.
Rule 36.  Prior to the application for a service connection permit, the owner
of the property shall first apply for a permit from the City. Such permit shall
only be issued upon the owner's compliance with Rules 33, 34 and 35. Such
permit shall be presented to the Northwestern Sewer and Water District (NSWD)
prior to it issuing a building service connection permit, if such a NSWD
connection permit is required.
Rule 37.  When an existing sanitary sewer service connection line is abandoned
by the property owner or when the structure served by the connection is
demolished, the property owner shall cut off and plug the abandoned service
connection line at the sewer. All costs associated with such work shall be at
the expense of the property owner.
Rule 38.  Where a connection to a combined sewer system is proposed, the
property owner shall install separate sanitary and storm service lines from the
building to a point at least three feet into the public right of way. At that
point, the service lines may be joined with approved wye fitting. A two inch by
two inch wood stake extending within eighteen inches of the finished grade
shall be placed above the wye fitting. A single service line shall extend from
the wye fitting to the combined sewer. All costs associated with this work
shall be at the expense of the property owner.
Rule 39.  Adjustments to sanitary sewer service bills, other than those covered
by Rule 19 of Section
1060.06(b), shall be at the discretion of Council, except that the Director
shall have the authority to adjust bills if the total amount at issue (water
and sanitary sewer charges combined) is one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or
less.
Rule 40.  A person planning on entering any part of the City's sanitary sewage
or storm drainage systems or any other City-owned confined space as defined in
29 CFR-1910.46 (permit-required confined spaces) shall be required to comply
with all applicable provisions of that standard.
Rule 41.  Delinquent Sanitary Sewer Bills.  Should the City fail to bill the
appropriate amount as a result of an error, the corrected due amount may be
collected by the City and shall be repaid by the sanitary sewer customer
prorated over a period of time equal to the length of time during which the
billing error occurred.  Provided, however, no delinquent bills over three
years in age shall be collected and further, the entire delinquent bill shall
be immediately due and payable by the sanitary sewer customer when such
sanitary sewer customer conveys the real estate for which the sanitary sewer
service giving rise to the delinquent bill applies.
Rule 42.  Developer Infiltration/Inflow Policy.  Pursuant to the policy of the
Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, infiltration/inflow (I&I) credits from
the City are available for reservation on a first-come, first-serve basis.  If
I&I credits are available, the City will reserve them for a development
effective on the date the sanitary sewer plans for the development are approved
by the City, contingent on approval by the Ohio Environmental Protection
Agency.  If I&I credits are not available, the development will be placed on a
standby list and I&I credits will be allocated to the development by the City
as I&I credits become available.  Developments will be placed on the standby
list in the order in which the sanitary sewer plans for each development were
approved by the City and developments will be allocated I&I credits as they
become available in the same order.
Prior to the approval by the City of the sanitary sewer plans for the
development, the developer shall file a bond with surety or sureties, in such
form as shall be approved by the Director of Law and Director of Public
Utilities, and in an amount equal to the infiltration and inflow capital
expansion charge as specified in Section
1050.09(b)(1).  Such bond shall guarantee that sanitary sewer construction for
the development will begin within twelve months from the date the Ohio
Environmental Protection Agency approves the Permit to Install for the
development.  In lieu of filing the bond as contemplated by this subsection,
the developer shall deposit in escrow the face amount of such bond in a banking
institution situated in the City.  The escrowed funds, by terms of the escrow
agreement, shall be retained on deposit until the earlier of the beginning of
sanitary sewer construction for the development or twelve months from the date
the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency approves the permit to install for the
development and shall not be disbursed except upon the written authorization of
the City Engineer.
   For the purposes of this rule, one gallon per day of average daily design
flow will require 3 1/3 gallons per day of I&I credits and one Equivalent
Residential Unit (ERU) is equal to 400 gallons per day of average daily design
flow or 1332 gallons per day of I&I credits (peak flow).  (Ord. 45-2012. 
Passed 3-16-12.)
1040.99  PENALTY.
   Whoever violates or fails to comply with any of the provisions of this
chapter is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and shall be fined not more than one
hundred dollars ($100.00).  A separate offense shall be deemed committed each
day during or on which a violation or noncompliance occurs or continues.

sewerage system, including storm sewerage, of such City or having such
connections available to them;

connected with or served by the City water system and is benefited, connected
and/or served, directly or indirectly, by the City sewerage system and
filtration plant;

meter, as though each consumer of water represented the owner or occupant of a
separate parcel of affected real property.

conveys residential, commercial and industrial sanitary wastes and industrial
wastes and storm water.

   Charges for industrial wastes treatment, sanitary sewage charges and normal
concentrations shall be as follows:
   (a)   Base sanitary sewage charges for wastes discharged to the wastewater
treatment works of the City from industries shall be determined upon the basis
of the volume of wastewater discharged from the industry to the wastewater
treatment works.  This volume shall be the same as that recorded on the meter
or meters used to measure water from the water system of the City, unless the
industry is supplied with water from a source other than the water system of
the City or unless a substantial volume of water supplied to the industry is
not discharged to the wastewater treatment works, in which cases the volume of
water discharged to the wastewater treatment works shall be determined by one
or more meters installed to measure water flow and/or wastewater discharged, or
by other means approved by the City.  Meters installed other than the meter or
meters used to record consumption from the water system of the City shall be
approved by the City and installed at the expense of the industry.
   (b)   The volume of wastewater discharged from the industry to the
wastewater treatment works shall be subject to a base charge of 1,000 cubic
feet, as follows:
      (1)   Charges for each billing quarter during a calendar year shall be
based upon the following data applicable for the previous calendar year:
         A.   Total sewer revenue fund expenses, excluding those expenses
attributable to debt service costs and any expenses classified as reimbursable
expenses (net sewer revenue fund expenses);
         B.   Total debt service payments to the Ohio Water Development
Authority; and
         C.   Total metered consumption subject to sanitary sewage charges
(expressed in 1,000 cubic feet).  Data not available shall be estimated in the
most practical manner possible.
      (2)   The base charge per 1,000 cubic feet shall equal the net sewer
revenue fund expenses pursuant to subparagraph (b)(1)A. hereof, plus the total
debt service payments to the Ohio Water Development Authority plus the total
metered consumption subject to sanitary sewage charges, in 1,000 cubic feet.
   (c)   Sanitary sewage charges levied pursuant to this section shall be
billed quarterly and shall be subject to a minimum charge applicable pursuant
to Sections
1050.01 and
1050.02.  (Ord. 51-74.  Passed 7-23-74.)

1057.01  PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   (a)   The purpose of this regulation is to establish technically feasible
and economically reasonable standards to achieve a level of erosion and
sediment control that will minimize damage to property and degradation of water
resources and wetlands, and will promote and maintain the health and safety of
the citizens of the City of Perrysburg.
   (b)   This regulation will:
      (1)   Allow development while minimizing increases in erosion and
sedimentation.
      (2)   Reduce water quality impacts to receiving water resources and
wetlands that may be caused by new development or redevelopment activities.
   (c)   This regulation applies to all parcels used or being developed, either
wholly or partially, for new or relocated projects involving highways,
underground cables, or pipelines; subdivisions or larger common plans of
development; industrial, commercial, institutional, or residential projects;
building activities on farms; redevelopment activities; general clearing; and
all other uses that are not specifically exempted in Section
1057.01(d), (e).
   (d)    This regulation does not apply to activities regulated by, and in
compliance with, theOhio Sediment Pollution Abatement Program, OAC Chapter 901:
13-1 and OAC 1501:3-12-02.
   (e)   This Chapter does not require a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan
(SWP3) for linear construction projects, such as pipeline or utility line
installation on private property and approved by the Public Utilities
Commission of Ohio or the U.S. Department of Transportation, Pipeline and
Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), that do not result in the
installation of impervious surface as determined by the Public Utilities
Director. Such projects must be designed to minimize the number of stream
crossings and the width of disturbance. Linear construction projects must
comply with USEPA requirements regarding erosion and sediment control.

controls and contractor B will maintain perimeter controls until final
stabilization). The SWP3 shall identify all subcontractors engaged in
activities that could impact storm water runoff. The SWP3 shall contain
signatures from all of the identified subcontractors indicating that they have
been informed and understand their roles and responsibilities in complying with
the SWP3.
   (b)   At a minimum, the SWP3 shall include controls and performance measures
describing: 
      (1)   Non-structural Preservation Measures:  The SWP3 must make use of
practices that preserve the existing natural condition to the maximum extent
practicable.
      (2)   Erosion Control Practices:  The SWP3 must make use of erosion
controls that are capable of providing cover over disturbed soils. A
description of control practices designed to re-stabilize disturbed areas after
grading or construction shall be included in the SWP3. The SWP3 must provide
specifications for stabilization of all disturbed areas of the site and provide
guidance as to which method of stabilization will be employed for any time of
the year.

control the flow of runoff from disturbed areas so as to prevent erosion.
      (4)   Sediment Control Practices.  The SWP3 shall include a description
of, and detailed drawings for, all structural practices that shall store
runoff, allowing sediments to settle and/or divert flows away from exposed
soils or otherwise limit runoff from exposed areas. Structural practices shall
be used to control erosion and trap sediment from a site remaining disturbed
for more than 14 days. All sediment control practices must be capable of
ponding runoff in order to be considered functional. Earth diversion dikes or
channels alone are not considered a sediment control practice unless used in
conjunction with a sediment settling pond. Sediment control practices shall be
functional throughout the course of earth disturbing activity. Sediment basins
and perimeter sediment barriers shall be implemented prior to grading and
within seven (7) days from start of grubbing, and shall continue to function
until the up slope development area is restabilized.

street, catch basin, or other public facility or natural resource is
prohibited. A designated area for concrete washout shall be made available.
         C.   Fuel/Liquid Tank Storage:  All fuel/liquid tanks and drums shall
be stored in a marked storage area. A dike shall be constructed around this
storage area with a minimum capacity equal to 110% of the volume of all
containers in the storage area.
         D.   SPCC and/or Fuel Spill:   Provisions for a Spill Prevention,
Control and Countermeasure (SPCC) plan must be included in the SWP3.
Notification requirements in the event of fuel spills less than 25 gallons and
in excess of 35 gallons must be included.
         E.   Toxic or Hazardous Waste Disposal:  Any toxic or hazardous waste
shall be disposed of properly.
         F.   Contaminated Soils Disposal and Runoff.  Contaminated soils from
redevelopment sites shall be disposed of properly. Runoff from contaminated
soils shall not be discharged from the site. Proper permits shall be obtained
for development projects on solid waste landfill sites or redevelopment sites.
      (6)   Compliance with Other Requirements.  The SWP3 shall be consistent
with applicable State and/or local waste disposal, sanitary sewer, or septic
system regulations, including provisions prohibiting waste disposal by open
burning, and shall provide for the proper disposal of contaminated soils
located within the development area.
      (7)   Trench and Ground Water Control.  There shall be no sediment-laden
or turbid discharges to water resources or wetlands resulting from dewatering
activities. If trench or ground water contains sediment, it must pass through a
sediment-settling pond or other equally effective sediment control device,
prior to being discharged from the construction site. Trench and groundwater
control must comply with applicable provisions in the latest version of the
Ohio EPA Construction General Permit.
      (8)   The site operator shall maintain current records pertaining to the
approval and implementation of the SWP3 on site and make them available for
inspection by authorized City or State personnel.

   (a)   In General.
      (1)   As used in this section:
         A.   "Director" means the Director of Public Utilities.
         B.   "Division" means the Division of Public Utilities Operations
         C.   "Employees" means all necessary persons appointed by the Mayor
upon recommendation of the Director and with the concurrence of Council, or
otherwise employed by the City, to perform duties, serve the term of
employment, and receive compensation for positions created by law, subject to
removal for violation of any of the rules and regulations of the City or for
any other just cause in accordance with the applicable civil service
regulations. 
      (2)   Office hours of the Division of Public Utilities Operations shall
be from 7:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. daily except Saturday and Sunday. 
   (b)   Rules.
Rule 1.  These Rules shall be considered a part of the contract with every
person, that is supplied with water through the water works system of the City,
and every such person taking water shall be considered to have expressed his or
her consent to be governed thereby.
Rule 2.  The City does not guarantee quality of service. The supply of water to
all parties for any purpose whatever is subject to the understanding that the
consumer is not guaranteed a fixed or continuous pressure, or a guarantee of
the water delivered as to quality, purity, or temperature, the same all being
subject to the variable conditions and maintenance of the water works system.
Rule 3.  Water mains may be shut off without notice. In case of breaks in
mains, services, pumping machinery, reservoirs, or other water works equipment;
for the purpose of tapping, extending, repairing, replacing or cleaning mains;
and in the case of emergency circumstances in which the City reasonably
believes it is necessary to shut off certain service in order to avoid risk of
substantial injury to person or property, including but not limited to fire,
the water may be shut off without giving notice and no claims shall be
considered for damage of any nature whatsoever arising from such action,
although, under ordinary conditions, consumers shall be notified.
Rule 4.   The Division of Public Utilities Operations reserves the right,
through its authorized agents, to enter the premises to which its service
extends, at all reasonable hours, for the purpose of reading, repairing,
installing, removing or inspecting meters for the purpose of inspecting the
piping systems thereof, or for any other purposes which it may deem necessary
in properly safeguarding the interests of the City and the consumer.  When such
access is refused, the Division may at its sole discretion either: (a)
Terminate water service until the City’s request has been complied with and an
“off and on” charge of twenty dollars ($20.00) for consumers in the City, or
thirty dollars ($30.00) for customers outside the City, has been paid, with
service not to resume unless access to enter premises is made available and the
City has completed the required work; or (b) Assess on the bill a fee of not
more than fifty dollars ($50.00) per billing period to reflect additional costs
to the Division arising from the customer’s failure to provide access, with the
fee to continue on the bill until access to enter premises is made available
and the City has completed the required work; or (c) If the customer has
allowed the Division access and the customer objects to the installation of a
wireless meter reading device, the customer will be assessed twelve dollars
($12.00) per billing period to reflect the additional costs to the Division
arising from the customer’s failure to comply with City equipment upgrades and
modifications.
Rule 5.  An application for water and/or sewer service shall be made on a form
approved by the Director of Public Utilities. 
Rule 6.  All water services must be metered, excluding firelines, in accordance
with this subsection.
Rule 7.  All applications for the use of water from the City must be made in
writing by the owner of the premises on the form provided by the Division of
Public Utilities Operations. When a final meter reading is ordered for
transferring service, a reading must be obtained from the meter and the remote
reading meter. If access to the meter is unavailable, the water shall
immediately be turned off and not turned on again until an "off and on" charge
of twenty dollars ($20.00) for customers in the City, or thirty dollars
($30.00) for customers outside the City, is paid. Service shall not be turned
on again unless access to enter the premises is made available. Any party
desiring water service from the City who has a past record of nonpayment of
water rental charges shall not have water service until such time as a cash
deposit equal to one- half the prior normal annual billing amount has been paid
to the Division of Public Utilities Operations. If a customer moves within the
City service area, a deposit shall be required for the new address and the
previous deposit shall be refunded upon payment of the final bill for the old
address.
If the City is required to attempt to turn off the water service to any
customer for any violation of its service application or agreement, or of these
Water Rules, then a charge of twenty dollars ($20.00) for customers in the
City, or thirty dollars ($30.00) for customers outside the City, shall be paid,
irrespective of whether or not the water service is actually turned off.
Any real estate company licensed by the State may sign an agreement on a form
provided by the Division of Public Utilities Operations to guarantee the
payment of water bills to clients' homes on a temporary basis. Such agreement
shall cover any and all such homes as such real estate company desires to
guarantee such service from time to time. The Division shall provide a code to
the company, which code shall be used by the company when communicating with
the Division its desire to accept the obligation of the service to such homes. 
Rule 8.  Any water meter installed after the effective date of this rule shall
be a remote reading meter. Any water meter two inches or larger shall require a
bypass around it.
Rule 9.  The Director shall require a permit for the installation of more than
one master meter on a service branch supplying an apartment building or a
building containing more than one distinct apartment, or more than one
commercial or industrial enterprise, when plans showing the piping arrangements
are submitted to and approved by the Director. In cases where additional meters
are installed, it shall be required that:
      A.   The meters shall be contained compactly or in a meter room, and that
each be controlled independently of the others; and
      B.   The Director may assume responsibility for the installation and
maintenance of the meters under the terms of an agreement made with the owner.
   For each water tap there shall be one meter. A second meter shall be allowed
as a sprinkler meter, if desired. Fire line taps require no meter. 
Rule 10.  Water for construction, private or public, shall be furnished on the
regular water rates, unless otherwise provided by the Director. Bulk water may
be provided under conditions established by City Council.
Rule 11.  Every meter is registered by a service number and applies to street
number and lot number and not to the property owner's name. A person making an
inquiry regarding a meter shall give the street number, and if possible, the
service number.
Rule 12.  The cost of maintenance and replacement of a meter, beyond normal
wear, including a meter the titles to which may have been assigned to the
Division of Public Utilities Operations by individual owners, shall be at the
expense of the customer.
Rule 13.  A property owner shall be held responsible for, and shall reimburse
the Division of Public Utilities Operations for, the loss or theft of a meter
installed on his or her property.
Rule 14.  Every meter and appurtenances shall be furnished at the expense of
the person applying therefore, shall comply with the requirements or
specifications prescribed by the Director and shall be of the make, type, model
and design approved or adopted for use by the Division of Public Utilities
Operations. A meter shall be installed with a lockable Ford meter valve on the
street side of the meter.
There shall be a half inch (½") conduit installed between the meter and the
outside remote. The conduit shall be used to run the remote wire. The exterior,
if needed, shall be EMT or equivalent. 
Rule 15.  A meter shall be removed only by an authorized employee of the
Division of Public Utilities Operations. Unauthorized persons removing or
tampering with meters shall be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.
Rule 16.  When, upon inspection, a meter seal has been found to have been
broken from any cause whatsoever, the water will be turned off and not turned
on again until twenty-five dollars ($25.00) has been paid to the City as
liquidated damages and expenses involved. At the discretion of the Director,
such fee may be waived.
Rule 17.  The Director reserves the right to remove a meter from any premises
and substitute another meter in its place for the purpose of making repairs or
testing.
Rule 18.  The Division of Public Utilities Operations may, on its own
initiative, undertake to test a meter which, in its judgment, is registering
incorrectly, without charge to the owner.
Rule 19.   If the property owner or consumer requests the City to test the
meter owned by him or her, the Director reserves the right to charge for the
cost of removing and testing the meter even if the meter is found to be in
correct working order. If a meter is found not in correct working order, only
the bill for the prior month shall be adjusted.
Rule 20.  A meter shall be kept freely accessible to meter readers and other
authorized employees of the Division of Public Utilities Operations and shall
not be permitted to become covered with or obstructed by rubbish or other
material regardless of whether such meter is located in meter vaults, areaways
or basements. A meter shall not be installed in a coal bin, coal cellar or
crawl space. The Director reserves the right to shut off water when a violation
of this rule is not corrected following due notice of such violation to the
owner by the Director.
Rule 21.  Charges for water used shall be based on the meter consumption at the
rates legally adopted by the City; provided, however, that the rates for water
to consumers outside the City shall be not less than ten percent greater than
the rates established for consumers in the City. Such rates may be obtained on
inquiry at the office of the Division of Public Utilities Operations.
      Rule 22.  A water meter shall be read monthly. If no meter reading is
obtained, the Division reserves the right to estimate and bill for the water
consumed on the basis of preceding comparable monthly consumption.  If a meter
cannot be read and an estimated billing is sent for two billing periods or
twice in any twelve-month period, the property owner shall have a remote
reading meter installed at the owner's expense. If a meter cannot be read due
to an unfriendly animal in the area of the meter, the property owner assumes
full responsibility and shall have a remote reading meter installed at his or
her expense.
      Rule 23.  Bills for metered water shall be rendered monthly.
Rule 24.  A bill not paid by the fifteenth of the billing month shall be
considered delinquent and shall be subject to a fifteen percent penalty charge.
The water may be shut off on the thirteenth day of the month following the
billing month, provided that written notice of delinquency is forwarded by mail
to the address shown on the application for service, at least two weeks before
the shut-off. The penalty charge shall apply to all accounts. When the
fifteenth day of the billing month falls on a Sunday or a holiday, the due date
shall be the next business day.
Rule 25.  If the owner of any premises elects to have his or her tenant or
lessee pay the water charges as they accrue, such tenant or lessee does so as
the agent of the owner and such owner shall not thereby be relieved from the
payment of delinquencies that might occur. If the tenant or lessee has made
proper application and is not delinquent in payment, the owner does not have
the right to order water off without permission from such tenant or lessee.
Rule 26.  The Division shall deliver bills for water by depositing the same in
the post office only as a matter of convenience to the owner or consumer, and
the failure to receive bills shall not be construed to relieve any owner from
his or her obligation as to the payment of such bills.
Rule 27.  When water service has been turned off on account of a delinquency,
it shall not be turned on until the delinquency has been paid, together with an
"off and on" charge of twenty dollars ($20.00) for customers in the City or
thirty dollars ($30.00) for customers outside the City. Service will not be
turned on again unless access to enter the premises is made available. The same
procedure is to be followed for an owner-requested "off and on." 
Rule 28.  No deduction shall be made, or rebate allowed, to a consumer of water
under meter control because of alleged leakage in any water pipe, tank or other
apparatus or device.
The amount of water registered by a meter shall be charged and paid in full,
irrespective of whether such water, after having been registered, was lost by
leakage, accident or otherwise. Adjustments to water bills, other than those
covered by Rule 19 hereof, shall be at the discretion of Council, except that
the Director shall have the authority to adjust bills if the total amount at
issue (water and sanitary sewer charges combined) is one thousand dollars
($1,000.00) or less, and inform the Health, Sanitation and Public Utilities
Committee of his actions. 
Rule 29. The Division of Public Utilities Operations is not responsible for
frozen meters, and pit meters shall not be read during the winter months. The
Division hereby reserves the right to estimate and bill for the water consumed
on the basis of preceding comparable monthly consumption. The owner has the
right to order a pit meter opened for the purpose of a final reading but by
doing so assumes responsibility for expenses that might be incurred.
Rule 30.  The installation of fire protection service connections, to supply
water to stand pipes and sprinkler systems for fire protection only, shall be
permitted when applications and plans for such service have been approved by
the Division.
Rule 31.  (EDITOR'S NOTE: Former Rule 31 was repealed by Ordinance 58-2006,
passed March 7, 2006.)
Rule 32.  Lines installed for fire protection shall under no circumstances be
tapped or used for the general water supply of any premises.
Rule 33.  All outlet valves on the fire protection line shall be sealed by the
Division and opened only in case of fire.

whatsoever, immediate notice must be given to the Division.
Rule 35.  When, upon inspection, a seal on a fire protection line has been
found broken for a cause other than fire protection, the water will be turned
off, the Fire Division notified and the water not turned on again until twenty-
five dollars ($25.00) has been paid to the Division of Public Utilities
Operations as liquidated damages and expenses involved.
      Rule 36.  In lieu of charges for water used in case of fire, the City
shall require the payment of fifty cents ($.50) monthly per inch of diameter of
the connection to the City mains. In addition, monthly charges at current water
rates shall be billed for any water registered by the meter, exclusive of fire
usage.
Rule 37.  Fire hydrant rental shall be twenty dollars ($20.00) per year per
hydrant, including all public and private fire hydrants attached to the City
water works system. Billings for this charge shall be made monthly.
Rule 38.  Fire hydrants are intended primarily for the use of the Fire
Division, and such use shall not be interfered with in any manner. A permit for
the use thereof for other purposes is given only in cases where such use is
considered to be an absolute necessity. 
Rule 39.  The operating of fire hydrants and the drawing of water therefrom by
unauthorized persons is strictly prohibited. Violators of this rule will be
required to pay an assessed fee of five hundred dollars ($500.00) to cover

as may be provided by law.
Rule 40.  No person except an authorized employee of the Division of Public
Utilities Operations, Street Division, or Fire Division shall open, operate or

the purpose of extinguishing fires, without first having secured the necessary
permits to do so. 
Rule 41.  At the discretion of the Commissioner of Public Utilities Operations,
a special permit may be issued for the use of a fire hydrant for securing a
supply of water for construction purposes, in cases where a permanent supply or
connection will not be required, upon the payment of charges for water to be
used in accordance with a tariff of rates on file together with such hydrant
fee as established covering the use of the hydrant. The right is hereby
reserved to revoke a permit for the use of a fire hydrant. Charges for such
permit shall be as determined by the Commissioner of Public Utilities
Operations. 
Rule 42.  A fire hydrant used for construction purposes, pursuant to permission
first obtained, must have a reducing coupling and union attached to the nozzle
of the hydrant, with an independent valve for regulation of the supply. The
main valve of the fire hydrant must be opened full at the beginning of work
each day and remain open until stoppage of work for the day, the water supply
to be regulated by the independent valve. The fire hydrant is to be operated
only by a spanner to be supplied by the Division of Public Utilities Operations
at the expense of the user.
Rule 43.  A property owner who wishes the installation of new water lines or

feet of such line shall all secure water from the line and shall pay to the
City the same rate as noted above, based upon front footage of property along
such line, in addition to the water tap charges then in effect.
Rule 44.  A subdivision developer operating in the City may petition for
permission to install new water lines or extensions of existing water lines,
the provisions of Rule 43 notwithstanding, and approval of the same may be
granted by the Mayor for such installation, provided that such developer shall
defray the entire cost of the installation or extension and that the same shall
be completed agreeable to plans and specifications approved by the Director and
under the supervision of the Commissioner of Public Utilities Operations.

November 2, 1983.)
Rule 46.  No person except an employee of the Division of Public Utilities
Operations shall tap or make a connection with the mains or distribution lines

Utilities Operations. The Commissioner shall allow plastic pipe to be used in
lines larger than one inch (1"), however, the type of pipe must be approved by
the Division of Public Utilities Operations. Plastic water lines three inches
(3") or larger shall transition to ductile iron pipes before the building
foundation through the meter set. 
Rule 53.  Any service between the main and the curb cock which is broken or
damaged by anyone, other than an employee of the Division of Public Utilities
Operations, while performing work at these connections, shall be repaired or
replaced by the Division at the expense of the individual who damaged the
service.
Rule 54.  Roughed in plumbing shall provide a space which is designated as a
meter spacer bar, such meter spacer bar to be of proper dimensions for

billed according to Sections
1050.01 and
1050.02; however, notwithstanding other terms in these Codified Ordinances,
there shall be no minimum billing for water usage through this second meter.
Rule 59.  At the discretion of the Commissioner of Public Utilities Operations,
if an approved backflow prevention device is necessary for the safety of the
public water system, the Commissioner shall give notice to the water consumer
to install such an approved device immediately. The water consumer shall, at
his or her own expense, install such an approved device at a location and in a
manner approved by the Commissioner and shall have inspections and tests made
of such approved devices as required by the Commissioner.
If the water consumer does not comply with this Rule within a reasonable time,
the Commissioner may turn off the water service and take such other
precautionary measures as he or she may deem necessary to eliminate any danger
of contamination of the public water supply distribution mains. Water service
to such property shall not be restored until such conditions have been
eliminated or corrected in compliance with this Rule. The Commissioner shall
also conduct surveys and investigations to be made of industrial and other

request for service. The request for extension of water service shall be
disapproved unless the criteria set forth in Rule 34 are met.
The City shall consult with the Township Zoning Inspector and the joint City/
Township Planning body on requests for the extension of such service. In
addition, the City may consult and seek the advice of the City Planning
Commission when he deems it appropriate.
In the event a request for extension of such service is disapproved, the
applicant may request that Council review the disapproval, and Council may
affirm, modify or reverse the decision.
Rule 64.  Persons seeking a water line installation or extension outside the
City will be required to bear the entire cost of such construction. All
construction plans, specifications and installation shall be subject to the
approval of the City and be under its direct supervision.

customers. 
Rule 66.  When an existing water service line is abandoned by the property
owner or when the structure served by the service line is demolished, the

associated with such work shall be at the expense of the property owner.
Rule 67.  Delinquent Water Bills.  Should the City fail to bill the appropriate
amount as a result of an error, the corrected due amount may be collected by
the City and shall be repaid by the water customer prorated over a period of
time equal to the length of time during which the billing error occurred.
Provided, however, no delinquent bills over three years in age shall be
collected and further, the entire delinquent bill shall be immediately due and
payable by the water customer when such water customer conveys the real estate
for which the water service giving rise to the delinquent bill applies.

CHAPTER 1088
Way Public Library
   EDITOR'S NOTE: Presently, the custody, control and administration of the Way
Public Library is vested in a Board of Library Trustees which is composed of
six members appointed by the Mayor pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3375.12.
The original Perrysburg Public Library was established by an ordinance of the
Village Council enacted January 4, 1881, as amended November 27, 1905,
accepting a gift of money from the estate of Willard V. Way. Council created a
board of trustees of seven members as follows: Mayor of the Village, ex-
officio; President of the Board of Education, ex-officio; three members
appointed by Council, and two members appointed by the Board of Education. This
composition continued until 1954 when the State Librarian published a report of
a survey of the Way Public Library, which was requested by the League of Women
Voters.
The report of the State Librarian stated that there is no law now in force nor
was there any law in force at the time of passage of the original ordinance in
1881 giving a Village Council authority to delegate the power of appointment of
library trustees to other agencies. The report concluded that this was the only
library in the State in which the board members were appointed in such fashion
and that the library did not appear to be a unit of the Village, Board of
Education, Township or County. It was recommended that the Board of Library
Trustees be appointed pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3375.12 so that the Board would
have the powers now granted by law to legally organized public library boards
and, in the event of a future tax levy or bond issue, it should belong to the
Municipality. The report resulted in the present Board being appointed pursuant
to Ohio R.C. 3375.12.
There are no sections in Chapter 1088. This chapter has been established to
provide a place for cross references and any future legislation.

1220.02  AGRICULTURAL DISTRICT.
   The agricultural district is intended to retain agricultural and other
compatible low intensity uses, areas where soil and topographic conditions are
suitable for these uses and into which the intrusion of urban uses would be
inappropriate or untimely due to a lack of urban services and facilities.
   (a)   A-1, Agricultural Districts: Land which is level or gently rolling,
possesses productive soil characteristics and is best preserved for
agricultural purposes.
      (Ord. 22-2006.  Passed 3-7-06.)
1220.03  RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS.
   The residential districts generally are intended to provide desirable
settings for residential development within the several density ranges
described in the City of Perrysburg Comprehensive Plan and for various types of
dwelling units with appropriate regulations regarding physical development. As
appropriate, the districts also allow other uses compatible with residential
areas, either as permitted, or as special uses. Basic urban services including
adequate access and utilities, are necessary for these districts.
   (a)   R-1, Single Family Residential – Suburban: Areas accommodating low-
density residential development. Includes land with topographic conditions that
are best suited for low-density development on residential lots typically in
excess of one- half (½) acre. Lot size may vary depending on the presence of
public sanitary sewer and water service.   
   (b)   R-2, Single Family Residential – Low Density: Relatively low-density
residential development which has or can be logically developed with group
water and sewerage facilities. Lot size may vary depending on the presence of
public sanitary sewer and water service.

streets. These areas are intended to serve as employment centers for adjacent
or nearby residential neighborhoods and as buffers between those neighborhoods
and arterial street traffic.

industrial uses, where they will have access to necessary services and
facilities and minimize obtrusion on or by adjoining uses and districts. Light
industrial uses, which are unlikely to cause undesirable effects, are located
in light industrial areas. More intensive industrial uses, which may have
wider- reaching environmental effects, are located in general industrial areas.
   (a)   I-1, Light Industrial:  Areas which are adaptable for industries of a
restricted nature and generally limited to operations conducted wholly within a
building and having no detrimental effects on neighboring land uses.
   (b)   I-2, General Industrial: Areas which, because of their access to
transportation and community services and relative isolation from other uses,

the Comprehensive Plan; to promote architectural continuity; to encourage
designs which produce a desirable relationship between individual buildings,
the circulation systems and adjacent areas; to control signage, visibility

the market as well as to provide incentives for the development of a variety of
land uses and activities of high quality.

1230.02  PROVISIONS GOVERNING INTERPRETATION AND APPLICATION OF YARD
REQUIREMENTS.
   The interpretation, application and administration of the specific yard
requirements established in this Chapter shall be subject to the following
general provisions:
   (a)    Corner Lots. When a lot is located at the intersection of two (2) or
more streets, the requirements for a front yard shall apply as to each part
abutting a street.
   (b)    Front Yard Exception. In "R-2", "R-3" or "R-4" Districts, when fifty
percent (50%) or more of the developed frontage in one (1) block on one (1)
side of the street has front yards that are greater or less than the minimum
front yard required, any building to be erected thereon shall not project
beyond the average of the existing front yards, except that a minimum front
yard of fifteen (15) feet shall be maintained in all instances.
   (c)    Architectural Projections. Cornices, eaves, sills, canopies or
similar architectural projections may project into required side yards no more
than thirty (30) inches. Bay windows, chimneys and open structures such as
porches and balconies shall be considered a part of the building to which
attached and shall not project into the required minimum front, side or rear
yard.
   (d)    Existing Plats with Preliminary or Final Approval. Lots existing
before, and plats which have received preliminary or final approval prior to,
the date of the adoption of this Zoning Code shall be excepted from the side
yard requirements of this Chapter if a minimum six (6) foot side yard is
observed in any case.
   (e)    Driveways. In all Residential Districts (R1 – RM), driveways shall be
a minimum of five (5) feet from the side and rear property lines.
   (f)    Setbacks from Public Watercourses and Drainage Ditches. No building
or structure shall be permitted closer than fifteen (15) feet from a public
watercourse or drainage ditch as measured from the top of the slope.
      (Ord. 27-2016.  Passed 3-1-16.)
   (g)   Accessory Uses; Off-Street Parking; Material Storage in Front Yard. 
No accessory use or structure, off-street parking facility or material or
equipment storage shall be located in the required front yard without the
approval of the Board of Zoning Appeals.  (Ord.  103-2007.  Passed 7-10-07.)
   (h)   Parking of Disabled Vehicles.  The parking of a disabled vehicle
within the corporate limits for a period of more than seven (7) days shall be
prohibited, except where such vehicle is stored in an enclosed garage or other
accessory building, provided there is no business conducted while such vehicle
is stored or parked.  Those who operate an automobile repair business shall not
permit vehicles to remain outside a building more than thirty (30) days. 
Extended term parking facilities for automobile repair businesses shall be
enclosed with a six (6) foot high solid fence or screening.  (Ord.  33-2009. 
Passed 3-3-09.)
1230.03  MAXIMUM BUILDING HEIGHT.
   The following provisions shall apply to buildings located in A1, C4, OS, I1,
I2, INS and PBP zoning districts within the City of Perrysburg.
   (a)   The Board of Zoning Appeals may grant a height variance for any
portion of a building that is taller than the maximum permitted height
specified in Chapter
1230 “Intensity & Dimensional Standards” providing the variance does not exceed
50% of the maximum height specified in Chapter
1230.
   (b)   The height regulations of Chapter
1230 “Intensity & Dimensional Standards” shall not apply to communication
towers, monuments, water/cooling towers, ornamental towers and spires,
chimneys, silos, elevator bulkheads, smoke stacks, conveyors and other similar
items as determined by the Planning and Zoning Administrator.
      (Ord. 70-2017.  Passed 7-11-17.)
CHAPTER 1235
Special Approval Uses
1235.01   Purpose.
1235.02   General provisions.
1235.03   Amendments or denial of a special approval use.
1235.04   Special approval uses.
 
1235.01  PURPOSE.
   The development and execution of this Chapter is based upon the division of
the City into Districts within which the uses of land and buildings and the
bulk and location of buildings and structures in relation to the land are
substantially uniform. It is recognized, however, that there are special
approval uses which, because of their unique characteristics, cannot be
properly classified in any particular district or districts without
consideration, in each case, of the impact of those uses upon neighboring land.
These uses include uses both publicly operated or traditionally affected with a
public interest and uses entirely private in character, but of such a nature
that their operation may give rise to unique problems with respect to their

the relief sought.
         B.   The application for a reasonable accommodation use shall include
the following:

   (ss)   Sexually Oriented Business:   Sexually oriented businesses require
special supervision from the City of Perrysburg in order to protect and
preserve the health, safety, morals and welfare of the patrons and employees of
the businesses as well as the citizens of Perrysburg. The City finds that
sexually oriented businesses are frequently used for unlawful sexual
activities, including prostitution and sexual liaisons of a casual nature. The
concern over sexually transmitted diseases is a legitimate health concern that
demands reasonable regulation of sexually oriented businesses in the specified
manner, and expanded authority for reasonable regulation of sexually oriented
businesses by local governments, in order to protect the health and well-being
of the citizens. Minimal regulations enacted by the City of Perrysburg are a
legitimate and reasonable means of accountability to ensure that operators of
sexually oriented businesses comply with reasonable regulations and to ensure
that operators do not knowingly allow their establishments to be used as places
of illegal sexual activity or solicitation. There is convincing documented
evidence that sexually oriented businesses, because of their very nature, have
a deleterious effect on both the existing businesses around them and the
surrounding residential areas adjacent to them, cause increased crime,
particularly in the overnight hours, and downgrade property values.
      (1)    Purpose: The purpose of this section is to regulate Sexually
Oriented Businesses through the application of uniform zoning and licensing
requirements to minimize and control these adverse effects by regulating
sexually oriented businesses in the specified manner. By minimizing and
controlling these adverse effects, the City of Perrysburg seeks to protect the
health, safety, and welfare of the citizenry; protect the citizens from
increased crime; preserve the quality of life; preserve the property values and
character of surrounding neighborhoods; and deter the spread of urban blight.
It is not the intent of the City of Perrysburg in enacting this Code to
suppress or authorize the suppression of any speech activities protected by the
First Amendment, but to enact content-neutral statutes that address the
secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses. Also, it is not the intent
of the City of Perrysburg to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene
material, and the City recognizes that state and federal law prohibits the
distribution of obscene materials and expects and encourages state law
enforcement officials to enforce state obscenity statutes against any such
illegal activities in this State.

   (yy)   Institutional Uses:  The Special Approval Use is intended to promote
the design and development that is built to human scale, encourage attractive
street fronts and accommodate pedestrians while also accommodating vehicular
movement.  It is desirable that there be a base level of quality architecture
of scale, color and material that will allow a project to blend into its
setting and build upon the existing aesthetic  identity of an area.  Building
shapes can be articulated to provide a sense of human scale at the ground level
that is inviting to the public through the application of horizontal and
vertical patterns expressed by architectural features such as cornices,
columns, windows, doors or variations in massing.
   Review and approval is intended to permit flexibility in site development
and in the design and arrangement of buildings.  In addition, it is intended to
protect the integrity of adjacent neighborhoods while creating efficient,
functional and attractive areas that incorporate a high level of amenities and
meet public objectives for protection and preservation of Perrysburg’s
neighborhoods.  The provisions are intended to ensure appropriate uses and
structure within institutional areas and between institutional areas and areas
adjacent to them.  The provisions are specifically intended to:
   •   maintain the integrity of existing residential neighborhoods and protect
such areas from the adverse land use impacts sometimes associated with
institutional uses;
   •   ensure safe and adequate pedestrian and vehicular movements:
   •   offer predictability for institutions as they contemplate expansion and
improvement efforts; and
   •   offer a predictable framework for the City in its efforts to make sound
public investment decisions.
      (1)   It is consistent with adopted plans of the City and the stated
purposes of this Zoning Code.
      (2)   Complies with all applicable standards of this Zoning Code.
      (3)   Will not result in significant adverse impacts to other property in
the vicinity of the subject property or to the natural environment.
      (4)   Any differences in appearance or scale from the surrounding area
will be mitigated through setbacks, screening, landscaping or other design
features.
      (5)   Has adequate mitigation measures for any other identified adverse
impacts.
      (6)   Uses shall be subject to site plan review to assure compatibility
with surrounding areas.
      (7)   An such use shall be so located and developed so as not to create a
nuisance to abutting property, and so as to be neither injurious to the
surrounding neighborhoods nor contrary to the spirit and purpose of this Zoning
Code.
      (8)   All buildings shall be harmonious in appearance with the
surrounding area and shall be similar in design and appearance to other
buildings on the same development site.
      (9)   Lighting of outdoor activities shall be shielded from adjacent
residential areas.
      (10)   No building or outdoor storage area shall be closer than fifty
(50) feet to any property or street right-of-way line.
      (11)   Facilities shall provide off-street parking and passenger loading
areas at least twenty- five (25) feet from residential lot lines.
      (12)   Will not have significant adverse impacts on the livability of
nearby residential property due to:  noise, glare from lights, late-night
operations, odors, litter, privacy, traffic and other safety issues.
      (13)   After review, the Planning Commission shall make a recommendation
to the City Council.  City Council shall hold a public hearing with respect to
the proposed use, in accordance with the same procedures as provided for in
Chapter
1285,  shall review and decide whether or not the use will be permitted in
accordance with the criteria of this Zoning Code and the procedures of Chapter
1285.  City Council may require an agreement between the City and the applicant
in order to guarantee specified improvements and City Council may impose fees
and/or require escrows related to the project. 
         (Ord. 150-2007.  Passed 10-2-07.)
   (zz)   Landmark Feature/Signage.  Landmarks featuring signage are exempt
from the provisions of the zoning code (including the sign code) but shall
require City Council approval in accordance with the criteria of the Special
Approval Use (SAU).  No Landmark Feature/Signage shall be approved by the 
Planning Commission unless it shall find the following:
      (1)   The feature utilizes materials that are of high quality, and are
arranged in a way to be complementary to its surroundings.
      (2)   The feature provides a broad interest or benefit to the public.
      (3)   Any signage or promotion of private enterprise does not in any way
dominate the visual impact of the structure or property.

1240.01  PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT; PURPOSE, APPLICABLE REGULATIONS.
   (a)   The Planned Unit Development (PUD) option is intended to permit, with
City approval, private or public development which is substantially in accord
with the goals and objectives of the Comprehensive Plan.
   (b)   The development permitted under this Chapter shall be considered as an
optional means of development only upon terms agreeable to the City.
   (c)   Use of the PUD option will permit flexibility in the regulation of
land development by: (1) Encouraging innovation through an overall development
plan to provide variety in design and layout. (2) Achieving economy and
efficiency in the use of land, natural resources, energy and in the provision
of public services and utilities. (3) Encouraging the creation of useful open
spaces particularly suited to the needs of the parcel in question. (4)
Providing appropriate housing, employment, service and shopping opportunities
suited to the needs of the residents of the City.
   (d)   It is further intended that the Planned Unit Development may be used
to: (1) Permit nonresidential uses of residentially zoned areas. (2) Permit
residential uses of non-residentially zoned areas. (3) Permit densities or lot
sizes which are different from the applicable district. (4) Permit the mixing
of land uses that would otherwise not be permitted; provided that other
objectives are met and the resulting development would promote the public
health, safety and welfare.
   (e)   It is further intended that the development will be laid out so that
the various land uses and building bulk will relate to each other and to
adjoining existing and planned uses in such a way that they will be compatible
with no material adverse impact of one use on another.
(Ord. 24-2006.  Passed 3-7-06.)
1240.02  DEFINITIONS.
   The term "Planned Unit Development" (PUD) means a specific parcel of land or
several contiguous parcels of land, for which a comprehensive physical plan
meeting the requirements of this Chapter, establishing functional use areas,
density patterns, a fixed system of streets (where necessary) provisions for
public utilities, drainage and other essential services and similar factors
necessary or incidental to development which has been approved by the City
Council and which has been, is being or will be developed in accordance with
the approved plan.
(Ord. 24-2006.  Passed 3-7-06.)
1240.03  CRITERIA FOR QUALIFICATION.
   In order to qualify for the Planned Unit Development option, it must be
demonstrated that all of the following criteria will be met:
   (a)   The PUD option may be effectuated only in the R, RM, C, OS and I
Districts.
   (b)   The use of this option shall not be for the sole purpose of avoiding
the applicable zoning requirements. Any permission given for any activity or
building or use not normally permitted shall result in an improvement to the
public health, safety and welfare in the area affected.
   (c)   The PUD shall not be utilized in situations where the same land use
objectives can be accomplished by the application of conventional zoning
provisions or standards. Problems or constraints presented by applicable zoning
provisions shall be identified in the PUD application.
   (d)   The Planned Unit Development option may be effectuated only when the
proposed land use will not materially add service and facility loads beyond
those contemplated in the Comprehensive Plan unless the proponent can
demonstrate to the sole satisfaction of the City that such added loads will be
accommodated or mitigated by the proponent as part of the Planned Unit
Development.
   (e)   The PUD shall not be allowed solely as a means of increasing density
or as a substitute for a variance request; such objectives should be pursued
through the normal zoning process by requesting a zoning change or variance.
   (f)   The Planned Unit Development must meet, as a minimum, two (2) of the
following objectives of the City:
      (1)   To permanently preserve open space or natural features because of
their exceptional characteristics or because it can provide a permanent
transition or buffer between land uses.
      (2)   To permanently establish land use patterns which are compatible or
which will protect existing or planned uses.
      (3)   To accept dedication or set aside open space areas in perpetuity.
      (4)   To provide alternative uses for parcels which can provide
transition buffers to residential areas.
      (5)   To guarantee the provision of a public improvement which could not
otherwise be required that would further the public health, safety, or welfare,
protect existing or future uses from the impact of a proposed use, or alleviate
an existing or potential problem relating to public facilities.
      (6)   To promote the goals and objectives of the Comprehensive Plan.
      (7)   To foster the aesthetic appearance of the City through quality
building design and site development; the provision of trees and landscaping
beyond minimum requirements; the preservation of unique and/or historic sites
or structures; and the provision of open space or other desirable features of a
site beyond minimum requirements.
      (8)   To bring about redevelopment of sites where an orderly change of
use or requirements is determined to be desirable.
         (Ord. 24-2006.  Passed 3-7-06.)
1240.04  USES PERMITTED.

1240.13  OPEN SPACE PLAN; PURPOSE, APPLICABLE REGULATIONS.
(Ord. 24-2006.  Passed 3-7-06.)
1240.14  PURPOSE.
   The purpose of a subdivision Open Space Plan is to promote the preservation
of open space while allowing a reduction in lot sizes in instances where the
reduction would be compatible with lot sizes existing in the surrounding area.
In reviewing a subdivision Open Space Plan, the Planning Commission and City
Council shall consider the following objectives:
   (a)   To encourage appropriate relationships in orientation and size of
yards and open spaces with other developed parcels in the area.
   (b)   To provide a more desirable living environment by preserving the
natural character of wetlands, stands of trees, brooks, hills and similar
natural assets.
   (c)   To encourage developers to use a more creative approach in the
development of residential areas.
   (d)   To encourage the provision of open space within reasonable distance of
all lot development of the subdivision and to further encourage the development
of recreational facilities or preservation of natural environmental assets and
to lessen the impact on existing park and open space available in the City.
   (e)   To encourage a more efficient, aesthetic and desirable use of open
area while recognizing a reduction in development costs and by allowing the
developer to bypass natural obstacles on the site.
      (Ord. 24-2006.  Passed 3-7-06.)
1240.15  MODIFICATION TO STANDARDS.
   (a)   Modifications of the standards as outlined in Chapter
1230 may be made in the districts when the following conditions are met:
      (1)   Lot dimensions may be reduced in accordance with the following
schedule, provided that the number of residential lots shall be no greater than
if the land area to be subdivided was developed in the minimum square foot lot
areas as required for each one-family district under Chapter
1230. All calculations of density for residential development shall be
predicated upon the one-family districts having the following gross densities
(including roads):
Modifications to Standards
 
                              Not Less Than
Districts          Dwellings
                   Per Acre   Lot Width Lot Depth
R-1 (Utilities)    1.7        90        170
R-1 (No Utilities) 1.2        120       195

R-4                4.0        60        130
 
      (2)    For each square foot of land gained under the provisions of (1)
above within a residential subdivision, through the reduction of lot sizes
below the minimum requirements as outlined in Chapter
1230, the equal amounts of land shall be dedicated in a manner approved by the
City.
      (3)    The land area necessary to meet the minimum requirements of the
intensity and dimensional standards of Chapter
1230 shall not include bodies of water or wetlands which would make land
unsuitable for recreation purposes, except that lakes or ponds, when landscaped
and maintained as portions of larger open space areas within the development,
may be included in density computations. All land reserved for recreation shall
maintain its natural drainage. The entire area may, however, be located in a
floodplain.
      (4)    A parcel to be dedicated for the common use of the subdivision
shall in no instance be fewer than five (5) acres and shall be in a location
and shape approved by the City, provided that a parcel divided by a road or

the subdivision for those lots not bordering on such dedicated areas by means
of streets or pedestrian access ways.
      (6)    Under this subdivision open space approach, the proprietor shall
dedicate sufficient park area so that each final plat is within maximum density
requirements; provided, however, that the entire park area within a single
block shall be dedicated as a whole.
      (7)    Application for approval of the subdivision open space plan shall
be submitted at the time of submission of the preliminary subdivision plat for
approval as required by the City of Perrysburg subdivision regulations.

         (Ord. 24-2006.  Passed 3-7-06.)
1240.17  PRELIMINARY SITE PLAN REVIEW PROCEDURES.
   Planning Commission Approval: If the Planning Commission is satisfied that
the proposed subdivision Open Space Plan meets the letter and spirit of the
Zoning Code and subdivision regulations and should be approved, it shall give
tentative approval to the plan with the conditions upon which such approval
should be based.
   (a)   The Planning Commission shall give notice of the Public Hearing in
accordance with provisions of Section
1270.04.
   (b)   If the Planning Commission is satisfied that the proposal meets the
letter and spirit of the Zoning Code and should be approved, it shall set forth
any conditions upon which such recommended approval is based. If the Planning
Commission is not satisfied that the proposal meets the letter and spirit of
this Zoning Code, or finds that approval of the proposal would be detrimental
to existing development in the general area and should not be approved, it
shall record the reasons therefore in the minutes of the Planning Commission
meeting. Notice of recommendation of approval or disapproval of the proposal
together with copies of all layouts and other relevant information shall be
forwarded to City Council.
   (c)   City Council shall review the recommendation of the Planning
Commission together with relevant material submitted by the applicant. City
Council shall take action to approve or disapprove the preliminary plan or may
refer such plan back to the Planning Commission with direction for further
review.
      (Ord. 24-2006.  Passed 3-7-06.)
1240.18  CLUSTER HOUSING.
   The intent of this Chapter is to permit the development of one-family
residential patterns which, through design innovation, will provide for an
alternative means for development of single family areas. To accomplish this,
modification to the one-family residential standards, as outlined in Chapter
1230 may be permitted in R-1, R-2, R-3 and R-4 districts.
(Ord. 24-2006.  Passed 3-7-06.)
1240.19  DENSITY STANDARDS.
   In permitted residential districts, the requirements of the intensity and
dimensional standards in Chapter
1230 may be waived and the attaching of one-family dwelling units may be
permitted.  (Ord. 24-2006.  Passed 3-7-06.)
1240.20  CONDITIONS AND QUALIFICATIONS.
   (a)   The City may approve the clustering or attaching of buildings on
parcels of land under single ownership and control, which, in the opinion of
the City, have characteristics that would make sound physical development under
the normal subdivision approach impractical because of parcel size, shape or
dimension, because it is located in a transitional use area, because the site
has natural characteristics which are worth preserving or which make platting
difficult. In approving an area for cluster development, the City shall find at
least one (1) of the following conditions to exist:
      (1)    The parcel contains floodplain or wetland soil conditions that
result in a substantial portion of the total area of the parcel being
unbuildable.
      (2)    The parcel contains natural assets that would be preserved through
the use of cluster development. Such assets may include natural stands of large
trees, land that serves as a natural habitat for wildlife, unique topographic
features or other natural assets that should be preserved.
      (3)    The parcel has water frontage which would be preserved and
enhanced by the clustering of housing units.
      (4)    The parcel is shaped in such a way that the angles formed by its
boundaries make a subdivision difficult to achieve.
      (5)    The parcel has a substantial portion of the parcels’ perimeter
bordered by land that is located in non-residential districts.
   (b)   In order to qualify a parcel for development for cluster housing, the
City shall determine that the parcel has characteristics as stated in Section
1240.20 above and the request shall be supported by written and/or graphic
documentation, prepared by a landscape architect, engineer, professional
community planner, architect or environmental design professional. Such
documentation shall include the following as appropriate: soil test borings,
floodplain map, topographic map of maximum two (2) foot contour level and an
inventory of natural assets including plant materials.
(Ord. 24-2006.  Passed 3-7-06.)
1240.21  PERMITTED DENSITIES.
   (a)   Dwelling unit densities shall not utilize storm water detention basins
and no more than twenty-five percent (25%) of any wetlands in computing the
maximum permitted densities. The maximum permitted gross densities, including
roads, are as follows:
   (b)   For those areas qualifying under subsections the following dwelling
unit densities shall apply.
Modifications to Standards
 
Districts          Dwellings Per Acre
R-1 (Utilities)    2.0
R-1 (No Utilities) 1.4
R-2 (Utilities)    2.6
R-2 (No Utilities) 1.8
R-3                3.6
R-4                4.6
 
   (c)   Up to fifty percent (50%) of water bodies within the parcel may be
included in the computation of density provided that the land adjacent to the
water is substantially developed as open space.  (Ord. 24-2006.  Passed 3-7-
06.)
1240.22  DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS.
   In areas meeting the criteria of this Chapter, the minimum yard setback and
minimum lot sizes per unit as required in Chapter
1230 may be waived and the attaching of one-family dwelling units, one to
another, may be permitted when the homes are attached by means of one of the
following:
   (a)   Through a common party wall forming interior room space which does not
have over seventy-five percent (75%) of its length in common with an abutting
dwelling wall, excluding garage;
   (b)   By means of architectural wall detail that does not form interior room
space;
   (c)   Through abutting garage party walls of adjacent structures;
   (d)   The number of units attached in this manner shall not exceed four (4)
in any one (1) building.
      (Ord. 24-2006.  Passed 3-7-06.)
1240.23  YARD REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Spacing between groups of attached buildings or between each group of
four (4) unattached buildings shall be equal to at least thirty (30) feet
measured between the nearest points of adjacent buildings. The minimum distance

1240.24  OPEN SPACE AND TRANSITION.
   (a)   The area in open space (including recreation areas and water as
specified in Section
1240.21(c)  above) accomplished through the use of one-family cluster
development shall represent at lease fifteen percent (15%) of the total parcel
area. The provision of walks, trails and recreation facilities is required
within the open space areas.
   (b)   In order to provide an orderly transition of density, where the parcel
proposed for use as a cluster development abuts a one-family residential
district, the City shall determine that the abutting one-family district is
effectively buffered by means of one (1) of the following within the cluster
development:
      (1)    Single-family lots subject to the standards of the schedule of
regulations.
      (2)    Detached one-family buildings with setbacks as required by the
schedule of regulations for the applicable residential district.
      (3)    Open or recreation space not less than one hundred (100) feet in
depth.
      (4)    A densely planted buffer not less than fifty (50) feet in depth.
         (Ord. 24-2006.  Passed 3-7-06.)
1240.25  QUALIFICATION FOR CLUSTER DEVELOPMENT.
   (a)   Application to the City for qualification of a parcel for cluster
development shall include documentation sustaining one (1) or more of the
characteristics outlined in Section
1240.20.
   (b)   The City may make a preliminary determination as to whether or not a
parcel qualifies for the cluster option under one (1) of the provisions of this
Chapter based upon the documentation submitted. Such review is not a
requirement, but may be requested of the owner.
   (c)   A preliminary determination by the City that a parcel qualifies for
cluster development does not ensure approval. It does, however, give an initial
indication as to whether or not a petitioner should proceed to prepare a site
plan.
(Ord. 24-2006.  Passed 3-7-06.)
1240.26  PRELIMINARY SITE PLAN CLUSTER APPROVAL.
   (a)   A preliminary site plan shall be submitted to the Planning Commission
and City Council for review which includes information called for in this
Chapter.
   (b)   The Planning Commission shall review the preliminary site plan at a

   (e)   The Planning Commission shall give notice of the Public Hearing in
accordance with provisions of Section
1270.04.
   (f)   If the Planning Commission is satisfied that the proposal meets the
letter and spirit of the Zoning Code and should be approved, it shall set forth
any conditions upon which such recommended approval is based. If the Planning
Commission is not satisfied that the proposal meets the letter and spirit of
this Zoning Code, or finds that approval of the proposal would be detrimental
to existing development in the general area and should not be approved, it
shall record the reasons therefore in the minutes of the Planning Commission
meeting. Notice of recommendation of approval or disapproval of the proposal
together with copies of all layouts and other relevant information shall be
forwarded to City Council.
   (g)   City Council shall review the recommendation of the Planning
Commission together with relevant material submitted by the applicant. City
Council shall take action to approve or disapprove the preliminary plan or may
refer such plan back to the Planning Commission with direction for further
review.
(Ord. 24-2006.  Passed 3-7-06.)
1240.27  FINAL SITE PLAN.
   (a)   After approval of a preliminary plan and cluster option, a final site
plan shall be submitted in accordance with the requirements of Chapter
1260.
   (b)   If the final site plan is approved such plan shall be submitted to the
City for the preparation of agreements setting forth the conditions upon which
the approval is based. Such agreement shall be finalized and approved by City
Council prior to the issuance of any zoning permits. Agreement and guarantees

1240.16 for open space subdivisions.
   (c)   As a condition for the approval of the final site plan and open space
plan, the applicant may be required to deposit cash or escrows, in the amount
of the estimated cost of the proposed improvements. Actual development of the
open space shall be carried out concurrently with the construction of dwelling
units. The City may require landscape improvement for the entire site frontage
where such site abuts public streets as an initial site improvement even
through such frontage is not part of any early stage of project development.
(Ord. 24-2006.  Passed 3-7-06.)
1240.28  PLANNED BUSINESS PARK.
   The creation of this district is intended to provide for developable areas
where a compatible mix of commercial, industrial, office and institutional land
uses may be located in a business park- like setting permitting flexibility in
design and dimensional requirements within a planned development. 
(Ord. 24-2006.  Passed 3-7-06.)
1240.29  PLANNED BUSINESS PARK SITE REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   A Planned Business Park is a tract of land intended to be developed in
an integrated manner for large scale planned developments. Noncontiguous
parcels and lots may be included in an original established site, provided that
the acreage of such noncontiguous parcels and lots shall not be used in
calculating the minimum requirements of fifteen (15) acres for a site and
provided further that all other requirements of the Zoning Code are met.
Contiguous parcels and lots may be added to an established site, provided that
all other requirements of the Zoning Code are met. Noncontiguous parcels and
lots may be added to an established site, provided that the noncontiguous
parcels and lots are situated in the same plat or revised plat in which all or
part of an established site is located, and provided further that all
requirements of the Zoning Code are met.
   (b)   The owners and developers of such a tract shall create an
Architectural Review Committee (ARC), which shall formulate Development
Standards to be utilized for the orderly development of the PBP.
(Ord. 24-2006.  Passed 3-7-06.)
1240.30  PERMITTED AND SPECIAL APPROVAL USES.
   All permitted and special approval uses listed in Chapter
1225 for PBP districts shall apply to the PBP District. Uses not specifically
listed or not interpreted by the Planning Commission to be included

developers shall develop and submit deed restrictions which shall include the
Development Standards, protective covenants, and other legal statements or
devices to be used to control the use, development and maintenance of the land
and the improvements thereon, including those areas which are commonly owned
and maintained. These restrictions shall be a part of the zoning application
and shall be considered in the zoning approval process and shall be enforced by
the ARC.
   (c)   The ARC shall create a set of Development Standards for development of
the PBP. These Development Standards shall establish specific requirements for
the PBP such as landscaping, mounding and screening, yard and building
placement, exterior illumination, signage, architectural design, color schemes
and building materials approved for use within the PBP. These Development
Standards shall remain in effect as long as the tract in question is zoned PBP.
In no case shall Development Standards, amendments thereto, or any development
plans result in standards or requirements which are less restrictive than those
established in the Zoning Code unless specifically stated otherwise in this
Chapter. These Development Standards shall be made a part of the deed
restrictions, protective covenants and other legal statements or devices of the
park.
   (d)   At the time a request is made to zone a parcel PBP, Development
Standards shall be submitted and be subject to the procedures for changes and
amendments as stated in Chapter

procedures specified in Section
1295.04. All dedicated roadways and utility installations shall require a final
plat as stipulated in Section
1295.07. All such improvements shall meet the requirements stipulated in
Section
1295.05 and all other applicable requirements of the Zoning Code.
   (b)   No improvement of any kind shall be installed, erected, placed,
constructed, assembled or permitted to remain on any of the properties within
the PBP until and unless the proposed use and nature, shape, size, color,
architectural design, material, location and landscaping, paving plans, curbing
and storm drainage have been submitted in writing to the ARC and the ARC has
approved in writing such development plans and specifications as conforming to
the Development Standards and PBP.
   (c)   A majority vote of the ARC on conformity of the submitted plans and
specifications with the Development Standards and the PBP regulations shall be
the final determining factor for the approval or disapproval of the proposed
improvements by the ARC. The ARC shall attach any conditions they deem
appropriate as part of the approval process.
   (d)   Development plans submitted to the ARC for approval shall include:

(Ord. 25-2006.  Passed 3-7-06.)
1245.12  (RESERVED).
1245.29  CORRIDOR OVERLAY.
1245.30  PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this Chapter is to maintain the long-term mobility function
of arterial and collector roadways; to limit access and the number of conflict
points and thereby reduce the need for additional crossover locations and
traffic signals; to promote improved pedestrian and vehicular circulation; to
encourage land assembly and the most desirable use of land in accordance with
the Comprehensive Plan; to promote architectural continuity; to encourage
designs which produce a desirable relationship between individual buildings,
the circulation systems and adjacent areas; to control signage visibility
obstructions and clutter and to permit a flexible response of development to
the market as well as to provide incentives for the development of a variety of
land uses and activities of high quality.
(Ord. 25-2006.  Passed 3-7-06.)
1245.31  APPLICABILITY.
   (a)   The boundaries of the Corridor Overlay are those non-residential
properties abutting State Route 25 from the Maumee River to the City Corporate
line.
   (b)   Access and internal circulation in the Corridor Overlay shall not
include recorded subdivisions consisting of single-family detached residential
structures.
   (c)   All uses and structures proposed for properties included within the
Corridor Overlay shall be permitted, subject to the submittal and approval of a
site plan, including a sign package. Provided, however, that:
      (1)    Where the affected property has an approved Site Plan and Access
Plan, internal lots not located next to a Corridor Overlay Road and which
utilize internal streets, shall be subject only to the submittal and approval
of an Access Plan which complies with the approved site plan.
      (2)    With the exception of corner lots, any lot with frontage along a
Corridor Overlay Road, but which does not take access from said road, shall be
subject to the setbacks prescribed herein only along the Corridor Overlay Road
and setbacks not along the Corridor Overlay Road shall conform to the
requirements of the underlying zoning district.
      (3)    For purposes of this Chapter, a “Corridor Overlay Road” means and
refers to any street or road right-of-way, which lies within the Corridor
Overlay, and which is designated an arterial or collector in the City’s
Comprehensive Plan.
   (d)   Lots within the Corridor Overlay which are internal lots subject to an
approved site plan, and which are adjacent to a public internal street rather
than a Corridor Overlay Road shall be subject only to the access management
requirements of this Chapter.
   (e)   Where property within a Corridor Overlay has recorded covenants or
declarations which specify architectural guidelines, and which have an approved
ARC (Architectural Review Committee), the City shall review the guidelines to
determine whether they are stricter than those set forth in this Chapter. If
the guidelines are stricter than the standards established in this Chapter, the
approval of the ARC shall constitute compliance with the requirements of this
Chapter.  (Ord. 25-2006.  Passed 3-7-06.)
1245.32  ACCESS AND INTERNAL CIRCULATION.
   The purpose and intent of this Chapter is to maximize the functional
capacity and maintain the level of service of arterial roadways; to minimize
the number of access points to major arterials and other public rights-of-way;
to promote the sharing of access and the ability to travel between sites; to
provide pedestrian circulation networks among residential, commercial and
recreational areas; and to enhance safety and convenience for uses of the
corridor.
   (a)   Access To Major Arterial Roads:
      (1)   Any parcel or lot having frontage along an arterial and in
existence prior to the effective date of this Zoning Code shall be permitted
one (1) direct access to that major arterial road, unless an access plan is
submitted to and approved by the City for more than one (1) access.
      (2)   Direct access to major arterial roads shall be provided by one (1)
or more of the following means for lots or parcels not permitted direct access
to the arterial thoroughfare:
         A.   Access to the site may be provided by an existing or planned
public street;
         B.   Access to the site may be provided via the internal circulation
of a shopping center, an office complex, or similar group of buildings having
access in accordance with an approved access plan; and no additional direct
access shall be provided to the site from a public street intended to carry
through traffic over and above those entrances which may exist to provide
access to the shopping center, office complex or similar group of buildings.
Access through side or rear setbacks is encouraged, provided that the access is
internal and generally perpendicular to the setback; access to the site may be
provided by a service drive and/or shared access which provides controlled
access to the site.
         C.   The access plan shall demonstrate the ability to provide adequate
access to surrounding properties via cross-easement agreement(s) or document of
same as shared access and/or public road(s). An access plan shall be submitted
and approved prior to Planned Unit Development, Preliminary Plat or Site Plan
approval. Such access plan shall be drawn to scale, including dimensions and
distances, and clearly delineate the traffic circulation system and the
pedestrian circulation system as coordinated with adjacent properties,
including the location and width of all streets, driveways, access aisles,
entrance to parking areas, walkways and bicycle paths.
         D.   Sites shall be designed to achieve direct and convenient
pedestrian and vehicular circulation between adjacent properties, unless
otherwise required by the City.
            (Ord. 25-2006.  Passed 3-7-06.)
1245.33  DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.
   (a)   Utility Lines: All utility lines such as electric, telephone, CATV or
other similar lines shall be installed underground. This requirement shall
apply to lines serving individual sites as well as to utility lines necessary
within the project. All junction and access boxes shall be screened with
appropriate landscaping. All utility pad fixtures and meters should be shown on
the site plan. The necessity for utility connections, meter boxes, etc., should
be recognized and integrated with the architectural elements of the site plan.
   (b)   Loading Areas: Sites shall be designed and buildings shall be oriented
so that loading areas are visually screened from any of the project perimeters
adjoining any agricultural or residential district or any public right-of-way.
Screening shall be in accordance with landscaping requirements specified within
this Zoning Code.
   (c)   Building Materials:  No building facade (whether front, side or rear)
shall consist of architectural materials which differ in composition,
appearance or detail from any other facade of the same building. The intent of
this requirement is not to preclude the use of different materials on different
building facades (which would be acceptable if representative of good
architectural design), but rather to preclude the use of inferior materials on
sides which face adjoining property and thus might adversely impact pedestrian
activity, existing or future development and property values. Mechanical
equipment, whether ground-level or rooftop, shall be shielded and screened from
public view and designed to be perceived as an integral part of the building.
   (d)   Exterior Lighting:  All exterior lights shall be arranged and
installed to comply with the exterior lighting provisions of this Zoning Code.
   (e)   Parking Lots Adjacent to Public Right-of-Way: Parking lots, which have
frontage along a public right-of-way, shall be screened with a wall and
landscaping. The screen wall shall be located at least three (3) to four (4)
feet from the property line and this area is to be landscaped with small shrubs
and perennial flowers. The height of the screening wall shall be thirty-eight
(38) to forty-two (42) inches in height.
   (f)   Landscaping Along Corridor: The area of land between the property line
and the curb, typically known as the terrace, shall be landscaped with street
trees. The spacing of these trees will depend on the species and the distance
between trees and the species shall be determined by the City.
   (g)   Driveways And Parking Areas:  Driveways and parking areas shall be
paved with concrete, bituminous concrete or other similar material. Concrete
curb and gutters shall be installed around the perimeter of all driveways and
parking areas. Drainage shall be designed so as not to interfere with
pedestrian traffic.
   (h)   Outside Storage Areas: Outdoor storage shall be as permitted by the
outdoor storage standards of underlying zoning districts; provided, that all
outdoor storage areas shall be visually screened from public streets, internal
roadways and adjacent property. Screening shall consist of materials specified
in this Zoning Code. All such screening shall be of sufficient height to screen
storage areas from view. Outdoor storage shall include the parking of all
company-owned and operated vehicles with the exception of passenger vehicles.
(Ord. 25-2006.  Passed 3-7-06.)
1245.34  LIMITATION OF SIGNS.
   The purpose and intent of this Chapter is to regulate the use of publicly
visible displays or graphics; to protect and enhance the character of arterial
roadways and surrounding areas; to prevent diminishing property values within
these areas; to safeguard the public use and nature of arterial roadways; and
to minimize visual distractions to motorists along public roads.
   (a)   The following shall apply to all signs in the Corridor Overlay:
      (1)    Signs and advertising structures shall not obstruct any window,
door, fire escape, stairway, ladder or opening intended to provide light, air
or ingress and egress for any building or structure.
      (2)    Sign lighting shall be positioned and shielded so as not to impair
the vision of any motor vehicle operator or cause any direct glare into or upon
any property other than the property to which the sign may be accessory.
      (3)    A unified system of signage and graphics shall be designed for
each individual development. Letter style, graphic display and color shall be
analogous for all signage and graphics within an individual development.
Signage concepts should be considered during the design of buildings so that
signage and graphics are architecturally incorporated into those buildings and
the site they inhabit. Size, height, location, material and color should
strongly relate to building and site design.
      (4)   All new and replacement signs within the Corridor Overlay from the
effective date of this Zoning Code shall be limited to a freestanding sign no
higher than six (6) feet, pursuant to the specifications outlined in the sign
standards of Section
1250.29 -
1250.39.  (Ord.  82-2016.  Passed 9-6-16.)
1245.41  MUNICIPAL UTILITY OVERLAY.
1245.42  PURPOSE.
   To encourage reasonable and planned growth of the City and the greater
Perrysburg community or to remediate a public health matter, the City may
extend municipal utilities, such as water and sanitary sewer, outside of the
City of Perrysburg’s corporate limits but within the City’s public utilities
service areas.
(Ord. 25-2006.  Passed 3-7-06.)
1245.43  REQUIREMENTS TO EXTEND MUNICIPAL SERVICES.

his or her property.
   (c)   Upon receipt of the owner's consent to the listing on the local
register, the Historic Landmarks Commission shall make a recommendation
concerning the designation of the property to the Planning Commission. After
receipt of the Historic Landmarks Commission's recommendation, the Planning
Commission shall make a recommendation concerning the designation of the
property to City Council. After receipt of the Planning Commission's
recommendation, City Council shall consider such recommendation and vote on the
designation of the area, place, site, building, structure, object or work of

   (d)   If the owner of individual properties refuses or declines to give his

         (Ord. 25-2006.  Passed 3-7-06.)
1245.51  GUIDELINES FOR REVIEWING APPLICATIONS;  REHABILITATION STANDARDS.
   (a)   Standards of Review: In considering an application for a Certificate
of Appropriateness, the Historic Landmarks Commission shall be guided by the
following general guidelines:
      (1)    Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible use
for a property which requires minimal alteration of the building, structure or
site and its environment or to use a property for its originally intended
purpose.
      (2)    The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building,
structure or site and its environment shall not be destroyed. The removal or
alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural feature should
be avoided when possible.
      (3)    All buildings, structures and sites shall be recognized as
products of their own time. Alterations that have no historical basis and which
seek to create an earlier appearance shall be discouraged.
      (4)    Changes which may have taken place in the course of time are
evidence of the history and development of a building, structure or site and
its environment. These changes may have acquired significance in their own
right and such significance shall be recognized and respected.
      (5)    Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled
craftsmanship which characterize a building, structure or site shall be treated
with sensitivity.
      (6)   Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than
replaced, wherever possible. If replacement is necessary, then the new material
should match the material being replaced in composition, design, color, texture
and other visual qualities. Repair or replacement of missing architectural
features should be based on accurate duplications of features, substantiated by
historic, physical or pictorial evidence rather than on conjectural designs or
the availability of different architectural elements from other buildings or
structures.
      (7)    The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the
gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that will
damage the historic building materials shall not be undertaken.
      (8)    Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve
archaeological resources affected by or adjacent to any project.
      (9)    Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing
properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and additions do not
destroy significant historical, architectural or cultural material and when
such design is compatible with the size, scale, color, material and character
of the property, neighborhood or environment.
      (10)    Wherever possible, new additions or alterations to structures
shall be done in such a manner that if such additions or alterations were to be
removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the structure would
be unimpaired.
   (b)   Guidelines for Applying Standards of Review: The following guidelines
are designed to help individual property owners formulate plans for the
rehabilitation, preservation and continued use of historic buildings consistent
with the intent of the Secretary of the Interior's "Standards of
Rehabilitation." The guidelines pertain to buildings of all occupancy and
construction types, sizes and materials. They apply to permanent and temporary
construction on the exterior and interior of historic buildings as well as new
attached or adjacent construction.
      (1)    Techniques, treatments and methods consistent with the "Standards
for Rehabilitation" are listed as "recommended." Not all recommendations listed
under treatment will apply to each project proposal. Rehabilitation approaches,
materials and methods which may adversely affect a building’s architectural and
historic qualities, are listed as "not recommended."
      (2)    Specific information on rehabilitation and preservation technology
may be obtained by writing to the Technical Preservation Services Division,
National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior (www.cr.nps.gov/hps/tps/
tax/rhb/), or to the appropriate State Historic Preservation Officer. Advice
should also be sought from qualified professionals, including architects,

1245.52  MINIMUM MAINTENANCE REQUIRED.
   (a)   If any structure located on a Listed Property or any property located
within a Historic District is vacant or uninhabited, the owner of such property
shall provide sufficient  maintenance and upkeep for such structure to ensure
its perpetuation and to prevent its destruction by deterioration.
   (b)   The provisions of provision (a) above shall be in addition to all
other applicable provisions of the Wood County Building Code and/or the Ohio
Basic Building Code.
   (c)   The Historic Landmarks Commission, on its own initiative, may file a
petition with City Council, requesting that the City proceed to take action

this Zoning Code.
(Ord. 25-2006.  Passed 3-7-06.)
1245.53  LIMITATIONS ON ISSUANCE OF BUILDING AND DEMOLITION PERMITS.
   No construction, reconstruction, alteration or demolition of any area,
place, site, building, structure, object or work of art in any designated
Historic District or of any Listed Property shall be undertaken prior to
obtaining a Certificate of Appropriateness from the Historic Landmarks
Commission and, if applicable, a permit from the Zoning Inspector. No permit
shall be issued by the Zoning Inspector for the construction, reconstruction,
alteration or demolition of any area, place, site, building, structure, object
or work of art within a designated Historic District or for a Listed Property,
except in cases coming under the exclusions in this Chapter, unless the
application for such permit is approved by the Commission through the issuance
of a Certificate of Appropriateness in the manner prescribed in Section
1245.54.
(Ord. 25-2006.  Passed 3-7-06.)
1245.54  ISSUANCE OF CERTIFICATES OF APPROPRIATENESS.
   (a)   Before any exterior change in design, texture or material, or to
exterior features, including construction, reconstruction, alteration and
demolition of any Listed Property or of a property located within a Historic
District, can be undertaken, an applicant shall first apply for and secure a
Certificate of Appropriateness from the Historic Landmarks Commission. The
application for such Certificate shall be submitted to the Chair of the
Commission, together with such plans, specifications and other material as the
Commission may from time to time prescribe.
   (b)   The Commission shall review the application for a Certificate of
Appropriateness at its next regularly scheduled meeting, provided the
application is filed at least two (2) weeks prior to such meeting. If the
Commission determines that there will be no change in exterior design, texture,
material or exterior architectural features, it shall cause the Chair to
endorse a Certificate of Appropriateness and return the plans and
specifications to the applicant.
   (c)   If the Commission finds that there will be a change in exterior
design, texture or material, or to the exterior architectural features, the
Commission shall determine whether the proposed construction, reconstruction,
alteration or demolition is appropriate or whether it has an adverse effect
upon the purposes of this Chapter, the Historic District or the Listed
Property. In making such determination, the Commission shall refer to the
Secretary of the Interior’s “Standards for Rehabilitation,” and to any other
written design guidelines adopted by the Commission. In the case of
archeological properties, the Commission shall refer to the Advisory Council on
Historic Preservation’s “Treatment or Archeological Properties: A Handbook”.
Cost estimates shall be presented by the applicant, and these costs shall be
considered by the Commission in making a decision. It is the Commission’s
responsibility to take into consideration the feasibility of the alternatives
or choices in each situation. The Commission’s consideration of cost estimates
shall include situations when the restoration of original features of the
building is one (1) of the alternatives or choices.
   (d)   If the proposed construction, reconstruction, alteration or demolition
is determined to have no adverse effect on the Historic District or Listed
Property, and does not violate the spirit and purpose of these preservation
regulations, then the Commission Secretary shall issue the Certificate of
Appropriateness.
   (e)   If the Commission finds that such proposed construction,
reconstruction, alteration, demolition or change in design, texture, material
or exterior architectural feature will have an adverse effect on the Historic
District or Listed Property, and does violate the spirit and purpose of these
preservation regulations, then the Commission shall deny issuance of the
Certificate of Appropriateness.
   (f)   If the Commission determines that a Certificate of Appropriateness
should not be issued, it shall forthwith state in its records reasons for such
determination and may include recommendations regarding the proposed
construction, reconstruction, alteration, demolition, or change in design,
texture, material or exterior architectural feature. The Secretary of the
Commission shall notify the applicant of such determination and transmit to him
or her a certified copy of the reasons for denial and recommendations, if any,
of the Commission.
   (g)   Certificate of Appropriateness: A Certificate of Appropriateness shall
then be in effect for one (1) year from the date of issuance. If the approved
improvements have not been started within one (1) year, the Certificate of
Appropriateness shall expire. If the improvements have been started within one
(1) year from the date of issuance of a Certificate of Appropriateness, the
Certificate shall be in effect for a total of two (2) years from the date of
issuance. All such improvements must be completed prior to the expiration of
the new Certificate of Appropriateness. If the Certificate of Appropriateness
expires, a new Certificate of Appropriateness shall be required for these
improvements as prescribed in Section
1245.54.
(Ord. 25-2006.  Passed 3-7-06.)
1245.55  DEMOLITIONS.
   (a)   When the Commission is deciding whether a proposed demolition will
have an adverse effect on the Historic District or Listed Property, its
consideration shall be based on the following standards:
      (1)    Whether the property at this time has historical, cultural or
architectural significance and contributes to maintaining the character of the
historic district.
      (2)    Whether the preservation of the building will cause substantial
economic hardship for the applicant. Substantial economic hardship does not
include an applicant’s inability to maximize the return on the applicant’s
investment. Neglect of a building by its owner and its deterioration does not
create the basis for a finding of substantial economic hardship or a finding of
no reasonable use.
      (3)    Whether the building can no longer be put to a reasonable use,
including an adaptive re-use of the building.
      (4)    For demolition of entire structures, whether the proposed new use
of the property is consistent with the quality and character of the Historic
District.
      (5)    The Commission’s determination on a proposed demolition of a
building shall be based upon a balance of the foregoing factors with the burden
upon the applicant to establish that he or she is entitled to a Certificate of
Appropriateness. In making any such determination, the Commission shall be
guided by the principle that the demolition of a historic or contributing
property constitutes as irreplaceable loss to the quality and character of a
Listed Property and the Historic District. The reasoning of the Commission in
reaching any such decision and the results of its balancing of the foregoing
factors shall be clearly stated either in the minutes for the proceeding or in
a separate written report. Upon a determination by the Commission that a
building is not historically, culturally or architecturally significant or
otherwise worthy of preservation upon consideration of the foregoing factors, a
Certificate of Appropriateness for the proposed demolition shall be issued.
   (b)   If the Commission answers any of these questions affirmatively, it
shall make findings and prepare a written report with its reasons. When this
step has been completed, the Commission shall authorize the Commission
Secretary to issue the Certificate of Appropriateness.
   (c)   In applying for a Certificate of Appropriateness to demolish a
building subject to this Chapter, the applicant shall present credible evidence
to the Commission including, but not limited to, the following:
      (1)    Detailed reports and background information on the historical or
architectural significant (or lack thereof) of the building to be demolished.
      (2)    Appraisals, where deemed necessary by the Commission, showing the
present fair market value of the property; the fair market value of the
property assuming that the building has been demolished; and the fair market
value of the property assuming that the building has been restored or altered
for productive use.
      (3)    Detailed information on the economic feasibility of restoring the
building, putting the building to an alternative use or altering the building
to an alternate use.
      (4)    Where necessary or where requested by the Commission, a cost
estimate for restoring the building or altering the building to an alternative
use.
      (5)    When requested by the Commission, definitive plans for reuse of
the site, evidence of a commitment for funding of the new project, a time frame
for project initiation and completion and an assessment of the effect of such
plans on the character and integrity of the Listed Property and the Historic
District.
   (d)   The Commission may extend the time for decision an additional ninety
(90) days on an application for the demolition in order to find a way to save
the building. The ninety (90) day period shall start on the day the Commission
meeting at which the demolition request is reviewed.
   (e)   The Commission may ask interested individuals and organizations for
assistance in seeking an alternative to demolition.
   (f)   During the review period, the owner of the structure shall make all
reasonable efforts to maintain the structure and prevent further deterioration.
   (g)   Upon determination of the Fire Chief or City Engineer and with the
concurrence of the Planning and Zoning Administrator, a Certificate of
Appropriateness may be issued to demolish a structure where the public health
and safety are in immediate danger if the demolition is not permitted.
   (h)   The following shall constitute the penalties and remedies for a
violation of this Chapter:
      (1)    Whoever demolishes or causes to demolish a building in the
Historic District or any Listed Property without obtaining a Certificate of
Appropriateness shall be guilty of a minor misdemeanor.
      (2)    Whoever demolishes or causes to be demolished a building in the
Historic District or any Listed Property after being enjoined by court of
equity or being ordered to cease and desist by the Planning and Zoning
Administrator shall be guilty of a first-degree misdemeanor.
      (3)    In addition to the other remedies and penalties provided in this
Chapter and the Zoning Code, the City may issue an order to cease and desist
and / or initiate appropriate actions or proceedings to prevent, restrain or
enjoin any threatened or continuing violations of Section
1245.55.
         (Ord. 25-2006.  Passed 3-7-06.)
1245.56  APPEALS.
   An applicant who has been denied a Certificate of Appropriateness by the
Historic Landmarks Commission may appeal the decision to City Council. Any such
appeal shall be made within thirty (30) days after the denial of the
Certificate. Grounds for the appeal shall be given by the applicants in the
papers submitted and the grounds shall be limited to procedural errors by the
Commission, failure by the Commission to consider the entire record presented
to the Commission with respect to the application, an incomplete explanation
for the decision reached by the Commission, or where there has been a clear
misapplication of either the design review guidelines or the Historic District
ordinance. When considering an appeal, City Council shall refer to the written
guidelines adopted by the Commission and the entire record before the
Commission. City Council may request additional information from the Commission
and/or the applicant and may hold a public hearing on the issue. City Council
may affirm or reverse the Commission’s decision. If City Council affirms the
decision, the denial of the Certificate will stand. If City Council reverses
the decision of the Commission it shall state, as a matter of public record,
the reasons for the reversal.  (Ord. 25-2006.  Passed 3-7-06.)
1245.57  REHABILITATION OF BUILDINGS.
   The Commission may initiate and encourage plans for the preservation and
rehabilitation of the individual historic buildings. To achieve this goal, the
Commission may assist private individuals and organizations who are working to
rehabilitate specific buildings. The Commission may seek to identify buildings
where maintenance work is needed or buildings where the restoration of former
features or elements is appropriate. After identifying such a building, the
Commission may request a meeting with the owner to discuss plans for the
property. The Commission shall, on a regular basis, give official recognition
to owners and tenants who maintain or rehabilitate their historic buildings
with care and thus contribute to the preservation of the history of
Perrysburg. 
(Ord. 25-2006.  Passed 3-7-06.)
1245.58  EARLY IDENTIFICATION OF PLANS AFFECTING HISTORIC PROPERTY.
   The Commission shall work with the City staff and private individuals to
learn about proposed public or private plans that would lead to changes in the
Historic Districts or to Listed Properties. This work shall be done to cover
the period before the Commission receives an application from an owner or
tenant. The purpose of this early identification of projects is to help in the
preservation of historic buildings and to resolve conflicts between the
preservation of historic buildings and alternative use of the land.
(Ord. 25-2006.  Passed 3-7-06.)
1245.59  EXCLUSIONS.
   Nothing in this Chapter shall prevent the ordinary maintenance or repair, as
defined in Section
1245.47, of any Listed Property or property within a Historic District, if such
work involves no change in design, texture, material or exterior feature.
Nothing in this Chapter shall prevent any change, including the construction,
reconstruction, alteration or demolition of any property, structure, building,
object or work of art within a Historic District or Listed Property, which, in
the view of the City acting lawfully, is required for public safety because of
an unsafe or dangerous condition.
(Ord. 25-2006.  Passed 3-7-06.)
1245.60  PREVENTION OF UNLAWFUL CHANGES.
   If any unlawful change is made in any property, which has been designated as
a Listed Property or which is situated in a Historic District, the City may
institute appropriate proceedings to prevent such unlawful change. Such remedy
shall be in addition to the penalty provided in Section
1280.06.  (Ord. 25-2006.  Passed 3-7-06.)

spaces. The number of off-street parking spaces, in conjunction with all land
or building use, shall be provided prior to the issuance of a Certificate of
Occupancy as prescribed in this Zoning Code.
   (b)   Application for parking lot construction. Any person desiring to
establish or change a parking area shall submit plans to the City showing the
locations, elevations, design, size, shape, landscaping, surfacing, marking,

parking lot. Any curb cuts, entrances, exits and drainage involving County or
State highways shall be submitted to the appropriate agency for approval.
   (c)   Minimum required off-street parking areas shall not be replaced by any
other use unless and until equal parking facilities are provided elsewhere.
   
   (d)   Off-street parking existing at the effective date of this Zoning Code
in connection with the operation of an existing building or use shall not be
reduced to any amount less than that required in this Zoning Code for a similar
new building or new use.
   (e)   Two (2) or more buildings or uses may collectively provide the
required off-street parking in which case the required number of parking spaces
shall not be less than the sum of the requirements for the individual uses if
computed separately.
   (f)   In the instance of dual function of off-street parking spaces where
operating hours of buildings do not overlap, the City may grant an exception.
   (g)   The placement of materials, merchandise, motor vehicles, trucks,
trailers, recreational vehicles or equipment in designated off-street parking
areas of a property for the purpose of sale, rental or repair including the
storage of such items is prohibited, except as may be provided in this Zoning
Code.
   (h)   For those uses not specifically mentioned, the requirements for off-
street parking facilities shall be in accord with a use that the City considers

   (i)   When units or measurements determining the number of required parking
spaces result in the requirement of a fractional space, any fraction up to and
including one-half (1/2) shall be disregarded and fractions over one-half (1/2)
shall require one (1) parking space.
   (j)   For the purpose of computing the number of parking spaces required,

usable floor area.
   (k)   For all residential buildings and institutional, public or essential
services in a residential district, the required parking area shall be provided
on the same lot with the buildings or on a lot immediately adjacent, under the
same ownership.

      (2)    A residential district,
      (3)    A street with an ornamental fence or compact hedge which shall be
at least four (4) feet high, of a type which will obscure vision at all seasons
from adjoining premises, except where it may block clear vision for traffic
movement. In that circumstance, it shall be thirty (30) inches in height.
   (o)   No commercial repair work, commercial servicing or selling of any kind
shall be conducted on parking areas in residential districts. A resident may

   (r)   The number of off-street parking spaces required for the uses located
in and permitted in C- 1, C-3, C-4 and INS districts may be reduced up to
thirty-three percent (33%) of the total required, provided that the following
conditions are met:
(Ord. 151-2007.  Passed 10-2-07.)
      (1)    The number of off-street parking spaces required for the use or
uses exceed fifteen (15).
      (2)    The applicant shall submit an acceptable site plan showing that an
adequate reserve of land is set aside for additional parking spaces, so that
the total depicted on the plan is adequate to meet the requirements under
1250.03 of this Chapter. The plan shall indicate the reserve area so that all
dimensional requirements as to spaces, aisles and other applicable requirements
of this Chapter can be met. The reserve area shall not be used for water
retention, for required greenbelts or as the location for replacement trees or
other deciduous or evergreen trees required by this Chapter. The landscape plan
submitted for the site shall include a plan for the reserve area.
      (3)    The City has determined that the applicant has submitted
substantial evidence showing that the parking needs of the specific occupant
will be less than would be required by this Chapter.
      (4)    The property owner shall execute an agreement prepared by the City
Law Director requiring the construction of the additional spaces within one
hundred and eighty (180) days of notification that the City has determined a
need exists for such spaces. The agreement shall run with the land, be binding
upon successors and assigns and shall be recorded with the County Recorder.
      (5)    A permit for change of occupancy shall not be issued until the
City has reevaluated the need for parking by the new occupant relative to the
number of spaces required by this Chapter.
   (s)   Parking Structures / Decks and Parking Beneath Buildings: The
appearance of parking structures, whether free-standing or attached, shall
relate to the building they serve, contribute to the character of the
development and shall not disrupt the streetscape. The following guidelines
shall be considered:
      (1)   Where parking structures have a strong relationship to the street
or other pedestrian areas, the ground-level shall be wrapped by retail, office
or some other related active use along at least the primary façade.
      (2)    Structures shall merit the same level of materials and finishes as
that a principal building would.
      (3)    Primary facades shall be enhanced with landscape treatments to
soften the structure. Other sides of parking structures shall be landscaped
with increasing intensity the more visible the parking structure is from
surrounding area.
      (4)    The façade shall be designed such that parked vehicles are not
visible from any adjacent public way.
      (5)    Parking structures shall have full roofs, varied parapet heights
or other suggestive roof form variations to eliminate top deck lighting
concerns and to create a more finished appearance.
      (6)   Interior and top deck lighting sources are not to be visible from
any adjacent public way.
      (7)    Pedestrian entries shall be clearly visible and convenient.
         (Ord. 26-2006.  Passed 3-7-06.)
   (t)   Parking is to be distributed around large buildings on not less than
two sides to shorten the distance to other buildings and public sidewalks and
to reduce perceived scale of paved surfaces.  No single parking area shall
exceed two hundred (200) spaces unless divided into two or more sub-areas
separated from each other by landscaping, access drives or public streets,
pedestrian walkways or building.  If more than sixty-five percent (65%) of the
total off-street parking spaces for the entire site are located between the
front facade of principal building and the Primary Street abutting the site,
additional landscaping, buffering and raised pedestrian walkway connections are
required. 
(Ord. 103-2007.  Passed 7-10-07.)
   (u)   Prohibit over-night parking of tractor-trailer vehicles anywhere

standards and regulations:
      (1)    No parking lot shall be constructed unless and until a permit
therefore is issued. Applications for permit shall be submitted with three (3)

1250.07  SHARED PARKING.
   The shared parking factor table reflects the reduction in off-street parking
that can be achieved when two (2) dissimilar but adjacent functions share
common parking facilities. The sum of the parking provided for any two (2)
dissimilar functions is modified by the factor. For example, the sum of ten
(10) residential parking spaces plus ten (10) office parking spaces are divided
by a factor of one point four (1.4) to provide the equivalent of fourteen (14)
shared parking spaces. The use of shared parking requires each property owner
benefiting from shared parking to submit an agreement acknowledging and
permitting cross access of each respective parking lot, a statement of building
occupancy and Planning Commission approval. The Planning Commission, as part of
their approval process, may attach other provisions to the agreement(s).

1250.24  PLANTING FOR WALLS AND BERMS.
   Whenever a wall or berm is required, deciduous trees shall be planted in the
ground adjacent to the wall on the nonresidential side spaced not less than
thirty (30) feet on center. If a berm is used, the trees may be planted on the
berm.
(Ord. 26-2006.  Passed 3-7-06.)
1250.25  WALL HEIGHT VARIANCE.
   The City may, in unusual circumstances, permit a wall or berm to be less
than the height required if no good purpose would be served by the height
required by this Zoning Code. In making such determination, the City may
consider the following:
   (a)   The height of existing nearby walls;
   (b)   The effectiveness of the wall in screening adjacent property;
   (c)   Variation in height would result in a significantly better-appearing
wall when the length, in the opinion of the City, is excessive;
   (d)   The characteristics of the area being screened.
      (Ord. 26-2006.  Passed 3-7-06.)
1250.26  WALL LOCATION.
   (a)   In those instances where a required wall is located generally parallel
to a public street right-of-way and within fifty (50) feet of the right-of-way,
the City may require that the wall be designed so that it provides a varying
setback or distance from the right-of-way. This may take the form of a
serpentine wall, a wall with offsets in its alignment or some other means of
providing variety. The use of plant materials in conjunction with the wall is
encouraged and may be required.
   (b)   Required walls shall be located along the lot line except where
underground utilities interfere and except in instances where this Zoning Code
requires conformance with front yard setback lines in abutting residential
districts.
   (c)   Upon review of the site plan, the City may approve an alternate
location for the wall or may waive the wall or deciduous trees requirement if
in specific cases it would not serve the purposes of screening the area
effectively or where it is determined that the adjoining property is indicated
on the future land use plan as a nonresidential area.
   (d)   Required walls may, upon approval of the City, be located on the
opposite side of an alley right-of-way from a nonresidential zone that abuts a
residential zone when mutually agreeable to affected property owners. The
continuity of the required wall on a given block will be a major
consideration.  (Ord. 26-2006.  Passed 3-7-06.)
1250.27  BERM CONFIGURATION AND MAINTENANCE.
   (a)   Berms shall be landscaped earth mounds, the same height as required
for walls with a maximum slope of 3:1 (three (3) feet horizontal to one (1)
foot vertical). All berms shall have a nearly flat, horizontal area at their
highest point of at least two (2) feet in width.
   (b)   Berm slopes shall be protected from erosion by sodding or seeding. If
slopes are seeded, they shall be protected by straw mulch, hydromulching or
netting specifically designed to control erosion until the seed germinates and
permanent lawn is established. The berm area shall be kept free from refuse and
debris and shall be planted with shrubs, trees or lawn and shall be maintained
in a healthy, growing condition.
   (c)   A planting plan and grading plan shall be prepared for the berm and
shall be reviewed by the City. Plant materials within the berm area shall be
installed in accordance with requirements for landscaping as set forth in
Section
1250.09.
(Ord. 26-2006.  Passed 3-7-06.)
1250.28  WALL AND BERM REVIEW.
   (a)   Review of walls and berms shall be provided by the City as part of
site plan review.
   (b)   Where site plan approval by the Planning Commission is required the
Planning Commission will provide such review.

building wall or permitted freestanding sign.  Street numbers shall also not
count as sign when displayed on a standalone sign not more than two square feet
in area with no other text, and no setback from the right of way is required. 
Street numbers may not be placed on any penthouse or architectural feature
above the highest point of the roof or parapet.
   (c)   Freestanding Signs.
      (1)   Table
1250.32(a) references freestanding signs allowed per zoning lot.
      (2)   The minimum frontage for a freestanding sign is 50 feet of lot

      (3)   One additional freestanding sign is permitted for every 500 feet of
street frontage or fraction thereof for lots greater than 500 feet.  Signs on
the same lot shall be separated by at least 200 feet.  For corner lots each
street frontage shall be calculated separately and each sign shall be oriented
to each respective street.
      (4)   The height of a sign shall be measured from the average natural
grade at the base of the sign or support structure to the tallest element of
the calculated sign area.  A freestanding sign on a man-made base, including a
graded earth mound, shall be measured from a height no more than one foot above
the average site grade.
      (5)   The minimum setback is 15 feet for permitted signs from freeway
right of way.
      (6)   Single pole signs are prohibited.  Freestanding signs that exceed
three (3) square feet in area shall be erected with a minimum of two supporting
posts or on a solid base and shall be erected in a landscaped setting and not
on sidewalks, drives or in parking lots.
   (d)   Wall Signs.
      (1)   The quantity of wall signs permitted shall mean one sign per ground
floor occupant and shall not exceed the number of occupants having occupied
space abutting the wall facade having the sign.
      (2)   A wall sign is not permitted on a façade facing a residential
district unless such district is separated from the non-residential district by
a street.
      (3)   Signs may not be placed on or attached to a roof nor extend above
the eave of a roof, except when a roof is so nearly vertical as to resemble a
wall.  However signs attached to such a roof shall not extend below the roof
nor within one foot of the top of the roof.
      (4)   In no case shall a wall sign project more than eighteen inches
(18") beyond the wall to which it is attached, notwithstanding a projecting
sign, nor be placed on any penthouse or other architectural feature so as to
extend above the highest point of the roof or parapet.
   (e)   Projecting Sign.  A sign may project four inches (4") per front foot
of building façade measured to the nearest side line of the building up to a
projection of forty-two (42") and no closer than two feet (2') to the street
curb measured horizontally.  The minimum distance between the bottom of the
sign and the ground shall be eight feet (8').
   (f)   Awning Sign.  A sign on an awning may consist of text and one graphic
emblem which together shall not exceed an area thirty-five percent of the
awning face on which the sign is placed.  The identical sign may be placed on
multiple awnings but the total area of awning signs shall be considered part of
the total permitted sign area of a building. 
   (g)   Nameplate Sign.  One nameplate sign is permitted at each exterior
entrance available for use by customers, patrons, or the public and does not
include service or employee entrances.
   (h)   Marquee Sign.  A marquee sign shall be limited to an area equal to or
less than thirty-three percent (33%) of the vertical face of the marquee upon
which the sign is placed.

1250.34  ENTRANCEWAY STRUCTURES AND SIGNS.
   Entranceway structures, for the purpose of supporting signs that identify
developments which may be served by minor public streets or private places such
as subdivisions, multiple-family developments, industrial or office parks may
be permitted.  Such structures and signs shall be approved and a permit issued
subject to the following restrictions:
   (a)   The entranceway structure shall be necessary in order to identify a
development in which individual parcels or uses are accessible only by way of
public streets that serve more than two (2) zoning lots or by way of private
places or drives that serve more than two (2) separate and distinct principal
uses.
   (b)   Such structures may be located within the right-of-way that is
perpendicular to an arterial or collector street which provides access to a
subdivision plat, site condominium, multiple-family development, office or
industrial park, mobile home park, or other planned development.  The sole
exception will be those entranceway structures within a UVO designated area and
detailed within the UVO design/ development standards.
   (c)   Such structure may be located within a required setback provided it
shall be set back a minimum of twenty-five (25) feet from any edge of pavement
or back of curb, and the location meets the requirements of Section
1250.54 (Clear Vision Zones).
   (d)   The size of entranceway structures, including supporting structures,
shall be limited as follows:
      (1)   In the A-1, R-1 through R-5, and RM districts, the maximum
dimensions permitted shall be ten feet high and twenty feet long.
      (2)   In the nonresidential districts, the maximum dimensions permitted
shall be ten (10) feet high and twenty (20) feet long, but, may not exceed
ninety (90) square feet in total area.
      (3)   Entranceway structures and signs may be located only in yards or
right of way adjacent to streets entering the development indicated on the
sign.
      (4)   Entranceway structures that are to be located on individually owned
parcels rather than on parcels that are part of an overall development, may be
allowed only in a private easement dedicated for such purposes and provided
that appropriate provision has been made to assure continued maintenance of the
structure.
      (5)   The area of sign shall be limited to 18 square feet in districts A-
1, R-1 through R-5, 32 square feet in RM districts and 48 square feet in non-
residential districts. The sign area shall be determined by measuring the
entire area within a single continuous perimeter enclosing the extreme limits
of writing, representation, emblem or any figure or similar character.
         (Ord. 40-2013.  Passed 4-9-13.)
1250.35  PROHIBITED SIGNS.

   (a)   No mobile signs shall be erected, constructed, displayed or maintained
except those on commercial delivery and service vehicles.  Such vehicles shall
not be parked in any district closer to the street than the front line of the

by the Zoning Inspector, after paying a fee and issuance of a permit unless
otherwise exempted in this Chapter.  A new permit shall be required if such
signs are relocated on the ground or are increased in surface area or dimension
or change of copy.
      (1)   No sign for which a permit has been issued shall thereafter be
moved to another location within the City nor shall it be structurally altered
in any way without the approval of the official or board that granted the
original permit. An additional fee shall be paid at the time of application for

      (2)   If a sign is proposed to be located within a Historic District, the
Zoning Inspector shall require a Certificate of Appropriateness for submission
to the Historic Landmarks Commission for review and approval.
   (b)   Assurance of Discontinuance: As an additional means of enforcing this
Zoning Code, the Zoning Inspector may accept an assurance of discontinuance of
any act or practice deemed to be in violation of this Zoning Code or of any
rule or regulation adopted pursuant hereto from any person engaging in, or who
has engaged in, such act or practice. Any such assurance shall specify a time
limit during which such discontinuance shall occur. Failure to perform such
assurance shall constitute prima facie proof of a violation of this Zoning
Code, or of any rule or regulation adopted pursuant hereto, or of any order
issued pursuant thereto, which makes the alleged act or practice unlawful, for
the purpose of securing any injunctive relief from a court of competent
jurisdiction.
   (c)   Effective Period:  Every sign permit issued by the Zoning Inspector
shall become null and void if the sign is not erected within one hundred and
eighty (180) days from the date of such permit. If construction authorized by
such a permit is suspended or abandoned for one- hundred and twenty (120) days
any time after the construction is commenced, another permit shall be obtained
before work is recommenced. The fee for such additional permit shall be one-
half (½) the amount required for a new permit for such construction, provided
that no changes have been made in the original plans. Such permit shall not be
unreasonably withheld, provided that proper application is made and the fee
paid.
   (d)   Revocation: The Zoning Inspector may, in writing, suspend or revoke a
permit issued under this Chapter whenever the permit is issued on the basis of
a misstatement of fact or fraud. When the Zoning Inspector denies a sign
permit, he or she shall give written notice of the denial to the applicant,
together with a brief written statement of the reasons for the denial.
   (e)   Permit Fees: An application for a permit shall be filed with the
Zoning Inspector, together with a fee for each sign. The fee schedule shall be
as determined from time to time by City.  (Ord. 40-2013.  Passed 4-9-13.)
1250.37  OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES.

(3) months or more or any sign which pertains to a time, event or purpose that
no longer applies to the zoning lot, shall be deemed to have been abandoned.
Permanent signs applicable to an occupancy temporarily suspended because of a
change of ownership or management shall not be deemed abandoned unless the
zoning lot remains vacant or unoccupied for a period of six (6) months or more.
Any nonconforming sign that, for a period of three (3) consecutive months,
advertises goods, products, services or facilities no longer available or that
directs persons to a location where such goods, products, services or
facilities are no longer available shall be deemed to have been abandoned.
   (b)    Removal of Signs by the Zoning Inspector:
      (1)   The Zoning Inspector shall cause to be removed any sign that
endangers the public safety, such as but not limited to, an abandoned,
dangerous or materially, electrically or structurally defective sign or a sign
for which no permit has been issued. The Zoning Inspector shall prepare a
notice describing the sign, specifying the violation involved, and stating that
if the sign is not removed or the violation is not corrected within ten (10)
days, the sign shall be removed in accordance with this Chapter.
      (2)   Notices mailed by the Zoning Inspector shall be sent by certified
mail. Time periods provided in this Chapter shall commence on the date of the
receipt of the certified mail.
      (3)   If known, or with reasonable care should be known, the notice shall
be mailed to or delivered to the owner of the sign and the occupant of the
property. For all other signs, the notice shall be mailed to the owner of the
property on which the sign is located as shown on the last equalized assessment
roll.
      (4)   Notwithstanding the above, in cases of emergency, the Zoning
Inspector may cause the immediate removal of a dangerous or defective sign
without notice.
   (c)   Disposal of Signs; Fees:
      (1)   Any sign removed by the Zoning Inspector pursuant to this Zoning
Code shall become the property of the City and may be disposed of in any manner
deemed appropriate by the City. The cost of removal of the sign by the City
shall be considered a debt owed to the City by the owner of the sign and the
owner of the property. Such debt may be recovered in an appropriate court
action by the City or by assessment against the property as hereinafter
provided. The cost of removal shall include any and all incidental expenses
incurred by the City in connection with removal of the sign.
      (2)   If the Zoning Inspector determines that such sign would cause an
imminent danger to the public safety, and if contact cannot be made with the
sign owner or the property owner, the service of a written notice shall not be
required. In such emergency the Zoning Inspector may correct the danger with
costs assessed against the sign owner or property owner.
   (d)   Conflict of Laws: If any portion of this Chapter is found to be in
conflict with any other provision of this Zoning Code or with the provisions of
any building, fire, safety, or health code of the City, the provision
establishing the higher standard shall prevail.
(Ord. 40-2013.  Passed 4-9-13.)
1250.38  NONCONFORMING SIGNS.
   (a)   It is the intent of this section that the continued use of
nonconforming signs shall not be encouraged.
   (b)   A nonconforming sign shall immediately lose its nonconforming
designation if:
      (1)   The structure of the sign is altered in any way, which tends to or
makes the sign less in compliance with the requirements of this Zoning Code
than it was before the alteration.
      (2)   The sign is relocated to a position making it less in compliance
with the requirements of this Zoning Code.
      (3)   The sign structure is replaced.
      (4)   After the date of December 31, 2022 any change is made to the sign
face, its message or structure.
   (c)   On the occurrence of any one of one (1), two (2), or three (3) the
sign shall be immediately brought into compliance with this Zoning Code with a
new permit secured therefore, or the sign shall be removed.
   (d)   Nothing in this section shall relieve the owner or user of a
nonconforming sign or owner of the property on which the nonconforming sign is
located from the provisions of this section regarding safety, maintenance and
repair of signs; provided however, that any repainting, cleaning and other
normal maintenance or repair of the sign or sign structure shall not modify the
sign structure or copy in any way which does not conform with the provisions of
this Code.
(Ord. 40-2013.  Passed 4-9-13.)
1250.39  VARIANCES.
   Board of Zoning Appeals: Notwithstanding any contrary language in this code,
the City's Board of Zoning Appeals shall have jurisdiction to hear requests for
a variance relating to the height, area, and setback of signs from the
otherwise applicable terms of Sections
1250.31 and
1250.32 of the Codified Ordinances.
   Any appeals pursuant to this provision shall be governed by the procedural
requirements otherwise applicable to other appeals to the City's Board of
Zoning Appeals.
   In granting such a variance, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall prescribe
appropriate conditions and safeguards to maintain the intent and spirit of the
zoning district in conformity with the Zoning Code.
   The Board of Zoning Appeals may grant a variance only if it finds that all
of the following apply:
   (a)   That the literal enforcement of the requirements of this chapter would
involve practical difficulties based on the presence of special conditions and
circumstances which are peculiar to the land or structure involved and which
are not applicable to other lands or structures in the same zoning district.  A
finding of such special conditions or circumstances shall be based on a review
of factors including but not limited to the following:
      (1)   Exceptional narrowness, shallowness or shape of a specific property
on the effective date of this chapter or amendment; or
      (2)   Exceptional topographic or environmental conditions or other
extraordinary situation on the land, building or structure; or
      (3)   The impact on the property of uses or development of immediately
adjoining property or properties.
      (4)   Whether the applicant was aware of the relevant code limitation
when the property was sold or leased to it.
      (5)   Whether the property in question will yield a reasonable rate of
return in the absence of the proposed variance, or whether there can be any
beneficial use of the property without the proposed variance.
      (6)   Whether the issue could be resolved by some other method, even if
this alternate method is less convenient or most costly to achieve.
   (b)   That granting the variance will not cause a substantial adverse effect
to property or improvements in the vicinity or will not materially impair the
intent and purposes of the requirement being varied or of this chapter, and is
the minimum variance necessary to provide relief.
   (c)   That the variance would not adversely affect the delivery of
governmental services ( e.g., water, sewer, garbage).
   (d)   That the variance as granted would not confer on the applicant any
special privilege, or deprive the applicant of rights, when compared with those
rights commonly enjoyed immediately adjoining properties;
   (e)   That the variance request is not one where the specific conditions
pertaining to the property are so general or recurrent in nature as to make the
formulation of a general regulation for those conditions reasonably
practicable.

community is considered important. It is recognized that the community should
be visually attractive as well as financially prosperous and the manner in
which a use is accomplished is as important as the use. The quality of
architecture and building construction is important to the preservation and
enhancement of building and property values, prevention of the physical
deterioration of buildings, the promotion of the image of the community and the
general welfare of its citizens. Architectural design and use of materials for
the construction of any building shall be subject to the approval of the City.

materials and any other information as deemed necessary to make a
determination. Detailed information relating to any lighting or signage on the
structure shall be provided, including backlit material or accent lighting. The
architectural design shall be in accordance with the standards as contained in
this Chapter.

impact study shall include:
   (a)   A description of the site, surroundings and study area. Illustrations
and a narrative should describe the characteristics of the site and adjacent
roadway system (functional classification, lanes, speed limits, etc.). This
description should include surrounding land uses, expected development in the
vicinity which could influence future traffic conditions, special site features
and a description of any committed roadway improvements. The study should
define and justify the study area selected for analysis.
   (b)   A description of the requested use which relates to traffic
generation, such as the number and types of dwelling units, the gross and
usable floor area, the number of employees and shift change factors. Intended
phasing or future expansion should also be noted.
   (c)   A description of existing peak-hour traffic volumes (and daily volumes
if applicable) at intersections and on street(s) adjacent to the site. The
existing level of service analysis shall be provided for intersections in the
vicinity that are expected to experience an increase in traffic of at least
five percent (5%) due to the proposed project. Existing traffic counts shall
not be over two (2) years old from the date of submittal of the report.
   (d)   Roadway characteristics, described and illustrated, as appropriate.
Features to be addressed include existing rights-of-way, lane configurations,
geometrics, signal timing, traffic control devices, posted speed limits,
average running speeds, sight distance information, existing driveways and
potential turning movement conflicts in the vicinity of the site.
   (e)   For projects that will be completed and occupied within one (1) year
of a traffic impact statement submittal, an analysis of background traffic
(i.e. the expected increase in traffic volumes related to approved projects and
historic annual percentage increases).
   (f)   Forecasted trip generation of the proposed use for the a.m.(if
applicable) peak hour, the p.m. peak hour and an average weekday. A weekend
forecast may also be required for certain commercial uses. The forecasts shall
be based on one (1) standard deviation above the average rate outlined in the
most recent edition of Trip Generation published by the Institute of
Transportation Engineers (ITE). The applicant may use other commonly-accepted
sources of data or supplement the standard data with data from at least three
(3) similar projects in northwest Ohio. For rezoning requests, the study should
contrast the traffic impacts of typical uses permitted in the requested zoning
district with uses permitted in the current zoning district. The determination
of typical uses shall be made by the Planning and Zoning Administrator. Any
trip reduction for pass-by trips, transit, ridesharing, other modes, internal
capture rates, etc., shall be both based on the ITE. The community may accept
in whole or in part the trip reduction rates used. For projects intended to be
developed in phases, the trip generation by phase shall be described.
   (g)   Distribution of Traffic:  The projected traffic generated shall be
distributed (inbound v. outbound; left turn v. right turn) onto the existing
street network to project turning movements at site access points and nearby
intersections where required. Projected peak hour turning movement volumes
shall be illustrated in the report. A description of the application of
standard engineering procedures for determining the distribution should also be
attached.
   (h)   Capacity Analysis:  A before and after level of service or "capacity"
analysis at the proposed access points and nearby intersections shall be
completed using the procedures outlined in the most recent edition of the
Highway Capacity Manual published by the Transportation Research Board.
   (i)   Mitigation Alternatives: The study shall outline mitigation measures
and demonstrate any changes to the level of service achieved by these measures.
Any alternatives or suggested phasing of improvements should be described. The
mitigation measures may include items such as roadway widening, need for bypass
lanes or deceleration tapers/lanes, changes to signalization, use of access
management techniques or a reduction in the proposed intensity of use.
   (j)   Waiver of Study Contents: The study contents listed in Section
1255.07(a) through (i) may be waived or modified by the Planning Commission.
Reasons for the waiver or modification shall be documented and the following
factors may be considered:
      (1)   Roadway improvements are already scheduled which are expected to
mitigate any impacts associated with the proposed project.
      (2)   The existing level of service is not expected to be significantly
impacted by the proposed project due to specific conditions at this location.
      (3)   A similar traffic study was previously prepared for the site and is
still considered applicable.

with City specifications.
      (11)   All parking areas shall be so designed to facilitate efficient and
safe vehicular and pedestrian circulation, minimize congestion at ingress and
egress points to intersecting roads, including the use of service drives as
appropriate and minimize the negative visual impact of such parking areas.
      (12)   Residential and nonresidential development shall not include
unnecessary curb cuts and commercial service drives shall be used where the
opportunity exists.

Nonconforming Uses
1265.01   Intent and purpose.
1265.02   Continuance, discontinuance or change to more restricted use.
1265.03   Nonconforming use of  structures.
1265.04   Nonconforming uses of land.
1265.05   Nonconforming lots.
1265.06   Repairs and maintenance.

1265.09   Hardship cases.
1265.10   Permits.
1265.11   Unlawful uses under prior ordinances not validated.
 
1265.01  INTENT AND PURPOSE.
   (a)   It is recognized that there exists within the districts established by
this Zoning Code or amendments that may later be adopted lots, structures and
uses of land and structures which were lawful before this Zoning Code was
passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under
the terms of this Zoning Code. It is the intent of this Zoning Code to permit
these nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage
their survival. Such uses are declared by this Zoning Code to be incompatible
with permitted uses in the districts involved. It is further the intent of this
Zoning Code that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or
extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited
elsewhere in the same district.
(Ord. 29-2006.  Passed 3-7-06.)
1265.02  CONTINUANCE, DISCONTINUANCE OR CHANGE TO MORE RESTRICTED USE.
   (a)   Except as hereinafter provided in this Chapter, the lawful use of a
building or structure or of any lot existing at the time of the effective date
of this Zoning Code or any amendment thereof may be continued, although such
use does not conform with the provisions of this Zoning Code or such amendment.
For the purpose hereof, as to uses where a zoning permit has been issued prior
to the adoption or amendment of this Zoning Code and rendering such uses
nonconforming, such uses shall be permitted as nonconforming uses provided such
permits are not revoked and occupancy or the start of construction pursuant to
such permits is undertaken within six (6) months after issuance thereof.
   (b)   If any nonconforming use is discontinued for a consecutive period of
two (2) years or more, its privileged status as a nonconforming use shall cease
and no future use of such building, structure or land shall be made except in
conformity to the general requirements of this Zoning Code or any amendments
hereto. In the event a nonconforming use is changed to a more restricted use or
to a conforming use, such use shall not thereafter be changed to a less
restricted use.  (Ord. 29-2006.  Passed 3-7-06.)
1265.03  NONCONFORMING USE OF STRUCTURES.
   (a)   The following special provisions shall apply to the nonconforming use
of buildings or structures:
      (1)   Currently existing nonconforming uses of any structure may be
extended throughout that portion thereof that was obviously designed and
intended for such use.
      (2)   Consistent with the overall goal of minimizing the impact of
nonconforming uses within the City, the Board of Zoning Appeals may grant a Use
Variance permitting a nonconforming use of a building or structure in existence
at the time that this section is passed to be changed to another nonconforming
use or may add up to one (1) nonconforming use, if the following conditions are
met.
         A.   When compared with the current use, the proposed change in use or
additional use must in the aggregate result in th same or less intense use of
the property, based on issued including but not limited to the proposed hours
of operation, traffic volume, noise, odor, and parking requirements; and
         B.   The proposed use must not negatively impact the surrounding area
or residents.
         C.   Any proposed exterior alterations must positively impact the
surrounding area and nearby properties.
      (3)   When a structure, the use of which is nonconforming, has been
damaged by explosion, fire, act of God, or other uncontrollable means to the
extent of more than sixty percent (60%) of the structure, it shall not be
restored or reconstructed except with the approval of the City.  Such
restoration or reconstruction shall be in conformity with the otherwise
applicable requirements and regulations of this Zoning Code.
         (Ord. 42-2012.  Passed  3-6-12.)
1265.04  NONCONFORMING USES OF LAND.
   (a)   Where, at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Zoning
Code, a lawful use of land exists that is made no longer permissible under the
terms of this Zoning Code as enacted or amended, such use may be continued, so
long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
      (1)    No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged, increased nor
extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective
date of adoption or amendment of this Zoning Code.
      (2)    No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to
any other portion of the lot or parcel occupied by such use at the effective
date of adoption or amendment of this Zoning Code.
         (Ord. 29-2006.  Passed 3-7-06.)
1265.05  NONCONFORMING LOTS.
   In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted,
notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this Zoning Code, a
single-family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any
single lot of record at or before the effective date of adoption or amendment
of this Zoning Code. This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to
meet the requirements for area, width or both that are generally applicable in
the district; provided that yard dimensions, setbacks and other requirements
not involving area, width or both of the lot shall conform to the regulations
for the district in which such lot is located, unless a yard requirement
variance is obtained through the Board of Zoning Appeals. However, if two (2)
or more lots or combinations of lots and portions of lots with continuous
frontage in single ownership are of record at the time of passage or amendment
of this Zoning Code and if all or part of the lots do not meet the requirements
established for lot width and area, the lands involved shall be considered to
be an undivided parcel for the purposes of this Zoning Code, and no portion of
said parcel shall be used or divided in a manner which diminishes compliance
with lot width and area requirements established by this Zoning Code.
(Ord. 29-2006.  Passed 3-7-06.)
1265.06  REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE.
   On any building devoted in whole or in part to any nonconforming use, work
may be done in any period of twelve (12) consecutive months on ordinary repairs
and on repair or replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing
to an extent not exceeding twenty-five (25) percent of the building’s
replacement cost prior to the initiation of repairs, exclusive of foundations,
provided that the cubic content of the building as it existed at the time of
passage or amendment of this Zoning Code shall not increase. Nothing in this
Zoning Code shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe
condition of any building or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official
charged with protecting the public safety upon order of such official. 
(Ord. 29-2006.  Passed 3-7-06.)
1265.07  CHANGE OF TENANCY OR OWNERSHIP.
   A change of tenancy or ownership of a nonconforming use is allowed provided
there is no increase in the degree of nonconformance of the nonconforming use.
(Ord. 29-2006.  Passed 3-7-06.)
1265.08  DISTRICT CHANGES.
   Whenever the boundaries of a district shall be changed so as to transfer an
area from one district to another district of another classification, the
provisions of this Zoning Code shall also apply to any existing uses that
become nonconforming as a result of the boundary changes.
(Ord. 29-2006.  Passed 3-7-06.)
1265.09  HARDSHIP CASES.
   Nonconforming buildings or structures may be structurally changed, altered
or enlarged with the approval of the Board of Zoning Appeals. The Board of
Zoning Appeals must find that the request is a case of exceptional hardship in
which failure to grant the relief requested would unreasonably restrict
continued use of the property or would restrict valuable benefits that the
public currently derives from the property as used in its nonconforming status.
With the exception that any approval for structural changes, alteration or
enlargement may be granted only with a finding by the Board of Zoning Appeals
that approval will not have an adverse affect on surrounding property and that
it will be the minimum necessary to relieve the hardship.
(Ord. 29-2006.  Passed 3-7-06.)
1265.10  PERMITS.
   Permits for construction on, expansion of or substitution of nonconforming
lots, uses or structures require a zoning permit. Other permits and approvals
may also be required.
(Ord. 29-2006.  Passed 3-7-06.)
1265.11  UNLAWFUL USES UNDER PRIOR ORDINANCES NOT VALIDATED.
   Neither the adoption of this Zoning Code nor any amendments thereto shall be
considered as validating any uses in violation of Ordinance 246, adopted August
29, 1939, commonly known as the "Zoning Ordinance of the Village of
Perrysburg", or the “Planning and Zoning Code of the City of Perrysburg, Wood
County, Ohio, dated November 9, 1965, as amended,” and Ordinance 542-60,
adopted August 29, 1960, as amended, and commonly known and referred to as the
"1960 Zoning Ordinance of the Municipality of Perrysburg," and any uses
declared unlawful by any other ordinance of the City or statute of the State as
of the date of the adoption of this Zoning Code.  (Ord. 29-2006.  Passed 3-7-

enacted pursuant thereto. In addition, it shall have such powers as may now or
hereafter be granted by the laws of the State of Ohio. It shall adopt and
recommend to the City Council a Comprehensive Plan for the physical development
of the City and the redevelopment of any area or district therein. The

limitations governing the plan, design, height, floor area, number of stories,
open spaces, locations, use and occupancy of public and private buildings,
structures and land uses or purposes, both public and private, pertaining to

time to time, by creating areas, zones, and districts of permitted and excluded
uses of such numbers or classifications and rules, regulations, limitations and
restrictions pertaining to each as will promote the general welfare of the City
and its inhabitants. City Council shall have full legislative authority to
accomplish those matters over which the Planning Commission is given power of
recommendation, provided, however, any such matter shall be first submitted to
the Planning Commission, and the action of the City Council, whether approving
or disapproving the recommendation of said Planning Commission, shall require a
vote of the majority of the members of City Council.
(Ord. 30-2006.  Passed 3-7-06.)
1270.04  NOTICE AND HEARINGS.
   (a)   The Planning Commission in procedure for enactment of zoning
legislation or regulations respecting the platting or subdivision of lands, may

the platting and subdivision of lands, with the power of recommendation
relative to zoning matters. Prior to City Council consideration, zoning matters
are referred to the Planning Commission for recommendation. Any City Council

(Ord. 31-2006.  Passed 3-7-06.)
1275.02  JURISDICTION OF BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS.
   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall not have the power to alter or change the
zoning district classification of any property, nor to make any change in the
terms of this Zoning Code, but does have power to act on those matters where
this Zoning Code provides for an administrative review, interpretation or
exception and to authorize a variance as defined in this Chapter and the laws
of the State of Ohio. Such powers include:
   (a)   Administrative Review: To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
by the applicant that there is an error in any order, requirement, permit,
decision or refusal made by the Zoning Inspector or any other administrative
official in carrying out or enforcing any provisions of this Zoning Code.
   (b)   Exceptions: To hear and decide, in accordance with the provisions of
this Zoning Code, requests for exceptions, interpretations of the zoning map
and other situations on which this Zoning Code specifically authorizes passage
by the Board. Any exception permit shall be subject to such conditions as the
Board may require to preserve and promote the character of the zoning district
in question and otherwise promote the purposes of this Zoning Code. Exception
permits may be issued in the following instances:
      (1)   To permit in a residential district the location of a temporary
building for commercial or industrial use which is incidental to residential
development, provided that such use shall be limited to one (1) year's
duration, subject to renewal by the Board upon proper application and, in the
case of a building, only upon the furnishing to the City of a bill-of-sale
therefore in event the building is not removed prior to the expiration of a
valid exception permit pertaining thereto.
      (2)   To permit the extension of a use district for a distance of not
more than twenty-five (25) feet, where the boundary line of a district divides
a lot held in single ownership at the time of the adoption of this Zoning Code
or of a redistricting amendment thereof.
      (3)   To permit the enlargement, erection and use of a building or the
use of a lot in any location for railroad or other public utility purposes
which the Board finds reasonably necessary for the public convenience or
welfare.
      (4)   To permit lots that were of record at the time of the adoption of
this Zoning Code or of a redistricting amendment thereof and which contain less
area or less width than the dimensional standards of the dwelling district in
which they are located, to be used for single-family dwellings and to vary the
side yard regulations for such lots. However, such exception shall be granted
only when the owners of such lots furnish substantial proof of their inability
to acquire or to acquire at a reasonable price additional land adjoining the
lot that would be necessary to meet the required lot area and width regulations
applicable thereto.
      (5)   To vary the parking requirements applicable, whenever it has been
clearly demonstrated that the providing of full parking facilities is
unnecessary or where such a requirement would impose an unreasonable hardship
upon the use of the lot, as contrasted with merely granting an advantage or a
convenience.
      (6)   To permit, except in R-1 through R-5 Districts, the placing of more
than one (1) main building on a lot when all of the buildings are intended to
operate as a single enterprise and the lot and all portions of it are owned,
leased or under the control of a single party. In such cases, the yard
requirements shall apply along all edges of the lot, but shall not be required
for the internal arrangement of the buildings on the lot, provided that
adequate light and air will reach all habitable rooms. Height, bulk and lot
area per family requirements shall apply as in the case of one (1) main
building on a lot.
      (7)   To permit the enclosing of an existing covered porch that extends
within the required front yard for a distance of not more than ten (10) feet,
but only when forty percent (40%) or more of the frontage within the same block
already has enclosed porches that encroach into the required front yard.
      (8)   To permit free off-street parking areas for patrons' automobiles
within a residential district, if the following conditions are met:
         A.   The parking area adjoins a commercial or industrial district
which is within one hundred fifty (150) feet thereof, and ingress and egress to
such parking area is from an arterial or collector street.
         B.   No business involving the repair or service to vehicles or sale
or display thereof is conducted from such parking areas and no structures are
erected or maintained thereon.
         C.   Conditions imposed by the Board with respect to yard surfacing,
lighting and suitable screening requirements are met.
      (9)   To vary the side, front and rear yards no more than fifty percent
(50%) of the required setbacks.
   (c)   Area or Dimensional Variance:
      (1)   To authorize upon an appeal a variance from the strict application
of the provisions of this Zoning Code where, by reason of exceptional
narrowness, shallowness, shape or area of a specific piece of property at the
time of enactment of this Zoning Code or by reason of exceptional topographic
conditions or other extraordinary or exceptional conditions of such property,
the strict application of the regulations enacted would result in practical
difficulties to the owner of such property, provided such relief may be granted
without substantial detriment to the public good and without substantially
impairing the intent and purposes of this Zoning Code. In granting a variance,
the Board may attach thereto such conditions regarding the location, character
and other features of the proposed uses as it may deem reasonable in
furtherance of the purposes of this Zoning Code. In granting a variance, the
Board shall state the grounds upon which it justified the granting of a
variance.
      (2)   Such appeals may be taken after initial application to the Zoning
Inspector for permit or, where it is apparent that such would be vain and
useless, may be made by initial application to the Board. In either event, the
procedural provisions of this Chapter shall apply and be followed.
      (3)   The Board shall grant such variance only if the Board finds that
four (4) of the following conditions [A. through G.] exist:
         A.   The property in question will either not yield a reasonable
return or no beneficial use of the property is possible without a variance.
         B.   The variance is not substantial.
         C.   The essential character of the neighborhood would not be altered
nor would adjoining properties suffer a substantial detriment as a result of
the variance.
         D.   The variance would not adversely affect the delivery of
governmental services.
         E.   The property owner purchased the property without knowledge of
the zoning restriction.
         F.   The property owner’s predicament cannot be obviated feasibly
through some method other than a variance.
         G.   The spirit and intent of this Zoning Code would be observed and
substantial justice would be done by granting the variance.
      (4)   In determining whether any of the aforementioned conditions exist,
the Board shall obtain recommendations of the proper City officials.
   (d)   Use Variance:
      (1)   To hear and decide instances where it is alleged that the
applicant’s property cannot be used for the purposes permitted in the zoning
districts because the restrictions as to use create an undue hardship. This is
because:
         A.   Applicant’s property cannot be used for the purposes permitted in
the zoning district.
         B.   Applicant’s plight is due to unique circumstances peculiar to his
property and not a general condition in the neighborhood.
         C.   Applicant’s suggested use would not alter the essential character
of the area.
         D.   Applicant’s problem has not been self-created.
         E.   The unavailability of administrative relief which might afford
reasonable use of applicant’s property.
         F.   In addition to the information required for other variance
requests, an application for a use variance under this Chapter shall include a
plan drawn to scale detailing the specific use and improvements proposed by the
applicant and a summary of the facts which support the alleged hardship.
   (e)   Appeals to Board:
      (1)   Appeals to the Board of Zoning Appeals may be taken after initial
applications to the Zoning Inspector for a permit or, where it is apparent that
such application would be in vain and useless, appeals may be made by initial
applications to the Board. In either event, the procedural provisions of this
Chapter shall apply and be followed.
      (2)   Appeals shall be made to the Board within thirty (30) days after
the complained of action or inaction of the Zoning Inspector. Appeals shall be
prepared in written form and shall specify the grounds thereof, setting forth
the material subject matter sufficiently to identify the matters involved upon
appeal. A copy thereof shall be filed with the Board and a copy thereof shall
be filed with the Deputy Planning and Zoning Administrator, who shall forthwith
prepare and transmit to the Board all papers and records of his/her office
bearing thereon.
      (3)   Upon the filing of an appeal, the Chair of the Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the hearing thereof, which may be at a special meeting of
the Board, and shall cause due notice thereof to be given to all abutting
properties. At such hearing, any party may appear in person or by an agent or
attorney and shall be given an opportunity to be heard. No hearing shall be had
sooner than fourteen (14) days after the date of the filing of the appeal.
      (4)   Upon hearing of the appeal, the Board may reverse, affirm or modify
the order or determination appealed from and may make such orders and
requirements as should be made for such purposes exercising all of the powers
of the Planning and Zoning Division. The Board shall act upon each appeal
within thirty (30) days after the filing thereof, failure of the Board to act
within such period of time may at any time thereafter be construed by the
appellant as denial thereof, for purposes of further appeal to City Council.
      (5)   In granting a permit under any of the powers granted by this
Chapter upon the Board of Zoning Appeals, the Board may stipulate the manner in
which the variance or exception shall be carried out or may require other
improvements and safeguards for the protection of the health, safety and
welfare of owners and occupants of surrounding lots or the public. In any
event, if the applicant for such permit does not act on the permit within one
(1) year from the date of issuance, such permit shall expire.
      (6)   Permits issued pursuant to the provisions of this Chapter shall be
in writing, which shall set forth the exact nature of the variance permitted
and all conditions and requirements exacted by the Board in connection
therewith. The Board shall keep a copy thereof or other record and a copy shall
be furnished to the Planning and Zoning Division.
   (f)   Appeals to Council:
      (1)   An applicant or appellant who has been denied a permit by the Board
of Zoning Appeals may appeal to City Council only for relief from the portion
of which the Board of Zoning Appeals has the authority to grant.  Decisions or
relief in excess of or outside of the Board of Zoning Appeal’s authority cannot
be appealed to City Council.  Any such appeal shall be made within thirty (30)
days after the complained of action or inaction of the Board. Appeals must be
prepared in written form and shall specify the grounds thereof, setting forth
the material subject matter sufficiently to identify the matters involved upon
appeal. One (1) copy thereof shall be filed with the Clerk of Council and one
(1) copy shall be filed with the Board, together with a fee as determined from
time to time by City Council to defray the cost of preparation of the record by
the Board.
      (2)   Within thirty (30) days after the filing of the appeal, the Board
shall prepare and transmit to the Clerk of Council all papers and records
pertaining to the appeal, including the record forwarded to it by the Planning
and Zoning Administrator in appeals originating through that office.
      (3)   Within a reasonable time after the filing of the appeal, City
Council shall fix a hearing date, giving public notice thereof by publication
and written notice thereof to the appellant. Upon hearing of such appeal, City
Council may reverse, affirm or modify the order or determination appealed from
and may make such orders and requirements as should be made, for such purposes
exercising all of the powers of the Board. On such an appeal, Council shall
have no authority to provide relief beyond that which would have been available
to the appellant through the Board.  No action contrary to that of the Board
shall be taken except upon concurrence of two-thirds (2/3)or more of the
members elected to City Council.
      (4)   If City Council does not act upon such appeal within sixty (60)
days of the filing thereof, the appellant or applicant, at anytime thereafter,
may file a written demand with the Clerk of Council that City Council act
thereon within thirty (30) days thereafter. The failure of City Council to act
upon such appeal within thirty (30) days may at anytime thereafter be construed
by the appellant or applicant as a denial thereof, for purposes of further
appeal to a tribunal having jurisdiction thereover.
   (g)   Appeals to Tribunal:  No applicant for any permit or appellant for any
special relief provided for in this Chapter shall file an action with respect
thereto before any tribunal before having fully exhausted all administrative
remedies and appeals provided for in this Zoning Code.
   (h)   Fees:  Fees with respect to proceedings for special relief as provided
in this Chapter shall be payable by the appellant or applicant at the time of
the filing of the particular appeal. The appeal shall not be considered a
qualified or properly filed appeal until such fee is paid. The fees for such
appeals or applications shall be as determined from time to time by City
Council.

   (b)   In the case of violations of this Zoning Code, as determined by the
Planning and Zoning Administrator, that do not constitute an emergency or
require immediate attention, the Zoning Inspector shall provide notice of the

   (a)   Before starting construction on any new building, building addition or
structural modification and before making any new use of vacant land, the owner
or his or her agent must obtain a zoning permit. Zoning permits shall be in
effect for one (1) year from the date of issuance. If construction is started
within one (1) year from the date of issuance of a zoning permit, the permit
shall be in effect for a total of two (2) years from the date of issuance.
Extensions may be granted only with the approval of City Council.
   (b)   The zoning permit shall conform to all the requirements pertaining
thereto and shall be filed with the Planning and Zoning Division. If zoning
officials determine that the proposed building, building addition, structural
modification or new use of vacant land complies in all respects with the Zoning
Code and other applicable statutes, the zoning official shall issue an
appropriate zoning permit. If the Inspector determines otherwise, the
application shall not be issued and the applicant shall be notified of the
grounds for such disallowance.
   (c)   The zoning officials shall so act upon such applications for zoning
permits within ten (10) days after the filing thereof. Failure by the Planning
and Zoning Division to act within such period of time may, at any time
thereafter, be construed by the applicant as constituting disallowance of such
application, for purposes of appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals.
   (d)   Failure to obtain any permits and certificates required per the
provisions of this Zoning Code prior to the performance of any functions and/or
compliance of any mandates set forth in this Zoning Code shall constitute a
“late fee” equal to not less than three (3) times the cost of the original
permit or certificate plus a “fee” equal to the cost of the original permit or
certificate. 
(Ord. 119-2011.  Passed 6-21-11.)

of the proposed use. The zoning official shall notify the applicant and shall
indicate the grounds for a disallowance.
   (b)   The specifications for a Certificate of Occupancy shall conform to all
the requirements pertaining thereto and shall be filed with the Planning and
Zoning Division. If the zoning official determines that the proposed use
complies in all respects with this Zoning Code and applicable statutes, the
zoning official shall issue an appropriate Certificate of Occupancy. If the
zoning official determines otherwise, he or she shall disallow such application
and so notify the applicant, indicating the grounds for such disallowance.
   (c)   A Certificate of Occupancy for the use of a building to be erected,

public area which is shown on the Comprehensive Plan as intended for public
ownership, all or part of such area shall either be dedicated to the proper
public agency or it shall be reserved for acquisition thereby, within a
specified period by a purchase or other means. An agreement shall be entered
into between the subdivider and the proper public agency regarding the time and
method of acquisition and the cost thereof or an agreement shall be made by the
appropriate public agency upon an alternate location that is satisfactory to
the Planning Commission.
         B.   Due regard shall be shown for the preservation of outstanding
natural and cultural features, such as scenic spots, watercourses and historic
sites.
         C.   Where future parks or other open spaces are not specifically
shown on the Comprehensive Plan to be within a proposed residential subdivision
of ten (10) acres or more, the Planning Commission shall determine which of the
following options shall be required to best meet the needs of the community:
            1.   Dedicate to the City a minimum of five percent (5%) of the
area of the subdivision as open space. Open space shall not be considered to
include required detention/retention areas.
            2.   Dedicate to the City other suitable land outside the
subdivision equal to five percent (5%) of the area of the proposed subdivision.
            3.   Deposit in escrow with the City a fee equivalent to the
“before developed” appraised fair market value of seven and one-half percent
(7.5%) of the land in the subdivision immediately prior to its development,
plus one hundred dollars ($100.00) per recorded lot in the final plat. Such
deposit shall be allocated for acquisition and improvement of open space and
recreational lands and may be expended only for such purposes at the discretion
of the City. Fair market value with respect to this paragraph shall be
determined as follows:
               a.   A fair market value shall be determined by the Planning
Commission based upon “before developed” current appraisals.
               b.   If the subdivider rejects the amount of the evaluation, he
or she may, at his or her expense, obtain an appraisal by a qualified real
estate appraiser approved by the Planning Commission. The Planning Commission
may accept or reject this appraisal or may negotiate for a final value.
               c.   If the Planning Commission rejects the owner's appraisal,
then he or she shall refer the determination of a fair market value to the
Court of Common Pleas of Wood County.
            4.   In the event of exercise of the requirements of paragraph C.
hereof, improvement of the open space as required shall occur prior to the
recording of any lot in the second (2nd) fifty percent (50%) of the lots to be
recorded in the subdivision. Such improvement shall include completion of any
street or road necessary to provide access to the open space.

sixteen (16) feet in width.
         D.   A sixteen (16) foot storm drainage easement shall be required at
rear lot lines (eight [8] feet on each side of the rear lot line) whenever rear
lot drainage is provided and a plat recitation shall be required which
prohibits alteration of established drainage flow by other than the maintaining
authority.
         E.   A five (5) foot utility easement shall be required on one (1)
side of all alleys.
      (9)   Standards of Improvements.  The following minimum improvements
shall be completed to the satisfaction of the City before the recording of the
final plat:
         A.   Monuments.  All subdivision boundary corners and the four (4)
corners of all street intersections shall be marked with permanent Wood County
Type A monuments. A permanent marker shall be deemed to be concrete, six (6)
inches diameter by thirty (30) inches, with one-quarter (¼) inch iron pipe cast

construction plan for street improvements for a part of the proposed
subdivision area, preliminary street grades and proposed drainage facilities
for the entire subdivision area shall also be presented.
            3.     Drawings. The construction drawings shall be made with India
ink or some other equally substantial and distinct material such as mylar from
which clear and legible prints may be obtained, using the principles of good
surveying, engineering or draftsmanship. The construction drawings shall be
made measuring twenty-four (24) inches by thirty- six (36) inches. A poorly-
drawn or illegible plan is sufficient cause for rejection. The original mylar
set of drawings, seven (7) sets of twenty-four (24) inches by thirty-six (36)
inches prints, and four (4) sets of eleven (11) inches by seventeen (17) inches
reductions and one (1) electronic copy shall be provided to the City upon the
City's approval of such drawings.

            6.     Plan and profile.  The plan view shall be drawn to a scale
of one (1) inch equals fifty (50) feet or larger. The plan view shall show the
proposed road, street or alley alignment, right-of-way and pavement widths,
centerlines, bearings, stationing, curve or radius data, existing and proposed
drainage, sanitary sewers and waterlines. Any other significant feature shall
also be shown on the plan. The centerline of road, street or alley construction
shall coincide with the centerline of the right-of- way. The profile view shall
have a horizontal scale equal to the plan scale and a vertical scale of one (1)
inch equals five (5) feet or larger. The existing and proposed centerline
profile, elevations, gradient, drainage lines and vertical curves shall be
shown.
         E.   Poles and Wires. Unless otherwise determined, all electrical,
telephone and other poles and wires shall be located within the easement at the
rear of the lots. In all subdivisions containing more than five (5) lots,
except along an existing paved street, all wires and cables, including
electrical and telephone wires and cables and those wires and cables used for
street lighting, shall be installed underground, in accordance with standards
and regulations promulgated by the Ohio Public Utilities Commission and in
accordance with the specifications of the City. Where utilities are installed
underground, the location of same shall be distinctly identified through the
use of permanent colored identification tape over the line or other suitable
means.
         F.   Water Supplies.  Where an approved public water supply is within
reasonable access to the subdivision, water facilities shall be installed in
accordance with all applicable requirements of the City and/or the Northwestern
Water and Sewer District. When a subdivision is located where no approved
public water supply is reasonably accessible or procurable, the subdivider
shall construct wells or a private water supply in such a manner that an
adequate supply of water will be available to each lot in the subdivision.
Construction of water supply facilities shall not begin until the construction
plans have been approved by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency.
         G.   Sanitary Sewers. Where public sanitary sewers are within

Sewer District. Where sanitary sewers are not within a reasonable distance of
the subdivision, the subdivider shall either install a sanitary sewer system
and treatment plant or provide individual septic tanks for each lot, in
accordance with all applicable requirements of the City and/or the Northwestern
Water and Sewer District. Construction of sanitary sewer facilities shall not
begin until the construction plans have been approved by the Ohio Environmental
Protection Agency.
         H.   Storm Drainage.
            1.   All necessary facilities, including underground pipes, inlets,
catch basins or open drainage ditches, shall be installed to provide for the
adequate disposal of surface water and to maintain any natural drainage course.
            2.    Existing agricultural drainage ditches located within a 
subdivision shall be realigned, widened, deepened, revested, paved, or replaced
with an underground pipe as required for the handling of storm run-off from
roofs and paved surfaces.
            3.    When lots are to be provided with septic tanks, the storm
drainage invert shall be at least three (3) feet below the natural ground level
in the vicinity of the septic tank in order to facilitate subsurface drainage,
provided that the effluent discharge shall not be connected to the storm
drainage.
            4.    An overall drainage layout plan showing the limits of the
contributing run-off area, broken down into areas contributing to each drainage
pick-up point, shall be submitted with the paving and drainage plans. Drainage
design within the development shall be adequate to handle the entire
contributing watershed area and its existing, proposed and probable future
development and not the area under submission only. When the design makes use
of an existing storm sewer or open ditch, cross-sections and profiles shall be
submitted which show the existing conditions at least five hundred (500) feet
downstream from the plat being considered. If existing downstream storm sewer
facilities are not adequate, downstream improvements or retention ponds within
the plat being considered shall be required at the expense of the subdivider.
            5.    If future plat extensions will utilize the same drainage
system, the overall drainage plan shall be submitted with the first plat paving
plans.
            6.    Complete drainage calculations must be submitted for pipe
size determinations, ten (10) year hydraulic gradient checks and catch basin
type and spacing designs.
            7.    The overall drainage layout plan shall show the proposed
grading of each lot, the proposed ground elevation at the building on each lot
and all existing and proposed drainage facilities.
            8.    Each lot in a subdivision shall have direct access to a storm
sewer.
            9.    The minimum diameter for any storm sewer which receives water
from a surface water inlet shall be twelve (12) inches. The minimum diameter
for any storm sewer which receives water from only subsurface foundation drains
shall be eight (8) inches.
            10.   Downspouts and foundation drains shall not be extended
through the curb to outlet into the gutter. Water from downspouts and
foundation drains shall be directed over the ground using splash blocks or
other erosion control devices.
            11.    Storm drainage facilities shall, in general, be installed
in  accordance with all applicable requirements of the City and/or the Wood
County. Storm sewer standards, construction and specifications shall conform to
the Requirements and Procedures for Storm Drainage Design as published in the
Wood County Construction Standards.
            12.    Headwalls, as approved by the Director of Public Service or
his/her designee, shall be constructed at both ends of all culverts. Where
possible, culverts shall be in accordance with a standard Ohio Department of
Transportation design. Erosion control may be required at culverts or other
locations along open ditches.
         I.   Sidewalks.
            1.   Portland cement concrete sidewalks having a minimum width of
five (5) feet and conforming to construction specifications of the City shall
be constructed along both sides and for the full length of all streets.
            2.    Curb ramps in accordance with the Ohio Department of
Transportation Standard Construction Drawings shall be provided at all
locations where the sidewalk intersects the curb.
            3.    Sidewalks shall, in general, be located within the public
right-of-way, one (1) foot from the right-of-way line. Sidewalks may be located
on private property if the necessary easements are shown on the final plat.
         J.   Inspection of Sanitary and Storm Sewers.  All public sanitary
sewer construction by a subdivider shall be inspected at the expense of the
subdivider. Such inspections shall be accomplished following normal
infiltration and air testing of newly installed sanitary sewers and supervised
television inspection on DVD. All public storm sewer construction shall be
inspected by such methods as are approved by the Director of Public Service or
his/her designee. Such inspections shall be completed in a satisfactory manner
as a condition precedent to the acceptance of such sewers by the City.
         K.   Location of Taps.  All necessary taps authorized by the City into
a sanitary sewer that is connected to the wastewater treatment plant shall be
extended a minimum of three (3) feet into each abutting lot. The intent of this
regulation is to eliminate excavation in the City right-of-way to complete
tapping, thus preventing the elimination of established property line
monuments.
         L.   Streetlights. Streetlights shall be provided in all subdivisions.
Within residential subdivisions, only the City will prepare the street lighting
plan, with the developer bearing the costs associated with such plan
preparations.  (Ord.  34-2006.  Passed 3-7-06.)
         M.   Street Trees.
            1.    Street trees shall be planted along all street frontages.
            2.    The number, size, species and location of the street trees
shall be in accordance with a plan approved by the Street Tree Commission.  The
plan shall be prepared by a registered landscape architect.  Six (6) copies of
the plan shall be submitted with the subdivision plans for approval.
               (Ord.  47-2017.  Passed 5-2-17.)
         N.   Street Signs.  Street signs shall be provided in all
subdivisions, including street name signs, stop signs, speed limit signs, no
parking signs and no outlet, etc. A sign plan shall be submitted with the
subdivision improvement plans for approval by the City, the Township and/or
Wood County. Signs shall be installed by the City, the Township and/or Wood
County at the expense of the developer.
      (10)   Variances.  Whenever the tract to be subdivided is of such unusual
size or shape or is surrounded by such development or unusual conditions that
the strict application of the requirements of these regulations would result in
substantial hardship or injustice, such requirements may be or modified by the
Planning Commission so that the subdivider may subdivide his property in a
reasonable manner, provided that the public welfare and interest of the City
and the surrounding areas are thoroughly protected and the general intent and
spirit of these regulations are enforced.
      (11)   Inspection Fees.   Each subdivider and developer of land shall pay
the City the actual cost of control testing, checking, investigating, and
inspecting all improvements during construction as required by law and these
subdivision regulations. Such cost shall be determined to be the moneys
expended by the City, plus a thirty percent (30%) surcharge required to defray
the cost of City inspection functions. Failure of the subdivider or developer
to assume and pay charges contemplated by this Chapter shall be cause for the
City to refuse to accept the dedication of streets and ways and to refuse to
issue zoning and occupancy permits.
         (Ord. 34-2006.  Passed 3-7-06.)
1295.06  PRELIMINARY PLATS.

authorize the issuance of a search warrant permitting access to and inspection
of that part of the premises on which the nuisance or violation exists. A

the notice may be posted on the outside front entrance of the building. The
property maintenance officer shall file and provide notice to any owner or
occupant of any violation at any address other than the last known address
provided hereunder if such other address is filed with the property maintenance
officer personally or by certified mail addressed to the property maintenance
officer. Date of service of the notice shall be determined (where service is by
mail) as the day following the day of mailing for notices to addresses within
the City and as of the fourth day after the day of mailing for notices to
addresses outside the City. Where the day of service would fall upon a Sunday
or other day when mail is not ordinarily delivered, then the day of service
shall be the next regular delivery day. Notwithstanding any other provisions
herein contained where premises are subject to registration and have been so
registered, notice served upon the agent designated therein shall constitute
service upon the owner, or lessor of the premises, jointly and severally.
   (c)    Non-compliance with Notice. Whenever the owner, agent, occupant, or
operator of a structure or premises fails, neglects, or refuses to comply with
any notice of the property maintenance officer, the property maintenance
officer may advise the Director of Law of the circumstances, and request him to
institute an appropriate  legal action to compel compliance.

and distinct violation independent of any other section or subsection or any
order issued pursuant to this Code. Each day's failure to comply with any such
section or subsection shall constitute a separate violation. Where the
defendant is other than a natural person or persons, this section shall also
apply to any agent, superintendent, officer, member, director, or partner who
shall alone or with others have charge, care, or control of the premises.

(Ord. 80-2011.  Passed 6-7-11.)
1453.02  FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The City of Perrysburg has special flood hazard areas that are subject to
periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and govemmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood  protection  and  relief,  and  impairment  of 
the  tax  base.  Additionally, structures that are inadequately elevated,
floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the
flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the
purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations are adopted.
(Ord. 80-2011.  Passed 6-7-11.)
1453.03  STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety
and general welfare, and to:
   (a)    Protect human life and health;
   (b)    Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (c)    Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (d)    Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (e)    Minimize damage to  public facilities  and  utilities such as  water
and gas  mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges
located in areas of special flood hazard;
   (f)     Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
   (g)    Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions;
   (h)    Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near flood prone areas;
   (i)    Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
   (j)    Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values
of the floodplain;
   (k)    Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible; and
   (l)     Meet community participation  requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
      (Ord. 80-2011.  Passed 6-7-11.)
1453.04  METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS.
   In order to accomplish  its purposes, these regulations include methods and
provisions for:
   (a)    Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
   (b)    Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (c)    Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (d)    Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development  which may increase flood damage; and
   (e)    Preventing or regulating the constmction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas. 
(Ord. 80-2011.  Passed 6-7-11.)
1453.05  LANDS TO WHICH THESE REGULATIONS APPLY.
   These regulations shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within
the jurisdiction of the City of Perrysburg as identified in  Section
1453.06,  including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by the
City of Perrysburg.
(Ord. 80-2011.  Passed 6-7-11.)
1453.06  BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING  THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.
   For the purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are
adopted:
   (a)    Flood Insurance Study Wood County, Ohio and  Incorporated Areas and
Flood Insurance Rate Map Wood County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas, both 
effective September 2, 2011.
   (b)    Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for establishment
of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year floodplain,
floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
   (c)    Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City of Perrysburg as required by Section
1453.27 , Subdivisions and Large Developments.
   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby adopted
by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or
studies are on file at the Planning and Zoning Office, 201 West Indiana Avenue,
Perrysburg, Ohio.
(Ord. 80-2011.  Passed 6-7-11.)
1453.07  ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   These regulations are not intended to repeal any existing ordinances
including subdivision regulations, zoning or building codes. In the event of a
conflict between these regulations and any other ordinance, the more
restrictive shall be followed. These regulations shall not impair any deed
restriction, covenant or easement but the land subject to such interests shall
also be governed by the regulations.
(Ord. 80-2011.  Passed 6-7-11.)
1453.08  INTERPRETATION.
   In the interpretation and application of these regulations, all provisions
shall be:
   (a)    Considered as minimum requirements;
   (b)    Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
   (c)    Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.
   Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with a state or
Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over these
regulations.
(Ord. 80-2011.  Passed 6-7-11.)
1453.09  WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. These regulations do
not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. These regulations
shall not create liability on the part of the City of Perrysburg, any officer
or employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood
damage that results from reliance on these regulations or any administrative
decision lawfully made thereunder. 
(Ord. 80-2011.  Passed 6-7-11.)
1453.10  SEVERABILITY.
   Should any section or provision of these regulations be declared by the
courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the
validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof other than the part
so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 80-2011.  Passed 6-7-11.)
1453.11  DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (a)    Accessory Structure.  A structure on the same lot with, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to the principal structure.

   (h)    Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management).  Issued  by 
President  Carter  in  1977,  this  order  requires  that  no  federally 
assisted activities  be conducted  in  or  have  the  potential  to  affect 
identified  special  flood hazard areas, unless there is no practicable
alternative.
   (i)     Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).  The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance  Program.
   (j)     Fill.  A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)    Flood or Flooding.  A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)    The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)    The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters
from any source.
   (l)     Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM).  Usually the initial map, produced
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (m)    Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM).  An official map on which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)    Flood Insurance Risk Zones.  Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs
that indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a
community. Following are the zone definitions:
      Zone A:
Special flood hazard areas inundated  by the 100-year flood; base flood
elevations are not determined.
      Zones A1-30 and Zone AE:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; base flood
elevations are determined.
      Zone AO:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; with flood depths
of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain); average depths are
determined.

Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; flood depths of 1
to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood elevations are determined.
      Zone A99:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood to be protected from
the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection system under construction; no
base flood elevations are determined.
      Zone B and Zone X (shaded):
Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject to the 100-year flood with average
depths of less than 1 foot or with contributing drainage area less than 1
square mile; and areas protected by levees from the base flood.
      Zone C and Zone X (unshaded):
Areas determined to be outside the 500-year floodplain.
   (o)    Flood Insurance Study (FIS).  The official report in which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries  (sometimes shown 
on Flood Boundary  and Floodway  Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)    Flood Protection Elevation.  The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE,
is the base flood elevation. In areas where no base  flood  elevations  exist 
from  any  authoritative  source, the flood protection elevation can be
historical  flood  elevations,  or  base  flood  elevations  determined and/or
approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (q)    Floodway.  A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that have  been reserved in order to pass the base
flood  discharge.  A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized by
any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
   (r)    Freeboard.  A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a
flood level for the purposes of floodplain  management. Freeboard tends to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway
conditions, such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice
jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)    Historic Structure.  Any structure that is:
      (1)    Listed  individually  in  the  National  Register  of  Historic 
Places  (a  listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior)  or
preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the
requirements for individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)    Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior  as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district  preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)    Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)     Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis.  An analysis
performed by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in
accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to
determine flood elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)    Letter of Map Change (LOMC).  A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise  effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA).
A revision based on technical data showing that a property was incorrectly
included in a designated special flood hazard area. A LOMA amends the current
effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and establishes that a specific property is
not located in a special flood hazard area.
Letter of Map Revision (LOMR).
A revision based on technical data that, usually due to manmade changes, shows
changes to flood zones, flood  elevations, floodplain and floodway
delineations, and planimetric features.  One common type of LOMR,  a LOMR-F, 
is a determination concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated
by fill above the base flood elevation and is, therefore, excluded from the
special flood hazard area.
Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR).
A formal review and comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies
with the minimum National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management
criteria.  A CLOMR does not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate
Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)    Lowest floor.  The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure
below the lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant  enclosure 
usable  solely  for  parking  of  vehicles, building access or storage, in an
area other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in
accordance with the applicable design requirements specified in these
regulations for enclosures below the lowest floor.
   (w)   Manufactured  home.  A structure,  transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is  designed for use with
or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured  home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured  homes
and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (x)    Manufactured home park.  As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (y)    National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).  The NFIP is a Federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents  caused by
floods.  Participation  in  the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the federal government that states if a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood  risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)    New construction.  Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of Perrysburg's
Flood Insurance Rate Map, May 2, 1983 and includes any subsequent improvements
to such structures.
   (aa)     Person.  Includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership,  association, or any other entity, including state
and local governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio
R.C. 111.15 as any governmental entity of the State and includes, but is not
limited to, any board, department, division, commission,  bureau,  society, 
council,  institution,  state college  or university, community college
district, technical college district, or state community college. "Agency" does
not include the general assembly, the controlling  board, the adjutant
general's department, or any court.
   (bb)     Recreational vehicle.  A vehicle  which  is:
      (1)   Built on a single  chassis, 
      (2)    400 square  feet  or less  when measured at the largest horizontal
projection,
      (3)    Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck, and    
      (4)    Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   (cc)     Registered Professional Architect.  A person registered to engage
in the practice of architecture  under the provisions of Sections 4703.01 to
4703.19 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (dd)     Registered Professional Engineer.  A person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (ee)     Registered Professional Surveyor.  A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (ff)     Special Flood Hazard Area.  Also  known  as "Areas  of  Special 
Flood  Hazard",  it is  the  land  in the  floodplain subject to a one percent
(1%) or greater chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard
areas are designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood
Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary  and Flood way
Maps and  Flood  Hazard  Boundary  Maps  as  Zones  A,  AE,  AH,  AO,  A1-30, 
and  A99. Special flood hazard areas may also refer to areas that are flood
prone and designated from other federal, state or local sources of data
including but not limited to historical flood information reflecting  high
water marks, previous flood inundation  areas, and flood prone soils associated
with a watercourse.
   (gg)     Start of construction.  The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on  a site, such  as the  pouring of 
slab  or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or
any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured
home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation,
such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of
streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement,
footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it
include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as
garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main
structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction
means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural
part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external
dimensions of a building.
   (hh)     Structure.  A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas
or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (ii)    Substantial Damage.  Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure
before the damage occurred.
   (jj)   Substantial Improvement.  Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
"start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures,
which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The term does not, however, include:
      (1)    Any improvement to a structure that is considered "new
construction,"
      (2)    Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)    Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (kk)    Variance.  A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)    Violation.  The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations.

review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
   (b)    Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA flood
maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and floodway
boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width and/or
lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased base
flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood maps
and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (c)    When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
      (1)    Upon  the  issuance  of  a  Letter  of  Final  Determination  by 
the  FEMA,  the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all
previously existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of
administering these regulations.
      (2)    Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary  flood  hazard  data  shall  only  be  required  where 
no  base  flood elevations and /or floodway areas exist or where the
preliminary base flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood
elevations and/or floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from
FEMA. Such preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
   (d)    The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting  the  determination of  the  location  of 
the  boundary  shall  be  given  a reasonable opportunity to appeal the
interpretation as provided in Section
1453.34,  Appeals and Variances.
   (e)    Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation  profile,  floodway  data  table, 
established  high  water  marks,  etc.)  shall prevail.
      (Ord. 80-2011.  Passed 6-7-11.)
1453.23  SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE DETERMINATIONS.

1453.33  ASSURANCE OF FLOOD CARRYING CAPACITY.
   Pursuant to the purpose and methods of reducing flood damage stated in these
regulations, the following additional standards are adopted to assure that the
reduction of the flood carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
   (a)    Development in Floodways.
      (1)    In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of  the  base  flood  discharge.  Prior to
issuance of a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a
hydrologic and hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional
engineer, demonstrating that the proposed  development  would not result in any
increase in the base flood elevation; or
      (2)    Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be pennitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
         A.     Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1453.21 (a);
         B.     An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
         C.     Certification that no structures are located in areas that
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
         D.    Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
         E.     Concurrence of the Mayor of the City of Perrysburg and the
Chief Executive Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed
actions.
   (b)    Development in Riverine Areas with Base Flood Elevations but No
Floodways.
      (1)    In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point.  Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
      (2)    Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
         A.     An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an increase
of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why these
alternatives are not feasible;
         B.     Section
1453.33(a)(2) items A. and C. - E.
   (c)    Alterations of a Watercourse.  For the purpose of these regulations,
a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the "bankfull
stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a  watercourse,
the following standards apply:
      (1)    The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development pennit,  the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and  certification by  a  registered  professional
engineer  that  the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will
not be diminished.
      (2)    Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      (3)    The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the
City of Perrysburg specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement
is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
      (4)    The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical data
in Section
1453.21(a)(1)C. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.

Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be granted a hearing on the
matter before the Appeals Board provided that such person shall file, within 21
days of the date of such notice and order, or other official action, a brief
statement of the grounds for such hearing or for the mitigation of any item
appearing on any order of the Floodplain Administrator's decision. Such appeal
shall be in writing, signed by the applicant, and be filed with the Floodplain
Administrator. Upon receipt of the appeal, the Floodplain Administrator shall
transmit said notice and all pertinent information on which the Floodplain
Administrator's decision was made to the Appeals Board.
   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
(Ord. 80-2011.  Passed 6-7-11.)
1453.38  VARIANCES.
   Any person believing that the use and development standards of these
regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an application for a
variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to authorize, in specific
cases, such variances from the standards of these regulations, not inconsistent
with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary to the public interest where,
owing to special conditions of the lot or parcel, a literal enforcement of the
provisions of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship.
   (a)    Application for a Variance.
      (1)    Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
      (2)    Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
   (b)    Public Hearing.  At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors,  standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
      (1)    The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
      (2)    The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage.
      (3)    The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
      (4)    The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
      (5)    The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
      (6)    The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
      (7)    The compatibility of  the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
      (8)    The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area.
      (9)    The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
      (10)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
      (11)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
   (c)    Variances shall only be issued upon:
      (1)    A showing of good and sufficient cause.
      (2)    A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
      (3)    A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
      (4)    A  determination  that  the structure or other development is 
protected  by methods to minimize flood damages.
      (5)    A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these regulations,
the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances, as
it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
   (d)    Other Conditions for Variances.
      (1)    Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)    Generally, variances may  be issued  for  new  construction and 
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section
1453.38(b)(l) to (11) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
      (3)    Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance will
be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.
         (Ord. 80-2011.  Passed 6-7-11.)
1453.39  PROCEDURE AT HEARINGS.

1460.10  ENFORCEMENT; SERVICE OF NOTICES AND ORDERS; HEARINGS.
   The Zoning Inspector shall have the primary duty of enforcing the provisions
of this chapter under the direction of the Director of Public Service-Safety.
It shall be the duty of all officers and employees of the Municipality, and
especially all members of the Police and Fire Divisions, to assist the Zoning
Inspector by reporting to him, for the taking by him of the necessary initial
action, all apparent violations.
   (a)    When the Zoning Inspector determines that there are reasonable
grounds to believe that there has been a violation of any provision of this
chapter or of any rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto, he shall give
notice of such alleged violation to the person or persons responsible therefor,
as hereinafter provided.
      (1)    Such notice shall:
         A.    Be put in writing and include a description of the real estate
sufficient for identification;
         B.    Include a statement of the reasons why it is being issued;
         C.    Allow a reasonable time for the performance of any act it
requires;
         D.    Be served upon the owner, or the occupant, as the case may
require; provided that such notice shall be deemed to be properly served upon
such owner or upon such occupant, if a copy thereof is served upon him
personally; or if a copy thereof is sent by registered mail to his last known
address; or if a copy thereof is posted in a conspicuous place in or about the
dwelling affected by the notice; or if he is served with such notice by any
other method authorized or required under the laws of this State.
      (2)    Such notice may contain an outline of remedial action which, if
taken, will effect compliance with the provisions of this chapter and with
rules and regulations adopted pursuant thereto.
   (b)    Any person affected by any notice which has been issued in connection
with the enforcement of any provision of this chapter, or of any rule or
regulation adopted pursuant thereto, may request and shall be granted a hearing
on the matter before the Zoning Inspector provided that such person shall file
in the office of the Zoning Inspector a written petition requesting such
hearing and setting forth a brief statement of the grounds therefor within ten
days after the day the notice was served. Upon receipt of such petition the
Zoning Inspector shall set a time and place for such hearing and shall give the
petitioner written notice thereof. At such hearing the petitioner shall be
given an opportunity to be heard and to show why such notice should be modified
or withdrawn. The hearing shall be commenced not later than ten days after the
date on which the petition was filed; provided that upon application of the
petitioner the Zoning Inspector may postpone the date of the hearing for a
reasonable time beyond such ten-day period, if in his judgment the petitioner
has submitted a good and sufficient reason for such postponement;
   (c)    After such hearing the Zoning Inspector shall sustain, modify or
withdraw the notice, depending upon his finding as to whether the provisions of
this chapter and of the rules and regulations adopted pursuant thereto have
been complied with. If the Zoning Inspector sustains or modifies such notice,
it shall be deemed to be in order. Any notice served pursuant to subsection (a)
of this section shall automatically become an order if a written petition for a
hearing is not filed in the office of the Zoning Inspector within ten days
after such notice is served. After a hearing in the case of any notice
suspending any permit required by this chapter or by any rule or regulation
adopted pursuant thereto, when such notice has been sustained by the Zoning
Inspector, the permit shall be deemed to have been revoked. Any such permit
which has been suspended by a notice shall be deemed to be automatically
revoked if a petition for hearing is not filed in the office of the Zoning
Inspector within ten days after such notice is served.
   (d)   The proceedings at such hearing, including the findings and decision
of the Zoning Inspector shall be summarized, reduced to writing, and entered as
a matter of public record in the office of the Zoning Inspector. Such record
shall also include a copy of every notice or order issued in connection with
the matter. Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Zoning Inspector may
seek relief therefrom in any court of competent jurisdiction, as provided by
the laws of the State.
   (e)    Whenever the Zoning Inspector finds that an emergency exists which
requires immediate action to protect the public health, he may, without notice
of hearing, issue an order reciting the existence of such an emergency and
requiring that such action be taken as he deems necessary to meet the
emergency. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this chapter, such order
shall be effective immediately. Any person to whom such order is directed shall
comply therewith immediately, but upon petition to the Zoning Inspector shall
be afforded a hearing as soon as possible. After such hearing, depending upon
his finding as to whether the provisions of this chapter and of the rules and
regulations adopted pursuant thereto have been complied with the Zoning
Inspector shall continue such order in effect, or modify it, or revoke it.
      (Ord. 65-66. Passed 12-13-66.)
1460.11  SMOKE DETECTOR REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)    The owner of each new and existing one, two or three-family dwelling
unit shall, after the effective date of this section (Ordinance 13-86, passed
April 15, 1986), install smoke detectors as hereinafter provided. At least one
smoke detector shall be installed to protect each sleeping area, and there
shall be at least one smoke detector installed on each level of the dwelling,
i. e. the cellar, basement, first floor and second floor.
   (b)    The owner of all existing dwelling units greater than three-family
shall have installed a minimum of one smoke detector in each sleeping area or
room.
   (c)    Such smoke detectors shall be capable of sensing visible or invisible
particles of combustion, shall provide a suitable audible alarm thereof and
shall be certified as to having met Underwriters' Laboratories Standards No.
217 for single and multiple-station smoke detectors. All smoke detectors shall
be installed in accordance with the manufacturer's directions as to location
and installation where such directions do not conflict with this section. A
sleeping area is defined as the area or areas of the family unit in which the
bedrooms or sleeping rooms are located. Where bedrooms or rooms ordinarily used
for sleeping rooms are separated by other use areas, such as kitchens or living
rooms, but not bathrooms or closets, they shall be considered as separate
sleeping areas for the purpose of this section and shall require protection.
When activated, the smoke detector shall provide a suitable alarm audible
within all of the individual sleeping rooms or areas.
   (d)    In new dwelling units, smoke detectors shall be wired directly to the
dwelling power supply. In existing dwellings, smoke detectors may be wired
(hardwired) to the dwelling power supply or powered by a self-monitored battery
or operated in a plug-in outlet which is fitted with a plug retainer device,
provided the outlet is not controlled by any switch other than by the main
power supply. All smoke detectors that are wired directly to the dwelling power
supply (hardwired) shall be installed in accordance with the National
Electrical Code.
   (e)   After May 31, 1986, upon every change of occupancy of every dwelling
unit occasioned by or incidental to a sale, rental, lease or sublease of such
unit, the grantor thereof, i.e. the seller, landlord, lessor or sublessor, as
the case may be, shall certify to the new occupant, before occupancy, that all
smoke detectors required by this section or other applicable laws are installed
and in proper working condition.  This subsection shall not be construed to
vitiate or render void any contract, lease or sublease subject thereto.
   (f)   In one, two or three-family dwellings, the occupant shall be
responsible for the operation and maintenance of installed smoke detectors,
i.e. battery replacement.  In all dwelling units greater than three-family, the
owner shall be responsible for the operation and maintenance of the smoke
detectors.
   (g)   No tenant shall remove or render a smoke detector inoperative.
   (h)   As an alternative to self-contained smoke detectors, an approved
detection system may be installed.  Each such fire detection system must be
individually approved by the Fire Division.
   (i)   No smoke detector or alternative system shall be directly connected
(permanently wired) to the electrical system of the structures unless an
electrical permit has first been obtained therefor from the County Building
Inspection Department.
   (j)   This section is intended to be used with and supplemented by the
applicable provisions of the National Fire Protection Association Standard 74,
1974 edition, which is hereby incorporated herein.  However, if there is any
conflict between this section and such supplemental standard, then this
section, and any rules and regulations adopted pursuant thereto, shall
prevail. 
(Ord. 13-86.  Passed 4-15-86.)
1460.12  SEPARABILITY.
   Should any section, clause or provision of this chapter be declared by any
court to be invalid, the same shall not affect the validity of this chapter as
a whole or any part thereof, other than the particular section, clause or
provision thereof so declared to be invalid.
(Ord. 65-66.  Passed 12-13-66.)
1460.13  DISPLAY OF STREET ADDRESSES.
   (a)   Owners of all premises, except vacant land, shall display the street
address of the premises in a conspicuous place visible and legible from the
public right-of-way to which the address applies.  In the case of premises such
as a condominium, where the City has assigned an address on a private street,
the foregoing requirements shall apply relative to the private street rather
than a public right-of-way.  Determination concerning the legibility of such
address shall be made by the Fire Chief.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. 
Punishment shall be as provided in Section
698.02.  A separate offense shall be deemed committed each day a violation
continues after service of notice.  (Ord. 115-98.  Passed 8-4-98.)
1460.99  PENALTY.
   (a)   Whoever violates any of the provisions of this chapter for which no
penalty is otherwise provided, or fails to comply therewith or with any of the
requirements thereof, is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree and shall
be fined not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) or imprisoned not more
than sixty days, or both.  A separate offense shall be deemed committed each
day during or on which a violation or noncompliance occurs or continues.  The
owner of the building where anything in violation of this chapter is permitted
to exist, and any agent, lessee, operator or occupant in connection with such
violation, or who may have assisted in the commission of any such violation,
shall be deemed guilty of a separate offense and shall be subject to the
penalty herein provided.
   (b)   Whoever violates any of the provisions of Section
1460.11 is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and shall be fined not more than one
hundred dollars ($100.00).  A separate offense shall be deemed committed each
day a violation continues after service of notice.
