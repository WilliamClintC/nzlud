Chapter 11
CRIMINAL HISTORY RECORDS SEARCHES
§ 11-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known as the "Criminal History Record Search Law"
of the Town of Gates.
§ 11-2. Legislative intent.
The Town Board of the Town of Gates, along with the Gates Fire District
and Gates Volunteer Ambulance Service, Inc., wishes to ensure that all
personnel acting on behalf of the Town of Gates and the Gates Fire District
and Volunteer Ambulance Service, Inc. are not only well-trained but also
upstanding and law-abiding citizens. Members of these organizations must
often enter homes on emergency conditions and must necessarily be trusted
not only with people's welfare but their property. It is therefore necessary
that a thorough criminal record search be done with respect to each
individual joining these organizations so as to ensure the welfare and safety
of the citizens of Gates. The Town of Gates has been informed that in
order for such criminal history record searches to be done, a local law
must be passed authorizing the Chief of Police to conduct such searches.
It is the intent of the Town of Gates that such a criminal history record
§ 1-13 GATES CODE § 11-2
4:8
search will be limited to searches concerning any outstanding charges
against an individual or convictions. Nothing in this chapter is intended to
authorize inquiries into whether there have been charges brought against
an individual which resulted in dismissal in such individual's favor.
Therefore, this chapter will authorize the Chief of Police of the Town of
Gates to submit fingerprints to obtain criminal history records from the
Division of Criminal Justice Services (DCJS) of the State of New York for
applicants for employment, membership and licenses with the Gates Fire
Department and Gates Volunteer Ambulance Service, Inc.
§ 11-3. Fingerprinting required; scope of investigation.
All applicants for employment with the Gates Fire District for the position
of firefighter and applicants with the Gates Volunteer Ambulance Service,
Inc. for the position of emergency medical technician must be fingerprinted.
All such applicants, upon the request of the Gates Fire District or Gates
Volunteer Ambulance Service, Inc., shall be investigated by the Gates Police
Department, which investigation shall be limited to the submission of a full
set of applicant's fingerprints to the New York State DCJS for a criminal
history record search.
§ 11-4. Authority of Chief of Police.
The Chief of Police of the Town of Gates, or his/her designees, is authorized
to obtain the fingerprints of such applicant and shall thereupon forward the
fingerprints and any appropriate processing fee to the New York State DCJS
for processing and return of a criminal history record. The Chief of Police
of the Town of Gates, or his/her designee, in utilizing the criminal history
provided by the DCJS shall comply with all applicable law and policies of the
DCJS.
Chapter 13
DRUG-FREE WORKPLACE
§ 13-1. Findings; policy.
The Town of Gates has a responsibility to its employees, town residents
and the public at large to take active, reasonable steps to assure safety
in the workplace and safety in the delivery of the services that it provides
to the citizens of Gates. To this end, the town affirms its policy that it
strictly prohibits the unlawful use, distribution, possession or manufacture
of controlled substances in the workplace, in town vehicles (whether
performing town business or not), while performing town business
anywhere, including off of town property, or during work hours; the
consumption of alcohol in the workplace, in town vehicles (whether
performing town business or not), while performing town business
anywhere, including off of town property, or during working hours; and
allowing staff to work while they are under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
§ 11-2 DRUG-FREE WORKPLACE § 13-2
13:9
§ 13-2. Disciplinary action.
Any staff member who is determined to unlawfully use, distribute, possess
or manufacture controlled substances under the above-stated conditions;
to consume alcohol under the above-stated conditions; or to be working
with ability impaired due to the use of alcohol or drugs will be subject to
appropriate disciplinary action, including loss of wages or termination. The
town will also pursue legal recourse when appropriate.
§ 13-3. Employee assistance.
To assist employees who may have a drug or alcohol abuse problem, the
Town of Gates has entered into a contract with Park Ridge Hospital to
administer an Employee Assistance Program. This program is a confidential
counseling and referral program for employees with a variety of problems,
including alcohol and drug abuse. If a supervisor feels that an employee has
an abuse problem that is affecting his work performance or if the employee
is found to have unlawfully used, distributed, possessed or manufactured
controlled substances in the workplace or reported to work with ability
impaired due to drug or alcohol abuse, the supervisor should report this
immediately to the department head, who may mandate the employee's
attendance and follow through with the Employee Assistance Program.
§ 13-4. Compliance required; report of convictions.
Employees must as a condition of employment abide by the terms of this
policy. Employees who perform work that is funded by a federal project
must report any conviction under a criminal drug statute for violations
occurring on or off the town's premises while conducting town business to
their immediate supervisor. A report of conviction must be made within five
days after the conviction.

ARTICLE I
Intent
§ 17-1. Statement of legislative intent.
The Town Board of the Town of Gates recognizes that there are state
statutory provisions mandating towns to establish rules and standards of
ethical conduct for public officers and employees which, if observed, can
enhance public confidence in local government. In the light of a tendency
today on the part of some people to downgrade our local governments
and to discredit our public servants and our free institutions generally, it
appears necessary that every effort be made to assure the highest caliber
of public administration of this town as part of our state's important system
of local government. It is the purpose of this chapter to implement this
objective through the establishment of standards of conduct, to provide for
punishment of violation of such standards and to create a Board of Ethics to
render advisory opinions to the town's officers and employees as provided
for herein.
§ 17-2. Applicability of other laws.
The standards, prohibited acts and procedures established herein are in
addition to any prohibited acts, conflicts of interest provisions or
procedures prescribed by statute of the State of New York and also in
addition to common law rules and judicial decisions relating to the conduct
of town officers to the extent that the same are more severe in their
application than this chapter.

ARTICLE I
Alternative to Health Care Insurance Benefits
[Adopted 8-4-1997 by L.L. No. 5-1997]
§ 24-1. Title.
This article shall be known as the "Local Law Providing an Alternative to
Health Insurance Benefits."
§ 24-2. Purpose.
It is the purpose of this article to codify the Town of Gates' procedure to
allow employees to take a cash payment in lieu of certain health insurance
benefits. This procedure was established by resolution of the Gates Town
Board on March 1, 1993 (R. 9193). This policy results in a savings of health
insurance costs to the Town of Gates and a cash benefit to eligible town
employees.
§ 24-3. Waiver of town-provided coverage; payment in lieu of
benefits.
Any Town of Gates employee who is eligible to receive health insurance
coverage provided by the Town of Gates and who has an alternative
provider of similar health insurance coverage and benefits may elect to
waive said health insurance coverage and benefits and receive, in cash, one
half of the annual health insurance premium which would have been paid
by the Town of Gates to the health insurance provider for said coverage and
benefits.
§ 24-4. Plans included.
The health insurance plans which are subject to this article include general
medical insurance coverage and benefits, dental coverage and benefits
and vision care coverage and benefits. In the event that additional health
insurance plans are added to those offered to Town of Gates employees, the
Town Board of the Town of Gates may extend this article to apply to said
additional health insurance plan(s) by passing a resolution to that effect.
§ 24-5. Procedure; resumption of coverage.
Any Town of Gates employee who wishes to take advantage of this
alternative must make a request in writing to the Town of Gates Payroll
Administrator. Said letter must indicate which plan or plans the employee
wishes to terminate, a termination date and, with respect to the medical
insurance benefits, the source of the alternative medical insurance
coverage. The Payroll Administrator will take the appropriate steps to
terminate the insurance subsequent to receipt of the letter. The employee
shall receive one half of the pro rata savings to the town of the insurance
premium for the balance for the year in which termination occurs. The
payment will be made the first February following the date of termination.
§ 24-1 INSURANCE § 24-5
24:21
The payments in lieu of health insurance benefits will continue in
subsequent years unless the employee notifies the Payroll Administrator
in writing of his/her desire to resume receiving town-provided medical
coverage. In the event of resumption of coverage, the employee will receive
a cash benefit equal to one half of any pro rata savings applicable to the year
in which health care coverage was resumed. Any payments made pursuant
to this article will be net of any taxes or other required deductions.

purporting to act within the scope of his public employment or duties.
Such defense shall not be provided where such civil action or
proceeding is brought by or on behalf of the town.
B. Subject to the conditions set forth in this article, the employee shall be
represented by the Town Attorney or an attorney employed or retained
by the town for the defense of the employee. The Town Board shall
employ or retain an attorney for the defense of the employee whenever
the town does not have a Town Attorney or the Town Board determines,
based upon its investigation and review of the facts and circumstances
of the case, that representation by the Town Attorney would be
inappropriate or a court of competent jurisdiction determines that a
conflict of interest exists and that the employee cannot be represented
by the Town Attorney. Reasonable attorney's fees and litigation
expenses shall be paid by the town to such attorney employed or
retained, from time to time, during the pendency of the civil action
proceeding, subject to certification by the Town Supervisor that the
employee is entitled to representation under the terms and conditions
of this article. Payment of such fees and expenses shall be made in the
same manner as payment of other claims and expenses of the town. Any
dispute with respect to representation of multiple employees by the
Town Attorney or by an attorney employed or retained for such
purposes or with respect to the amount of the fees or expenses shall be
resolved by the court.

original or a copy of any summons, complaint, process, notice, demand or
pleading, within 10 days after he is served with such document, and the full
cooperation of the employee in the defense of such action or proceeding
and defense of any action or proceeding against the town based upon the
same act or omission and in the prosecution of any appeal. Such delivery
shall be deemed a request by the employee that the town provide for his
defense pursuant to this article, unless the employee shall state in writing
that a defense is not requested.
§ 36-4. Benefits to inure only to employees; effect on state law.
The benefits of this article will inure only to employees as defined herein
and shall not enlarge or diminish the rights of any other party, nor shall any

of any other provision of state or federal statutory or common law.
C. Where the employee delivers process and a request for a defense to the

article, the Town Attorney or the Supervisor, as the case may be, shall
take the necessary steps, including the retention of an attorney under

resolution of any question relating to the obligation of the town to

Part II: General Legislation
Chapter 59
ALARM SYSTEMS
§ 59-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known as the "Local Law Regulating Alarm Systems in
the Town of Gates."
§ 59-2. Purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to protect and promote the health, safety
and general welfare of the residents of the Town of Gates by reducing
the number of avoidable alarms to emergency agencies. Avoidable alarms
contribute to ineffective utilization of public safety manpower and
equipment. In addition, avoidable alarms require emergency responses
which may contribute to a high accident rate and delayed responses to
genuine emergencies. This chapter seeks to ensure that police, fire
communications and ambulance facilities will be available to dispatch
police, fire and ambulance personnel for actual emergencies and to alleviate
the nuisance of audible alarms in the town. Another purpose of this chapter
is to provide the town with the names of responsible people to contact in
the case of activation of an alarm.
§ 59-3. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
ALARM SYSTEM  A device or an assembly of equipment which emits an
audible response, which is intended to alert persons outside a premises
to the existence of a hazard or emergency or which is intended to alert
§ 44-10 GATES CODE § 59-3
47:42
emergency agencies by automatically dialing an emergency agency or
which is connected to a private answering point for the purpose of reporting
such alarms to emergency agencies or which is directly connected to the
Emergency Communications Center or other emergency agency.
ALARM USER  Any person who owns, leases or uses an alarm system
within the Town of Gates, except for a person whose alarm system is on a
motor vehicle or is a proprietary system. If, however, an alarm system on a
motor vehicle is connected with an alarm system at a premises (other than
a proprietary system) in the Town of Gates, the person using such system is
an alarm user.
AVOIDABLE ALARM  The activation of an alarm system through
mechanical failure, malfunction, improper installation or the negligence of
the owner, user, custodian or lessee of an alarm system, or of his employees
or agents, or through any other cause which, through direct connection to
an emergency agency or through notification of an emergency agency by a
private answering point or automatic dialing device or through notification
to an emergency agency by any second party or means, indicates that
an emergency situation exists requiring response within the town when,
in fact, an emergency situation does not exist. An "avoidable alarm" also
includes the knowing or intentional activation of an alarm to an emergency
agency when the activator knows that an emergency situation does not
exist. "Avoidable alarm" does not include alarms activated by violent
conditions of nature such as hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes or any
other similar cause beyond the control of the user of the alarm system.
Activation of an alarm system under any circumstances which the activator
reasonably believes that an emergency situation exists is not an avoidable
alarm. Notwithstanding any language to the contrary, the defective
installation of an alarm system, the failure to repair or cause to be repaired
an alarm system or the use of defective equipment in connection with an
alarm system shall not constitute an extraordinary circumstance beyond the
reasonable control of the alarm user.
EMERGENCY AGENCY  Any Police Department, Fire Department or other
law enforcement agency or ambulance company (public or private) or other
agency summoned to respond to an emergency situation and any public
safety answering point serving the Town of Gates.
LOCAL ALARM SYSTEM  A signaling system which, when activated,
causes an audible signaling device to be activated outside the premises
within which the system is installed.
NOTICE ADDRESS  The address which an alarm user designates on the
application for a permit as the address to which notices are to be sent.
PERSON  Any person, firm, partnership, corporation, association,
company or organization of any kind.
PRIVATE ANSWERING POINT  A business which offers the service of
receiving emergency signals, monitoring said signals and relaying them to
an emergency agency.
§ 59-3 ALARM SYSTEMS § 59-3
59:43
PROPRIETARY SYSTEM  An alarm, sounding and/or recording within the
premises protected by the alarm, which is not intended to alert persons
outside of the premises on which the alarm system is located of a possible
hazard and not intended to alert an emergency agency, the control center
being under the supervision of the proprietor of the protected premises. If a
proprietary system includes a signal line connected directly or by means of
an automatic device to an emergency agency or to a private answering point
or to a local alarm system, it thereby becomes an alarm system as defined
in this chapter.
TOWN  The Town of Gates.
§ 59-4. Exemptions.
§ 59-5. Permit required.
No person shall own, use, lease, operate or maintain an alarm system within
the Town of Gates unless such person shall have first obtained from the
town a permit for such alarm, as herein provided.
§ 59-6. Application for permit.
A. The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to proprietary systems.
B. Permits shall be required for alarm systems located in buildings of
federal, state or local governmental agencies or authorities or in public
or private elementary schools, but said alarm systems shall be exempt
from the permit fee, but said alarms shall be subject to the fines and
penalties herein provided for avoidable alarms.
A. In order to obtain an alarm user permit, any person who operates an
alarm system shall submit an application for such permit in the form
designated by the town, which application shall contain the following:
(1) The name, home address and telephone number of the person
applying for the permit.
(2) The address of the premises upon which the alarm system is or will
be located.
(3) The address to which notices required under this chapter shall be
sent.
(4) The type of alarm system for which the permit is sought.
(5) The name of the alarm business or businesses selling, installing,
monitoring, inspecting, responding to and/or maintaining the alarm
system, if applicable.
(6) The name, address and telephone number of one or more persons
who can be reached at any time and who are authorized by the
owner of the premises in which the system is installed to open the
premises.
§ 59-3 GATES CODE § 59-6
59:44
§ 59-7. Fee.
§ 59-8. Duration of permit.
An alarm user permit shall expire on April 30 next following its date of
issuance.
§ 59-9. Renewal of permit.
(7) Any other information relating to the alarm system or user as the
town may require.
B. The information required on the permit application shall be treated as
confidential and shall not be made available to members of the general
public. The Town Board finds that the release of such information would
constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy and could
endanger the life or safety of persons at the premises where an alarm
system is located. The information on a permit application shall be used
by the town only for public safety purposes.
A. Every application for an alarm user permit shall be accompanied by a
fee as set from time to time by resolution of the Town Board, except that
no fee shall be required for applications submitted by any alarm user by
December 31, 1985, nor for applications submitted after said date if the
application is submitted prior to the installation of an alarm system.
[Amended 9-7-1999 by L.L. No. 2-1999]
B. Upon the receipt of a properly executed permit application, the town
shall issue an alarm user permit to the applicant. Alarm user permits
shall not be transferable, shall be kept on the premises where the alarm
system is located and shall be made available for inspection by
emergency agency officers.
A. Subject to the provisions of this chapter and upon the payment of the
appropriate renewal fee as stipulated in Subsection B hereof, an alarm
user permit may be renewed by the alarm user.
B. The annual permit renewal fee shall be based upon the number of
avoidable alarms recorded for each alarm user as follows:
(1) For an alarm user with zero avoidable alarms during the preceding
year, no renewal fee shall be charged.
(2) For an alarm user with one to three avoidable alarms during the
preceding year, a base permit renewal fee as set from time to time
by resolution of the Town Board shall be charged. [Amended
9-7-1999 by L.L. No. 2-1999]
(3) For an alarm user with more than three avoidable alarms during
the preceding year, a base permit renewal fee plus an additional
excessive use fee for each avoidable alarm in excess of three shall
be charged as set from time to time by resolution of the Town
§ 59-6 ALARM SYSTEMS § 59-9
59:45
§ 59-10. Notice of excessive use.
The town shall notify an alarm user in writing, by means of first-class mail
sent to the notice address listed on the permit application, when an alarm
user has had three avoidable alarms during the permit year. The notice
shall inform the alarm user that additional avoidable alarms will subject
the alarm user to the excessive use fee as specified in this chapter for
each additional avoidable alarm. At the end of the permit year, the town
shall notify each alarm user having more than three avoidable alarms of
the number of avoidable alarms incurred during the preceding year and the
amount to be charged for the renewal of the alarm user permit. The notice
shall be in writing and shall be sent by first-class mail to the notice address
listed on the application.
§ 59-11. Revocation of permit.
An alarm user permit shall be revoked whenever 10 or more avoidable
alarms are recorded for a system in any one permit year. Notice of such
revocation shall be sent by the town via first-class mail, to the notice
address listed on the permit application, at least 15 days before the
revocation takes effect. The alarm user may reinstate a revoked permit by
the payment of the excessive use fee for each avoidable alarm in excess of
three (the excessive use fee shall be as specified in § 59-9B of this chapter)
and by submission of proof that modifications have been made to the alarm
system or other steps have been effected so as to reduce the number of
avoidable alarms. An alarm user permit shall not be revoked under this
section if said alarm system is required by federal, state or local law.
However, all other provisions of this chapter shall apply to such systems and
the user thereof shall remain responsible for the payment of all authorized
fees.
§ 59-12. Enforcement.
Any emergency agency as herein defined desiring the town to initiate
enforcement of this chapter against an alarm user who has generated
avoidable alarms shall comply with the following requirements:
Board. At the time of renewal, an alarm user shall receive credit
for any amounts paid during the permit year to reinstate a revoked
permit. [Amended 9-7-1999 by L.L. No. 2-1999]
C. No renewal of a permit shall be granted unless the appropriate renewal
fee is submitted with the application.
A. The emergency agency shall send to the Town Clerk of the Town of
Gates an alarm incident report containing the information required in
§ 59-13 within seven days of the alarm call.
B. A copy of the avoidable alarm incident report shall be mailed by the
emergency agency, via first-class mail, to the alarm user to the notice
address listed on the permit application.

shall contain the following information:
§ 59-14. Authority of Supervisor.
The Supervisor of the Town of Gates is authorized to develop procedures
for the purpose of implementing or providing clarification for §§ 59-12 and
59-13 of this chapter.
§ 59-15. Connections to Emergency Communications Center.
Alarm systems which are interconnected or otherwise transmit signals
directly to the Emergency Communications Center shall be subject to the
laws, rules, regulations and penalties adopted by the County of Monroe
relating to such systems.
§ 59-16. Local alarms.
C. An alarm user receiving a notice of an avoidable alarm may challenge
such classification by notifying the emergency agency in writing,
specifying in detail the reasons why the alleged avoidable alarm should
not be so classified. The challenging notice must be received by the
emergency agency within 20 days after notification to the alarm user. A
hearing may be requested by the alarm user with the notice. The failure
to give timely notice shall be deemed a waiver of the right to challenge
the classification.
D. Within a reasonable time, but not more than 45 days after receipt of a
notice from the alarm user challenging the classification of an alarm as
an avoidable alarm, the emergency agency shall make a final
determination, which shall be reviewable only pursuant to Article 78 of
the Civil Practice Law and Rules.
E. Within 10 days after a final determination has been made by the
emergency agency, a copy thereof shall be filed with the Town Clerk and
a copy mailed or otherwise given to the alarm user.

Chapter 63
BEST VALUE AWARD METHODOLOGY
§ 63-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known as "the Town of Gates Best Value Contract
Award Law."
§ 63-2. Finding and intent.
A. The State Legislature and Governor amended General Municipal Law
§ 103 (A08692/S6117) on January 27, 2012, to provide local
governments greater flexibility in awarding contracts by authorizing
the award of purchase contracts, including contracts for service work,
on the basis of best value. The state legislation requires political
subdivisions with a population of less than 1,000,000 to pass a local law
authorizing the use of the best value award process.
B. (From Assembly Bill Memo A08692) Enactment of this chapter provides
additional procurement options to localities in ways that may expedite
the procurement process and result in cost savings. The "best value"
standard for selecting goods and services vendors, including janitorial
and security contracts, is critical to efforts to use strategic sourcing
principles to modernize the supply chain and ensure that taxpayers
obtain the highest quality goods and services at the lowest potential
cost, while also ensuring fairness to all competitors.
C. The federal government, approximately half of the states and many
localities have added best value selection processes to their
procurement options, in recognition of these advantages. With the
increased complexity of the goods and services that municipalities must
obtain in order to serve taxpayers, it is critical to consider selection and
evaluation criteria that measure factors other than cost in the strictest
sense.
D. Taxpayers are not well served when a public procurement results in low
unit costs at the outset, but ultimately engenders cost escalations due
to factors such as inferior quality, poor reliability and difficulty of
maintenance. Best value procurement links the procurement process
directly to the municipality's performance requirements, incorporating
selection factors such as useful lifespan, quality and options and
incentives for more timely performance and/or additional services.
E. Even if the initial expenditure is higher, considering the total value over
the life of the procurement may result in a better value and long-term
investment of public funds. Best value procurement also encourages
competition and, in turn, often results in better pricing, quality and
customer service. Fostering healthy competition ensures that bidders
will continue to strive for excellence in identifying and meeting
municipalities' needs, including such important goals as the
§ 62-20 GATES CODE § 63-2
59:58
§ 63-3. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
BEST VALUE  The basis for awarding contracts for services to the offerer
who optimizes quality, cost and efficiency, among responsive and
responsible offerers. Such basis shall reflect, wherever possible, objective
and quantifiable analysis. Such basis may also identify a quantitative factor
for offerers that are small businesses or certified minority- or women-owned
business enterprises as defined in Subdivisions 1, 7, 15 and 20 of § 310
of the Executive Law to be used in evaluation of offers for awarding of
contracts for services.
§ 63-4. Requirements.
participation of small, minority- and women-owned businesses, and the
development of environmentally preferable goods and service delivery
methods. Best value procurement will provide much-needed flexibility
in obtaining important goods and services at favorable prices, and will
reduce the time to procure such goods and services.
A. Where the basis for award is the best value offer, the Comptroller/
Director of Finance shall document, in the procurement record and in
advance of the initial receipt of offers, the determination of the
evaluation criteria, which, whenever possible, shall be quantifiable, and
the process to be used in the determination of best value and the
manner in which the evaluation process and selection shall be
conducted.
(1) The Comptroller/Director of Finance shall select a formal
competitive procurement process in accordance with General
Municipal Law and Town of Gates purchasing policies and
document its determination in the procurement record. The
process shall include, but is not limited to, a clear statement of
need; a description of the required specifications governing
performance and related factors; a reasonable process for ensuring
a competitive field; a fair and equal opportunity for offerers to
submit responsive offers; and a balanced and fair method of award.
Where the basis for the award is best value, documentation in the
procurement record shall, where practicable, include a
quantification of the application of the criteria to the rating of
proposals and the evaluation results, or, where not practicable,
such other justification which demonstrates that best value will be
achieved.
B. The solicitation shall prescribe the minimum specifications or
requirements that must be met in order to be considered responsive
and shall describe and disclose the general manner in which the
evaluation and selection shall be conducted. Where appropriate, the
solicitation shall identify the relative importance and/or weight of cost

§ 63-5. Severability.
If any clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivision, section or part of this
chapter or the application thereof to any person, individual, corporation,
firm, partnership, entity or circumstance shall be adjudged by any court
of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unconstitutional, such order or
judgment shall not affect, impair, effect or invalidate the remainder thereof
but shall be confined in its operation to the clause, sentence, paragraph,
subdivision, section or part of this chapter or in its application to the
person, individual, corporation, firm, partnership, entity or circumstance
directly involved in the controversy in which such order or judgment shall

to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
B. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve
such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
C. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of
floodwaters;

damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
(4) The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
(5) The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
(6) The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which
are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
(7) The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
(8) The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program of that area;
(9) The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
(10) The costs to local governments and the dangers associated with

including technical information, and report any variances to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency upon request.
A. Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of 1/2 acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures
constructed below the base flood level, providing items § 100-19D(1)
through (12) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond the 1/2 acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
B. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon determination that:
(1) The proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure's continued designation as an historic structure; and
(2) The variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic
character and design of the structure.
C. Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and
substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the
conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that:
(1) The criteria of Subsections A, D, E and F of this section are met;
and
(2) The structure or other development is protected by methods that
minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no
additional threat to public safety.
D. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
E. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is
the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.

reasonable return, regardless of whether that return represents the most

where the failure to permit demolition would unreasonably interfere
with the applicant's charitable purpose;

landmark which does not involve a change in design, material or
outward appearance.
B. No owner or person with an interest in real property designated as a
landmark shall permit the property to fall into a serious state of
disrepair so as to result in the deterioration of any exterior

occurred and the expense so assessed shall constitute a lien and charge
on the real property on which it is levied until paid or otherwise
satisfied or discharged and shall be collected in the same manner and at
the same time as other town charges. Within 30 days of the date of such
notice or such lesser period of time as may be set forth in such notice if
the Director of Public Works determines that an emergency exits, the
affected property owner shall either:

Advertising in any print, electronic media or by sign that any of those
articles or goods referred to in Subsection A of the definition of

years.
A. Upon receipt of an application completed pursuant to this chapter, the
Town Clerk shall refer such application to the Chief of Police or his
designee who shall conduct an investigation of the prospective license
pursuant to this chapter for the purpose of determining the suitability
of the applicant for licensing. Said investigation shall include but shall
not be limited to the following:
(1) The experience of the applicant in the business of purchase and
sale of those articles or goods referred to in Subsection A of the
definition of "secondhand dealer" in § 151-1 herein, although
nothing in this section shall be construed to warrant denial of a
license solely on the basis of a lack of experience.
(2) The reputation of the applicant for fair dealing in the community
which shall be made among credible sources, which sources shall
be disclosed to the applicant in the event of a denial of any license.
(3) Any criminal record of the applicant.
(4) The type of operation contemplated to be conducted by the
applicant, particularly whether the business is to be operated from
a fixed location, whether it is to be conducted from a location
primarily devoted to the purchase and sale of those articles and
goods referred to in Subsection A of the definition of "secondhand
dealer" in § 151-1 herein and other factors bearing upon whether
the licensed business will be of a fixed and permanent nature. This
section, however, shall not be construed to require denial of any
§ 151-2 GATES CODE § 151-3
143:214
license solely on the grounds that the business is not conducted
from a fixed location.
B. The Chief of Police or his designee shall complete any investigation
commenced pursuant to this chapter within 30 days of the submission
of the application to the Town Clerk, fully completed by the applicant.

deny the license or to revoke the conditional license, he/she shall notify
the applicant within 10 days of such denial or revocation and forward to
the applicant a statement of the reason(s) for such denial. The applicant
shall have 10 days thereafter to request consideration by the Clerk and
may provide the Clerk with any relevant information and response as
set forth in the Clerk's notice of denial.
D. Grounds for recommending denial of a license may include reliable
information indicating that the applicant has in the past engaged in
fraudulent or deceptive business practices in a business identical to or
similar to the business for which the applicant seeks a license pursuant
to this chapter. The license may be denied if the investigation
conducted by the Chief of Police or his designee reveals conviction of
the applicant or any of its principal officers or employees of any crime
or disorderly persons offense in which deceit or misrepresentation is an
element or any conviction of any crime or disorderly persons offense
involving theft or receiving stolen goods, whether such conviction was
as a principal, accessory before or after the fact or coconspirator.
E. The applicant will submit fingerprints and fees to DCJS in the form and
manner prescribed by DCJS. If an applicant has been convicted of a
felony and/or misdemeanor, any decision regarding such prospective

factors contained in New York State Correction Law §§ 701-703-b and
§§ 751-753.
F. Upon receipt of the recommendation of the Chief of Police or his
designee, the Town Clerk shall issue or deny the license accordingly,

pursuant to § 151-7. In the event of a denial of a license by the Clerk,
the applicant shall be entitled to a public hearing before the Town
Board of the Town of Gates, at which time the applicant shall be
permitted to introduce such evidence as may be deemed relevant to
such denial. After a public hearing thereon, at which the licensee shall
have an opportunity to be heard, the Town Board may sustain the
decision of Town Clerk, reverse the decision of Town Clerk and direct

§ 151-4. Identification of seller; required information.

consideration.
G. Additional grounds for recommending denial of a license may be the
revocation of a prior secondhand dealer's license within the last 10
years.
A. All licensees shall keep a record book in which they will enter at the
time of purchase of any item:
(1) A detailed description of the item, including but not limited to
identifying marks of the item, a brief description of the item,
initials, names, dates, social security numbers engraved thereon,
serial numbers, series numbers or any other information appearing
calculated to set apart the particular object purchased from others
of like kind; the name, date of birth and description of the person
from whom the purchase was made, the date the purchase was
made, and the address where such purchase was made for such
item(s).
(2) If the item is purchased by weight, the troy ounce weight of the
item.
(3) The name of the clerk or employee of the licensees making the
transaction, legibly set forth.
(4) The name, permanent business address and license number of the
purchaser-licensee.

proof of photo identification in the form of a drivers license, valid
drivers license, New York State nondrivers identification, military
identification, or other adequate proof of identification. Said
receipt book shall be a record kept in the regular course of
business of the licensee.
(6) The actual price paid for the purchase of said item.
B. The record book shall be open to inspection by any member of the Town
of Gates Police Department or any other law enforcement agency. The
record book shall be securely bound, not less than six inches in either
length or width, legibly written in the English language. No entry in
such book shall be erased, obliterated, altered or defaced. Every
secondhand dealer and his/her employee shall, at the time of making
any purchase, attach a tag or otherwise legible number and date to
each item bought and make corresponding entry to such number in the
aforementioned record book. In the event of an error, a single red line
shall be made through the entry, but not in such a way as to prevent
legibility.

have elapsed after the purchase of the same by such licensee. At certain
times the Chief of Police may specify a list of items that must be held for
longer than 10 days or certain items that may not be purchased at all by
a dealer. It shall be an affirmative defense to any prosecution or
administrative proceeding brought for a violation of this section if
retention for the time period required were to result in a serious and
substantial economic loss to the dealer or the probability of such loss
was significant due to rapid and highly fluctuating market conditions,
provided that the person so charged shall prove the existence of the
market conditions giving rise to the aforesaid defense by a
preponderance of the evidence. Market conditions, in order to be
defense hereunder, must be such that financial analysts would
characterize trading as at or approaching a level or occurrence so as to
clearly distinguish trading conditions from normal variations and
market movement in response to economic news or other events. In the
event that this type of situation occurs, the secondhand dealer will
notify the Gates Police Department by telephone, advising the
department of the disposal. The Gates Police Department will have one
hour to respond to the dealers address to view the property should the
department decide to do so.
B. No licensee under this chapter shall purchase any item covered by this
chapter from any person under the age of 17.
C. The Town Board of the Town of Gates may, after notice and hearing,
revoke the license issued to any licensee convicted of robbery, burglary,
theft, receiving stolen goods or any other crime involving moral
turpitude after the license is granted.
D. The licensee shall have the right to change the location of the licensed
business, provided that he notifies the Town Clerk, in writing, of the
street address of said new location.

approved by the Town Attorney, shall be in the penal sum of $10,000
conditioned for the due and proper observance of and compliance with

be and remain for the benefit of any person who shall obtain a judgment
against obligor as a result of damage sustained in the operation

credit, exchange or refund to the person from whom said items were
originally obtained, provided that the items were not secondhand items
when originally obtained.

the U.S. any refuse, rubbish, yard/lawn waste, garbage, litter, or other
discarded or abandoned objects, articles, and accumulations, so that
the same may cause or contribute to pollution. Wastes deposited in
streets in proper waste receptacles for the purposes of collection are
exempted from this prohibition.
E. Prohibition against failing private sewage disposal systems. No person
shall construct or maintain any cesspool, sewage disposal system, pipe
or drain so as to expose or discharge the sewage contents or other
deleterious liquids or matter therefrom to the atmosphere or on the
ground surface or into any storm sewer or drain or as to endanger any
watercourse or body of water, unless a permit for such discharge shall
have been issued by the Monroe County Department of Public Health or
by the State Department of Health or the State Department of

the Town of Gates may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent
or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the United States or to
minimize danger to persons.
B. Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person
discharging to the MS4 in violation of this article may have his or her
MS4 access suspended or terminated if such action would abate or
reduce an illicit discharge. The Town of Gates will notify a violator of
the proposed suspension or termination of its MS4 access. The violator
may petition the Town of Gates or designee to reconsider the
suspension or termination of MS4 access by requesting a hearing.
C. It shall be unlawful for any person to reinstate MS4 access to premises
suspended or terminated pursuant to this section without the prior
approval of the Town of Gates.

SPDES stormwater discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of
such permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form
acceptable to the Town of Gates prior to discharge or as a condition of a
subdivision map, site plan, building permit, or development or improvement
plan; upon inspection of the facility; during any enforcement proceeding or
action; or for any other reasonable cause.
§ 156-10. Monitoring of discharges.
A. Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that the Town of Gates
must inspect to enforce any provision of this article, or whenever the
Town of Gates has cause to believe that there exists, or potentially
exists, in or upon any premises any condition which constitutes a
violation of this article.
B. Access to facilities.
(1) The Town of Gates shall be permitted to enter and inspect, at any
time, facilities subject to regulation under this article as often as
may be necessary to determine compliance with this article. If a
discharger has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the
discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access
to representatives of the Town of Gates.
(2) Facility operators shall allow the Town of Gates ready access to all
parts of the premises for the purpose of inspection, sampling and
examination of the private storm drainage system. Persons or
facility operators must supply copies, if requested by the Town of
Gates, of all records kept under the conditions of the SPDES
stormwater discharge permit. Persons or facility operators must
also identify the performance of any additional duties as defined by
state and federal law.
(3) The Town of Gates shall have the right to place or position on any
permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of
the Town of Gates to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the
facility's discharge to the storm sewer system.

pollutants by use of best management practices.
sampling of the storm drainage system shall be promptly removed
by the discharger at the written or verbal request of the Town of
Gates and shall not be replaced. All costs associated with clearing
such access restrictions shall be borne by the discharger in full.
(6) Unreasonable delays, as determined by the Town of Gates, in
allowing the Town of Gates access to a facility, which is permitted
under the New York State Department of Environmental
Conservation SPDES program, for the purposes of conducting any
activity authorized or required by the permit, is considered a
violation of said program and of this article.
(7) If the Town of Gates has been refused access to any part of the
premises from which a discharge or conveyance to the storm sewer
system exists, and the Town of Gates is able to demonstrate
probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
article, or that there is a need to further inspect and/or sample the
private stormwater system to verify compliance with this article or
any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health,
safety and welfare of the community, then the Town of Gates may
seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent
jurisdiction.
A. Best management practices. Town of Gates will adopt requirements
identifying best management practices (BMPs) for any activity,
operation or facility which may cause or contribute to pollution or
contamination of stormwater, the storm drain system or waters of the
United States. The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial
establishment shall provide, at his or her own expense, reasonable
protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other
wastes into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses through
the use of structural and nonstructural BMPs. Further, any person
responsible for a property or premises which is or may be the source of
an illicit discharge may be required to implement, at said person's
expense, additional structural and nonstructural BMPs to prevent the
further discharge of pollutants to the municipal storm drainage system.
Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid SPDES permit
authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial
activity, to the maximum extent practicable, shall be deemed compliant
with the provisions of this section. Appropriately designed structural/
nonstructural BMPs shall be included as part of a stormwater pollution
prevention plan (SWPPP) as necessary for compliance with
requirements of the SPDES permit.
B. Private sewage disposal systems. Where private sewage disposal
systems are contributing to the Town of Gates being subject to the

ARTICLE I
Construction Site Stormwater Pollution Prevention and Sediment
Control
[Adopted 1-7-2008 by L.L. No. 1-2008]
§ 157-1. Introduction; purpose.
A. Land disturbance activities and associated increases in impervious
cover alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase
stormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding, stream channel erosion,
and sediment transport and deposition. This stormwater runoff
contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants.
Stormwater runoff, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be
controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff
from development sites.
B. During the construction process, soil is the most vulnerable to erosion
by wind and water. This eroded soil endangers water resources by
reducing water quality, and causing the siltation of aquatic habitat for
fish and other desirable species. Eroded soil also necessitates
maintenance and/or repair of sewers and ditches, and the dredging of
waterways. In addition, clearing and/or grading during construction
tends to increase soil erosion and causes the loss of native vegetation
necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat, and to provide a healthy
living environment for citizens of the Town of Gates. Improper design
and construction of stormwater management practices can increase the
velocity of stormwater runoff, thereby increasing streambank erosion
and sedimentation. Impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate
into the soil, thereby decreasing groundwater recharge and stream
base flow. Regulation of land disturbance activities by means of
performance standards governing stormwater management and site
design will produce development compatible with the natural functions
of a particular site or an entire watershed and thereby mitigate the
adverse effects of erosion and sedimentation from development.
C. As a result, the purpose of this article is to safeguard public health,
protect property, prevent damage to the environment and promote the
public welfare by guiding, regulating, and controlling the design,
construction, use, and maintenance of any development or other
activity which disturbs or breaks the topsoil or results in the movement
of earth on land in the Town of Gates. It seeks to meet those purposes
by achieving the following objectives:
(1) Meet the requirements of minimum measures 4 and 5 of the SPDES
General Permit for Stormwater Discharges from Municipal
Separate Stormwater Sewer Systems (MS4s), Permit No. GP-02-02
or as amended or revised;
(2) Require land disturbance activities to conform to the substantive
requirements of the NYS Department of Environmental
Conservation State Pollutant Discharge Elimination System

(1) The applicant shall employ a responsible individual, as defined in
§ 157-2 of this article, who will oversee the implementation of the
SWPPP on a daily basis. The responsible individual shall be on site
at all times when construction or grading activity takes place and
shall inspect and document the effectiveness of all erosion and
sediment control practices. The applicant shall also employ the
services of a qualified professional in erosion and sediment control
who will inspect and document the effectiveness of all erosion and
sediment control practices. The documentation will be kept in a site
logbook. Inspection reports will be completed every seven days and
within 24 hours of any storm event producing 0.5 inch of
precipitation or more. A monthly summary of reports will be copied
to the site logbook and delivered to Town of Gates within five days
after the month's end.
(2) The requirement to employ a qualified professional to inspect and
document the effectiveness of all erosion and sediment control
practices is not applicable to land disturbance activities five acres
or less occurring on a single-family residence which is not part of a

ARTICLE II
Postconstruction Stormwater Pollution Prevention
[Adopted 1-7-2008 by L.L. No. 2-2008]
§ 157-14. Introduction; purpose.
§ 157-15. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITY  The activity of an active farm, including
grazing and watering livestock, irrigating crops, harvesting crops, using
land for growing agricultural products, and cutting timber for sale, but
shall not include the operation of a dude ranch or similar operation, or the
construction of new structures associated with agricultural activities.
APPLICANT  A property owner or agent of a property owner who has filed
an application for a stormwater management permit.
CHANNEL  A natural or artificial watercourse with a definite bed and
banks that conducts continuously or periodically flowing water.
A. Land development projects and associated increases in impervious
cover alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase
stormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding, stream channel erosion,
and sediment transport and deposition. This stormwater runoff
contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants.
Stormwater runoff, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be
controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff
from development sites.
B. The purpose of this article is to establish minimum stormwater
management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the
general health, safety, and welfare of the public residing in the
watersheds within the Town of Gates. Therefore, the Town of Gates
establishes this set of water quality and quantity policies to provide
reasonable guidance for the regulation of stormwater runoff and to, in
addition to the above, safeguard persons, protect property, prevent
damage to the environment in Town, and comply with the NYSDEC
State Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (SPDES) General Permit
for Stormwater Discharges from Municipal Separate Storm Sewer
Systems (MS4s), for the purpose of protecting local water resources
from degradation. It is determined that the regulation of stormwater
runoff discharges from land development projects and other
construction activities in order to control and minimize increases in
stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion, stream channel
erosion, and nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater
runoff is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health
and safety.
§ 157-14 SOLID WASTE § 157-15
155:279
DEDICATION  The deliberate appropriation of property by its owner for
general public use.
DESIGNATED AGENT  Individual(s) directed by the Town of Gates to
conduct site inspections and/or perform other municipal duties.
EROSION CONTROL  Measures that minimize erosion.
FEE IN LIEU  A payment of money in place of meeting all or part of the
stormwater performance standards required by this article.
HOTSPOT  An area where land use or activities generate highly
contaminated runoff, with concentrations of pollutants in excess of those
typically found in stormwater.
IMPERVIOUS COVER  Those surfaces that cannot effectively infiltrate
rainfall (e.g., building rooftops, pavement, sidewalks, driveways, etc).
INFILTRATION  The process of percolating stormwater into the subsoil.
JURISDICTIONAL WETLAND  An area that is inundated or saturated by
surface water or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to
support a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil
conditions, commonly known as "hydrophytic vegetation."
LAND DISTURBANCE ACTIVITY  Construction activity, including

§ 157-20. Waivers and mitigation requirements.
A. No person(s) shall receive any of the building, grading or other land
disturbance approvals or permits required for land disturbance
activities without first meeting the requirements of this article to the
satisfaction of the Town of Gates.
B. Unless specifically excluded by this article, any landowner or operator
desiring approval or a permit for a land disturbance activity shall
comply with all applicable provisions of this article and shall submit all
required plans, documentation and information as required under this
article to the Town of Gates for review and approval.
C. Unless otherwise accepted by this article, the following items shall be
submitted prior to the issuance of a permit or site plan approval.
(1) Stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) (see § 157-23).
(2) Maintenance easement(s) (see § 157-24).
(3) Maintenance agreement(s) (see § 157-24).
(4) Any applicable fees (see § 157-29).
D. The SWPPP shall be prepared to meet the requirements of §§ 157-22
through 157-24 of this article. The maintenance agreement shall be
prepared to meet the requirements of § 157-24 of this article, and
applicable fees shall be those as set forth in § 157-29 of this article.
E. The SWPPP and all other documents required by this article must be
reviewed by the Town of Gates to ensure that established water quality
standards will be maintained after development of the site and that
postconstruction runoff levels are consistent with any local and regional
watershed plans. Information shall be submitted as a single, logical
package, with all information bound together.
F. Where a site plan approval is required, the review and approval of the
SWPPP shall be conducted as part of the site plan approval process by
the Planning Board. Where no site plan is required, the review and
approval of the SWPPP shall be conducted as part of the building permit
approval process by the Building Inspector.
A. The waivers and mitigation requirements outlined below are subject to
the approval of the Town of Gates and are only applicable to land
disturbance activities that disturb less than one acre of land and do not
directly discharge to a 303(d) water body or are located in a total
maximum daily load (TMDL) watershed.
B. All person(s) shall comply with the requirements of this article, unless a
written request is filed to waive the requirements in part or whole for
land disturbance activities that disturb less than one acre of land.
§ 157-19 GATES CODE § 157-20
155:284
Requests to waive any requirements of this article shall be submitted to
the Town of Gates for approval.
C. The minimum requirements for stormwater management may be
waived in whole or in part upon written request of the applicant,
provided that at least one of the following conditions applies:
(1) It can be demonstrated that the proposed development is not likely
to impair attainment of the objectives of this article.
(2) Alternative minimum requirements for on-site management of
stormwater discharges have been established in a stormwater
pollution prevention plan that has been approved by the Town of
Gates and the implementation of the plan is required by local law.
These practices are encouraged in order to minimize the reliance
on structural practices. Credit in the form of reductions in the
amount of stormwater that must be managed can be earned
through the use of nonstructural practices that reduce the
generation of stormwater from the site. These nonstructural
practices are explained in detail in the manual, Better Site Design:
A Handbook for Changing Development Rules in Your Community.
Applicants wishing to obtain credit for use of nonstructural
practices must ensure that these practices are documented and
remain unaltered by subsequent property owners.
(3) Provisions are made to manage stormwater by an off-site facility.
The off-site facility is required to be in place, to be designed and
adequately sized to provide a level of stormwater control that is
equal to or greater than that which would be afforded by on-site
practices and there is a legally obligated entity responsible for
long-term operation and maintenance of the stormwater practice.
(4) The Town of Gates finds that meeting the minimum on-site
management requirements is not feasible due to the natural or
existing physical characteristics of a site.
(5) Nonstructural practices will be used on the site that reduce:
(a) The generation of stormwater from the site;
(b) The size and cost of stormwater storage; and
(c) The pollutants generated at the site.
D. In instances where one of the conditions above applies, the Town of
Gates may grant a waiver from strict compliance with these stormwater
management provisions, as long as acceptable mitigation measures are
provided. However, to be eligible for a variance, the applicant must
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Town of Gates that the variance
will not result in the following impacts to downstream waterways:
(1) Deterioration of existing culverts, bridges, dams, and other
structures;
§ 157-20 SOLID WASTE § 157-20
155:285
§ 157-21. Fee in lieu of; dedication or easement of land.
The fee in lieu of and dedication or easement of land outlined below are
subject to the approval of the Town of Gates and are only applicable to land
disturbance activities that disturb less than one acre of land and do not
directly discharge to a 303(d) water body or are located in a total maximum
daily load (TMDL) watershed.
(2) Degradation of biological functions or habitat;
(3) Accelerated streambank or streambed erosion or siltation;
(4) Increased threat of flood damage to public health, life, property.
E. Furthermore, where compliance with minimum requirements for
stormwater management is waived, the applicant will satisfy the
minimum requirements by meeting one of the mitigation measures
selected by the Town of Gates. Mitigation measures may include, but
are not limited to, the following:
(1) The purchase and donation of privately owned lands, or the grant of
an easement to be dedicated for preservation and/or reforestation
(Dedication or easement of land, see § 157-21B below). These lands
should be located adjacent to the stream corridor in order to
provide permanent buffer areas to protect water quality and
aquatic habitat;
(2) The creation of a stormwater management facility or other
drainage improvements on previously developed properties, public
or private, that currently lack stormwater management facilities
designed and constructed in accordance with the purposes and
standards of this article;
(3) Monetary contributions (Fee in lieu of, see § 157-21A below) to a
dedicated fund for stormwater management activities.
F. No waivers or mitigation plans will be considered for land disturbance
activity that disturbs one acre or greater of land.
A. Fee in lieu of. Where the Town of Gates waives all or part of the
minimum stormwater management requirements, or where the waiver
is based on the provision of adequate stormwater facilities provided
downstream of the proposed development, the applicant shall be
required to pay a fee in an amount as determined by the Town. All
monetary contributions shall be made to a dedicated fund for
stormwater management activities. The fee structure shall be based on
the cubic feet of storage required for stormwater management of the
development in question. All of the monetary contributions shall be
made by the applicant prior to the issuance of any permit or approval
for the development.
§ 157-20 GATES CODE § 157-21
155:286
§ 157-22. General design and performance criteria for stormwater
management.
B. Dedication or easement of land. In lieu of a monetary contribution, an
applicant may obtain a waiver of the required stormwater management
by entering into an agreement with the Town of Gates for the granting
of an easement or the dedication of land by the applicant, to be used for
the construction of an off-site stormwater management facility. The
agreement shall be entered into by the applicant and the Town of Gates
prior to the recording of plats or, if no record plat is required, prior to
the issuance of the permit.
A. The applicant shall consult the Town of Gates design, criteria, the New
York State Stormwater Management Design Manual and the New York
Standards and Specifications for Erosion and Sediment Control for
standards and specifications related to stormwater management design
criteria. Stormwater management practices that are designed and
constructed in accordance with these technical documents shall be
presumed to meet the standards imposed by this article. If there is a
conflict between any of the standards, the more stringent standard shall
apply. Where stormwater management practices are not in accordance
with technical standards, the applicant or developer must demonstrate
equivalence to the technical standards set forth in this section and
§ 157-23 of this article and the SWPPP shall be prepared by a licensed/
certified professional.
B. The following design and performance criteria shall be addressed for
stormwater management at all sites:
(1) All site designs shall establish stormwater management practices
to control the peak flow rates of stormwater discharge associated
with specified design storms and reduce the generation of
stormwater. These practices should seek to utilize pervious areas
for stormwater treatment and to infiltrate stormwater runoff from
driveways, sidewalks, rooftops, parking lots, and landscaped areas
to the maximum extent practicable to provide treatment for both
water quality and quantity.
(2) All stormwater runoff generated from new development shall not
discharge untreated stormwater directly into a jurisdictional
wetland or local water body without adequate treatment. Where
such discharges are proposed, the impact of the proposal on
wetland functional values shall be assessed using a method
acceptable to the Town of Gates. In no case shall the impact on
functional values be any greater than that allowed by the Army
Corp of Engineers (C.O.E) or the NYSDEC responsible for natural
resources.
(3) An attempt shall be made to maintain annual groundwater
recharge rates, by promoting infiltration through the use of
structural and nonstructural methods. At a minimum, an attempt
§ 157-21 SOLID WASTE § 157-22
155:287
§ 157-23. Stormwater pollution prevention plan requirements.
shall be made for annual recharge from the postdevelopment site
to mimic the annual recharge from predevelopment site conditions.
(4) In order to protect stream channels from degradation, a specific
channel protection criteria shall be provided as prescribed in the
Town of Gates design criteria and/or the New York State
Stormwater Management Design Manual.
(5) Stormwater discharges to critical areas with sensitive resources
may be subject to additional performance criteria, or may need to
utilize or restrict certain stormwater management practices.
(6) Stormwater discharges from land uses or activities with higher
potential pollutant loadings, known as "hotspots," may require the
use of specific structural stormwater treatment practices and
pollution prevention practices.
(7) Prior to design, applicants are required to consult with the Town of
Gates to determine if they are subject to additional stormwater
design requirements.
(8) The calculations for determining peak flows (WQv) as found in the
New York State Stormwater Management Design Manual shall be
used for sizing all stormwater management practices.
A. A SWPPP is required as part of the compliance with this article. This
plan must be prepared by a qualified professional and must indicate
whether stormwater will be managed on site or off site and, if on site,
the general location and type of practices and shall also include
sufficient information (e.g., maps, hydrologic calculations, etc.) to
evaluate the environmental characteristics of the project site, the
potential impacts of all proposed development of the site, both present
and future, on the water resources, and the effectiveness and
acceptability of the measures proposed for managing stormwater
generated at the project site. The plan must be signed by a New York
State licensed professional engineer (PE), who will verify that the
design of all stormwater management practices meet the submittal
requirements outlined in the New York State Stormwater Management
Design Manual. No building or grading permit or site plan approval
shall be issued until a satisfactory stormwater pollution prevention
plan, or a waiver thereof, has undergone a review and been approved
by the Town of Gates after determining that the plan or waiver is
consistent with the requirements of this article.
B. The applicant shall employ a responsible individual, as defined in
§ 157-15 of this article, who will oversee the implementation of the
SWPPP on a daily basis. The applicant shall also employ the services of
a qualified professional in erosion and sediment control who will
inspect and document the effectiveness of all erosion and sediment

155:288
control practices. The documentation will be kept in a site logbook.
Inspection reports will be completed every seven days and within 24
hours of any storm event producing 0.5 inch of precipitation or more.
A monthly summary of reports will be copied to the site logbook and
delivered to Town of Gates within five business days after the month's
end. The Town, at its discretion, may require submission of the weekly
inspection reports. If requested, they shall be submitted within three
business days after the competition of the inspection.

§ 179-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known as the "Junked and Abandoned Motor Vehicle
Ordinance of the Town of Gates."
§ 179-2. Purpose.
The storage of junk motor vehicles and the abandonment of motor vehicles
on privately owned property within the Town of Gates is a threat to the
health, safety and general welfare of the community. Junked and abandoned
vehicles are a safety hazard to members of the community and especially
younger children. These vehicles oftentimes are replete with broken glass,
gasoline fumes and gasoline still existing in tanks, and harmful acids which
can cause injury. Such vehicles are unsightly and depreciate the property on
which they are located as well as the property in the community in general.
They destroy the aesthetic quality of the town as a whole and constitute the
town a less safe and pleasant place in which to live and do business. The
control of the storage of junked motor vehicles outdoors on privately owned
property as well as abandoned vehicles on privately owned property is
therefore a necessity for the preservation for the health, safety and welfare
of the community. The intent of this chapter is to establish procedures for
the control and the removal of junked and abandoned motor vehicles found
in the town in violation of this chapter.
§ 179-3. Definitions.

Access
§ 190-56. Access control in nonresidential districts.
In order to prevent adverse effects from strip road front development,
to produce more harmonious appearance and to promote public safety
by reducing, to a reasonable number, access points to and from public
highways, all development must take place in areas which have a minimum
frontage on state and county roads of 400 feet and a minimum size of
four acres. Ownership need not be by one owner but adjacent owners may
apply jointly if their aggregate holdings meet these requirements and agree
to a coordinated development plan. Individual lots may be used within
a development area. Adjacent property owners within these districts will
be required to give mutual easements for vehicular traffic across their
properties to permit vehicles to get to limited points of access to and from
public highways. No access point serving these areas shall be closer than
100 feet to an intersection. Deceleration and/or acceleration lanes may be
required as deemed necessary by appropriate county or state officials to
permit proper traffic flow into and out of the access point. Proof that these
regulations are being or will be met shall be provided before building or
occupancy permits can be issued.

date of the permit and each year thereafter, but prior to annual site approval
inspection.
§ 190-62. Dimensional and safeguard requirements.
A. Permits for excavation within the geographical area outlined in the
permit application shall be issued for a three-year period, subject to
annual site inspection and approval by the Town Engineer and any
other agency(s) that the Town designates.
B. The active excavation area shall not exceed a total of five acres at any
one time.
C. No excavation shall be conducted closer than 100 feet to a public rightof-
way or adjoining property line, except that grading may be
conducted within such limits in order to provide adequate access to the
premises. The setback area shall not be used for any use in conjunction
with the excavations and appurtenant activities, except for one public
notice sign for identifying use, buffer effect and those conditions stated
in § 190-62H of this chapter pertaining to topsoil and subsoil
preservation.
D. All equipment, structures and other operation facilities, including
sedimentation ponds, shall not be closer than 200 feet from the right-ofway
of the public highway or from an adjoining property line, except
when the applicant demonstrates that the topography necessitates the
location of a sedimentation pond elsewhere and also demonstrates that
sufficient safeguards will be constructed or provided for the protection
of neighboring residents. Screening from public view will be provided
as required in this chapter and as may be additionally required by the
Town.
E. Each tract of land to be granted a conditional use permit for excavation
must use only direct access to major highways and have proof of legal
rights to that access.

provision applies to all operations except that of topsoil removal.
I. Landscape. Existing hills, trees and ground cover fronting along public
roads or adjacent property shall be preserved, maintained and
supplemented by selective cutting, transplanting and addition of new
trees, shrubs and other ground cover for the purpose of screening and
noise reduction. If, however, the existing topography and natural
vegetation does not lend itself to any economically feasible supplement
plan, the operation can, if properly landscaped with grass, trees and
shrubs, grade back overburden around the perimeter of the excavation
site to create a berm for the purpose of screening and noise reduction.
No berm shall be constructed within 25 feet of property boundaries.
The type and design of screening shall be approved by the Town Board
after referring the proposal to the Monroe County Soil and Water
Conservation District or the Town Conservation Board. Adequate
maintenance approval of the landscape by the Town Engineer shall be
required for all permit renewals.

be dust and mud free. All precautions, such as oiling or watering, daily
or more frequently if and when necessary, shall be taken to prevent dust
and dirt from being blown from the premises. Also, the first 200 feet of
access from public roads shall be paved.
M. Noise. Operations shall not be detrimental to adjacent property nor
unduly interfere with the quiet enjoyment of adjacent property.
N. Drainage system. An adequate and comprehensive drainage system
shall be provided to convey the stormwater runoff originating on and
crossing the premises in accordance with the natural direction of runoff
for the total watershed area. No excavation shall be allowed closer than
50 feet from a natural stream. Sediment control measures musts be
installed to keep all sediment damage on the applicant's property. The
Town Engineer shall determine whether or not the system and control
measures are adequate before approval of an original or renewal
permit.
O. Flood and erosion control. The applicant shall include a plan for control
of soil erosion and excessive groundwater seepage to public roads,
streams or adjacent property. The Town Engineer shall determine
§ 190-62 VEHICLES, JUNKED AND ABANDONED § 190-62
179:391
§ 190-63. Restoration and revegetation requirements.
whether or not the controls are adequate before approval of an original
or renewal permit.
A. Slope. No slope shall be left with a grade steeper than one foot on three
feet; provided, however, that for quarry operations, the Town Engineer
shall certify the face of the quarry wall as safe and acceptable and may
require any means necessary to reinforce unsafe faces.
B. All debris, stumps, boulders, etc., shall be removed from the site and
disposed of or, in case of inorganic material, buried and covered with a
minimum of two feet of soil.
C. Timing. Restoration shall be a continuous operation subject to field
review and approval at each annual inspection and at the end of the
permit period, by the Town Engineer and anyone else designated by the
Town Board. Grading of topsoil or cover material and planting of the
area designated for restoration during the permit period shall have
been completed before a permit renewal can be granted. Plans for
reuse of a quarry which do not call for restoration shall be reviewed and
approved by the Planning Board and the Town Engineer.
D. Topsoil and fertilizing. Subsoil and topsoil shall be respread over the
excavation area to a minimum depth of one foot (six inches of topsoil
and six inches of subsoil). This soil shall be treated with lime and
fertilizer and seeded with a grass or legume mixture prescribed by the
Town Engineer after conferring with the Monroe County Soil and Water
Conservation District. Trees or shrubs shall be planted in order to
provide screening, natural beauty and to reduce erosion. The planted
area shall be protected from erosion during the establishment period
using approved conservation practices.
E. During and upon completion of the excavation operation (within six
months after completion of the excavation operation) the land shall be
left so that natural drainage leaves the property at the original drainage
points. Also, the volume of drainage to any one point shall not be
increased.
F. Within six months after termination of the excavation operation, all
equipment, building, structures, etc., shall be removed from the
premises and all restoration will have been completed.

ARTICLE XX
MR Multiple Residence District
§ 190-99. Purpose.
It is the intent to permit, where appropriate, the construction and
development of multiple-family residences in the Town. At the same time,
the Town does not desire the large-scale development of these units to the
extent that large areas of the Town become so devoted to such use that
single-family residences would appear out of place. Accordingly, areas shall

a homeowners' association, trust or other appropriate arrangement for the
maintenance and conservation of the streets, parking areas, sidewalks,
common areas, open space and facilities.
§ 190-109. Location.
Townhouse clusters and developments shall be limited to and permitted in
those areas which are now or may hereafter be zoned by the Town Board

AOD Airport Overlay District
§ 190-167. Purpose.
The purposes of these regulations are to promote safe and efficient flight
operations connected with the Rochester-Monroe County Airport by limiting
the heights of structures and objects of natural growth in areas necessary
for airport operations, in accordance with Federal Aviation Agency
standards for planes using the airport, and to protect the lives and property
of the occupants of land in the vicinity of the airport by regulating the use
of property within specified areas adjacent to and extending outward from
the boundary of the airport, in the Town of Gates.
§ 190-168. Delineation of districts.
§ 190-169. Regulations.
A. There are hereby established Airport Overlay Districts a(AOD-a),
b(AOD-b) and c(AOD-c) to accomplish the purposes described above.
These districts are delineated more specifically on the Zoning Map
which is a part of this chapter.29 These districts provide for
unobstructed air spaces for general use, instrument approach areas
and noninstrument approach areas, as well as additional regulations
that apply to areas already covered elsewhere in this chapter.
B. Where these districts overlay any primary zoning district delineated on
the Official Zoning Map of the Town of Gates, the requirements of these
districts shall be met in addition to those requirements specified for
development in the respective primary district; provided, however, that
where the requirements specified in any or all of these districts are
more restrictive or require review before development can take place,
then the requirements specified in this article shall supersede those
requirements and administrative review procedures required for
development in the primary zoning district.
A. Airport Overlay District a(AOD-a). No permit for any land use shall be
issued and no map subdividing such lands into lots for residential,
business or industrial purposes in such areas shall be accepted for filing
by the Monroe County Clerk unless it shall have been approved by the
Monroe County Director of Planning and shall have such approval
endorsed thereon. The Building Inspector shall refer all building
permits, occupancy permits and all other types of permits for land use
and/or land subdivision to the Planning Director for his review. The
following requirements shall be met before any building permit can be
issued by the Building Inspector.
29.Editor's Note: The Zoning Map and amendments thereto are on file in the office of the
Town Clerk.
§ 190-167 VEHICLES, JUNKED AND ABANDONED § 190-169
179:433
§ 190-170. Review procedures.
B. Airport Overlay District b(AOD-b). The Building Inspector shall refer
every application for a building, structure, wire, tower, smokestack,
pole, overhead transmission line, fence, derrick or any other object
constructed or installed by man, regardless of height, to the Director of
Public Works of Monroe County. Additionally, any tree or any other
object of natural growth in this district should be reviewed by the
Director of Public Works.
C. Airport Overlay District c(AOD-c). The Building Inspector shall refer
every application for items listed in Subsection B above, including those
of natural growth, which exceed 40 feet in height above ground level of
the particular site, to the Director of Public Works.
D. The Building Inspector shall refer every application for items listed in
Subsection B above, including those of natural growth, to the Director
of Public Works where the specific object is outside any of the overlay
districts listed above and exceeds 75 feet in height above ground level
where it is to be located.
E. Potential hazards.
(1) The Building Inspector shall refer to the Director of Public Works
every application for a building permit or certificate of occupancy
for a structure or use of land which has the potential of creating
any condition listed below: [Amended 9-7-1999 by L.L. No.
2-1999]
(a) Interference with radio communications or signaling between
the airport and aircraft.
(b) Impairment of visibility in the vicinity of the airport.
(c) Placement of lights in a location or manner that may make it
difficult for fliers to distinguish such lights and airport lights.
(d) Production of glare in the eyes of fliers using the airport.
(e) Any other interference that might tend to endanger the
landing, taking-off or maneuvering of aircraft.
(2) Such referral shall pertain to any use or structure in the Town

Building Inspector should contact the Director of Public Works of
Monroe County if he is unsure as to whether to submit a particular
permit request.
A. Procedures for § 190-169A. The Director of Planning shall review and
approve, modify or disapprove plans submitted for subdivision
development or land use relating to the efficient and safe operation of
the Rochester-Monroe County Airport. No permit shall be issued, no
subdivision granted and no structure constructed until the Town has
§ 190-169 GATES CODE § 190-170
179:434
received the written report of the Planning Director stating his approval
or modification. When the plan is approved or modified by the Planning
Director, the Building Inspector may then issue the appropriate permits
in conformance with the requirements of the primary zoning district in
which the permit is for, in addition to the conditions that may have been
stipulated by the Director of Planning. No permit may be issued when
the request has been disapproved by the Planning Director.
B. Procedures for § 190-169B, C, D and E.
(1) The Director of Public Works of Monroe County, or his authorized
designee, shall review the location and height of the proposed
structure above ground level or, alternatively, examine the
proposed use to determine if it would, in either case, result in one
or more hazards to aircraft operations. In the event that in neither
case would there be a hazard to aircraft operations, the Director or
his designee shall notify the Building Inspector that the permit
need only meet requirements of the local code or ordinance. In the
event that it is found that either the height of the structure or the
use would present a hazard to aircraft operations, the Director
shall determine to what extent the hazards exist and what
modifications should be made to eliminate or satisfactorily reduce
the hazard. The results of the investigation, which may take into
account existing structural heights and uses in the immediate
vicinity of the permit in question, shall be transmitted to the
Building Inspector. Such notification shall state that the application
for building permit, for use or for certificate of occupancy is to be
denied if the request is for a structure or use within one mile of the
boundary of the airport, or the notification shall recommend that
the permit application be denied if it is beyond the one-mile
distance.
(2) The Director or his designee shall have 30 days from the date of
receipt of the request to render his decision; however, where it is
not necessary to conduct a detailed investigation, the Director or
his designee shall attempt to render a decision within 10 days.
However, if no action is taken by the Director of Public Works or his
designee within 30 days, then the application shall be deemed to
have been approved.
(3) Building permits and certificates of occupancy shall expire 18
months after issuance, unless provided otherwise in this chapter.
(4) A nonconforming structure, natural object or use of land or
structure existing as of March 12, 1965, may continue in existence
without change; provided, however, that the owner of the
structure, natural object or use may be required to install or may be
required to permit the installation of markers and lights necessary
to indicate the location of the hazard to aircraft operators in the
vicinity of the airport.
§ 190-170 VEHICLES, JUNKED AND ABANDONED § 190-170
179:435
§ 190-171. Appeals procedure.
(a) No structure, use of land or natural object existing as of March
12, 1965, which is nonconforming to the provisions of this
district shall be altered or permitted to grow so as to increase
its height. No existing structure or object of natural growth
which is not nonconforming shall be permitted to be altered or
to grow to a height which would render it nonconforming.
(b) Unless provided for otherwise elsewhere in this chapter,
whenever a structure or use of structure or land which is
nonconforming to the provisions of § 190-169B, C, D and E is
destroyed or torn down to the extent of 80% or more of its
effective utility, any permit for reconstruction, occupancy or
reuse of the site shall be subject to review as stipulated in the
above-mentioned sections.
(5) Unless provided for otherwise elsewhere in this chapter, any
structure or use of land which is nonconforming to the provisions of
§ 190-169B, C, D and E shall be considered to be abandoned when
use has been voluntarily discontinued for a period of 24 months.
When such is the case, as determined by the Building Inspector,
any permit for reuse or occupancy or any building permit shall be
subject to review as stipulated in the above-mentioned sections.
A. For applications listed in § 190-169A:
(1) An appeal from a decision of the Director of Planning shall be made
to the Monroe County Planning Board. The Board may affirm,
modify or overrule such decisions.
(2) The County Planning Board shall establish and make rules,
regulations and the criteria for acting upon appeals.
B. For applications listed in § 190-169B, C, D and E:
(1) Any person aggrieved by a decision of the Director of Public Works
of Monroe County or his designee may appeal to the County of
Monroe.
(2) Variances may be granted where the literal enforcement of these
regulations contained in this provision would result in practical
difficulty or unnecessary hardship to the applicant, provided that it
is found that relief from these provisions would not be contrary to
the public interest and public safety and would conform to the
spirit of this district. When determining whether a variance should
be granted, prior existing structures and uses of land or structures
which are nonconforming to the provisions of this district may be
taken into consideration, when in the immediate vicinity of the site
or use in question, in order to determine if the granting of the
variance would result in a material increase of the airport hazard.
§ 190-170 GATES CODE § 190-171
179:436
§ 190-172. Additional requirements.
Where an application has been approved by the Director of Planning or has
been approved upon appeal to the County Planning Board, the request shall
thereafter be reviewed by the Director of Public Works of Monroe County
or his designee to determine compliance with § 190-169B, C, D and E and
the subsequent provisions that relate to implementation of these respective
sections.
When granting a variance the applicant may be required to meet
any conditions necessary to protect the public health and safety.
(3) Penalties for violations of § 190-169B, C, D and E and the
subsequent sections of this district that implement these sections
shall be the same as those required for the remainder of this
chapter; provided, however, that a penalty of $500 shall be
recovered by Monroe County in a civil action at the request of the
Director of Public Works, whether in an action for a penalty or in
action in equity for injunctive relief.

Conditional Use Permit Review Procedures
§ 190-195. Purpose.
The purpose of conditional use approval is to allow the proper integration
of uses into the community and zoning districts, plans and elevations
necessary to show the proposed development, any requirements listed in
§ 190-196, as determined necessary by the review board, and other
drawings or information necessary for an understanding of the proposed
use and its relationship to surrounding properties and a filing fee as
required in the Town's fee schedule, established by Town Board resolution,
no part of which is returnable.
§ 190-196. Authorization to grant or deny.
The conditional uses listed in this chapter may be permitted upon
authorization of the appropriate board authorized to do so by Town Board
resolution or, alternatively, the Town Board, in accordance with the
standards and procedures set forth in this article. In permitting a
conditional use or the modification of a conditional use, the appropriate
board may impose, in addition to those standards and requirements
expressly specified by this chapter, any additional conditions which the
Board considers necessary to protect the best interests of the surrounding
property, the neighborhood or the Town as a whole. These conditions may
include but are not limited to increasing the required lot size or yard
dimensions; limiting the height of buildings; controlling the location and
number of vehicle access points; increasing the street width; increasing
the number of off-street parking and loading spaces required; limiting the
number, size and location of signs; and requiring diking, fencing, screening,
landscaping or other facilities to protect adjacent or nearby property. In the
case of a use existing prior to the effective date of this chapter and classified
in this chapter as a conditional use, any change in use or in lot area or
an alteration of structure shall conform with the requirements dealing with
conditional uses.
§ 190-197. Application.
A property owner(s) or his agent(s) may initiate a request for a conditional
use by filing an application with the authorized official, using forms
provided by the Town for such requests. Such application shall be
accompanied by a legal description of the property, a map showing the
property and all properties within a radius of 500 feet of the exterior
boundaries thereof, plans and elevations necessary to show the proposed
development, any requirements listed in § 190-196, as determined
necessary by the review board, and other drawings or information
necessary for an understanding of the proposed use and its relationship
to surrounding properties and a filing fee as required in the Town's fee
schedule, established by Town Board resolution, no part of which is
returnable.
§ 190-195 VEHICLES, JUNKED AND ABANDONED § 190-198

§ 190-198. Governing standards.
A conditional use shall comply with the standards of the zone in which it
is located, except as these standards have been modified in authorizing the
conditional use or as otherwise modified when consideration is given the
following:
§ 190-199. Public hearing.
Before a conditional use is permitted, the proposed conditional use shall
be considered by the appropriate board at a public hearing. Notice of said
hearing shall be given as provided in § 190-176.
§ 190-200. Notification of action.
The appropriate board shall, in writing, notify the applicant for a conditional
use of the Board's action, within five days after the decision has been
rendered.
A. In order to grant any conditional use, the appropriate board shall find
that the request is:
(1) In harmony with the general purpose and intent of this chapter and
of other respective zoning districts in which it is proposed.
(2) Would not be detrimental in any way to any uses permitted in the
respective zone or adjacent zones, taking into account the location
and size of use, the nature and intensity of the operations involved
in connection with it and the size of the site in respect to streets
giving access thereto.
B. In order to grant any conditional use, the appropriate board shall find
that the establishment, maintenance or operation of the use applied for
will not, under the circumstances of the particular case, be detrimental
to the health, safety or general welfare of persons residing or working
in the neighborhood of such proposed use or be detrimental or injurious
to the property and improvements in the neighborhood or to the
general welfare of the Town.
C. A conditional use permit shall become void one year after approval
unless, by conditions of the use permit, greater or lesser time is
specified as a condition of approval or unless, prior to the expiration of
one year, a building permit is issued and substantial construction is
started within two years. The reviewing board may extend the permit
for a period of one year subject to the requirements of this article.
D. The appropriate board, on its own motion, may revoke any conditional
use permit for noncompliance with conditions set forth in the granting
of said permit after first notifying the applicant of the violations and of
the time period for compliance.

[1] All vehicle wash operations shall be so soundproofed, the
entire development shall be so arranged and the
operations shall be so conducted that the noise emanating
therefrom, as measured from any point on adjacent
property, shall be no more audible than the noise

commercial or industrial uses measured at the same point
on said adjacent property; except that in no event shall it
be necessary to reduce the noise from such operations as
measured from any point on the adjacent lot in a
residential and/or business nonretail district to below 65
decibels, or to below 70 decibels, as measured from any
point from adjacent property in a neighborhood and/or
light and general industrial districts.
