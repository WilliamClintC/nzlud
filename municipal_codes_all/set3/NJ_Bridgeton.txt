Statutory Authorization, Findings of Fact, Purpose and Objectives
§ 167-1. Statutory authorization.
The Legislature of the State of New Jersey has in N.J.S.A. 40:48-1, et
seq., delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt
regulations designed to promote public health, safety, and general welfare
of its citizenry. Therefore, the City Council of the City of Bridgeton of

§ 167-2. Findings of fact.
§ 167-3. Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
A. The flood hazard areas of the City of Bridgeton are subject to periodic
inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public
health, safety, and general welfare.
B. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in
areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and
velocities, and when inadequately anchored, causes damage in other
areas. Uses that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise
protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss.
A. Protect human life and health;
B. Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
C. Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding
and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
D. Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
E. Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas
mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets, bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
F. Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the second use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future

Definitions
§ 167-5. Terms defined.
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter
shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common
usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.
AH ZONE  Areas subject to inundation by one-percent-annual-chance
shallow flooding (usually areas of ponding) where average depths are
between one feet and three feet. Base Flood Elevations (BFEs) derived from
detailed hydraulic analyses are shown in this zone.
AO ZONE  Areas subject to inundation by one-percent-annual-chance
shallow flooding (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average
depths are between one feet and three feet.
APPEAL  A request for a review of the Construction Code Official's
interpretation of any provision of this chapter or a request for a variance.
AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING  A designated AO or AH zone on a
community's Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map (DFIRM) with a 1% annual
or greater chance of flooding to an average depth of one feet to three feet
where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding
is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is
characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD  Land in the floodplain within a
community subject to a 1% or greater chance of flooding in any given year.
It is shown on the FIRM as Zone V, VE, V1-30, A, AO, A1-A30, AE, A99, or
AH.
BASE FLOOD  A flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded
in any given year.
BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE)  The flood elevation shown on a
published Flood Insurance Study (FIS) including the Flood Insurance Rate
Map (FIRM). For zones AE, AH, AO, and A1-30 the elevation represents
the water surface elevation resulting from a flood that has a 1% or greater
chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. For zones VE and
V1-30 the elevation represents the stillwater elevation (SWEL) plus wave
effect (BFE = SWEL + wave effect) resulting from a flood that has a 1% or
greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year.
BASEMENT  Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all sides.

the building and is intended through its design and construction to collapse
under specific lateral loading forces without causing damage to the elevated
portion of the building or supporting foundation system.
COASTAL A ZONE  The portion of the special flood hazard area (SFHA)
starting from a velocity (V) zone and extending up to the landward limit
§ 167-5 FINGERPRINTING SERVICES § 167-5
154:205
of the moderate wave action delineation. Where no V zone is mapped the
Coastal A Zone is the portion between the open coast and the landward limit
of the moderate wave action delineation. Coastal A Zones may be subject to
wave effects, velocity flows, erosion, scour, or a combination of these forces.
Construction and development in Coastal A Zones is to be regulated the
same as V Zones/coastal high hazard areas.
COASTAL HIGH HAZARD AREA  An area of special flood hazard
extending from offshore to the inland limit of a primary frontal dune along
an open coast and any other area subject to high velocity wave action from
storms or seismic sources.

which the Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas
of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the
community.
ELEVATED BUILDING  A non-basement building built, in the case of a
building in an area of special flood hazard, to have the top of the elevated
floor or, in the case of a building in a Coastal A Zone, to have the bottom
of the lowest horizontal structural member of the elevated floor, elevated
above the base flood elevation plus freeboard by means of piling, columns
(posts and piers), or shear walls parallel to the flow of the water, and
adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the
building during a flood up to the magnitude of the base flood. In an area
of special flood hazard "elevated building" also includes a building elevated
by means of fill or solid foundation perimeter walls with openings sufficient
to facilitate the unimpeded movement of floodwaters. In areas of Coastal A
Zones "elevated buildings" also includes a building otherwise meeting the
definition of "elevated building" even though the lower area is enclosed by
means of breakaway walls.
EROSION  The process of the gradual wearing away of land masses.
EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK or SUBDIVISION  A
manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of
facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to
be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the
construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of
concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the floodplain
management regulations adopted by a community.

B. Conditions for variances.
(1) Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of 0.5 acre or less
in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing
structures constructed below the base flood level, providing items
A-K in § 167-15A(4) have been fully considered. As the lot size
increases beyond the 1/2 acre, the technical justification required
for issuing the variance increases.
(2) Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued
designation as an historic structure and the variance is the
minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design
of the structure.
(3) Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would
result.
§ 167-15 BRIDGETON CODE § 167-15
154:216
(4) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard,
to afford relief.
(5) Variances shall only be issued upon:
(a) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
(b) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
(c) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on
or victimization of the public as identified in § 167-15A(4), or
conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
(6) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk
resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.

§ 167-18. Floodways.
Located within areas of special flood hazard established in § 167-7 are areas
designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area
due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles,
and erosion potential, the following provisions apply:
§ 167-19. Coastal A Zone.
Coastal A Zones are located within the areas of special flood hazard
established in § 167-7. These areas may be subject to wave effects, velocity
flows, erosion, scour, or a combination of these forces; therefore, the
following provisions shall apply:
(c) Have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood
damage; and
(d) Be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the top of the
lowest floor is at or above the base flood elevation plus one foot
or as required by ASCE/SEI 24-14, Table 2-1, whichever is

improvements, and other development unless a technical evaluation
demonstrates that encroachment shall not result in any increase in
flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
B. If § 167-18A is satisfied, all new construction and substantial
improvements must comply with Article V, Provisions for Flood Hazard
Reduction.
C. In all areas of special flood hazard in which base flood elevation data
has been provided and no floodway has been designated, the
accumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with
all other existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the
water surface elevation of the base flood more than 0.2 foot at any
point.

lowest floor (excluding the piling or columns) is elevated to or
§ 167-17 BRIDGETON CODE § 167-19
154:222
above the base flood elevation plus one foot or as required by
ASCE/SEI 24-14, Table 4-1, whichever is more restrictive; and
(b) With all space below the lowest floor's supporting member
open so as not to impede the flow of water, except for
breakaway walls as provided or in § 167-19B(4).
(2) Structural support.
(a) All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
securely anchored on piling or columns.
(b) The pile or column foundation and structure attached thereto
shall be anchored to resist flotation, collapse or lateral
movement due to the effects of wind and water loading values
each of which shall have a one-percent chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year (one-hundred-year
mean recurrence interval).
(c) Prohibit the use of fill for structural support of buildings within
Coastal A Zones on the community's FIRM.
(3) Certification. A registered professional engineer or architect shall
develop or review the structural design specifications and plans for
the construction and shall certify that the design and methods of
construction to be used are in accordance with accepted standards
of practice for compliance with the provisions of § 167-19B(1) and
§ 167-19B(2)(a) and § 167-19B(2)(b).
(4) Space below the lowest floor.
(a) Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a
structure started after the enactment of this chapter shall not
enclose the space below the lowest floor unless breakaway
walls, open-wood lattice work or insect screening are used as
provided for in this section.
(b) Breakaway walls, open-wood lattice work or insect screening
shall be allowed below the base flood elevation provided that
they are intended to collapse under wind and water loads
without causing collapse, displacement or other structural
damage to the elevated portion of the building or supporting
foundation system. Breakaway walls shall be designed for a
safe loading resistance of not less than 10 and no more than 20
pounds per square foot. Use of breakaway walls which exceed
a design safe loading of 20 pounds per square foot (either by
design or when so required by local or State codes) may be
permitted only if a registered professional engineer or
architect certifies that the designs proposed meet the following
conditions:
§ 167-19 FINGERPRINTING SERVICES § 167-19
154:223
[1] Breakaway wall collapse shall result from a water load less
than that which would occur during the base flood; and
[2] The elevated portion of the building and supporting
foundation system shall not be subject to collapse,
displacement or other structural damage due to the effects
of wind and water load acting simultaneously on all
building components (structural and nonstructural). Water
loading values used shall be those associated with the base
flood. Wind loading values used shall be those required by
applicable state or local building standards.
(c) If breakaway walls are utilized, such enclosed space shall be
used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage,
and not for human habitation.
(d) Prior to construction, plans for any breakaway wall must be
submitted to the Construction Code Official or Building Sub-
Code Official for approval.
C. Sand dunes. Prohibit man-made alteration of sand dunes within Coastal
A Zones on the community's DFIRM which would increase potential
flood damage.

238:332
§ 265-31.1. Designation and power of public officer to create
Abandoned Property List.
The public officer is hereby directed to identify abandoned properties within
the municipality, place said properties on an Abandoned Property List,
established as provided in Section 36 of P.L. 1996, c. 62 (N.J.S.A. 55:19-55),
as amended, and provide such notices and carry out such other tasks as are
required to effectuate an Abandoned Property List as provided by law.
§ 265-31.2. Abandoned property report.
The public officer shall provide a report to the Mayor, City Administrator
and governing body every six months with respect to the number and
location of properties on the Abandoned Property List, the status of those
properties, and any actions taken by the municipality or by any qualified
rehabilitation entity, designated pursuant to the authority granted the
public officer, with respect to any property on the list or any other
abandoned property within the City of Bridgeton.
§ 265-31.3. Establishment of and updates to Abandoned Property
List.
The public officer shall establish the Abandoned Property List or any
additions thereto by publication in the official newspaper of the City of
Bridgeton, which publication shall constitute public notice and, within 10
days after publication, shall send a notice, by certified mail, return receipt
requested, and by regular mail, to the owner of record of every property
included on the list. The published and mailed notices shall identify
property determined to be abandoned setting forth the owner of record, if
known, the tax lot and block number and street address. The public officer,
in consultation with the Tax Collector, shall also send out a notice by regular
mail to any mortgagee, servicing organization, or property tax processing
organization that receives a duplicate copy of the tax bill pursuant to
Subdivision d of N.J.S.A. 54:4-64. When the owner of record is not known
for a particular property and cannot be ascertained by the exercise of
reasonable diligence by the Tax Collector, notice shall not be mailed but
instead shall be posted on the property in the manner as provided in
Section 5 of P.L. 1942, c. 112 (N.J.S.A. 40:48-2.7). The mailed notice shall

within 30 calendar days after a building becomes vacant property or
within 30 calendar days after assuming ownership of a vacant property,
whichever is later; or within 10 calendar days of receipt of notice by the
municipality, and failure to provide correct information on the
registration statement, failure to comply with the provisions of § 265-28
of this article, or such provisions contained herein, shall be deemed to
be violations of this article.
C. If not paid within six months of notification by the City, the applicable
registration fee shall double.
§ 265-31 PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITY § 265-31.3

indicate the factual basis for the public officer's finding that the property is
abandoned property as that term is defined in Section 35 of P.L. 1996, c. 62
(N.J.S.A. 55:19-54) and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder,
specifying the information relied upon in making such finding. In all cases a
copy of the mailed or posted notice shall also be filed by the public officer
in the office of the Cumberland County Clerk or Register of Deeds and
Mortgages. This filing shall have the same force and effect as a notice of lis
pendens under N.J.S.A. 2A:15-6. The notice shall be indexed by the name of
the property owner as defendant and the name of the City as plaintiff, as
though an action had been commenced by the City against the owner.
§ 265-31.4. Appeals of Abandoned Property List inclusion.
A. An owner or lienholder may challenge the inclusion of his or her
property on the Abandoned Property List by appealing that
determination to the public officer within 30 days of the owner's receipt
of the certified notice or 40 days from the date upon which the notice
was sent. An owner whose identity was not known to the public officer
shall have 40 days from the date upon which notice was published or
posted, whichever is later, to challenge the inclusion of a property on
the Abandoned Property List. For good cause shown, the public officer
shall accept a late filing of an appeal. Within 30 days of receipt of a
request for an appeal of the findings, the public officer shall schedule a
hearing for redetermination of the matter. Any property included on the
list shall be presumed to be abandoned property unless the owner,
through the submission of an affidavit or certification by the property
owner averring that the property is not abandoned and stating the
reasons for such averment, can demonstrate that the property was
erroneously included on the list. The affidavit or certification shall be
accompanied by supporting documentation, such as but not limited to
photographs, repair invoices, bills and construction contracts. The
ground for appeal shall be that the property in question is not
abandoned property as that term is defined in Section 35 of P.L. 1996, c.
62 (N.J.S.A. 55:19-54) or exempted pursuant to this article. The public
officer shall decide any timely filed appeal within 10 days of the hearing
on the appeal and shall promptly, by certified mail, return receipt
requested, and by regular mail, notify the property owner of the
decision and the reasons therefor.
B. The property owner may challenge an adverse determination of an
appeal with the public officer by instituting, in accordance with the
New Jersey Court Rules, a summary proceeding in the Superior Court,
Law Division, sitting in Cumberland County, which action shall be tried
de novo. Such action shall be instituted within 20 days of the date of the
notice of decision mailed by the public officer pursuant to Subsection A
of this section. The sole ground for appeal shall be that the property in
question is not abandoned property as that term is defined in Section 35
of P.L. 1996, c. 62 (N.J.S.A. 55:19-54). The failure to institute an action
of appeal on a timely basis shall constitute a jurisdictional bar to
§ 265-31.3 BRIDGETON CODE § 265-31.4
238:334
§ 265-31.5. Sale of tax lien.
challenging the adverse determination, except that, for good cause
shown, the Court may extend the deadline for instituting the action.
C. The public officer shall promptly remove any property from the
Abandoned Property List that has been determined not to be
abandoned on appeal.
D. The Abandoned Property List shall become effective, and the City of
Bridgeton shall have the right to pursue any legal remedy with respect
to properties on the Abandoned Property List, at such time as any one
property has been placed on the list in accordance with the provisions
of this section, upon the expiration of the period for appeal with respect
to the property or upon the denial of an appeal brought by the property
owner.
A. The City of Bridgeton shall hold special tax lien sales in compliance with
New Jersey Tax Sale Law as described in N.J.S.A. 54:5-1 et seq. and in
compliance with the provisions of the Abandoned Properties
Rehabilitation Act as described within N.J.S.A. 55:19-101 and in
compliance with N.J.S.A. 54:5-86(b).
B. Remediation.
(1) If the City of Bridgeton or the New Jersey Redevelopment Authority
or its subsidiaries acquire the tax sale certificate for a property on
the Abandoned Property List, then, upon 10 days' written notice to
the property owner and any mortgagee as of the date of the filing of
the lis pendens notice under Subdivision d of Section 36 of P.L.
1996, c. 62 (N.J.S.A. 55:19-55), that entity shall be permitted to
enter upon the property and remediate any conditions that caused
the property to be included on the Abandoned Property List. No
remediation shall be commenced, however, if within that ten-day
period the owner or mortgagee shall have notified the City of
Bridgeton or the New Jersey Redevelopment Authority or its
subsidiary, as appropriate, in writing that the owner or mortgagee
has elected to perform the remediation itself. When the owner or
mortgagee elects to perform the remediation itself, it shall be
required to post bond in favor of the City of Bridgeton or the New
Jersey Redevelopment Authority or its subsidiaries, as appropriate,
in order to ensure performance. The amount and conditions of the
bond shall be determined by the public officer.
(2) The cost of remediation incurred by the City of Bridgeton or the
New Jersey Redevelopment Authority or its subsidiaries pursuant
to this subsection, as so certified by the entity incurring the cost
upon completion of the remediation, shall constitute a lien upon the
property first in time and right to any other lien, whether the other
lien was filed prior to or after the filing of any lien by the
municipality or the New Jersey Redevelopment Authority, except
§ 265-31.4 PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITY § 265-31.5
238:335
§ 265-31.6. Removal of property from list; remediation.
for municipal taxes, liens and assessments and any lien imposed
pursuant to the Spill Compensation and Control Act, P.L. 1976,
c. 141 (N.J.S.A. 58:10-23.11 et seq.), together with any interest
thereon. The certification of cost shall be filed and recorded as
a lien by the entity incurring the cost with the County Clerk or
Register of Deeds and Mortgages, as appropriate, in the county in
which the property is located.
C. Property maintained as abandoned property.
(1) Failure of an owner or lienholder to remove a property from the
Abandoned Property List within the period of time for appeal of
inclusion of the property on the list pursuant to Subdivision e of
Section 36 of P.L. 1996, c. 62 (N.J.S.A. 55:19-55) shall be prima
facie evidence of the intent of the owner to continue to maintain the
property as abandoned property.
(2) The clearance, development, redevelopment, or repair of property
being maintained as an abandoned property pursuant to
Subsection C(1) of this section shall be a public purpose and public
use for which the power of eminent domain may be exercised.
A. An owner may remove a property from the list of abandoned properties
prior to sale of the tax sale certificate by paying all taxes and municipal
liens due, including interest and penalties, and:
(1) By posting a certified check, money order, or a bond equal to the
cost of remediating all conditions because of which the property
has been determined to be abandoned pursuant to Section 36 of
P.L. 1996, c. 62 (N.J.S.A. 55:19-55) and posting a certified check,
money order, or a bond to cover the cost of any environmental
cleanup required on the property, evidenced by a certification by a
licensed engineer retained by the owner and reviewed and
approved by the public officer stating that the certified check,
money order, or bond adequately covers the cost of the cleanup; or
(2) By demonstrating to the satisfaction of the public officer that the
conditions rendering the property abandoned have been
remediated in full; provided, however, that where the public officer
finds that the owner is actively engaged in remediating the
conditions because of which the property was determined to be
abandoned pursuant to Section 36 of P.L. 1996, c. 62 (N.J.S.A.
55:19-55), as evidenced by significant rehabilitation activity on the
property, the public officer may grant an extension of time of not
more than 120 days for the owner to complete all work, during
which time no further proceedings will be taken against the owner
or the property.
§ 265-31.5 BRIDGETON CODE § 265-31.6
238:336
§ 265-31.7. Acquisition of tax sale certificate; action to foreclose;
right of redemption.
B. If the owner has posted a certified check, money order, or a bond in
order to have a property removed from the Abandoned Property List
and the conditions because of which the property was determined to be
abandoned have not been fully remediated within one year of the date
of posting a certified check, money order or bond, or, in the case of a
property which requires a remediation of any known, suspected or
threatened release of contaminants, if the owner has failed to enter into
a memorandum of agreement with the Department of Environmental
Protection or an administrative consent order, as the case may be, or if
an agreement or order is in effect but the owner has failed to perform
the remediation in conformance with the agreement or order, then the
cash or bond shall be forfeited to the municipality, which shall use a
certified check, money order, or bond and any interest which has
accrued thereon for the purpose of demolishing or rehabilitating the
property or performing the environmental remediation. Any funds
remaining after the property has been demolished, rehabilitated or
cleaned up shall be returned to the owner.
A. When a person other than the City of Bridgeton or the New Jersey
Redevelopment Authority or its subsidiaries acquires a tax sale
certificate for a property on the Abandoned Property List at tax sale, the
purchaser may institute an action to foreclose the right of redemption
at any time at or after the sale as permitted by law and in compliance
with N.J.S.A. 54:5-86.
B. Notwithstanding Section 6 of P.L. 1948, c. 96 (N.J.S.A. 54:5-104.34),
when the City of Bridgeton is the purchaser at tax sale of any property
on the Abandoned Property List pursuant to N.J.S.A. 54:5-34, or when
the New Jersey Redevelopment Authority or any of its subsidiaries
acquires the tax sale certificate pursuant to Subdivision a of Section 37
of P.L. 1996, c. 62 (N.J.S.A. 55:19-56), an action to foreclose the right of
redemption may be instituted in accordance with the provisions of
Subdivision b of N.J.S.A. 54:5-77.
C. After the foreclosure action is instituted, the right to redeem shall exist
and continue to exist until barred by the judgment of the Superior
Court; provided, however, that no redemption shall be permitted except
where the owner:
(1) Posts a certified check, money order, or a bond equal to the cost of
remediating the conditions because of which the property was
determined to be abandoned pursuant to Section 36 of P.L. 1996, c.
62 (N.J.S.A. 55:19-55), as determined by the Court; or
(2) Demonstrates to the Court that the conditions because of which the
property was determined to be abandoned pursuant to Section 36
of P.L. 1996, c. 62 (N.J.S.A. 55:19-55) have been remedied in full.
§ 265-31.6 PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITY § 265-31.8
238:337
§ 265-31.8. Grounds for reopening judgment.
Once a final judgment barring the right of redemption with respect to
a property on the list of abandoned properties has been recorded, the
grounds of lack of jurisdiction or fraud in the conduct of the action or
any other legal basis for reopening judgment may be utilized; in any such
proceeding, the provisions of P.L. 1996, C. 62 (N.J.S.A. 55:19-20 et seq.)
shall be construed liberally in favor of the purchaser, assignee or transferee
of the tax sale certificate.
§ 265-31.9. Property deemed not abandoned; certification of
abandonment.
§ 265-31.10. Transfer of possession and control of abandoned
property.
A. If an entity other than the City of Bridgeton has purchased or taken
assignment from the City of a tax sale certificate on a property that has
not been legally occupied for a period of six months, that property shall
not be placed on the Abandoned Property List pursuant to Section 36 of
P.L. 1996, c. 62 (N.J.S.A. 55:19-55) if 1) the owner of the certificate has
continued to pay all City of Bridgeton taxes and liens on the property in
the tax year when due; and 2) the owner of the certificate takes action
to initiate foreclosure proceedings within six months after the property
is eligible for foreclosure pursuant to either Subdivision a or
Subdivision b of N.J.S.A. 54:5-86, as appropriate, and diligently pursues
foreclosure proceedings in a timely fashion thereafter.
B. A property which is used on a seasonal basis shall be deemed to be
abandoned only if the property meets any two of the additional criteria
set forth in Section 4 of P.L. 2003, c. 210 (N.J.S.A. 55:19-81).
C. A determination that a property is abandoned property under the
provision of P.L. 2003, c. 210 (N.J.S.A. 55:19-78 et seq.), shall not
constitute a finding that the use of the property has been abandoned for
purposes of municipal zoning or land use regulation.
D. Upon the request of a purchaser or assignee of a tax sale certificate
seeking to bar the right of redemption on an abandoned property
pursuant to Subdivision b of N.J.S.A. 54:5-86, the public officer or the
Tax Collector shall, in a timely fashion, provide the requester with a
certification that the property fulfills the definition of abandoned
according to the criteria set forth in Sections 4 and 5 of P.L. 2003, c. 210
(N.J.S.A. 55:19-81 and N.J.S.A. 55:19-82).
A. A summary action or otherwise to transfer possession and control of
abandoned property in need of rehabilitation to the City of Bridgeton
may be brought by the City of Bridgeton in the Superior Court in
Cumberland County. If the Court shall find that the property is
abandoned pursuant to Section 4 of P.L. 2003, c. 210 (N.J.S.A. 55:19-81)
and the owner or party in interest has failed to submit and initiate a

rehabilitation plan, then the Court may authorize the City of Bridgeton
to take possession and control of the property and develop a
rehabilitation plan.
B. The City of Bridgeton, granted possession and control, may commence
and maintain those further proceedings for the conservation, protection
or disposal of the property or any part thereof that are required to
rehabilitate the property, necessary to recoup the cost and expenses of
rehabilitation and for the sale of the property; provided, however, that
the Court shall not direct the sale of the property if the owner applies to
the Court for reinstatement of control of the property as provided in
Section 15 of P.L. 2001 c. 210 (N.J.S.A. 55:19-92).
C. Failure by the owner, mortgage holder or lienholder to submit plans for
rehabilitation to the City of Bridgeton, obtain appropriate construction
permits for rehabilitation or, in the alternative, submit formal
applications for funding the cost of rehabilitation to local, state or
federal agencies providing such funding within that six-month period
shall be deemed prima facie evidence that the owner has failed to take
any action to further the rehabilitation of the property.
A. A complaint filed pursuant to Section 7 of P.L. 2003, c. 210 (N.J.S.A.
55:19-84) shall include:
(1) Documentation that the property is on the municipal Abandoned
Property List or a certification by the public officer that the
property is abandoned; and
(2) A statement by an individual holding appropriate professional
qualifications that there are sound reasons that the building should
be rehabilitated rather than demolished based upon the physical,
aesthetic or historical character of the building or the relationship
of the building to other buildings and lands within its immediate
vicinity.
A. Within 10 days of filing a complaint pursuant to P.L. 2003, c. 210
(N.J.S.A. 55:19-78 et seq.), the plaintiff shall file a notice of lis pendens
with the County of Cumberland Recording Officer.
B. At least 30 days before filing the complaint, the City of Bridgeton shall
serve a notice of intention to take possession of an abandoned building.
The notice shall inform the owner and interested parties that the
property has not been legally occupied for six months and of those
criteria that led to a determination of abandonment pursuant to Section
4 of P.L. 2003, c. 210 (N.J.S.A. 55:19-81). The notice shall provide that
unless the owner or a party in interest prepares and submits a

238:339
§ 265-31.13. Plan for rehabilitation and reuse.
rehabilitation plan to the appropriate City of Bridgeton official, the City
will seek to gain possession of the building to rehabilitate the property,
and the associated costs shall be a lien against the property, which may
be satisfied by the sale of the property, unless the owner applies to
the Court for reinstatement of control of the property as provided in
Section 15 of P.L. 2003, c. 210 (N.J.S.A. 55:19-92). After the complaint
is filed, the complaint shall be served on the parties in interest in
accordance with the New Jersey Rules of Court.
C. After serving the notice of intent pursuant to Subsection B of this
section, the City of Bridgeton or its designee may enter upon that
property after written notice to the owner by certified mail, return
receipt requested, in order to secure, stabilize or repair the property, or
in order to inspect the property for purposes of preparing the plan to be
submitted to the Court pursuant to Section 12 of P.L. 2003, c. 210
(N.J.S.A. 55:19-89).
A. Any owner may defend against a complaint filed pursuant to Section 7
of P.L. 2003, c. 210 (N.J.S.A. 55:19-84) by submitting a plan for the
rehabilitation and reuse of the property which is the subject of the
complaint and by posting a bond equal to 125% of the amount
determined by the public officer or the Court to be the projected cost of
rehabilitation. Any plan submitted by an owner to defend against a
complaint shall be submitted within 60 days after the complaint has
been filed, unless the Court provides the owner with an extension of
time for good cause shown.
B. A plan submitted by an owner pursuant to this section shall include, but
not be limited to:
(1) A detailed financial feasibility analysis, including documentation of
the economic feasibility of the proposed reuse, including operating
budgets or resale prices, or both, as appropriate;
(2) A budget for the rehabilitation of the property, including sources
and uses of funds, based on the terms and conditions of realistically
available financing, including grants and loans;
(3) A timetable for the completion of rehabilitation and reuse of the
property, including milestones for performance of major steps
leading to and encompassing the rehabilitation and reuse of the
property; and
(4) Documentation of the qualifications of the individuals and firms
that will be engaged to carry out the planning, design, financial
packaging, construction, and marketing or rental of the property,
C. The Court shall approve any plan that, in the judgment of the Court, is
realistic and likely to result in the expeditious rehabilitation and reuse
of the property, which is the subject of the complaint. If the Court
§ 265-31.12 BRIDGETON CODE § 265-31.13
238:340
§ 265-31.14. Mortgage holder or lienholder to be designated in
possession of property.
§ 265-31.15. City to be designated in possession of property.
approves the owner's plan, then it may appoint the public officer to act
as monitor of the owner's compliance. If the owner fails to carry out
any step in the approved plan, then the City may apply to the Court to
have the owner's bond forfeited, possession of the building transferred
to the City to complete the rehabilitation plan and authorization to
use the bond proceeds for rehabilitation of the property. The owner
shall provide quarterly reports to the City on its activities and progress
toward rehabilitation and reuse of the property. The owner shall
provide those reports to the Court on its activities that the Court
determines are necessary.
D. The Court may reject a plan and bond if it finds that the plan does not
represent a realistic and expeditious means of ensuring the
rehabilitation of the property or that the owner or his representatives
or agents, or both, lack the qualifications, background or other criteria
necessary to ensure that the plan will be carried out successfully.
A. If an owner is unsuccessful in defending against a complaint filed
pursuant to Section 7 of P.L. 2003, c. 210 (N.J.S.A. 55:19-84), the
mortgage holder or lienholder may seek to be designated in possession
of the property by submitting a plan and posting a bond meeting the
same conditions as set forth in Section 10 of P.L. 2003, c. 210 (N.J.S.A.
55:19-87). The plan shall be submitted within 60 days after the Court
has rejected the owner's plan, unless the Court provides the mortgage
holder or lienholder with an extension of time for good cause shown. If
the Court approves any such mortgage holder or lienholder's plan, it
shall designate that party to be in possession of the property for
purposes of ensuring its rehabilitation and reuse and may appoint the
public officer to act as monitor of the party's compliance. The mortgage
holder or lienholder, as the case may be, shall provide quarterly reports
to the Court and the City on its activities and progress toward
rehabilitation and reuse of the property. If the mortgage holder or
lienholder fails to carry out any material step in the approved plan, then
the public officer shall notify the Court, which may order the bond
forfeit, grant the City possession of the property, and authorize the City
to use the proceeds of the bond for rehabilitation of the property.
B. Any sums incurred or advanced for the purpose of rehabilitating the
property by a mortgage holder or lienholder granted possession of a
property pursuant to Subsection A of this section, including Court costs
and reasonable attorney's fees, may be added to the unpaid balance due
that mortgage holder or lienholder, with the interest calculated at the
same rate set forth in the note or security agreement; or, in the case of a
tax lienholder, at the statutory interest rate for subsequent liens.
§ 265-31.13 PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITY § 265-31.15
238:341
§ 265-31.16. Designation of qualified rehabilitation entity.
A. If no mortgage holder or lienholder meets the conditions of Section 11
of P.L. 2003, c. 210 (N.J.S.A. 55:19-88), then the City may submit a plan
to the Court which conforms with the provisions of Subdivision b of
Section 10 of P.L. 2003, c. 210 (N.J.S.A. 55:19-87). The plan shall
designate the entity which shall implement the plan, which may be the
City or that entity designated in accordance with the provisions of
Section 13 of P.L. 2003, c. 210 (N.J.S.A. 55:19-90).
B. The Court shall grant the City possession of the property if it finds that:
(1) The proposed rehabilitation and reuse of the property is
appropriate and beneficial;
(2) The City is qualified to undertake the rehabilitation and reuse of
the property; and
(3) The plan submitted by the City represents a realistic and timely
plan for the rehabilitation and reuse of the property.
C. The City may take all steps necessary and appropriate to further the
rehabilitation and reuse of the property consistent with the plan
submitted to the Court. In making its findings pursuant to this
subsection, the Court may consult with qualified parties, including the
Department of Community Affairs, and, upon request by a party in
interest, may hold a hearing on the plan.
D. Where either a redevelopment plan pursuant to P.L. 1992, c. 79 (N.J.S.A.
40A:12A-1 et seq.) or a neighborhood revitalization plan pursuant to
P.L. 2001, c. 415 (N.J.S.A. 52:27D-490 et seq.) has been adopted or
approved by the Department of Community Affairs, as appropriate,
encompassing the property which is the subject of a complaint, the
Court shall make a further finding that the proposed rehabilitation and
reuse of the property are not inconsistent with any provision of either
plan.
A. The City may exercise its rights under P.L. 2003, c. 210 (N.J.S.A.
55:19-78 et seq.), directly, or may designate a qualified rehabilitation
entity to act as its designee for the purpose of exercising the City's
rights where that designation will further the rehabilitation and reuse
of the property consistent with the City's plans and objectives. This
designation shall be made by resolution of the Council of the City of
Bridgeton.
B. Regardless of whether the City exercises its rights directly or
designates a qualified rehabilitation entity pursuant to this section,
while in possession of a property pursuant to P.L. 2003, c. 210 (N.J.S.A.
55:19-78 et seq.), the City shall maintain, safeguard, and maintain
insurance on the property. Notwithstanding the City's possession of the
property, nothing in P.L. 2003, c. 210 (N.J.S.A. 55:19-78 et seq.), shall be
deemed to relieve the owner of the property of any civil or criminal
§ 265-31.15 BRIDGETON CODE § 265-31.16
238:342
§ 265-31.17. City deemed possessor of property; borrowing of
funds; reporting and filing requirements.
liability or any duty imposed by reason of acts or omissions of the
owner.
A. If the City has been granted possession of a property pursuant to
Section 12 of P.L. 2003, c. 210 (N.J.S.A. 55:19-89), the City shall be
deemed to have an ownership interest in the property for the purpose of
filing plans with public agencies and boards, seeking and obtaining
construction permits and other approvals, and submitting applications
for financing or other assistance to public or private entities. For the
purposes of any state program of grants or loans, including but not
limited to programs of the Department of Community Affairs and the
New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency, possession of a
property under this subsection shall be considered legal control of the
property. Notwithstanding the granting of possession to the City,
nothing in P.L. 2003, c. 210 (N.J.S.A. 55:19-78 et seq.) shall be deemed
to relieve the owner of the property of any obligation the owner or any
other person may have for the payment of taxes or other City liens and
charges, or mortgages or liens to any party, whether those taxes,
charges or liens are incurred before or after the granting of possession.
The granting of possession shall not suspend any obligation the owner
may have as of the date of the granting of possession for payment of any
operating or maintenance expense associated with the property,
whether or not billed at the time of the granting of possession.
B. The Court may approve the borrowing of funds by the City to
rehabilitate the property and may grant a lien or security interest with
priority over all other liens or mortgages other than municipal liens.
Prior to granting this lien priority, the Court shall find that 1) the City
sought to obtain the necessary financing from the senior lienholder,
which declined to provide such financing on reasonable terms; 2) the
City sought to obtain a voluntary subordination from the senior
lienholder, which refused to provide such subordination; and 3) lien
priority is necessary in order to induce another lender to provide
financing on reasonable terms.
C. Where the City has been granted possession by the Court in the name of
the City, the City may seek the approval of the Court to assign its rights
to another entity, which approval shall be granted by the Court when it
finds that:
(1) The entity to which the City's rights will be assigned is a qualified
rehabilitation entity; and
(2) The assignment will further the purposes of this section.
D. Where the City has designated a qualified rehabilitation entity to act on
its behalf, the qualified rehabilitation entity shall provide quarterly
reports to the City on its activities and progress toward rehabilitation

238:343

and reuse of the property. The City or qualified rehabilitation entity,
as the case may be, shall provide such reports to the Court as the
Court determines to be necessary. If the Court finds that the City or its
designee have failed to take diligent action toward rehabilitation of the
property within one year from the grant of possession, then the Court
may request the City to designate another qualified rehabilitation entity
to exercise its rights, or if the City fails to do so, may terminate the
order of possession and return the property to its owner.
E. The City shall file a notice of completion with the Court, and shall also
serve a copy on the owner and any mortgage holder or lienholder, at
such time as the City has determined that no more than six months
remain to the anticipated date on which rehabilitation will be complete.
This notice shall include an affidavit of the public officer attesting that
rehabilitation can realistically be anticipated to be complete within that
time period, and a statement setting forth such actions as it plans to
undertake to ensure that reuse of the property takes place consistent
with the plan.
A. An owner may petition for reinstatement of the owner's control and
possession of the property at any time after one year from the grant of
possession, but no later than 30 days after the City has filed a notice of
completion with the Court or, in the event the notice of completion is
filed within less than one year of the grant of possession, within 30 days
after the City has filed notice.
B. The Court may allow additional time for good cause if that additional
time does not materially delay completion of the rehabilitation, place
undue hardship on the City, or affect any of the terms or conditions
under which the City has applied for or received financing for the
rehabilitation of the property.
C. Any petition for reinstatement of the owner's control and possession of
the property filed pursuant to Section 15 of P.L. 2003, c. 210 (N.J.S.A.
55:19-92) shall:
(1) Include a plan for completion of the rehabilitation and reuse of the
property consistent with the plan previously approved by the
Court;
(2) Provide legally binding assurances that the owner will comply with
all conditions of any grant or loan secured by the City or repay
those grants or loans in full, at the discretion of the maker of the
loan or grant; and
(3) Be accompanied by payment equal to the sum of 1) all City liens
outstanding on the property; 2) all costs incurred by the City in
bringing action with respect to the property; 3) any costs incurred

§ 265-31.19. Obligations of owner prior to grant of petition.
§ 265-31.20. Granting of title to City; authority to sell.
If the owner fails to petition for the reinstatement of control and possession
of the property within 30 days after the entity in possession has filed a
notice of completion or in any event within two years after the initial grant
of possession, or if the owner fails to meet any conditions that may be set
by the Court in granting a reinstatement petition filed pursuant to Section
15 of P.L. 2003, c. 210 (N.J.S.A. 55:19-92), upon petition from the entity in
possession, the Court may grant the City title or authorize the City to sell
the property, subject to the provisions of Section 19 of P.L. 2003, c. 210

by the City not covered by grants or loans to be assumed or repaid
pursuant to this section; and 4) any costs remaining to complete
rehabilitation and reuse of the property, as determined by the
public officer, which payment shall be placed in escrow with the
Clerk of the Court pending disposition of the petition.
A. Prior to the granting of a petition on the part of the owner by the Court
pursuant to Section 15 of P.L. 2003, c. 210 (N.J.S.A. 55:19-92), the
owner may be required to post a bond or other security in an amount
determined by the Court, after consultation with the public officer, as
likely to ensure that the owner will continue to maintain the property in
sound condition. That bond or other security shall be made available to
the City to make any repair on the property in the event of a Code
violation which is not corrected in timely fashion by the owner. The
bond or other security may be forfeited in full in the event that the
owner fails to comply with any requirement imposed as a condition of
the reinstatement petition filed pursuant to Section 15 of P.L. 2003, c.
210 (N.J.S.A. 55:19-92).
B. The owner may seek approval of the Court to be relieved of this
requirement after five years, which shall be granted if the court finds
that the owner has maintained the property in good repair during that
period, that no material violations affecting the health and safety of the
tenants have occurred during that period, and that the owner has
remedied other violations in a timely and expeditious fashion.
A. Other than in-state or out-of-state creditors, any owner who is not in full
compliance with this article or who otherwise violates any provision of
this article or of the rules and regulations issued hereunder shall be
subject to a fine of $500 to $2,000 for each offense at the discretion of
the public officer. Every day that a violation continues shall constitute a
separate and distinct offense. Fines assessed under this article shall be
recoverable from the owner/creditor and shall be a lien on the property.

238:345
For purposes of this subsection, failure to file a registration statement
in time, failure to provide correct information on the registration
statement, failure to comply with all provisions of this article, or such
other matters as may be established by the rules and regulations of the
public officer or his/her designee shall be deemed to be violations of
this article.
B. In accordance with P.L. 2014, c. 35, if an out-of-state creditor that is
subject to a rule promulgated in this article is found by the City's
Municipal Court or by any court of competent jurisdiction to be in
violation of the requirement to appoint an in-state representative or
agent, such creditor shall be subject to a fine of $2,500 for each day of
the violation. However, any fines imposed on a creditor for the failure to
appoint an in-state representative or agent shall commence on the day
after the ten-day period set forth in Subdivision a(1) of Section 17 of P.L.
2008, c. 127 (N.J.S.A. 46:10B-51), for providing notice to the Municipal
Clerk that a summons and complaint in an action to foreclose on a
mortgage has been served.
C. In accordance with P.L. 2014, c. 35, if a creditor that is found by the
City's Municipal Court or by any court of competent jurisdiction to be in
violation of the requirement to correct a care, maintenance, security, or
upkeep violation cited in a notice issued pursuant to this article, such
creditor shall be subject to a fine of $1,500 for each day of the violation.
Every day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate and
distinct offense. Any fines imposed pursuant to this subsection shall
commence 31 days following receipt of the notice, except if the
violation presents an imminent risk to public health and safety, as
determined by the public officer, Code Enforcement Official,
Construction Official, Fire Chief, or other appropriate City Official, as
applicable based on the code violation at issue, in which case any fines
shall commence 11 days following receipt of the notice.
D. In accordance with P.L. 2014, c. 35, c N.J.S.A. 40:48-2.12s(d.), no less
than 20% of any money collected from creditors/owners/responsible

be subject to all maintenance rules described within this section that
apply to creditors. Failures to correct a care, maintenance, security, or
upkeep violation cited in a notice issued pursuant to this article, if
found by any court of competent jurisdiction, shall result in the violator
being subject to a fine pursuant to the guidelines set forth in
§ 265-31.21A. Any fines imposed pursuant to this subsection shall
commence 31 days following receipt of the notice, except if any
violation presents an imminent risk to public health and safety, as
determined by the public officer, Code Enforcement Official,
Construction Official, Fire Chief or other appropriate City Official, in
accordance with City Code, in which case any fines shall commence 11
days following receipt of notice.

A. Where the City seeks to gain title to the property, it shall purchase the
property for fair market value on such terms as the Court shall approve,
and may place the proceeds of sale in escrow with the Court. The Court
may authorize the City to sell the building free and clear of liens, claims
and encumbrances, in which event all such liens, claims and
encumbrances shall be transferred to the proceeds of sale with the
same priority as existed prior to resale in accordance with the
provisions of this section except that municipal liens shall be paid at
settlement. The proceeds of the purchase of the property shall be
distributed as set forth in Section 20 of P.L. 2003, c. 210 (N.J.S.A.

B. The City may seek approval of the Court to sell the property to a third
party when the Court finds that such conveyance will further the
effective and timely rehabilitation and reuse of the property.
C. Upon approval by the Court, the City shall sell the property on such
terms and at such price as the court shall approve, and may place the

and mortgage holders.
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in P.L. 2003, c. 210 (N.J.S.A.
55:19-78 et seq.), a court may in its discretion deny a lienholder or
mortgage holder of any or all rights or remedies afforded lienholders and
mortgage holders under P.L. 2003, c. 210 (N.J.S.A. 55:19-78 et seq.), if the
Court finds that the owner of a property subject to any of the provisions of
P.L. 2003, c. 210 (N.J.S.A. 55:19-78 et seq.) owns or controls more than a
fifty-percent interest in, or effective control of, the lienholder or mortgage
holder or that the familial or business relationship between the lienholder
or mortgage holder and the owner precludes a separate interest on the part
of the lienholder or mortgage holder.
§ 265-31.26. Recourse of City with respect to liens against real
property.
A. The public officer, with the approval of the Court, may place a lien on

proceeding under P.L. 2003, c. 210 (N.J.S.A. 55:19-78 et seq.), incurred
prior to the grant by the Court of an order of possession under P.L.
2003, c. 210 (N.J.S.A. 55:19-78 et seq.), which may include costs
incurred to stabilize or secure the property to ensure that it can be
rehabilitated in a cost-effective manner. Any such lien shall be
considered a City lien for the purposes of N.J.S.A. 54:5-9 with the rights
and status of a City lien pursuant thereto.
B. With the exception of the holding of special tax sales pursuant to
Section 24 of P.L. 2003, c. 210 (N.J.S.A. 55:19-101), the remedies
available under P.L. 2003, c. 210 (N.J.S.A. 55:19-78 et seq.), shall be
available to the City with respect to any abandoned property, whether
or not the City has established an Abandoned Property List as provided
in Section 36 of P.L. 1996, c. 62 (N.J.S.A. 55:19-55) and whether or not

C. With the exception of the holding of special tax sales pursuant to
Section 24 of P.L. 2003, c. 210 (N.J.S.A. 55:19-101), the remedies
available under P.L. 2003, c. 210 (N.J.S.A. 55:19-78 et seq.), shall be

or not the City has established an Abandoned Property List as provided
in Section 36 of P.L. 1996, c. 62 (N.J.S.A. 55:19-55) and whether or not
the property has been included on any such list.
A. The City may hold special tax sales with respect to those properties
eligible for tax sale pursuant to N.J.S.A. 54:5-19 which are also on an
Abandoned Property List established by the City pursuant to Section 36
of P.L. 1996, c. 62 (N.J.S.A. 55:19-55). If the City elects to hold a special
tax sale, it shall conduct that sale subject to following provisions:
(1) The City shall establish criteria for eligibility to bid on properties at
the sale, which may include, but shall not be limited to:
documentation of the bidder's ability to rehabilitate or otherwise
reuse the property consistent with the City's plans and regulations;
commitments by the bidder to take action to foreclose on the tax
lien by a date certain; and such other criteria as the City may
determine are necessary to ensure that the properties to be sold
will be rehabilitated or otherwise reused in a manner consistent
with the public interest;
(2) The City may establish minimum bid requirements for a special tax
sale that may be less than the full amount of the taxes, interest and
penalties due, the amount of such minimum bid to be at the sole
discretion of the City, in order to ensure that the properties to be
sold will be rehabilitated or otherwise reused in a manner
consistent with the public interest;
(3) The City may combine properties into bid packages, and require
that bidders place a single bid on each package in addition to bids
on individual properties within the bidding package, and the City
may reject any and all bids on individual properties that have been
included in bid packages;
(4) The City may sell properties subject to provisions that, if the
purchaser fails to carry out any commitment that has been set forth
as a condition of sale pursuant to Subsection A(1) of this section or
misrepresents any material qualification that has been established
as a condition of eligibility to bid pursuant thereto, then the
properties and any interest thereto acquired by the purchaser shall
revert to the City, and any amount paid by the purchaser to the City
at the special tax sale shall be forfeited to the City;

(5) In the event there are two or more qualified bidders for any
property or bid package in a special tax sale, the City may
designate the unsuccessful but qualified bidder whose bid was
closest to the successful bid as an eligible purchaser;
(6) In the event that the purchaser of that property or bid package fails
to meet any of the conditions of sale established by the City
pursuant to this section, and the purchaser's interest in the
property or properties reverts to the City, the City may
subsequently designate the entity previously designated as an
eligible purchaser as the winning bidder for the property or
properties, and assign the tax sale certificates to that entity on the
basis of that entity's bid at the special tax sale, subject to the terms
and conditions of the special tax sale.
(7) The City shall provide notice of a special tax sale pursuant to
N.J.S.A. 54:5-26. The notice shall include any special terms of sale
established by the City pursuant to Subsection A(2), (3), or (4) of
this section. Nothing shall prohibit the City from holding a special
tax sale on the same day as a standard or accelerated tax sale.
A. With respect to any eminent domain proceeding carried out under
Section 37 of P.L. 1996, c. 62 (N.J.S.A. 55:19-56), the fair market value
of the property shall be established on the basis of an analysis which
determines independently:
(1) The cost to rehabilitate and reuse the property for such purpose as
is appropriate under existing planning and zoning regulations
governing its reuse or to demolish the existing property and
construct a new building on the site, including all costs ancillary to
rehabilitation such as, but not limited to, marketing and legal costs;
(2) The realistic market value of the reused property after
rehabilitation or new construction, taking into account the market
conditions particular to the neighborhood or subarea of the City in
which the property is located; and
(3) The extent to which the cost exceeds or does not exceed the market
value after rehabilitation, or demolition and new construction, and
the extent to which any "as is" value of the property prior to
rehabilitation can be added to the cost of rehabilitation or
demolition and new construction without the resulting combined
cost exceeding the market value as separately determined. If the
appraisal finds that the cost of rehabilitation or demolition and new
construction, as appropriate, exceeds the realistic market value
after rehabilitation or demolition and new construction, there shall
be a rebuttable presumption in all proceedings under this

assignment from the City of a tax sale certificate is placed on the Abandoned
Property List, the property shall be removed from the list if the owner of the
certificate pays all the City's taxes and liens due on the property within 30
days after the property is placed on the list; provided, however, that if the
owner of the certificate fails to initiate foreclosure proceedings within six
months after the property was first placed on the list, the property shall be

specifying the street address and block and lot number of the property
to be included, and the grounds for its inclusion. Within 30 days of
receipt of any such request, the public officer shall provide a written
response to the party, either indicating that the property will be added
to the list of abandoned properties or, if not, the reasons for not adding
the property to the list. For the purposes of this subsection, "interested
party" shall include any resident of the City, any owner or operator of a
business within the City or any organization representing the interests
of residents or engaged in furthering the revitalization and
improvement of the neighborhood in which the property is located.
(1) Any interested party may participate in any redetermination
hearing held by the public officer pursuant to Subdivision e of
Section 36 of P.L. 1996, c. 62 (N.J.S.A. 55:19-55). Upon written
request by any interested party, the public officer shall provide the

environmentally sensitive site design and source controls that prevent
pollutants from being placed on the site or from being exposed to
stormwater. Source control plans should be developed based upon
physical site conditions and the origin, nature, and the anticipated
quantity or amount of potential pollutants. Multiple stormwater
management BMPs may be necessary to achieve the established
performance standards for water quality, quantity, and groundwater
recharge.
B. Purpose. It is the purpose of this article to establish minimum
stormwater management requirements and controls for major
development, as defined in § 304-2.

preempted by the Residential Site Improvement Standards at
N.J.A.C. 5:21.
(2) this article shall also be applicable to all major developments
undertaken by the City of Bridgeton.
D. Compatibility with other permit and ordinance requirements.
Development approvals issued for subdivisions and site plans pursuant

A. Design and performance standards for stormwater management
measures.
(1) Stormwater management measures for major development shall be
developed to meet the erosion control, groundwater recharge,
stormwater runoff quantity, and stormwater runoff quality
standards in § 304-4. To the maximum extent practicable, these
standards shall be met by incorporating nonstructural stormwater
management strategies into the design. If these strategies alone
are not sufficient to meet these standards, structural stormwater
management measures necessary to meet these standards shall be
incorporated into the design.
§ 304-2 SMOKING § 304-3
294:421
§ 304-4. Stormwater management requirements for major
development.
(2) The standards in this article apply only to new major development
and are intended to minimize the impact of stormwater runoff on
water quality and water quantity in receiving water bodies and
maintain groundwater recharge. The standards do not apply to new
major development to the extent that alternative design and
performance standards are applicable under a regional stormwater
management plan or water quality management plan adopted in
accordance with Department rules. [Note: Alternative standards
shall provide at least as much protection from stormwater-related
loss of groundwater recharge, stormwater quantity and water
quality impacts of major development projects as would be
provided under the standards in N.J.A.C. 7:8-5.]
A. The development shall incorporate a maintenance plan for the
stormwater management measures incorporated into the design of a
major development in accordance with § 304-10.
B. Stormwater management measures shall avoid adverse impacts of
concentrated flow on habitat for threatened and endangered species as
documented in the Department's Landscape Project or Natural
Heritage Database established under N.J.S.A. 13:1B-15.147 through
15.150, particularly Helonias bullata (swamp pink) and/or Clemmys
muhlnebergi (bog turtle).
C. The following linear development projects are exempt from the
groundwater recharge, stormwater runoff quantity, and stormwater
runoff quality requirements of § 304-4F and G:
(1) The construction of an underground utility line, provided that the
disturbed areas are revegetated upon completion;
(2) The construction of an aboveground utility line, provided that the
existing conditions are maintained to the maximum extent
practicable; and
(3) The construction of a public pedestrian access, such as a sidewalk
or trail with a maximum width of 14 feet, provided that the access
is made of permeable material.
D. A waiver from strict compliance from the groundwater recharge,
stormwater runoff quantity, and stormwater runoff quality
requirements of § 304-4F and G may be obtained for the enlargement of
an existing public roadway or railroad or the construction or
enlargement of a public pedestrian access, provided that the following
conditions are met:
(1) The applicant demonstrates that there is a public need for the
project that cannot be accomplished by any other means;
§ 304-3 BRIDGETON CODE § 304-4
294:422
(2) The applicant demonstrates through an alternatives analysis that,
through the use of nonstructural and structural stormwater
management strategies and measures, the option selected
complies with the requirements of § 304-4F and G to the maximum
extent practicable;
(3) The applicant demonstrates that, in order to meet the requirements
of § 304-4F and G, existing structures currently in use, such as
homes and buildings, would need to be condemned; and
(4) The applicant demonstrates that it does not own or have other
rights to areas, including the potential to obtain through
condemnation lands not falling under Subsection D(3) above within
the upstream drainage area of the receiving stream, that would
provide additional opportunities to mitigate the requirements of
§ 304-4F and G that were not achievable onsite.
E. Nonstructural stormwater management strategies.
(1) To the maximum extent practicable, the standards in § 304-4F and
G shall be met by incorporating nonstructural stormwater
management strategies set forth at § 304-4E into the design. The
applicant shall identify the nonstructural measures incorporated
into the design of the project. If the applicant contends that it is not
feasible for engineering, environmental, or safety reasons to
incorporate any nonstructural stormwater management measures
identified in Subsection E(2) below into the design of a particular
project, the applicant shall identify the strategy considered and
provide a basis for the contention.
(2) Nonstructural stormwater management strategies incorporated
into site design shall:
(a) Protect areas that provide water quality benefits or areas
particularly susceptible to erosion and sediment loss;
(b) Minimize impervious surfaces and break up or disconnect the
flow of runoff over impervious surfaces;
(c) Maximize the protection of natural drainage features and
vegetation;
(d) Minimize the decrease in the time of concentration from

retention and planting of native vegetation and minimizes the
use of lawns, fertilizers and pesticides;
(h) Provide vegetated open-channel conveyance systems
discharging into and through stable vegetated areas;
(i) Provide other source controls to prevent or minimize the use or
exposure of pollutants at the site in order to prevent or
minimize the release of those pollutants into stormwater
runoff. Such source controls include, but are not limited to:
[1] Site design features that help to prevent accumulation of
trash and debris in drainage systems, including features
that satisfy § 304-4E(3) below;
[2] Site design features that help to prevent discharge of trash
and debris from drainage systems;
[3] Site design features that help to prevent and/or contain
spills or other harmful accumulations of pollutants at
industrial or commercial developments; and
[4] When establishing vegetation after land disturbance,
applying fertilizer in accordance with the requirements
established under the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control
Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq., and implementing rules.
(3) Site design features identified under § 304-4E(2)(i)[2] above shall
comply with the following standard to control passage of solid and
floatable materials through storm drain inlets. For purposes of this
paragraph, "solid and floatable materials" means sediment, debris,
trash, and other floating, suspended, or settleable solids. For
exemptions to this standard see § 304-4E(3)(c) below.
(a) Design engineers shall use either of the following grates
whenever they use a grate in pavement or another ground
surface to collect stormwater from that surface into a storm
drain or surface water body under that grate:
[1] The New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT)
bicycle safe grate, which is described in Chapter 2.4 of the
NJDOT Bicycle Compatible Roadways and Bikeways
Planning and Design Guidelines (April 1996); or
[2] A different grate, if each individual clear space in that
grate has an area of no more than seven square inches, or
is no greater than 0.5 inches across the smallest
dimension. Examples of grates subject to this standard
include grates in grate inlets, the grate portion (non-curbopening
portion) of combination inlets, grates on storm
sewer manholes, ditch grates, trench grates, and grates of
§ 304-4 BRIDGETON CODE § 304-4
294:424
spacer bars in slotted drains. Examples of ground surfaces
include surfaces of roads (including bridges), driveways,
parking areas, bikeways, plazas, sidewalks, lawns, fields,
open channels, and stormwater basin floors.
(b) Whenever design engineers use a curb-opening inlet, the clear
space in that curb opening (or each individual clear space, if
the curb opening has two or more clear spaces) shall have an
area of no more than seven square inches, or be no greater
than two inches across the smallest dimension.
(c) This standard does not apply:
[1] Where the review agency determines that this standard
would cause inadequate hydraulic performance that could
not practicably be overcome by using additional or larger
storm drain inlets that meet these standards;
[2] Where flows from the water quality design storm as
specified in § 304-4G(1) are conveyed through any device
(e.g., end-of-pipe netting facility, manufactured treatment
device, or a catch basin hood) that is designed, at a
minimum, to prevent delivery of all solid and floatable
materials that could not pass through one of the following:
[a] A rectangular space 4 5/8 inches long and 1 1/2 inches
wide (this option does not apply for outfall netting
facilities); or
[b] A bar screen having a bar spacing of 0.5 inch.
[3] Where flows are conveyed through a trash rack that has
parallel bars with one-inch spacing between the bars, to
the elevation of the water quality design storm as specified
in § 304-4G(1); or
[4] Where the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection determines, pursuant to the New Jersey
Register of Historic Places Rules at N.J.A.C. 7:4-7.2(c), that
action to meet this standard is an undertaking that
constitutes an encroachment or will damage or destroy the
New Jersey Register listed historic property.
(4) Any land area used as a nonstructural stormwater management
measure to meet the performance standards in § 304-4F and G
shall be dedicated to a government agency, subjected to a
conservation restriction filed with the appropriate county clerk's
office, or subject to an approved equivalent restriction that ensures
that measure or an equivalent stormwater management measure
approved by the reviewing agency is maintained in perpetuity.

(5) Guidance for nonstructural stormwater management strategies is
available in the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management
Practices Manual. The BMP Manual may be obtained from the
address identified in § 304-7, or found on the Department's Web
site at www.njstormwater.org.
F. Erosion control, groundwater recharge and runoff quantity standards.
(1) This subsection contains minimum design and performance
standards to control erosion, encourage and control infiltration and
groundwater recharge, and control stormwater runoff quantity
impacts of major development.
(a) The minimum design and performance standards for erosion
control are those established under the Soil Erosion and
Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq., and
implementing rules.
(b) The minimum design and performance standards for
groundwater recharge are as follows:
[1] The design engineer shall, using the assumptions and
factors for stormwater runoff and groundwater recharge
calculations at § 304-5, either:
[a] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis that the site and its stormwater management
measures maintain 100% of the average annual
preconstruction groundwater recharge volume for the
site; or
[b] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis that the increase of stormwater runoff volume
from preconstruction to postconstruction for the twoyear
storm is infiltrated.
[2] This groundwater recharge requirement does not apply to
projects within the urban redevelopment area, or to
projects subject to Subsection F(1)(b)[3] below.
[3] The following types of stormwater shall not be recharged:
[a] Stormwater from areas of high pollutant loading. High
pollutant loading areas are areas in industrial and
commercial developments where solvents and/or
petroleum products are loaded/unloaded, stored, or
applied, areas where pesticides are loaded/unloaded
or stored; areas where hazardous materials are
expected to be present in greater than "reportable
quantities" as defined by the United States
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR
302.4; areas where recharge would be inconsistent
§ 304-4 BRIDGETON CODE § 304-4
294:426
with Department-approved remedial action work plan
or landfill closure plan and areas with high risks for
spills of toxic materials, such as gas stations and
vehicle maintenance facilities; and
[b] Industrial stormwater exposed to source material.
"Source material" means any material(s) or
machinery, located at an industrial facility, that is
directly or indirectly related to process,
manufacturing or other industrial activities, which
could be a source of pollutants in any industrial
stormwater discharge to groundwater. Source
materials include, but are not limited to, raw
materials; intermediate products; final products;
waste materials; by-products; industrial machinery
and fuels, and lubricants, solvents, and detergents
that are related to process, manufacturing, or other
industrial activities that are exposed to stormwater.
[4] The design engineer shall assess the hydraulic impact on
the groundwater table and design the site so as to avoid
adverse hydraulic impacts. Potential adverse hydraulic
impacts include, but are not limited to, exacerbating a
naturally or seasonally high water table so as to cause
surficial ponding, flooding of basements, or interference
with the proper operation of subsurface sewage disposal
systems and other subsurface structures in the vicinity or
downgradient of the groundwater recharge area.
(c) In order to control stormwater runoff quantity impacts, the
design engineer shall, using the assumptions and factors for
stormwater runoff calculations at § 304-5, complete one of the
following:
[1] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
that for stormwater leaving the site, postconstruction
runoff hydrographs for the two-, ten- and one-hundredyear
storm events do not exceed, at any point in time, the
preconstruction runoff hydrographs for the same storm
events;
[2] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
that there is no increase, as compared to the
preconstruction condition, in the peak runoff rates of
stormwater leaving the site for the two-, ten- and onehundred-
year storm events and that the increased volume
or change in timing of stormwater runoff will not increase
flood damage at or downstream of the site. This analysis
shall include the analysis of impacts of existing land uses
and projected land uses assuming full development under
§ 304-4 SMOKING § 304-4
294:427
existing zoning and land use ordinances in the drainage
area;
[3] Design stormwater management measures so that the
postconstruction peak runoff rates for the two-, ten- and
one-hundred-year storm events are 50%, 75% and 80%,
respectively, of the preconstruction peak runoff rates. The
percentages apply only to the postconstruction
stormwater runoff that is attributable to the portion of the
site on which the proposed development or project is to be
constructed. The percentages shall not be applied to
postconstruction stormwater runoff into tidal flood hazard
areas if the increased volume of stormwater runoff will not
increase flood damages below the point of discharge; or
[4] In tidal flood hazard areas, stormwater runoff quantity
analysis in accordance with Subsection F(1)(c)[1], [2] and
[3] above shall only be applied if the increased volume of
stormwater runoff could increase flood damages below the
point of discharge.
(2) Any application for a new agricultural development that meets the
definition of major development at § 304-2 shall be submitted to the
appropriate soil conservation district for review and approval in
accordance with the requirements of this section and any
applicable soil conservation district guidelines for stormwater
runoff quantity and erosion control. For the purposes of this
section, "agricultural development" means land uses normally
associated with the production of food, fiber and livestock for sale.
Such uses do not include the development of land for the
processing or sale of food and the manufacturing of agriculturally
related products.
G. Stormwater runoff quality standards.
(1) Stormwater management measures shall be designed to reduce the
post-construction load of total suspended solids (TSS) in
stormwater runoff by 80% of the anticipated load from the
developed site, expressed as an annual average. Stormwater
management measures shall only be required for water quality
control if an additional 1/4 acre of impervious surface is being
proposed on a development site. The requirement to reduce TSS
does not apply to any stormwater runoff in a discharge regulated
under a numeric effluent limitation for TSS imposed under the New
Jersey Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NJPDES) rules,
N.J.A.C. 7:14A, or in a discharge specifically exempt under a
NJPDES permit from this requirement. The water quality design
storm is 1.25 inches of rainfall in two hours. Water quality
calculations shall take into account the distribution of rain from the
water quality design storm, as reflected in Table 1. The calculation
of the volume of runoff may take into account the implementation
§ 304-4 BRIDGETON CODE § 304-4
294:428
of non-structural and structural stormwater management
measures.

(2) For purposes of TSS reduction calculations, Table 2 below presents
the presumed removal rates for certain BMPs designed in
accordance with the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management
Practices Manual. The BMP Manual may be obtained from the
address identified in § 304-7, or found on the Department's Web
site at www.njstormwater.org. The BMP Manual and other sources
of technical guidance are listed in § 304-7. TSS reduction shall be
calculated based on the removal rates for the BMPs in Table 2
below. Alternative removal rates and methods of calculating
removal rates may be used if the design engineer provides
documentation demonstrating the capability of these alternative
rates and methods to the review agency. A copy of any approved
alternative rate or method of calculating the removal rate shall be
provided to the Department at the following address: Division of
Watershed Management, New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection, PO Box 418, Trenton, New Jersey 08625-0418.
(3) If more than one BMP in series is necessary to achieve the required
eighty-percent TSS reduction for a site, the applicant shall utilize
the following formula to calculate TSS reduction:
§ 304-4 SMOKING § 304-4
294:429
R = A + B - (AXB)/100
Where
R = total TSS percent load removal from application of both
BMPs
A = the TSS percent removal rate applicable to the first BMP
B = the TSS percent removal rate applicable to the second BMP
Table 2
TSS Removal Rates for BMPs
Best Management Practice TSS Percent Removal Rate
Bioretention systems 90
Constructed stormwater
wetland
90
Extended detention basin 40 to 60
Infiltration structure 80
Manufactured treatment device See § 304-6C
Sand filter 80
Vegetative filter strip 60 to 80
Wet bond 50 to 90
(4) If there is more than on-site drainage area, the eighty-percent TSS
removal rate shall apply to each drainage area, unless the runoff
from the subareas converge on site, in which case the removal rate
can be demonstrated through a calculation using a weighted
average.
(5) Stormwater management measures shall also be designed to
reduce, to the maximum extent feasible, the postconstruction
nutrient load of the anticipated load from the developed site in
stormwater runoff generated from the water quality design storm.
In achieving reduction of nutrients to the maximum extent feasible,
the design of the site shall include nonstructural strategies and
structural measures that optimize nutrient removal while still
achieving the performance standards in § 304-4F and G.
(6) Additional information and examples are contained in the New
Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual, which may
be obtained from the address identified in § 304-7.
(7) In accordance with the definition of FW1 at N.J.A.C. 7:9B-1.4,
stormwater management measures shall be designed to prevent
any increase in stormwater runoff to waters classified as FW1.
(8) Special water resource protection areas shall be established along
all waters designated Category One at N.J.A.C. 7:9B, and perennial
or intermittent streams that drain into or upstream of the Category
§ 304-4 BRIDGETON CODE § 304-4
294:430
One waters as shown on the USGS Quadrangle Maps or in the
County Soil Surveys, within the associated HUC14 drainage area.
These areas shall be established for the protection of water quality,
aesthetic value, exceptional ecological significance, exceptional
recreational significance, exceptional water supply significance,
and exceptional fisheries significance of those established Category
One waters. These areas shall be designated and protected as
follows:
(a) The applicant shall preserve and maintain a special water
resource protection area in accordance with one of the
following:
[1] A three-hundred-foot special water resource protection
area shall be provided on each side of the waterway,
measured perpendicular to the waterway from the top of
the bank outwards or from the center line of the waterway
where the bank is not defined, consisting of existing
vegetation or vegetation allowed to follow natural
succession is provided.
[2] Encroachment within the designated special water
resource protection area under Subsection G(8)(a)[1]
above shall only be allowed where previous development
or disturbance has occurred (for example, active
agricultural use, parking area or maintained lawn area).
The encroachment shall only be allowed where applicant
demonstrates that the functional value and overall
condition of the special water resource protection area will
be maintained to the maximum extent practicable. In no
case shall the remaining special water resource protection
area be reduced to less than 150 feet as measured
perpendicular to the top-of-bank of the waterway or center
line of the waterway where the bank is undefined. All
encroachments proposed under this subparagraph shall be
subject to review and approval by the Department.
(b) All stormwater shall be discharged outside of and flow through
the special water resource protection area and shall comply
with the standard for off-site stability in the Standards For Soil
Erosion and Sediment Control in New Jersey, established under
the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et
seq.
(c) If stormwater discharged outside of and flowing through the
special water resource protection area cannot comply with the
standard for off-site stability in the Standards for Soil Erosion
and Sediment Control in New Jersey, established under the Soil
Erosion and Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq.,
then the stabilization measures in accordance with the
§ 304-4 SMOKING § 304-4
294:431
§ 304-5. Calculation of stormwater runoff and groundwater
recharge.
requirements of the above standards may be placed within the
special water resource protection area, provided that:
[1] Stabilization measures shall not be placed within 150 feet
of the Category One waterway;
[2] Stormwater associated with discharges allowed by this
section shall achieve a ninety-five-percent TSS
postconstruction removal rate;
[3] Temperature shall be addressed to ensure no impact on
the receiving waterway;
[4] The encroachment shall only be allowed where the
applicant demonstrates that the functional value and
overall condition of the special water resource protection
area will be maintained to the maximum extent
practicable;
[5] A conceptual project design meeting shall be held with the
appropriate Department staff and soil conservation district
staff to identify necessary stabilization measures; and
[6] All encroachments proposed under this section shall be
subject to review and approval by the Department.
(d) A stream corridor protection plan may be developed by a
regional stormwater management planning committee as an
element of a regional stormwater management plan, or by a
municipality through an adopted municipal stormwater
management plan. If a stream corridor protection plan for a
waterway subject to § 304-4G(8) has been approved by the
Department of Environmental Protection, then the provisions
of the plan shall be the applicable special water resource
protection area requirements for that waterway. A stream
corridor protection plan for a waterway subject to Subsection
G(8) shall maintain or enhance the current functional value
and overall condition of the special water resource protection
area as defined in Subsection G(8)(a)[1] above. In no case shall
a stream corridor protection plan allow the reduction of the
special water resource protection area to less than 150 feet as
measured perpendicular to the waterway subject to this
subsection.
(e) Subsection G(8) does not apply to the construction of one
individual single-family dwelling that is not part of a larger
development on a lot receiving preliminary or final subdivision
approval on or before February 2, 2004, provided that the
construction begins on or before February 2, 2009.
§ 304-4 BRIDGETON CODE § 304-5
294:432
A. Stormwater runoff shall be calculated in accordance with the following:
(1) The design engineer shall calculate runoff using one of the
following methods:
(a) The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS)
methodology, including the NRCS Runoff Equation and
Dimensionless Unit Hydrograph, as described in the NRCS
National Engineering Handbook Section 4 - Hydrology and
Technical Release 55 - Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds;
or
(b) The Rational Method for peak flow and the Modified Rational
Method for hydrograph computations.
(2) For the purpose of calculating runoff coefficients and groundwater
recharge, there is a presumption that the preconstruction condition
of a site or portion thereof is a wooded land use with good
hydrologic condition. The term "runoff coefficient" applies to both
the NRCS methodology at § 304-5A(1)(a) and the Rational and
Modified Rational Methods at § 304-5A(1)(b). A runoff coefficient or
a groundwater recharge land cover for an existing condition may
be used on all or a portion of the site if the design engineer verifies
that the hydrologic condition has existed on the site or portion of
the site for at least five years without interruption prior to the time
of application. If more than one land cover have existed on the site
during the five years immediately prior to the time of application,
the land cover with the lowest runoff potential shall be used for the
computations. In addition, there is the presumption that the site is
in good hydrologic condition (if the land use type is pasture, lawn,
or park), with good cover (if the land use type is woods), or with
good hydrologic condition and conservation treatment (if the land
use type is cultivation).
(3) In computing preconstruction stormwater runoff, the design
engineer shall account for all significant land features and
structures, such as ponds, wetlands, depressions, hedgerows, or
culverts, that may reduce preconstruction stormwater runoff rates
and volumes.
(4) In computing stormwater runoff from all design storms, the design
engineer shall consider the relative stormwater runoff rates and/or
volumes of pervious and impervious surfaces separately to
accurately compute the rates and volume of stormwater runoff
from the site. To calculate runoff from unconnected impervious
cover, urban impervious area modifications as described in the
NRCS Technical Release 55 - Urban Hydrology for Small
Watersheds and other methods may be employed.
(5) If the invert of the outlet structure of a stormwater management
measure is below the flood hazard design flood elevation as defined
at N.J.A.C. 7:13, the design engineer shall take into account the
§ 304-5 SMOKING § 304-5

measures.
effects of tailwater in the design of structural stormwater
management measures.
B. Groundwater recharge may be calculated in accordance with the
following:
(1) The New Jersey Geological Survey Report GSR-32, A Method for
Evaluating Ground-Water Recharge Areas in New Jersey,
incorporated herein by reference, as amended and supplemented.
Information regarding the methodology is available from the New
Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual; at
http://www.state.nj.us/dep/njgs/; or at New Jersey Geological
Survey, 29 Arctic Parkway, PO Box 427, Trenton, New Jersey
08625-0427; (609) 984-6587.
A. Standards for structural stormwater management measures are as
follows:
(1) Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed to
take into account the existing site conditions, including, for

A. This section sets forth requirements to protect public safety through
the proper design and operation of stormwater management basins.
This section applies to any new stormwater management basin. [Note:
The provisions of this section are not intended to preempt more
stringent municipal or county safety requirements for new or existing
stormwater management basins. Municipal and county stormwater
management plans and ordinances may, pursuant to their authority,
require existing stormwater management basins to be retrofitted to
meet one or more of the safety standards in § 304-8B(1), B(2), and B(3)
for trash racks, overflow grates, and escape provisions at outlet
structures.]
B. Requirements for trash racks, overflow grates and escape provisions.
(1) A trash rack is a device designed to catch trash and debris and
prevent the clogging of outlet structures. Trash racks shall be
installed at the intake to the outlet from the stormwater
management basin to ensure proper functioning of the basin
outlets in accordance with the following:
(a) The trash rack shall have parallel bars, with no greater than
six-inch spacing between the bars.
(b) The trash rack shall be designed so as not to adversely affect
the hydraulic performance of the outlet pipe or structure.
(c) The average velocity of flow through a clean trash rack is not to
exceed 2.5 feet per second under the full range of stage and
discharge. Velocity is to be computed on the basis of the net
area of opening through the rack.
(d) The trash rack shall be constructed and installed to be rigid,
durable, and corrosion-resistant, and shall be designed to
withstand a perpendicular live loading of 300 pounds per
square foot.
(2) An overflow grate is designed to prevent obstruction of the
overflow structure. If an outlet structure has an overflow grate,
such grate shall meet the following requirements:
(a) The overflow grate shall be secured to the outlet structure but
removable for emergencies and maintenance.
§ 304-7 BRIDGETON CODE § 304-8
294:436
(b) The overflow grate spacing shall be no less than two inches
across the smallest dimension.
(c) The overflow grate shall be constructed and installed to be
rigid, durable, and corrosion-resistant, and shall be designed
to withstand a perpendicular live loading of 300 pounds per
square foot.
(3) For purposes of this paragraph, escape provisions means the
permanent installation of ladders, steps, rungs, or other features
that provide easily accessible means of egress from stormwater
management basins. Stormwater management basins shall include
escape provisions as follows:
(a) If a stormwater management basin has an outlet structure,
escape provisions shall be incorporated in or on the structure.
With the prior approval of the reviewing agency identified in
§ 304-8C, a freestanding outlet structure may be exempted
from this requirement.
(b) Safety ledges shall be constructed on the slopes of all new
stormwater management basins having a permanent pool of
water deeper than 2 1/2 feet. Such safety ledges shall be
comprised of two steps. Each step shall be four to six feet in
width. One step shall be located approximately 2 1/2 feet below
the permanent water surface, and the second step shall be
located one to 1 1/2 feet above the permanent water surface.
See § 304-8D for an illustration of safety ledges in a
stormwater management basin.
(c) In new stormwater management basins, the maximum interior
slope for an earthen dam, embankment, or berm shall not be
steeper than three horizontal to one vertical.
C. Variance or exemption from safety standards. A variance or exemption
from the safety standards for stormwater management basins may be
granted only upon a written finding by the appropriate reviewing
agency (municipality, county or Department) that the variance or
exemption will not constitute a threat to public safety.

be necessary and shall prepare plans for drainage or for flood
control devices or plans to raise the level of land above the
floodplain, satisfactory to the City Engineer whenever the Planning
Board shall consider that such are necessary. No plat shall be

(2) Land subject to flooding and deemed to be topographically
unsuitable shall not be platted for residential occupancy, nor for
such other uses as may increase danger of health, life or property,

such uses as shall not be endangered by periodic or occasional
inundation or shall not produce unsatisfactory living conditions.

or flooding. All streets must be adequately located outside the
floodplain setback line.

1968, c. 285). Failure of the County Planning Board to submit a
report within the thirty-day review period shall be construed to
constitute approval.
(4) The Planning Board shall recommend preliminary approval to a
preliminary plat conditional upon changes, alterations or
§ 311-8 STORM SEWER SYSTEMS § 311-8
305:489
modifications. Any such changes, alterations or modifications as
required by the Planning Board shall be construed as disapproval

plat, the Planning Board shall recommend approval or disapproval
within 45 days of the date of submission or within such further time
as may be consented to by the developer. Otherwise, the Planning

67.Editor's Note: N.J.S.A. 46:23-9.7 to 46:23-9.16 were repealed by L.2011, c. 217, § 2,

§ 311-9 STORM SEWER SYSTEMS § 311-9
305:493
(b) Provision for a maintenance guarantee to be posted with City
Council for a period not to exceed two years after final
acceptance of the improvement, in an amount not to exceed
15% of the cost of the improvement. In the event that other
governmental agencies or public utilities automatically will
own the utilities to be installed or the improvements are
covered by a performance or maintenance guarantee to
another governmental agency, no performance or maintenance
guarantee, as the case may be, shall be required by the City for
such utilities or improvements.
(2) The amount of any performance guarantee may be reduced by City
Council, by resolution, when portions of the improvements have
been certified by the City Engineer to have been completed. The
time allowed for installation of the improvements for which the
performance guarantee has been provided may be extended by said
body by resolution.
(3) If the required improvements are not completed or corrected in
accordance with the performance guarantee, the obligor and
surety, if any, shall be liable thereon to the City for the reasonable
cost of the improvements not completed, and the City may, either
prior to or after the receipt of the proceeds thereof, complete such
improvements.
(4) When all of the required improvements have been completed, the
obligor shall notify City Council in writing, by certified or
registered mail addressed in care of the Municipal Clerk, of the
completion of said improvements and shall send a copy thereof to
the City Engineer. Thereupon the City Engineer shall inspect all of
the improvements and shall file a detailed report, in writing, with
City Council, indicating either approval, partial approval, or
rejection of the improvements with a statement of reasons for any
rejection. If partial approval is indicated, the cost of the
improvements rejected shall be set forth. [Amended 9-19-2017
by Ord. No. 17-20]
(5) City Council shall either approve, partially approve or reject the
improvements, on the basis of the report of the City Engineer, and

the contents of said report and the action of said approving
authority with relation thereto, not later than 60 days after receipt
of the notice from the obligor of the completion of the
improvements. Where partial approval is granted, the obligor shall
be released from all liability pursuant to its performance
guarantee, except for that portion adequately sufficient to secure
provision of the improvements not yet approved. Failure of City
Council to send or provide such notification to the obligor within 60
days shall be deemed to constitute approval of the improvements,
and the obligor and surety, if any, shall be released from all liability,
pursuant to such performance guarantee.
§ 311-9 BRIDGETON CODE § 311-9
305:494
(6) If any portion of the required improvements are rejected, the City
Council may require the obligor to complete such improvements
and, upon completion, the same procedure of notification, as set
forth in this section, shall be followed.
(7) The obligor shall reimburse the City for all reasonable inspection
fees paid to the City Engineer for the foregoing inspection of
improvements.
H. Recording of final approval.
(1) Final approval of a major subdivision shall expire 90 days from the
date of signing of the plat unless within such period the plat shall
have been duly filed by the developer with the County Recording
Officer. The City Council upon recommendation of the Planning
Board may for good cause shown extend the period for recording
for an additional period not to exceed 180 days from the date of the
signing of the plat.
(2) No plat shall be accepted for filing by the County Recording Officer
until it has been approved by the City Council as indicated on the
instrument by the signatures of the Planning Board Chairman, City
Engineer and President of City Council, or a certificate has been
issued pursuant to Subsection C(2) of this section.
I. Effect of final approval.
(1) After final approval of a plat has been duly recorded pursuant to
Subsection H above, the zoning requirements applicable to the
preliminary approval first granted and all other rights conferred
upon the developer pursuant to § 311-8G of this chapter, whether
conditionally or otherwise, shall not be changed for a period of two
years after the date of final approval. If the developer has followed
the standards prescribed for final approval, the City Council upon
recommendation by the Planning Board may extend such period of
protection for extensions of one year but not to exceed three
extensions. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter,
the granting of final approval terminates the time period of
preliminary approval pursuant to § 311-8 of this chapter.
(2) In the case of a planned unit development or planned residential
development or residential cluster development of 50 acres or
more or subdivision of 150 acres or more, the City Council may
grant the rights referred to in Subsection I(1) above for a
reasonable period of time, longer than two years, but not more than
four years, if mutually agreed upon. The developer may apply for
thereafter, and the City Council may thereafter grant, an extension
of final approval for an additional reasonable period of time
mutually agreed upon.

ARTICLE VII
Administration
§ 311-35. Enforcement.69
Inspection of actual construction under any approved subdivision plat shall
be the sole responsibility of the City, which may undertake any reasonable
measures to provide adequate inspection of all projects.
§ 311-36. Approval of subdivision required prior to sale of lot or
issuance of building permit.
No lot in a subdivision may be sold nor a building permit issued unless the
subdivision has been approved by the Planning Board and recorded by the
County Recording Officer.
§ 311-37. Compliance with other ordinances, regulations and
standards.
A. Chapter 370, Zoning. It is the intent of this chapter that regulations
contained herein conform to the applicable provisions of Chapter 370,
Zoning. If in effect there is no Zoning Ordinance as in the case of the
courts of the State of New Jersey invalidating the Zoning Ordinance or
an article, section or subsection thereof or the annexation to City of
lands adjacent to it, this chapter shall be amended to include such
standards and regulations as deemed necessary by the Planning Board
and City Council to assure that development within the City shall
conform to the duly adopted Master Plan.
B. Master Plan and Official Map. Where the Master Plan or the Official
Map provides for the reservation of designated streets, public
drainageways, flood control basins, and public areas within the
proposed subdivision, before approving a subdivision, the Planning
Board may further require that such streets, ways, basins or areas be
shown on the plat in locations and sizes suitable to their intended uses.
(1) The Planning Board may reserve the location and extent of such
streets, ways, basins or areas shown on the plat for a period of one
year after the approval of the final plat or within such further time
as may be agreed to by the developer.
(a) Unless during such period or extension thereof the City shall
have entered into a contract to purchase or institute
condemnation proceedings according to law for the fee or a
lesser interest in the land comprising such streets, ways,
basins or areas, the developer shall not be bound by such
reservations shown on the plat and may proceed to use such
land for private use in accordance with applicable development
regulations.
69.Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I).
§ 311-35 STORM SEWER SYSTEMS § 311-37
305:533
(b) This provision shall not apply to the streets and roads, flood
control basins or public drainageways necessitated by the
subdivision or development and required for final approval of
any plat.
(2) The developer shall be entitled to just compensation for actual loss
found to be caused by such temporary reservation and deprivation
of use. In such instance, just compensation shall be deemed to be
the fair market value of an option to purchase the land in question
for the period of reservation. Where the land in question or an
interest therein is acquired for public use, the developer shall be
compensated for the fair market value of the land or interest
therein, so taken or acquired, and for the reasonable cost of
engineering services incurred in connection with obtaining
subdivision approval as to such land.
C. State, county and/or regional development agency standards.
(1) Where there are state regulations governing development in
critical or floodplain areas and such regulations provide stricter
standards than this chapter or Chapter 370, Zoning; and/or where
the critical or floodplain area is more extensive than shown on the
City of Bridgeton Zoning Map, the state regulations shall apply as
though they were duly adopted and contained herein.
(2) Where state or county agencies or departments or a regional

(3) No approval pursuant to this chapter shall be required as a

condominium form of ownership.
A. Contribution for off-site water, sewer, drainage and street
improvements. The City Council may, by ordinance, adopt regulations
requiring a developer, as a condition for approval of a subdivision, to
pay his pro rata share of the cost of providing only reasonable and
necessary street improvements and water sewerage and drainage
facilities, and easements thereof, located outside the property limits of
the subdivision but necessitated or required by construction or
improvements within such subdivision.
(1) Such regulations shall be based on circulation and comprehensive
utility service plans as indicated by the Master Plan and the Official
Map; and shall establish fair and reasonable standards to
determine the proportionate or pro rata amount of the cost of such
facilities that shall be borne by each developer within a related and
common area, which standards shall not be altered subsequent to
preliminary plat approval.
(2) Where a developer pays the amount determined as his pro rata
share under protest, he shall institute legal action within one year
of such payment in order to preserve the right to a judicial
determination as to the fairness and reasonableness of such
amount.
B. Open space organization. Where, pursuant to § 311-27C of this chapter,
required open space is not dedicated to the City, an easement is not
provided or deed restrictions are not imposed on individual lots, the
Planning Board may require that an open space organization be
established for the ownership and maintenance of any open space for
the benefit of the residents of the development.
(1) Such organization shall enter into an agreement with City Council,
which agreement shall be in a form and contain provisions
acceptable to the City Council, except that such agreement shall
include the following provisions:
(a) Such organization shall not be dissolved and shall not dispose
of any open space, by sale or otherwise, except to an
organization conceived and established to own and maintain
the open space for the benefit of such development, and
thereafter such organization shall not be dissolved or dispose
of any of its open space without first offering to dedicate the
same to the City.
§ 311-37 STORM SEWER SYSTEMS § 311-38
305:535
(b) In the event that such organization shall fail to maintain the
open space in reasonable order and condition, the Planning
Board may serve written notice upon such organization or
upon the residents and owners of the development setting
forth the manner in which the organization has failed to
maintain the open space in reasonable condition, and said
notice shall include a demand that such deficiencies of
maintenance be cured within 30 days thereof, and shall state
the date and place of a hearing thereon which shall be held
within 15 days of the notice.
[1] At such hearing, the Planning Board may modify the terms
of the original notice as to deficiencies and may give a
reasonable extension of time, not to exceed 60 days, within
which they shall be cured.
[2] If the deficiencies set forth in the original notice or in the
modification thereof shall not be cured within said 30 days
or any permitted extension thereof, the City, in order to
preserve the open space and maintain the same for a
period of one year, may enter upon and maintain such
land. Said entry and maintenance shall not vest in the
public any rights to use the open space except when the
same is voluntarily dedicated to the public by the residents
and owners.
[3] Before the expiration of said year, the Planning Board
shall, upon its initiative or upon the request of the
organization theretofore responsible for the maintenance
of the open space, call a public hearing upon 15 days'
written notice to such organization and to the residents
and owners of the development, to be held by the Planning
Board, at which hearing such organization and the
residents and owners of the development shall show cause
why such maintenance by the City shall not, at the election
of City Council, continue for a succeeding year.
[4] If the Planning Board shall determine that such
organization is ready and able to maintain such open space
in reasonable condition, the municipality shall cease to
maintain said open space at the end of said year.
[5] If the Planning Board shall determine such organization is
not ready and able to maintain said open space in a
reasonable condition, City Council may, in its discretion,
continue to maintain said open space during the next
succeeding year, subject to a similar hearing and
determination in each year thereafter.

305:536
§ 311-39. Deviations from compliance to subdivision regulations.
[6] The decision of the Planning Board in any such case shall
constitute final administrative decision subject to judicial
review.
(c) The cost of such maintenance by the City shall be assessed
ratably against the properties within the development that
have a right of enjoyment of the open space and shall become a
lien and tax on said properties and be added to and be a part of
the taxes to be levied and assessed thereon, and enforced and
collected with interest by the same officers and in the same
manner as other taxes.
C. Phased development completion. The subdivider or developer may
submit a final plat which proposes construction over a period of years
contingent upon approval by the Planning Board and upon written
agreement with City Council. Such agreement shall:
(1) Be in a form acceptable to the City Solicitor.
(2) Be accompanied by both performance and maintenance guarantees
in the form prescribed by the City Solicitor.
(a) Guarantees provided for the first and subsequent phases shall
be in force until the completion of the final phase and for as
long thereafter as agreed upon by the developer and City
Council.
(b) No street or other improvement will be accepted by the City for
dedication until after completion of the final phase.
(3) Include a complete schedule of all work to be accomplished during
each phase.
(4) Include clauses which will ensure the protection of the interests of
the public and of the residents and owners of the proposed
development in the total completion of the development.
A. Deviation from final development plan. The subdivision or land
development shall be developed in substantial accordance with the final
plat; provided that the Planning Board, after public hearing, may permit
a deviation from the final plat if caused by substantial change of
conditions beyond the control of the developer since the date of final
approval, and the deviation would not substantially alter the character
of the development or substantially impair the intent and purpose of the
Master Plan and Zoning Ordinance.
B. Planned developments. The Planning Board may accept and review
tentative and final development plans for planned unit developments,
planned unit residential developments, residential cluster
developments, planned commercial developments and planned

Planning Board approval, the developer shall request a
preapplication consultation with the Planning Board and shall
conform to the requirements of § 311-6 of this chapter.
(a) At the preapplication consultation, the Planning Board shall
advise the developer as to the manner in which the provisions
for planned developments specified in Chapter 370, Zoning,
differ from the standards otherwise applicable to subdivision
as prescribed by this chapter.
(b) At the preapplication consultation, the developer shall present
sufficient plans and details for the Planning Board to determine
that a planned development would be a more appropriate type
of development for the site than a standard subdivision.
(2) Approval of a tentative plan for a planned development shall have
the same force and effect as the approval of a preliminary plat for a
standard subdivision and shall confer on the developer the same
rights.
(3) Approval of a final development plan for a planned development
shall have the same force and effect as the approval of a final plat
for a standard subdivision, and shall confer on the developer the
same rights, and shall be the instrument of filing of record with the
County Recording Officer.
(4) Prior to approval of such planned developments, the Planning
Board shall find the following facts and conclusions:
(a) That departures by the proposed development from zoning
regulations otherwise applicable to the subject property
conform to the standards set forth in Chapter 370, Zoning;
(b) That the proposals for maintenance and conservation of the
common open space, and the adequacy of the amount, location
and purpose of the common open space, are reliable and
adequate;
(c) That provision through the physical design of the proposed
development adequately provides for public services, control
over vehicular and pedestrian traffic, and the amenities of light
and air, recreation and visual enjoyment are adequate;
(d) That the proposed planned development will not have an
unreasonably adverse effect or input upon the area in which it
is proposed to be established; and
(e) In the case of a proposed development which proposes
construction over a period of years, that the terms and

conditions intended to protect the interests of the public and of
the residents and owners of the proposed development in the
total completion of the development are adequate.
C. Exemption of certain facilities of public utilities. This chapter or
regulation made under authority thereof shall not apply to land or
structures used or to be used by public utilities in furnishing light, heat,
power or communication service if, upon a petition of the public utility,
the Board of Public Utility Commissioners, after a public hearing,
decides that the present or proposed situation of the proposed use of
the land or structures in question is reasonably necessary for the
service, convenience or welfare of the public and conforms insofar as
possible with the state development plan and County and City Master
Plans.
(1) The City, the County Planning Board and the Division of State and
Regional Planning shall have personal notice of such hearing as
provided in § 311-43 of this chapter and shall be afforded the
opportunity to be heard at such hearing.
(2) If a party in interest is aggrieved by the action of a City, county or
state agency through said agency's exercise of its powers under
this chapter with respect to any action in which the public utility
has an interest, an appeal to the Board of State Public Utility
Commissioners of the State of New Jersey may be taken within 30
days after such action without appeal to the City Council pursuant
to this chapter unless the party in interest so chooses.
(a) In such case appeal to the Public Utility Commissioners may be
taken within 30 days after action by the City Council.
(3) A hearing on the appeal of a public utility to the Public Utility
Commissioners shall be had on notice to the agency from which the
appeal is taken and to all parties primarily concerned, all of whom
shall be afforded an opportunity to be heard.
(4) If, after such hearing, the Board of Public Utility Commissioners
shall find that the present or proposed use by the public utility of
the land described in the petition is necessary for the service,
convenience or welfare of the public, the public utility may proceed
in accordance with such decision of the Board of Public Utility
Commissioners, any regulation made under the authority of this
chapter notwithstanding.
(5) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to restrict the right of
any interested person to obtain a review of the action of the
Planning Board or of the Board of Public Utility Commissioners by
any court of competent jurisdiction according to law.

ARTICLE II
Stopping, Standing and Parking
§ 350-7. Parking regulations not exclusive.
The provisions of this chapter imposing a time limit on parking shall not
relieve any person of the duty to observe other, more restrictive provisions
prohibiting or limiting the stopping or standing or parking of vehicles as set
forth in N.J.S.A. 39:4-138, any other New Jersey statute or as hereinafter
provided.
§ 350-8. Parking near public or private driveways or alleys.
Except when necessary to avoid conflict with other traffic or compliance
with the directions of a traffic or police officer or traffic sign or signal, no
operator of a vehicle shall stand or park a vehicle within five feet of the
nearest public or private driveway or alley. A violation of this section will be
considered a violation of LO10.
§ 350-9. Parking prohibited during state of emergency.
§ 350-10. Temporary parking prohibition for snowplowing and
removal.
A. Upon the declaration of an emergency, there shall be no parking upon
the streets where temporary EMERGENCY NO PARKING signs are
displayed. The Chief of Police or, in his absence, the ranking police
officer is authorized to declare an emergency and to direct the posting
of EMERGENCY NO PARKING signs when weather conditions,
accidents, road construction, fire or public celebrations dictate or
require avoidance of hazards or other conditions which interfere with
the free flow of traffic. Notification that EMERGENCY NO PARKING
signs are being or will be posted shall be given to the operator or owner
of any vehicle which has been parked prior to the posting of the signs.
B. The effectiveness of this section is contingent upon the signs being
erected as required by law.
A. Whenever snow has fallen and the accumulation is such that it covers
the streets and highways, an emergency shall exist, and no vehicle shall
be parked on the streets or highways or portions thereof indicated
below:
Name of Street Side Location
(Reserved)
B. The above parking prohibitions shall remain in effect after the snow has
ceased until the streets have been plowed sufficiently and to the extent
that parking will not interfere with the normal flow of traffic.
§ 350-7 VEHICLES, ABANDONED § 350-10
347:603
§ 350-11. Stopping or standing prohibited.
C. Any unoccupied vehicle parked or standing in violation of this section
shall be deemed a nuisance and a menace to the safe and proper
regulation of traffic, and any police officer may provide for the removal
of such vehicle. The owner shall pay the reasonable costs of removal
and storage which may result from such removal before regaining
possession of the vehicle.
A. No person shall stop, stand, or park a vehicle in any manner that
obstructs the normal flow of traffic. A violation of this section will be
considered a violation of LO9.
B. No person shall stop, stand or park a vehicle between the hours
specified on any day upon any of the streets or parts of streets

ARTICLE IX
Traffic Controls for Street and Highway Construction and
Maintenance Operations
§ 350-50. Adoption of Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices
for Streets and Highways.
The City Council finds and declares that problems of traffic control occur
when traffic must be moved through or around street construction,
maintenance operations and utility work, above or below the ground, which
requires blocking the street and obstructing the normal flow of traffic, and
that such obstructions are or can become dangerous when not properly
controlled. In order to better promote the public health, safety, peace and
welfare, it is necessary to establish controls and regulations directed to
secure the safe and expeditious movement of traffic through and around
construction and maintenance zones and to provide safety for the work
forces performing these operations. The City Council does hereby adopt
the current Manual on Uniform Control Devices for Streets and Highways
hereafter known as the "MUTCD," except as hereby supplemented and
amended, as it controls and regulates whenever construction, maintenance
operations or utility work obstructs the normal flow of traffic. Any person,
contractor or utility who fails to comply with the provisions of the MUTCD
while performing such work is in violation of this article.
§ 350-51. Preconstruction meetings.
It shall be the responsibility of the person, contractor or utility (in the
case of a public utility as required under the public utility agreement,
Section 16:25-9.2) wishing to conduct work on, under or above the street
to contact the Police Department of the municipality in order to arrange a
preconstruction meeting in order to submit plans for the safe movement of
traffic during such period of construction or work. Any person, contractor or
utility who fails to comply with this section prior to the start of such work or
whose plans are not approved by the Police Department of the municipality
is in violation of this article.
§ 350-52. Emergencies and hazardous conditions.
The person, contractor or utility shall provide at least two emergency
contact telephone numbers to be called in case of emergency problems at
the construction or maintenance site prior to the start of any work. If, for
any reason, emergency contact cannot be made, or if the emergency contact
person does not respond to a call from the Police Department to correct
such hazardous condition, the municipality may respond to correct the
hazardous condition(s). The reasonable fees for such emergency services
by the municipality shall be charged to the person, contractor or utility
responsible for the condition.
§ 350-50 VEHICLES, ABANDONED § 350-53
347:669
§ 350-53. Hours of operation; exceptions.
There shall be no construction, maintenance operations or utility work
on any roadway in the municipality before the hour of 9:00 a.m. or after
4:00 p.m. This time limit may be adjusted by the officer in charge of the
municipal Police Department to permit work prior to 9:00 a.m. or after
4:00 p.m. If it is determined by the officer in charge that the construction
or maintenance operations prior to 9:00 a.m. or after 4:00 p.m. would
substantially delay traffic or cause a safety or health hazard, the work shall
then be permitted only between 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.
§ 350-54. Road closings or detours.
Road closings and/or traffic detours shall not be permitted unless approved
by the municipal Police Department.
§ 350-55. Traffic directors.
Traffic directors shall be posted at all construction or maintenance sites
when determined by the municipal Police Department that they are
necessary to provide for the safe and expeditious movement of traffic.

A. Specific intent. It is the specific intent of the PMU-1 Planned Mixed-Use
District to provide the opportunity for planned residential
neighborhoods that include a variety of housing types and subsidiary
commercial and professional office uses as set forth below. The
objectives of the PMU-1 regulations and standards are to encourage
innovative development to achieve a variety of building types, layout
and siting under a comprehensive plan of development. The PMU-1
encourages comprehensive planning for large tracts of land within the
context of the City and the region, as it permits flexibility in the mix of
uses, but provides standards to ensure integrated building design,
quality architecture, efficient circulation, protection of natural
resources and an attractive pedestrian environment. Such design
standards will have a beneficial effect upon the health, safety, general
welfare and morals of the City and neighboring communities consistent
with smart growth and sustainable development concepts and
principles. For parcels not developed in accordance with the Planned
Mixed-Use Overlay District, the underlying zoning district regulations
shall apply.

spaces and other structures should be designed to relate to one
another, both functionally and visually. Features such as
courtyards, greens, quadrangles, pedestrian and bicycle
pathways, which encourage pedestrian activity and incidental
social interaction among users, shall be incorporated into the
site design. The site should be designed to reinforce street
frontages, and main entryways should be emphasized to create
a sense of identity with special landscape features and
appropriately scaled signage and architectural accents.
(b) Buildings shall define the streetscape through the use of detail,
building articulation and massing. The streetscape shall be

intervals but not greater than 100 feet on center.
(d) Lighting on residential streets and within parking areas should
be no greater than 200 feet apart per side and should be
located at the intersections and corners. Lighting standards
shall be consistent throughout the development. If individual
lampposts equipped with photo sensors are provided at each
driveway, the need for streetlights between intersections may
be eliminated.
(e) Residential porch, patio, or balcony lighting and yard post
lighting is encouraged to augment street lighting design and to
create a sense of safety and community.
(f) Light fixtures attached to the exterior of a building shall be

(b) Signs affixed to the exterior of a building shall be
architecturally compatible with the style, composition,
materials, colors, and details of the building, as well as with
other signs used on the building or in its vicinity. The use of
coordinated awnings and decorative light fixtures is
encouraged.
(c) Signs shall fit within the existing facade features and shall not
interfere with door and window openings, conceal
architectural details or obscure the composition of the facade
where they are located.
(d) Sign colors should be compatible with the colors of the
building facade. A dull or matte finish is recommended for
reduction of glare and enhancement of legibility.
(e) Signs shall be either spotlighted or backlit with a diffused light
source. Light shall not significantly spill over to other portions
of the building or site. Backlighting shall illuminate the letters,
characters, or graphics on the sign, but not its background.

the preservation, rehabilitation, restoration or reconstruction of an historic
resource will have and how it will impact the applicant's ability to use
the property. Demonstration that meeting these criteria is not practical

materials and features rather than extensive replacement and new
construction. New exterior additions are not within the scope of this

mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems, and other code-required
work to make properties functional is appropriate within a preservation
activity.
RECONSTRUCTION 
REHABILITATION  In general, the repair, renovation, alteration or
reconstruction of any building or structure in accordance with the New
Jersey Uniform Construction Code. As applied to historic structures,
rehabilitation work preserves or restores, or takes into account those
proportions or features which convey its historical, cultural or architectural
values of a structure or on which its integrity as an historic structure relies.

materials (or with materials that satisfactorily simulate the appearance of
the original) in order to substitute for a feature that has been deteriorated

a new certificate of occupancy is required before the work area can be
reoccupied. Reconstruction may include repair, renovation, alteration
or any combination thereof. Reconstruction shall not include projects
which comprise only floor finish replacement, painting or wallpapering,
or the replacement of equipment or finishings. Asbestos hazard
abatement and lead hazard abatement projects shall not be classified
as reconstruction solely because occupancy of the work area is not
permitted.
A.
As specifically applied to historic sites and structures, reconstruction
shall also mean the act or process of depicting or reconstructing by
means of new construction the form, features and detailing of a
nonsurviving site, landscape, building, structure or object, or a site that
has otherwise lost its historic integrity, for the purpose of replicating its
appearance at a specific period of time and/or in its historic location.

RESTORATION  The act or process of accurately depicting the form,
features, and character of an historic property as it appeared at a particular
period of time by means of the removal of features inappropriate to that

limited and sensitive upgrading of mechanical, electrical and plumbing
systems and other code-required work to make properties functional is
appropriate within the scope of restoration activities.
SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR'S STANDARDS  The publication issued
by the United States Department of the Interior, National Park Service,
entitled: "The Secretary of the Interior's Standards for the Treatment of
Historic Properties as the Guidelines for Preserving, Rehabilitating,
Restoring and Reconstructing Historic Buildings," issued in 1995 and
revised from time to time.
SITE  Any place where a significant event or pattern of events occurred. A
site may also be the location of a ruined building, structure, or object if the
location itself, and/or the objects found therein, possess historic, cultural,
or archaeological significance. Both primary and accessory buildings and
structures may be included as or within sites. Besides including structures
and improvements, a site may be the location of prehistoric or historic
occupations or activities that may be marked by physical remains; or a site
may be a place designated as the symbolic focus of a significant event or
pattern of events.
STREETSCAPE  The overall visual character of the street, including,
but not limited to, the architecture and architectural character, building
rhythms, setbacks and height, fences, and storefronts. The character of
a streetscape is also affected by signs, lighting, parking areas, materials,

been proposed for historic district designation, that the
property is under consideration for such designation and the
reasons therefor;
(b) Advise the owner(s) of record of the significance,
consequences and rights to contest such designation;
(c) Advise the owner(s) of record of the date, time and location of
the hearing;
(d) Serve any further notices as may be required under the
provisions of the MLUL;
(e) Cause public notice of the hearing to be published in the
official newspaper of the City;
(f) Assure that a copy of the nomination report is made available
for public inspection in the municipal offices of the Municipal
Clerk. [Amended 9-19-2017 by Ord. No. 17-20]
(3) At the public hearing, the Commission shall review the nomination
report and accompanying documents. Interested parties shall be
given the opportunity to be heard and to comment on the proposed
nomination for designation.
(4) If the proposed nomination is approved by the Commission, then
the Commission shall forward a report concerning the proposed
historic landmark, historic landmark site or historic district to the
City Council, which shall contain a statement and reasons for the
Commission's recommendations. The City Council shall then
consider whether to adopt or reject the proposed historic
designation(s). If adopted, the corresponding landmark, site, or
district shall then be subject to those procedures and statutes
which apply to a change of a zoning designation and the adoption,
revision or amendment of any development regulation.
(5) All other requirements of the MLUL regarding adoption of
development regulations shall be followed.
(6) Upon adoption of an ordinance by the City Council designating an
historic landmark, historic landmark site or an historic district, the
designation shall supplement rather than supersede the existing
zoning district in which the affected historic landmark, historic
landmark site or historic district is located. At that time, the
designation list and map shall be incorporated into the Bridgeton
City Master Plan and Zoning Ordinance as required by the MLUL.
(7) Designated properties shall also be noted as such on the records
for those properties maintained by the approving authority, City

§ 370-31. Design review of demolition, relocation, alteration and
new construction; certificate of appropriateness.
Construction Official, the City Tax Assessor and the Municipal
Clerk. [Amended 9-19-2017 by Ord. No. 17-20]
D. Amendments. Amendments to historic landmark, historic landmark site
or historic district designations may be made in the same manner as
they were adopted in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
A. Certificate of appropriateness.
(1) When required. A certificate of appropriateness shall be required
before any work is commenced on any historic landmark, any
historic landmark site or improvement within an historic district,
whether or not a permit is required for such work, including but not
limited to the following:
(a) Changing the exterior appearance of any building, structure,
site, object or improvement by addition, reconstruction,
alteration or replacement, including the replacement of
windows and doors, except for the activities described by
Subsection A(2) below.
(b) Demolition of any building, structure, site, object or
improvement.
(c) Relocation of a principal or accessory building, structure,
object or improvement.
(d) Any addition to or new construction of a principal or accessory
building, structure, object or improvement.
(e) Painting or repainting the exterior surfaces, with exception as
described in Subsection A(2) below.
(2) When not required. A certificate of appropriateness shall not be
required:
(a) Before a permit is issued by the Zoning Officer for changes to
the interior of a structure, unless that interior has been
specifically landmarked in its own right, or if the interior
change will affect the appearance of the exterior of the
building.
(b) For any strictly in-kind repair or exact replacement of any
existing improvement.
(c) For repainting in the existing color or color palette, if this was
previously approved by the Commission. If this was not
previously approved, a certificate of appropriateness shall be
required. In the event that the color or exterior surface
material of the improvement shall be changed as a result of
§ 370-30 BRIDGETON CODE § 370-31
347:784
such repainting, repair or exact replacement, a certificate of
appropriateness shall be required, as in Subsection A(1)(a)
above.
(d) For work contemplated that, in the opinion of the Commission
(or the Administrative Officer acting in its behalf), constitutes
"ordinary maintenance and repair" as defined by this chapter.
In such cases, if a permit is required for the proposed work, the
Commission or Administrative Officer shall promptly notify the
Zoning Officer that a certificate of appropriateness is not
required as a prerequisite to the issuance of a permit, and has
been waived.
(3) Application procedures.
(a) Except for the circumstances described in § 370-31A(2)(a) and
(b) above, no work shall be performed on any historic
landmark, historic landmark site or on any building, structure,
object, site or improvement located within an historic district
until either a certificate of appropriateness has been issued by
the Commission's Administrative Officer, or if forwarded to the
Commission for determination, until the Commission has either
approved such work or determined that no certificate of
appropriateness is necessary because the proposed work
constitutes "ordinary maintenance and repair" pursuant to this
chapter.
(b) All applicants shall complete and submit a preapplication form
for a certificate of appropriateness, as adopted by the Historic
District Commission, not less than 10 calendar days before a
regularly scheduled meeting of the Commission. The
Administrative Officer may waive this time requirement if, in
his judgment, the application is of an emergent nature. The
Administrative Officer shall in all cases be responsible for
receiving and processing the preapplication form and assuring
that it is accompanied by the necessary supporting documents.
The Administrative Office shall review the preapplication form
and documents and classify the application in accordance with
the scope of work for which approval is being sought.
[1] If the action for which the certificate of appropriateness is
requested will substantially affect those characteristics of
the district listed on the district's landmark designation,
the Administrative Officer shall classify the application as
a major application, and be guided by the process as set
forth in § 370-31A(5).
[2] If the action for which the certificate of appropriateness is
requested will not substantially affect the building,
structure or district as stated in § 370-31A(3)(b)[1] above,
then the Administrative Officer shall classify the
§ 370-31 VEHICLES, ABANDONED § 370-31
347:785
application as a minor application, and be guided by the
process as set forth in § 370-31A(4).
(4) Process for minor applications.
(a) Minor applications may be heard and decided by the
Administrative Officer as soon as they are classified as such
and the Administrative Officer has determined that the
supporting documentation is complete. If the Administrative
Officer judges the minor application to be of sufficient
complexity or uncertainty in its effect, however, the
Administrative Officer may pass it on to the Commission for
evaluation and review at the next regularly scheduled meeting.
(b) The Administrative Officer shall maintain a brief, running
inventory of the applications adjudged to be minor that have
received certificates of appropriateness during the interval
between Commission meetings, and provide this to the
Commission Chair before each regular meeting.
(c) The Administrative Officer shall also determine whether or not
an adjacent property may be affected by the proposed
undertaking, even if the undertaking is judged to be minor. If
so, the Administrative Officer may order, as a condition of final
approval, that the applicant send notice of the Commission's or
Administrative Officer's actions to such owners of adjacent
properties, by certified mail with return receipt. The adjacent
property owners will then have 30 calendar days from the date
of receipt to file a written objection with the Administrative
Officer.
(d) If no objections are received, the approval of the minor
application shall be deemed final. If written objection is
received, the Administrative Officer shall refer the matter to
the Commission for its consideration or reconsideration and
decision at the next regularly-scheduled meeting. Any objector
will have full rights to present evidence and to cross-examine
witnesses or the applicant. The Commission shall hear and
decide any objection within 45 calendar days of its receipt by
the Administrative Officer.
(5) Process for major applications.
(a) Major applications shall be heard and decided by the
Commission within 45 calendar days following the
determination of the application deemed administratively
complete by the Administrative Officer, or any extension of
time that has been mutually agreed upon by both the applicant
and the Commission.
(b) In addition to those items required to be submitted as a part of
a complete application, if the application is deemed by the
§ 370-31 BRIDGETON CODE § 370-31
347:786
Administrative Officer to be of sufficient impact on
surrounding properties, the applicant shall also submit:
[1] A copy of the certified list of property owners within 200
feet of the subject property, as issued by the City Tax
Assessor, and a certificate that all such property owners
have been sent a certified return mail notice of the
application not less than 10 calendar days prior to the
hearing on the application.
[2] Proof of publication of the legal notice that appeared in the
officially designated newspaper of record at least 10
calendar days prior to the hearing on the application.
(c) The Historic District Commission may advise the applicant and
make recommendations in regard to the appropriateness of the
proposed action and may grant approval upon such conditions
as it deems appropriate within the intent, purposes and
standards of this chapter and as may be contained in the "The
Secretary of the Interior's Standards for the Treatment of
Historic Properties as the Guidelines for Preserving,
Rehabilitating, Restoring and Reconstructing Historic
Buildings."
(d) Should final action on an application not take place within the
prescribed or agreed-upon time frame, the application shall be
deemed to have been approved.
(e) The Commission may require the submission by the applicant
of such additional materials as it reasonably requires in order
to make an informed decision; absent those materials, the
Commission may judge the application to be incomplete, and
carry over the application to the next meeting or next mutually
agreed-upon date without affecting the prescribed forty-fiveday
period for a decision.
(f) The Commission shall clearly set forth its decision with its
findings of fact and conclusions in reference to the particular
application.
(g) If an application is approved, the Historic Preservation
Commission shall grant the issuance of a certificate of
appropriateness and, through the Administrative Officer,
provide the same to the applicant along with a certified copy of
the resolution.
(h) In any instance where the Commission disapproves an
application, the Commission, through the Administrative
Officer, shall notify the applicant with a certified copy of the
resolution of that determination. A summary of the
Commission's action, with the full language of the resolution,
§ 370-31 VEHICLES, ABANDONED § 370-31
347:787
shall be published in the official minutes of the Commission,
and be made available on request.
(i) In the case of a major application, where the Commission is
persuaded by visual evidence, its own or the applicant's, that
the proposed addition, removal or alteration is not sufficiently
visible from any viewing-point normally accessible to the
public to adversely impact the historic viewscape, the
Commission may by majority vote of the full authorized
membership grant a certificate of appropriateness on that
basis.
(j) In the case of the Commission granting an applicant approval,
approval with conditions or denial, a summary of the
Commission's action shall be published in the official
newspaper of record.
(6) Requirements for a complete major application.
(a) An application for a certificate of appropriateness, or for a
determination of nonnecessity of a certificate of
appropriateness, shall be accompanied by appropriate
sketches, drawings, photographs, descriptions or other
information as required by the Administrative Officer or the
Commission, or as specified in the application checklist. The
information should include existing or prior conditions
proposed to be altered, projected future appearance of the
structure or site after alterations, additions, changes or new
construction are complete. Wherever possible, the application
shall include both historical and contemporary photographs of
the exterior of the landmarked site or structure.
(b) An application for demolition shall include historical and
contemporary photographs of the exterior and interior of the
building or structure in question, if possible.
(7) Form of recommendations issued for major or minor applications
that come before the Commission.
(a) The Commission shall recommend to the Administrative
Officer either the approval, approval with conditions or denial
of the application for a certificate of appropriateness.
(b) The Commission shall explain in writing the reasons for its
recommendation, and otherwise provide information sufficient
to instruct the Administrative Officer on how to guide the
applicant in meeting the expectations of the Commission's
recommendations. The explanation shall focus the effect of the
proposed undertaking on the landmark's historic and/or
architectural significance as set forth in the criteria of this
chapter.
§ 370-31 BRIDGETON CODE § 370-31
347:788
(c) The Administrative Officer shall follow the recommendations of
the Commission.
(8) Length of validity of a certificate of appropriateness.
(a) A certificate of appropriateness shall be valid for a period of
two calendar years from the date it is issued by the
Commission's Administrative Officer.
B. Applications for demolition.
(1) The Commission shall first consider whether preservation of the
historic landmark in place is feasible or, failing that option, whether
preservation of the historic landmark at another location is feasible
and practical. In determining whether preservation of the historic
landmark in place is feasible, the following factors shall be
considered:
(a) Its importance to the municipality and the extent to which its
historical or architectural value is such that its removal would
be detrimental to the public interest.
(b) Its status with regard to the New Jersey and National Registers
of Historic Places; i.e., whether it is individually listed or
eligible to be listed; whether it is a part of a registered or
eligible historic district, and whether, within that district, it is a
key, contributing or noncontributing building.
(c) The extent to which it is of such old, unusual or uncommon
design, craftsmanship, texture or material that it could not be
reproduced or could be reproduced only with difficulty.
(d) The extent to which its retention would promote the general
welfare by maintaining and increasing real estate values,
generating business, creating new jobs, attracting tourists,
students, writers, historians, artists and artisans, attracting
new residents, encouraging study and interest in studying
architecture and design, educating citizens in American
culture and heritage or making the municipality a more
attractive and desirable place in which to live.
(e) The probable impact of its removal upon the ambience of the
historic district, if it is within an historic district.
(f) Whether the site contains any extant archaeological resources.
(g) Whether the historic landmark represents the last or best
remaining example of its kind in the City that possesses
research potential or public education values.
(h) Whether the historic landmark can be preserved by protecting
its location from disturbance.
§ 370-31 VEHICLES, ABANDONED § 370-31
347:789
(i) Whether redesign of the development proposal to avoid impact
can result in the preservation of the building or structure in
question.
(j) The historic, architectural, aesthetic and social significance of
the structure or building and/or importance and uniqueness to
the City and the extant archaeological resources.
(k) Whether protective measures will result in the long-term
preservation of the historic landmark.
(l) Whether the steps necessary to preserve the historic landmark
are feasible and practical.
(2) In the event that the Commission determines that preventing
demolition is not feasible and recommends that the demolition of a
listed or contributing historic landmark be approved, the following
steps shall be taken:
(a) The applicant shall be responsible for preparing and
submitting to the Commission a completed set of drawings and
photographs of the historic landmark that meet the standard
established by the Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS),
as administered through the United States Department of the
Interior. The photographs are to be taken by a professional
photographer, shall be eight-inch-by-ten-inch black and white
prints made on archival quality photographic paper and be
taken from large format (four-inch-by-five-inch minimum size)
negatives.
(b) The drawings and photographs shall be submitted to the
Commission for review and acceptance. Prior to the
municipality issuing the formal certificate authorizing the
demolition, the applicant shall have submitted two sets of
drawing prints and one set of reproducible Mylar prints; and
two sets of eight-inch-by-ten-inch black and white
photographic prints and the large-format negatives from which
the prints were made.
(c) These requirements may be waived by the Historic District
Commission if the demolition involves a noncontributing
building or structure within a designated historic district.
(3) In the event that the Commission recommends denial of an
application for a certificate of appropriateness to demolish an
historic landmark or a building, structure, site, object or
improvement located in an historic district, the owner shall be
entitled to raze or demolish the same, provided that all of the
following requirements have been fully met prior to the formal
demolition permit being issued by the City:
§ 370-31 BRIDGETON CODE § 370-31
347:790
(a) Appeal to the New Jersey State Superior Court. The owner has
applied for the necessary certificate of appropriateness and
has received notice of the denial of same from the
Administrative Officer and has appealed to the New Jersey
State Superior Court.
(b) If the New Jersey State Superior Court overturns the denial
issued by the Administrative Officer, then the applicant will be
responsible for completing the documentation components
stipulated in § 370-31B(2) above prior to the formal demolition
permit being issued by the City.
(c) Attempt at sale for fair market value. The owner presents
evidence that prior to seeking demolition for a period of at
least 365 days thereafter (the "offer period"), and at a price
reasonably related to its fair market value, made a bona fide
offer to sell such building, structure, site, object or
improvement and the land pertaining thereto to any person,
entity, organization, government or political subdivision
thereof which gives reasonable assurance that it is willing to
preserve the building, structure, site, object or improvement
and the land pertaining thereto. This offer period may have a
start date that is before or after the application to demolish,
but the date must be documented.
(d) Demolition notice posted and publication. The owner has
caused a notice of any proposed demolition, clearly readable
by the public, to be posted on the exterior premises of the
building, structure, site, object or improvement throughout the
notice period. The actual size and location of the notice sign
shall be determined jointly by the Commission and the
applicant at a public meeting on the application.
(e) In addition, the applicant shall publish a notice in the officially
designated newspaper of the City setting forth the following:
[1] The applicant's intent to demolish, including a description
of the subject property by block and lot number, as well as
by physical location, and a brief written description of the
building, structure, site, object or improvement to be
demolished, using its common or well-known name, if it
has one; and
[2] The applicant's proposed use of the property following
demolition; and
[3] The proposed time frame(s) associated with the
demolition; and
[4] A statement indicating the applicant's willingness to
consider any and all bona fide offers to sell the property to
§ 370-31 VEHICLES, ABANDONED § 370-31
347:791
any person who wishes to preserve the building, structure,
site, object or improvement; and
[5] The owner's name, address, and telephone number where
the owner may be reached during normal business hours
by any interested person who wishes to discuss the
proposed demolition and/or make an offer to purchase the
property as set forth above.
(f) The notice shall be published as follows:
[1] At least once within the first 10 days of the notice period;
and
[2] At least once within the period of time that is not less than
10 nor more than 15 days prior to the expiration of the
notice period; and
[3] At least once each 20 days between the above first and last
notifications.
(g) At the conclusion of the notice period, if the applicant still
wishes to demolish the subject building, structure, site, object
or improvement, it shall, prior to performing the demolition,
perform the following:
[1] Advise the Commission in writing, by certified return mail,
of its intention to proceed with the demolition; and
[2] Certify in writing to its compliance with the provisions of
§ 370-31B(2) and (3)(b), relating to photographic and
drawing documentation and to the three-hundred-sixtyfive-
day offer period, respectively; and
[3] Provide the Commission with a copy of the notices that
appeared in the officially designated newspaper(s) of the
City and a listing of all of the dates on which the said
notice(s) appeared in the newspaper(s); and
[4] Advise the Commission in writing as to whether any
interested persons submitted an offer or offers to purchase
the property, whether during the three-hundred-sixty-fiveday
offer period or following the newspaper notices
referenced above, and set forth the terms and conditions
relating to said offer(s) and the results of any negotiations
pertaining thereto; and
[5] File copies of the affidavits of publications relating to all
newspaper notices with the Commission.
(h) Notice period. The period of time during which the notice must
be given in the manner set forth shall be known as the "notice
period," which shall commence on the 10th day following the
§ 370-31 BRIDGETON CODE § 370-31
347:792
date of the notice of denial of the appeal from the New Jersey
State Superior Court, and such notice period shall run for a
period of time of 60 days.
(4) Assignment. The rights granted by a certificate of appropriateness
to demolish a building or structure cannot be reassigned.
(5) Expiration of approval.
(a) In cases where demolition is approved, the certificate of
appropriateness shall be valid for one year from the date of the
Commission approval of the application. The one-year approval
shall not be extended.
(b) At the time of issuance of the certificate of appropriateness to
demolish, the Zoning Officer shall designate the period of time,
within the one-year approval period, within which demolition
must be completed.
(6) Approval after change of circumstances. If, at any time during the
notice period, a significant change in circumstances occurs that
can be shown beyond reasonable doubt to demand immediate
action to protect the health and safety of the public, the
Commission may be called upon to approve a certificate of
appropriateness to demolish, in which event, a permit from the
Construction Official shall be issued within 10 business days
thereafter.
C. Removal of an historic landmark out of the municipality.
(1) In regard to an application to move an historic landmark within an
historic district or an individually designated historic landmark to a
location outside the City, the following matters shall be considered,
in addition to the criteria set forth in § 370-31B:
(a) Whether the historic landmark can be relocated and still retain
its historic significance.
(b) Whether the historic landmark is sufficiently well preserved
and structurally stable to sustain the relocation.
(c) Whether alternative locations that are compatible with the
historic landmark are available.
(d) Whether it is feasible and practical to relocate the historic
landmark.
(e) Whether the relocation will result in the long-term
preservation of the historic landmark.
(f) The rationale for not retaining the historic landmark at its
present location and the probable impact of its removal upon
the ambience of the historic district.
§ 370-31 VEHICLES, ABANDONED § 370-31
347:793
D. Removal of an historic landmark to another location within the City.
(1) The following matters shall be considered in addition to the criteria
listed in § 370-31B when moving an individually designated historic
landmark or any building or structure in an historic district to a
new location within the City:
(a) Whether the historic landmark can be relocated and still retain
its historic significance.
(b) Whether the historic landmark is sufficiently well preserved
and structurally stable to sustain the relocation.
(c) Whether alternative locations that are compatible with the
historic landmark are available.
(d) Whether it is feasible and practical to relocate the historic
landmark.
(e) Whether the relocation will result in the long-term
preservation of the historic landmark.
(f) The rationale for not retaining the historic landmark at its
present location and the probable impact of its removal upon
the ambience of the historic district. Consideration must be
given to the site where the building or structure is to be
relocated.
(2) Following the relocation of the historic landmark to another site in
the City, the Commission shall retain jurisdiction on the building
and site for purposes of review of any future development activity
in terms of alteration, addition or demolition. The tax block and lot
number of the new site shall be added to the list of designated
historic properties and shall be included on the Historic District
Map, as defined in this chapter.
E. Alterations and additions. The following factors shall be considered for
an application for alterations and/or additions affecting an individually
designated historic landmark, site or a building or structure within a
designated historic district:
(1) Design and materials. The proposed design and materials shall
conform to the building's original architectural style.
(2) Original qualities. The distinguishing original qualities or character
of a building, structure, or site and its environment shall not be
destroyed. The removal of alteration of any historic material or
distinctive architectural features shall be avoided.
(3) Acquired significance. Changes that have taken place in the course
of time are evidence of the history and development of a building,
structure or site and its environment. These changes may have
§ 370-31 BRIDGETON CODE § 370-31
347:794
acquired significance in their own right, and this significance shall
be recognized and respected.
(4) Repair versus replacement. Deteriorated architectural features
(e.g., windows, doors, shutters, trim, siding, etc.) shall be repaired
rather than replaced, wherever possible, using the Secretary of the
Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation and appropriate guidelines
developed in keeping with these Standards by the National Park
Service. In the event replacement is necessary, the new material
should match the material replaced in composition, design, color,
texture, and other visual qualities. Repair or replacement of
missing architectural features should be based on accurate
duplications of features substantiated by historic, physical, or
pictorial evidence rather than conjectural designs or the
availability of different architectural elements from other buildings
or structures.
(5) Design of alterations or additions. Contemporary design for
alterations and additions to existing properties shall not be
discouraged when such alterations and additions do not destroy
significant historic, architectural, or cultural material and such
design is compatible with the size, scale, color, material, and
character of the property, neighborhood, or environment. The
proposed addition cannot exceed more than 25% of the total abovegrade
enclosed and livable square footage of the existing building
or structure.
(6) Character of alterations. Wherever possible, new additions and
alterations to buildings or structures shall be done in such a
manner that if such additions or alterations were to be removed in
the future, the essential form and integrity of the structure would
be unimpaired.
(7) Synthetic siding. Synthetic siding is not permitted on key buildings.
Synthetic siding may be used to resurface facades of low public
visibility on contributing buildings that were originally wood-sided
only if the substitute siding is similar in design, width and texture
to the original siding and will not endanger the physical condition
and structural life of the original building. Architectural trim must
be retained, and packing out of window and door frames is
specifically prohibited.
(8) Window and door openings.
(a) Size, location and style. The number, size and locations of
original window and door openings shall be retained. Window
and door openings shall not be reduced to fit stock material.
New window and door openings shall not be added on
elevations that are subject to view from a public street. The
replacement window or door shall be of the same style and
type that was originally used on the building or structure.
§ 370-31 VEHICLES, ABANDONED § 370-31
347:795
(b) Metal windows. Where appropriate to the building or structure
in question, metal windows shall be permitted to match the
metal windows which were used when the building or
structure was originally built.
(c) Key buildings. Fiberglass-clad, vinyl-clad and aluminum-clad
windows and doors are not acceptable on key buildings. New
wood windows and doors shall be historically and
architecturally correct for the building or structure.
(d) Contributing buildings. Fiberglass-clad, vinyl-clad and
aluminum-clad windows and doors are not acceptable on the
front facades of contributing buildings. Non-wood-surfaced
window sashes, frames and doors and door frames may be used
on side and rear exposures of low public visibility on
contributing buildings that were originally wood windows and
doors when the substitute windows and doors are similar in
design, width, height and texture to the original wood windows
or doors and will not endanger the physical condition and
structural life of the building or structure. Pure vinyl windows
are not permitted.
(e) Noncontributing buildings. Non-wood-surfaced window
sashes, frames and doors are acceptable as replacement
windows or doors on noncontributing buildings. Pure vinyl
windows are not permitted.
(f) Trim and adornments. Architectural trim and adornments must
be retained. Wrapping and/or packing out of wood frames of
windows and doors is specifically not permitted.
F. New construction. The following factors shall be considered for new
construction on vacant lots or replacements affecting an historic
landmark, site, or an improvement within an historic district:
(1) Height. The height of the proposed buildings shall be visually
compatible with adjacent buildings.
(2) Proportion of building's front facade. The relationship of the width
of the building to the height of the front elevation shall be visually
compatible with buildings and places to which it is visually related.
(3) Proportion of openings within the facility. The relationship of the
width of windows to the height of windows in a building shall be

variance applications.
first obtaining a certificate of appropriateness. Under such
circumstances, the repairs performed shall be only such as are
necessary to protect the health and safety of the occupants of the
structure or others and/or to maintain the habitability of the structure.
Where feasible, temporary measures to prevent further damage should
be used, provided these measures are reversible without damage to the
structure.
B. The property owner shall make a request for the Commission's review
simultaneously with the onset of the emergency work. The request shall
be made to the Administrative Officer. Such emergency work shall be
permitted only if the Administrative Officer certifies the immediate
necessity for such permit issuance. Upon notice to the full Commission
by telephone, personal contact or other appropriate means of
communication, at least three members of the Commission shall
convene as soon as possible, and such convening members shall
proceed to review the certificate of appropriateness application as
provided in this chapter. The Commission shall conduct the emergency
meeting in accordance with the Open Public Meetings Act (N.J.S.A.

appropriateness is made and approval is obtained from the Commission

authority for site plan, subdivision or variance approval(s) that relate to
land, buildings or structures within the established historic districts or
for any buildings, structures, sites or objects designated as an historic
landmark pursuant to this chapter, an applicant shall also submit a copy
of such application to the Historic Preservation Commission for review
pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-110. Such an application shall solely
pertain to the proposed development review.
B. The application shall be scheduled for review by the Historic
Preservation Commission at its next regular scheduled meeting, and
preferably before it is scheduled to be heard by the approving authority.
Upon completion of its review, the Commission shall forward a report of
its findings to the approving authority recommending an approval (with
or without conditions) or recommending denial. The recommendations
shall be in the form of a written report conveyed to the approving
authority. The report shall also set forth the reasons for the specific
recommendations based upon the criteria contained in this chapter and
also the Guidelines of the Secretary of the Interior.

§ 370-33. Effect of certificate of appropriateness; approval; denial;
appeal.
C. The Historic Preservation Commission shall provide its advice through
the Commission's delegation of one of its members or staff to testify
orally at the hearing on the application and to explain any technical
comments or recommendations as outlined in the written report.
D. The Commission's recommendations shall focus on how the proposed
undertaking would affect a landmark's historic or architectural
significance, and shall be guided by the documents submitted by the
applicant, the standards and design criteria for review of applications
established in this chapter, and the Guidelines of the Secretary of the
Interior.
E. Neither approving authority shall take action on any development
application request affecting an historic landmark or an improvement
within a designated historic district without first reviewing and giving
significant weight and consideration to the Commission's
recommendations. In considering the Commission's recommendations,
the approving authority shall also be guided by the review criteria
established by this chapter and the Guidelines of the Secretary of the
Interior.
A. Within 45 days of a submission of an administratively complete
application for a certificate of appropriateness, the Historic District
Commission shall report to the Administrative Officer summarizing its
actions relative to the application. Its report may recommend issuance
of the certificate of appropriateness, with or without conditions, or may
recommend denial of the certificate of appropriateness. Failure to
report within the forty-five-day period, or any extended time limit
agreed upon jointly by the Commission and the applicant, shall be
deemed to be constituted as a report to the Administrative Officer in
favor of issuance of the certificate of appropriateness and without the
recommendations of conditions to the certificate of appropriateness.
B. A certificate of appropriateness which permits new construction,
demolition, relocation, alteration, additions, nonordinary repairs or
replacements affecting an historic landmark shall be conditioned upon
the appropriate treatment of the resources.
C. The work authorized by the certificate of appropriateness must be
initiated within one year from the date that the certificate is granted. If
a construction permit is required for such work, the certificate of
appropriateness shall be valid for the life of the construction permit and
any extensions thereof. For the purposes of this section, a certificate of
appropriateness shall be deemed invalid if the work ceases for a period
of six months after commencement of work. Reasonable extensions may
be granted by the Historic District Commission based upon appropriate
persuasive evidence.

§ 370-34. Violations and penalties.
Any exterior work undertaken on an individually designated historic
landmark or improvement or an historic landmark or improvement within
a designated historic district for which a certificate of appropriateness is
required without first having obtained such a certificate of appropriateness
shall be deemed to be in violation of this chapter and shall be subject to the
fines and penalties as provided by law in the Code of the City of Bridgeton
for violation of local ordinances and subject to the following:
§ 370-35. Interpretative statement.
D. An applicant for a certificate of appropriateness who is dissatisfied with
the actions of the Administrative Officer in denying the certificate of
appropriateness or in issuing the certificate of appropriateness with
objectionable conditions may appeal that action to the City Zoning
Board of Adjustment within 30 calendar days from the date of the
Administrative Officer's written decision. This right of appeal is limited
to the applicant only.
A. Upon learning of the violation, the Zoning Officer shall personally serve
upon the lot owner where the violation occurred a notice describing the
violation in detail and giving the owner 10 calendar days to abate the
violation by restoring the landmark or improvement to its prior state. If
the owner cannot be personally served within the municipality with said
notice, a copy shall be posted on site and a copy sent by certified mail,
return receipt requested, to the owner at his last known address as it
appears on the municipal tax rolls.
B. In the event that the violation is not abated within 10 calendar days of
service or posting on site, whichever is earlier, the Zoning Officer shall
issue a summons and complaint, returnable in the municipal court,
charging violation of this article. Each separate day that the violation
exists shall be deemed to be a new and separate violation.
C. The penalty for violation shall be as follows:
(1) For each day, up to 10 days: not more than $100 per day.
(2) For each day, 11 to 25 days: not more than $125 per day.
(3) For every day after the 25th day: not more than $150 per day, up to
a maximum of $5,000.
D. In the event that any action which would permanently change adversely
the landmark or historic district, such as demolition or removal, is
about to occur without issuance of a construction permit, the Zoning
Officer is hereby authorized to apply to the Superior Court of New
Jersey for such injunctive relief as is necessary to prevent the
destruction of any historic landmark, historic landmark site or
improvement within an historic district.
§ 370-33 BRIDGETON CODE § 370-35
347:800
§ 370-36. (Reserved)
A. Nothing contained within this article shall supersede the powers of
other local legislative or regulatory bodies or relieve any property
owner of complying with the requirements of any other state statutes or
municipal ordinances or regulations.
B. In the event of any inconsistency, ambiguity or overlapping of
requirements between the provisions of this article and any other
requirements enforced by the municipality, the more restrictive shall
apply, to the effect that state and/or federal legislation has not
preempted the municipality's power to enforce more stringent
standards.
C. These article requirements should not be viewed as requiring or
prohibiting the use of any particular architectural style, rather the
purpose is to preserve the past by making it compatible with and
relevant to the present. To that end, new construction in or near an
historic building, structure, object or site should not necessarily
duplicate the style; rather it should be compatible with and not detract
from the building, structure, site, object, neighborhood and its
environment.
