At any time before the 31st day of December, 1971, and every ten (10)

Bureau. The Board shall not reject any plea entered by mail if the
postmarked date on the envelope is within thirty (30) days from the

decision and order imposing a penalty up to the maximum amount
prescribed under rules and regulations of the Board for the violation
charged.
H. Any final order of the Board imposing a civil penalty, whether the
adjudication was had by hearing or upon default or otherwise, shall
constitute a judgment rendered by the Board against the respondent
which may be entered in the City Court or other equivalent court of the
municipality or any other place provided for the entry of civil judgments
within the state, and may be enforced against the respondent and his,
her or its property without court proceedings in the same manner as

upon written application showing excusable default and a defense to
the charge. A default decision and order may thereafter be opened in
the discretion of the Chief ALJ only upon written application showing
excusable default, a defense to the charge and good cause for the delay.
J. Before a judgment based upon a default may be so entered, the Board
must have notified the respondent by first-class mail in such form as the
Chief ALJ may require of the default decision and order and the penalty
imposed, that a judgment may be entered in the City Court or other
equivalent court of the municipality or any other place provided for the
entry of civil judgments within the State of New York that entry of such
judgment may be avoided by requesting a stay of default for good cause
shown and either requesting a hearing or entering a plea pursuant to
the rules of the Bureau within 30 days of the mailing of such notice.

penalties in § 1-21 of the City Code. No person may be sentenced by an
ALJ to a term of imprisonment upon being found guilty of any charge.

is complete, the original penalty will double, provided that such
increase in the penalty amount will never cause the penalty to exceed
the maximum amount provided for such violation in § 1-21.
A. All hearings shall be held in the City of Yonkers at such place as the
Chief ALJ shall designate from time to time. Hearings shall be held at
least twice per month.

communications. No charges may be sustained except upon proof by
substantial evidence. All testimony shall be given under oath or
affirmation.
D. A record shall be made of every hearing either by stenographic
recordings or by mechanical or electronic methods as the Chief ALJ
shall determine. A transcript of such record shall be supplied to a
respondent upon application and upon the payment of a fee. The ALJ
may, in his or her discretion or at the request of the respondent, on a
showing of good cause and need thereof, subpoena the attendance of
witnesses, including the issuing officer, and the production of relevant
books, records or other information.

application to a court of competent jurisdiction for an order requiring
such appearance, testimony or production of evidence.

consolidate for hearing or appeal one or more charges pending against
such respondent. An adjournment may be requested by the respondent
(up to 24 hours) prior to the hearing, but not more than two
adjournments shall be granted except under extraordinary
circumstances which the Chief ALJ shall determine.
A. The ALJ shall make final findings of fact and a final determination or
order. All findings of fact, decisions, determinations and orders shall be
written and rendered in an expeditious manner.
B. A final determination or order of the Board imposing a civil penalty
shall constitute a judgment and a record showing payment or
nonpayment of penalties. A copy of such judgment record or transcript
thereof may be filed in the office of the Clerk of the County of
Westchester or in such other County wherein the respondent resides or
is employed.
C. Where any final decision or order may not be entered and enforced as a
judgment because the amount of civil penalty exceeds the jurisdictional
amount of the City Court or other equivalent court of the municipality,
with respect to actions and proceedings for the recovery of money, such
decision or order may be enforced by the commencement of an action
or proceeding for the recovery of such civil penalties in a court of
competent jurisdiction by the municipality.
§ C6A-11 YONKERS CODE § C6A-12
C:138
§ C6A-13. Appeals.

Yonkers shall become a lien on said property subject to the collection as
a tax thereon.
A. There shall be one or more administrative appeal panels within the
Bureau. Each panel shall consist of three ALJs. In no event shall the ALJ
from whom such appeal of a decision, determination or order is taken
hear and determine that particular appeal. The appeals panel shall have
the power to review the record and the findings of the ALJ and may
reverse, modify or remand any such decision, determination or order
appealed therefrom. ALJs serving on the appeals panel may hear and
conduct administrative hearings but shall serve primarily as
administrative appeal panel members.
B. A respondent may appeal on the facts and/or the law, a final decision,
final determination or final order. No appeal may be made where a plea
of "guilty" or "guilty with an explanation" was entered by the
respondent at the hearing.
C. Upon rendering a decision, making a final determination or issuing a
final order, the ALJ shall provide the respondent with a form notice of
appeal and shall explain to such party on the record the method of filing
the notice of appeal and time limits, the requirements of Subsection E
of this section concerning the payment of penalties and posting of
bonds pending appeal, including the right to request exemption
therefrom, and that no further court challenge is permitted by law
unless an administrative appeal is taken.
D. For good cause shown, the administrative appeals panel may permit the
filing of a notice of appeal after the thirty-day period.
E. No appeal of a decision, determination or order of an administrative law
panel imposing civil penalties shall be decided unless such civil
penalties are paid or a cash or recognized surety company bond shall
have been posted in the amount of such civil penalties. No such
payment or posting of such bond shall be required where the
respondent is the holder of a current license or permit for the operation
of a business issued by an agency or officer of the City. Upon a showing
of undue hardship or where justice may require, the ALJ who decided
the case or the appellate panel to which the appeal is assigned may
order that the appeal shall be decided without requiring such payment
or posting of such bond.
F. A written determination of the appeals panel shall be rendered within
90 days after the submission of all relevant papers to the panel. The
determination of the appeals panel shall be the final determination of
the Bureau for the purposes of judicial review. Judicial review may be
sought pursuant to Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules.

§ C9-14. Water rents.
A. The Commissioner, with the consent of the City Council, shall establish
a scale of rents to be charged and paid from time to time, either in
advance or at such time or times as he or she shall prescribe, for the use
and supply of water to be called water rents on all classes of building in
said city in which water shall be used, and in the establishment of such
scale of rents shall have reference to the ordinary or extraordinary uses
of said water for dwellings, stores, shops, hotels, factories, livery
stables, wharves, barns and all other buildings, establishments and
trades, yards, number of families or occupants, or consumption of water
for useful or ornamental purposes, as near as may be practicable, and
from time to time the Commissioner may, with the approval of the City
Council, modify, amend, increase or diminish such rents, but the rents
shall be so fixed and kept that no consumer shall obtain water for less
than cost, and that the aggregate annual amount collected therefrom
shall equal each year at least two per centum of the then existing water
debt of the city, over and above all expense of repairs, maintenance,
operation, management, salaries and the interest on the water debt.
But before any such annual rents shall be fixed, established or
increased by the Commissioner, he or she shall give five days' public
notice in the official newspaper or newspapers of the city that he or she
has prepared a proposed scale of water rents and that the same is
subject to the inspection of any resident of said city, for the period of at
least five days, at a place to be named by the Commissioner, and that he
or she will be present at the time and place, which shall be named in
such notice, for the consideration of such proposed scale and for the
hearing and consideration of any complaint that may be then or there
made thereto by any interested party of said city. At the time and place
so appointed he shall hear the complaints and allegations of all parties
interested, and may take proof in relation thereto, and may confirm and
adopt the said proposed scale without alteration, or with such
alteration as he or she may deem proper, except that he shall not
increase any rent or rents. The Commissioner may, subject to the
approval in each instance of the City Council, remit or reduce any water
rate or rent, determined by meter charges, with the interest and
penalties thereon deemed by him or her to be erroneous or excessive.
Any such decision by the Commissioner to remit or reduce any water
rate or rent, including interest and penalties thereon, determined to be
erroneous or excessive shall be limited to the two semiannual billing
cycles immediately preceding the receipt of the written complaint by
the Commissioner's office alleging erroneous or excessive charges.

in accordance with statements or accounts of the amounts due which shall
be prepared and sent within ten days after the same shall be due by
the Commissioner to the owners of the premises liable therefor, but the
failure to render such statements shall not affect the lien of such rents.

the Commissioner all payments of water rents made or collected during the
preceding month and keep a separate account of the amounts so received,
and of all payments made in such month for maintaining and operating

preceding the time for making the annual assessment rolls, to make out
a list or roll of each ward of the city in which he or she shall set out the
amount of water rents accrued or chargeable upon each lot, part of lot or
building, and which shall not have been paid or included in a preceding
like list or roll, and file the same with the Commissioner, who shall in the
preparation of the next assessment roll for general city taxes, in separate
columns thereof, assess such amounts upon such property; and the same
shall be levied, corrected, enforced and collected in the same manner, by
the same proceedings, at the same time, under the same penalties, and
having the same lien upon the property assessed as the general city tax and
as a part thereof.

D. The frontage for frontage tax purposes for corner lots, shall be
computed by determining footage on the front chosen as the address of
the premises only.
E. The frontage for the purpose of this section, in regard to unimproved
lots, shall be the front as determined by the Department of Assessment
and Taxation.
A. In addition to all other rights and liens given to the City of Yonkers and
the Commissioner of the City of Yonkers in the preceding sections of
this Article and in § § 94 and 95 of the Second Class Cities Law, in any
case where a statement or account of the amount due for water rents

provided shall be paid into the city treasury, and the Commissioner of
Finance shall keep a separate account of the rents so received, and all
payments made in each year for operating and maintaining the waterworks
and for interest on all water bonds of the city heretofore issued. On or
before the fifth day of January in each year the Commissioner of Finance
shall make a detailed statement of the amounts so received, and the
payments so made to the City Council. Any surplus income, after paying
the necessary expenses of operating and maintaining the waterworks and
paying interest on all outstanding water bonds of the city heretofore issued,
shall constitute a sinking fund for the retirement of said water bonds
heretofore issued, and with all income received from investments of such
sinking fund, shall be invested by the Commissioner of Finance under the
direction of the City Council, either in bonds of the United States, or of the
State of New York, or any bonds of the City of Yonkers. Any water bonds of
the city heretofore issued, so purchased, shall be stamped as belonging to
the sinking fund, but the Commissioner of Finance shall collect the interest
thereon and upon all other bonds held by said sinking fund and invest
said interest as hereinbefore provided. Any bonds held in said sinking fund
other than water bonds of the city heretofore issued may from time to
time be sold by the Commissioner of Finance with the consent of the City
Council and the proceeds thereof reinvested as aforesaid. If in any fiscal
year the water rents collected shall not be sufficient to show a surplus after
deducting all payments made in such year for operating and maintaining
waterworks and for paying interest on all water bonds of the city heretofore
that such water rents are unpaid and that unless payment of the same
together with any interest and penalties thereon accruing shall be made
in accordance with the provisions of this Article within ten days after
the mailing of such notice, the Commissioner of the City of Yonkers
without further notice may cause the supply of water to such premises
to be cut off or shut off, and in the event that such notice is mailed to
the "owner or occupant" the Commissioner of the City of Yonkers shall
have the power to cut off or shut off the supply of water to the said
premises in accordance with the terms of the said notice. Such notice
shall have printed or written thereon a copy of this section.
B. In addition to all remedies granted by law for the nonpayment of water
rents and interest and penalties thereon, and in addition to the right to
collect water rents, and interest and penalties thereon by sale of tax
lien, the city may maintain an action for their recovery against the
person for whose benefit or by whom the water is or has been taken or
used.

exceed the needs of the city, the city, by ordinance of the City Council, shall
have power to contract with any corporation or corporations, municipal
or otherwise, or person or persons without said city, to supply to such
corporation or person such water for a term not exceeding five years, and
to supply and deliver such water under such contract.

property whatever, erected or used, or hereafter to be erected or used
for the purpose of procuring or keeping such supply of water, shall in any
manner be injured, nor erect or place any nuisance on the banks of any
lake, stream, pond or spring from which supply of water is obtained, nor
throw anything into such lake, stream, pond or spring, or into the aqueduct,

§ C18-3 CHARTER § C18-7
C:217
A. City taxes. All city taxes upon real estate for each fiscal year shall be
due and payable when such taxes shall have become a lien, or in equal
installments on July 6, October 6 and January 6, respectively, when such
dates occur after the lien date, without any additional charge,
percentage or penalty; provided, however, that in no event shall any
additional charge, percentage or penalty be added to any taxes for any
such fiscal year paid within thirty (30) days after such taxes shall have
become a lien. To all taxes or installments thereof paid after the last
date provided herein upon which such taxes or installments may be
paid without any additional charge, percentage or penalty, interest shall
be added at the rate of fifteen per centum (15%) per annum, computed
from the date such taxes shall have become a lien to the date of the
payment thereof; provided, however, that if such taxes in any such fiscal
year shall have become a lien prior to the beginning of such fiscal year,
the interest upon such taxes shall be computed from the beginning of
such fiscal year to the date of payment of such taxes.
B. Payment of certain city taxes. Notwithstanding any other provisions
contained in this section, any installment of city taxes upon real estate
or any portion of such installment for the fiscal year beginning July 1,
1976, whether or not fixed or assessed, which is or will become due and
payable, may be paid on any date prior to July 6, 1976, October 6, 1976,
or January 6, 1977, pursuant to Subsection A of this section, provided
that all prior installments shall have been paid or shall be paid at the
same time; and upon such prepayment, a discount shall be allowed
thereon from the date of such prepayment to and including the last day
on which such taxes may, under Subsection A of this section, be paid
without any additional charge, percentage or penalty, such discount to
be at the rate of eight per centum (8%) per annum for taxpayers who
have paid, prior to April 1, 1976, the last quarterly tax installment for
the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1975, and seven and one-half per
centum (7 1/2%) per annum for all other taxpayers, and a receipt shall
be furnished to the extent of such prepayment and the discount
thereon. If, at the time of such prepayment of the first such installment,
such taxes shall not have become a lien, the receipt for such
prepayment of such installment shall reflect a discount computed from
the date of such prepayment to and including July 6, 1976. If, when the
taxes so prepaid shall have become a lien, it appears that such
installment could have been paid without any additional charge,
percentage or penalty on a date which is later than July 6, 1976, then an
additional discount at the same rate shall be allowed on such
prepayment, computed from July 6, 1976, to and including such later
date, and upon the request of the taxpayer a receipt shall be furnished
for the amount of such additional discount, which shall be deducted
from any remaining balance of such installment or, if such installment
shall be fully paid, from the next installment remaining unpaid. Upon
such prepayment any installment of city taxes upon real estate or any
portion of such installment for which prepayment shall be made shall be
deemed due and payable and shall be satisfied and extinguished to the
extent of the amount prepaid plus the discount provided for herein. As

§ C18-8. Applicability of statute of limitations.
In any action or proceeding to which the City of Yonkers, or any of its
officers, is a party, and in which it is claimed that taxes, local assessments,
water rents or sewer rents heretofore or hereafter taxed, assessed or
charged are due or owing the city, or in which it is sought to collect the
same, the statute of limitations is not a bar or defense to the right of the city
or its officers to recover or offset such taxes, assessments or water rents.
§ C18-9. Validity of assessments and charges.
All taxes, local assessments, water rents, sewer rents and expenses of
repairing and removal of snow and ice from sidewalks heretofore or
hereafter levied and assessed by the City of Yonkers, or by its officers,
together with interest, fees and penalties, are and shall be valid and
effectual, notwithstanding any irregularity, omission, defect or error not
actually fraudulent with respect thereto; and all proceedings for the
collection of the same are and shall be valid and effectual, notwithstanding
any such irregularity, omission, defect or error.

includes special franchise taxes.

shall be paid in one (1) installment on or before April 6, without any
additional charge, percentage or penalty; provided, however, that in no
event shall any additional charge, percentage or penalty be added to
any taxes for any such calendar year paid within thirty (30) days after
such taxes shall have become a lien. To all taxes or installment thereof
paid after the last date provided herein upon which such taxes or
installment may be paid without any additional charge, percentage or
penalty, interest shall be added at the rate of fifteen per centum (15%)
per annum, computed from the date when such taxes shall have become
a lien to the date of the payment thereof; provided, however, that if such
taxes in any calendar year shall have become a lien prior to the
beginning of such calendar year, the interest upon such taxes shall be
computed from the beginning of such calendar year to the date of the
payment of such taxes.

deed(s) and mortgage(s) recorded with the Westchester County Clerk.
C. The notice shall include a copy of the transfer of tax lien issued to the
purchaser by the city; shall include a statement of the total amount due
under the tax lien; shall state the next date upon which interest is to be
paid to the lien purchaser and the amount which is to be paid; and shall
state that if semi-annual interest payments are not timely paid and the
tax lien is not paid in full by not later than three (3) years from the date
of the tax lien sale, then the holder of the tax lien may foreclose the tax
lien.
D. No action to foreclose a tax lien may be maintained, and no foreclosure
of a tax lien shall be allowed, unless the requirements of this section
have been satisfied and proof of such compliance is established by clear
and convincing evidence.
§ C19-2.1 CHARTER § C19-4
C:227
Commissioner of Finance shall require from each purchaser of a tax lien at
the time of such sale a deposit on account of ten per centum (10%) of the
amount of the tax lien purchased by him or her, and not later than ten (10)
days from the date of sale, the balance shall be paid to the Commissioner
of Finance at his or her, office. If no bid shall be received for a tax lien
offered for sale, the Commissioner of Finance, for and on behalf of the City
of Yonkers, may bid in the said tax lien at the rate of interest of twelve
per centum (12%) per annum, and upon such bid no deposit or payment in
cash shall be required from the city. When the city has bid in any tax lien a
transfer of tax lien to the city shall be executed by the said Commissioner of
Finance or a deputy in the form and manner prescribed for other transfers
of tax liens, and the city shall have the same rights in, to and under such
transfer of tax liens as if the same had been bought by any other person.
Transfers of tax lien shall be made and delivered to the purchaser without
charge upon payment of the amounts therein shown to be due. In case any
purchaser shall not complete his or her purchase in accordance with the
terms prescribed, and as herein provided, then the amount deposited by
him or her at the time of the sale shall be forfeited to the city, and the
entire tax lien upon the lands affected by such purchase shall be sold again.
Such resale shall be held at such time and place as the Commissioner of
Finance may direct and notice thereof shall be advertised in the official
newspapers in such manner and for such time, not less than once in each
of two weeks, as the Commissioner of Finance may direct. All deposits
forfeited as aforesaid shall remain on deposit and be included as a part of
the estimated revenues in the next succeeding annual estimate. When the
city has bid in any tax lien, and a transfer of such lien has been made to
the city, if any person, firm, or corporation, shall offer to purchase such lien
for not less than the amount thereof, together with accrued interest, the
Commissioner of Finance may, and if directed to do so by the City Council
shall, execute on behalf of the city and deliver an assignment of such lien
to such person, firm, or corporation, upon receiving the amount offered
therefor.
§ C19-5. Effect of transfer. [Amended 11-4-2008 by L.L. No.
10-2008]
A transfer of tax lien shall operate to transfer and assign the tax lien upon
the lands or tenements described therein for the taxes and assessments,
and penalties, the interest thereon, and the charges of the notices and
advertisement given pursuant to § C19-1 of this Article, and all other costs
and charges, so advertised for sale, free of all taxes and assessments and
penalties and interest thereon, which became due and payable before the
day of the date mentioned in the advertisement of the sale as stated therein,
and to create a lien upon the property affected thereby for the interest
to which the purchaser may be entitled under his or her bid, but subject
to the lien for and right of the city to collect and receive all taxes and
assessments and penalties and interest thereon, which became due and
payable or which became a lien on and after the day of the date mentioned
in the advertisement for such sale as stated therein. A transfer of tax lien
shall contain a transfer and assignment by the city of the tax lien sold to
§ C19-4 YONKERS CODE § C19-5
C:228
the purchaser, the date of sale, the aggregate amount of the tax lien so
transferred, and the items of taxes, assessments, penalties, interest and
charges of notices and advertisement composing the tax lien, the annual
rate of interest which the purchaser has bid and will be entitled to receive,
the date when the amount of the tax lien will be due, and a description of
the real property affected by the tax lien. Each transfer of tax lien shall be
subscribed by the Commissioner of Finance or one of his or her deputies
or a successor in office of such Commissioner of Finance or deputy, and
shall be acknowledged by the officer subscribing the same in the manner in
which a deed is required to be acknowledged to be recorded in Westchester
County.
§ C19-6. Records of sales of tax liens. [Amended 11-4-2008 by L.L.
No. 10-2008]
The Commissioner of Finance shall keep in his or her office a public record
of sales of tax liens, and a copy of each transfer of tax lien issued by him
or her, and suitable books indexing such records and copies. Assignments
of transfers of tax lien duly acknowledged may be filed and recorded in
the office of the Commissioner of Finance. A transfer of tax lien and any
assignment thereof duly acknowledged shall be deemed a conveyance
under Article eight of the Real Property Law, and may be recorded in the
office of the Clerk of the County of Westchester, Division of Land Records.
Transfer of a tax lien and all assignments thereof shall be recorded by
said County Clerk in the same manner as mortgages and assignments
thereof, and without payment of tax under Article eleven of the Tax Law.
The record in the office of the Commissioner of Finance of sales of tax
liens, of a transfer of tax lien, and of a copy of a transfer of tax lien, and
of an assignment of a transfer of tax lien; a record of a transfer of tax lien
in the office of said County Clerk and of an assignment of tax lien, duly
acknowledged, in the office of said County Clerk, shall each be evidence
in any court in the state without further proof. A transcript of any record
enumerated in this section, duly certified, shall be evidence in any court
in the state with like effect as the original instrument of record. Neither
the tax lien nor the rights transferred or created by a transfer of tax lien
shall be impaired by failure of said County Clerk to record a transfer of
tax lien made by the city through the Commissioner of Finance. Unless a
contrary intent appears, a tax lien shall be presumed to be satisfied and
discharged whenever it shall appear from recorded instruments that the tax
lien has been transferred or assigned to the record owner of such lands or
tenements, notwithstanding other intervening estates or liens.
§ C19-7. Payments to holder of transfer of tax lien. [Amended
11-4-2008 by L.L. No. 10-2008; 12-11-2018 by L.L. No. 14-2018]
The aggregate amount of each tax lien transferred pursuant to this Article
shall be due three years from the date of the sale. Until such aggregate
amount is fully paid and discharged, the holder of the transfer of tax lien
shall be entitled to receive interest on such aggregate amount from the
day of sale, semi-annually on the first day of January and July, at the rate
§ C19-5 CHARTER § C19-7
C:229
which the purchaser shall have bid. The holder of the transfer of tax lien
shall receive no additional fees or compensation other than the aggregate
amount of the lien and applicable interest. If default shall be made in
the payment of any installment of such interest and shall continue for a
period of thirty days after such installment became due and payable, or if
default shall be made in the payment of any tax or assessment upon lands
and tenements affected by the transfer of tax lien, which became due and
payable after the day of the date mentioned in the advertisement of the
sale of the tax lien as stated therein, and such latter default shall continue
for a period of six months after the delivery of the transfer of tax lien
and after such tax or assessment became a lien, then and in either such
case, at the option of the holder of the transfer of tax lien, the aggregate
amount thereof shall become due and payable. Any person having a legal
or beneficial interest in the property affected by a transfer of tax lien
may satisfy the same before maturity upon payment of the principal with
interest at the rate bid to a time three months after the date of such
payment, or, if such principal is to become due within three months after
the date of such payment, with interest at the rate bid up to the time the
tax lien is to become due. All installments of interest, and any payment
made to satisfy and discharge the principal of the lien, may be made to
the Commissioner of Finance either before or after the tax lien shall have
become due until and unless the recorded holder of the tax lien shall make
and deliver to the Commissioner of Finance an affidavit stating that such
holder has commenced an action to foreclose the tax lien and stating the
title of the action, the name and post office address of the attorney of record
for the plaintiff in such action; and, after the filing of such an affidavit,
the Commissioner of Finance shall not accept any such payments. In case
any payment of principal or interest shall be made to the Commissioner of
Finance as aforesaid he or she shall receive the same for the benefit of the
holder of the tax lien, and shall give notice thereof to the purchaser, by mail
addressed to such address as may have been furnished to the Commissioner
of Finance, and shall pay the amount thus deposited to the person who
according to the record in his or her office appears to be entitled thereto, or
to the personal representatives of such person, but such payment shall be
made by the Commissioner of Finance only upon receiving surrender of the
transfer of tax lien.
§ C19-8. Discharge of tax lien to be recorded. [Amended 11-4-2008
by L.L. No. 10-2008]
A tax lien sold pursuant to the provisions of this Article must be discharged
upon the record thereof by the Commissioner of Finance when payment is
made to him or her of the principal and interest as provided in the last
preceding section, and also when the transfer of tax lien is surrendered
to him or her for cancellation and there is presented to him a certificate
executed by the purchaser, or the personal representative or assignee of the
purchaser, acknowledged so as to be entitled to be recorded in Westchester
County, certifying that the tax lien has been paid or has been otherwise
satisfied and discharged. The transfer of tax lien thus surrendered and such
certificate of discharge must be filed by the Commissioner of Finance and
§ C19-7 YONKERS CODE § C19-8
C:230
he or she must note upon the margin of the record of such sale, upon
such transfer of tax lien and upon the copy of the transfer of a tax lien
kept in his or her office a minute of such discharge and the date of filing
thereof. In case the transfer of tax lien shall have been lost or destroyed
or mutilated, if payment be made to the Commissioner of Finance, or if a
certificate of discharge be filed as hereinafter provided, application for an
order dispensing with the surrender of the transfer of tax lien may be made
in the same manner as is provided in section three hundred and twenty-two
of the Real Property Law, the provisions of which, so far as the same may
be, are hereby made applicable to discharge of tax liens to the same extent
as if Westchester County was wholly embraced in a city of the first class.
The Commissioner of Finance shall upon demand issue his or her certificate
showing the discharge of any tax lien which may have been duly discharged
as provided in this section, and such certificate may be filed in the office
of the Clerk of the County of Westchester, and said Clerk shall record the
same, and upon the margin of the record of such transfer of tax lien in his
or her office shall note a statement that the same has been discharged with
a reference to the record of such certificate in his or her office.
§ C19-9. Exemption from taxation.
Tax liens and transfers of tax liens shall be exempt from taxation by the
state or any local subdivision thereof, except from the taxes imposed by
Article ten of the Tax Law. The real property affected by any tax lien shall
not be exempt from taxation by reason of this section.
§ C19-10. Action to foreclose. [Amended 5-9-2000 by L.L. No.
5-2000]
If the amount of any tax lien which shall have been transferred by a transfer
of a tax lien shall not be paid when under its terms and the provisions of this
Article such amount shall be due, the holder of such tax lien may maintain
an action in the Supreme Court to foreclose such tax lien. In an action
to foreclose a tax lien each and every person shall be named as a party
whom the plaintiff has reason to believe, based upon a search of documents
recorded with the Westchester County Clerk, that such person has or may
have an interest in or claim upon the real property affected by the tax lien.
Except as otherwise provided in this Article, an action to foreclose a tax lien
shall be regulated by the provisions of the Civil Practice Act and by all other
provisions of law, and rules of practice applicable to actions to foreclose
mortgages on real property. All summonses or other notices required to be
published shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the
City of Yonkers. The people of the State of New York may be made a party
to an action to foreclose a tax lien in the same manner as a natural person.
Where the people of the State of New York or the City of Yonkers is made
a party defendant the complaint shall set forth, in addition to the other
matters required to be set forth by law, detailed facts showing the particular
nature of the interest in or the lien on the said real property of the people of
the State of New York or the City of Yonkers, and detailed facts showing the
particular nature of the interest in or the lien on said real property which
§ C19-8 CHARTER § C19-10
C:231
plaintiff has reason to believe that the people of the State of New York or the
City of Yonkers has or may have in the said real property, and the reason for
making the people of the State of New York or the City of Yonkers a party
defendant. Upon failure to state such facts the complaint shall be dismissed
as to the people of the State of New York or the City of Yonkers.
§ C19-11. Actions regarding separate properties commonly held.
In an action to foreclose a tax lien the plaintiff may include and join in one
action all tax liens relating to or affecting two or more separate and distinct
parcels of real property belonging to the same person or persons, firm or
firms, or corporation or corporations.
§ C19-12. Appointment of receiver. [Amended 11-4-2008 by L.L. No.
10-2008]
In any action brought by the City of Yonkers as plaintiff to foreclose a tax
lien under this Article, the City of Yonkers as plaintiff shall be entitled,
without notice and without regard to adequacy of any security of the debt,
to the appointment of a receiver of the rents and profits of the premises
covered by the tax lien, and the court shall appoint the Commissioner of
Finance of the City of Yonkers as such receiver to act without bond or other
security, and all fees received by him or her shall be paid into the city
treasury. Except as otherwise provided in this Article, the appointment of
the receiver shall be regulated by the Civil Practice Act and by all other
provisions of law and rules of practice applicable to the appointment of a
receiver.
§ C19-13. Evidence and burden of proof in action. [Amended
11-4-2008 by L.L. No. 10-2008]
Whenever a cause of action, defense or counterclaim is for the foreclosure
of a tax lien, or is in any manner founded upon a tax lien or a transfer
of tax lien, the production in evidence of an instrument executed by the
Commissioner of Finance in the form prescribed in § C19-5 of this Article
for a transfer of tax lien subscribed by or in behalf of the Commissioner
of Finance shall be presumptive evidence that the lien purported to be
transferred by such an instrument was a valid and enforceable lien, and that
it has been duly assigned to the purchaser, and it shall not be necessary to
plead or prove any act, proceeding, notice or action, preceding the delivery
of such transfer of tax lien nor to establish the validity of the tax lien
transferred by such transfer of tax lien. If a party or person in interest
in any such action or proceeding claims that a tax lien is irregular or
invalid, or that there is any defect therein, or that a transfer of a tax lien
is irregular, invalid or defective, such irregularity, invalidity or defect must
be specifically pleaded or set forth, and must be established affirmatively by
the party or person pleading or setting forth the same.
§ C19-10 YONKERS CODE § C19-14
C:232
§ C19-14. Validity of lien and transfer.
In every action for the foreclosure of a tax lien, and in every action or
proceeding in which a cause of action, defense or counterclaim is in any
manner founded upon a tax lien or a transfer of tax lien, such transfer of tax
lien and the tax lien which it transfers shall be presumed to be regular and
valid and effectual to transfer to the purchaser named therein a valid and
enforceable tax lien. Unless in such an action or proceeding such tax lien
or transfer of tax lien be found to be invalid, they shall be adjudged to be
enforceable and valid, for the amount thereof and the interest to which the
holder may be entitled, and a tax lien transferred by a transfer of tax lien
effectual to transfer such tax lien to the purchaser named therein.
§ C19-15. Judgment; sale of property. [Amended 11-4-2008 by L.L.
No. 10-2008]
In an action to foreclose a tax lien, unless the defendants obtain judgment,
the plaintiff shall be entitled to a judgment establishing the validity of the
tax lien so far as the same shall not be adjudged invalid and of the transfer
of tax lien, and directing the sale of the real property affected thereby, or
such part thereof as shall be sufficient to discharge the tax lien, or such
items thereof as shall not be adjudged invalid and the interest thereon and
all other due and unpaid taxes and assessments which are liens on the real
property, together with the expenses of the sale, and the costs of the action.
At a sale pursuant to judgment in an action to foreclose a tax lien wherein
the City of Yonkers is plaintiff, said city, without authorization other than
that hereby given, may purchase the real property affected at a price not
exceeding the amount due to the plaintiff at the time of such sale together
with the costs and expenses of the sale plus the amount of all due and
unpaid taxes and assessments which are liens on the premises and became
due on or after the day of the date mentioned in the advertisement of the
sale of the said tax lien, unless a bid in amount equal thereto be made by
some person other than the plaintiff. The moneys required to be paid by said
city upon any purchase made pursuant to the provisions of this section may
be taken from any appropriate fund of the city. The proceeds of any such
sale over and above the costs and allowances of the action shall be applied
in like manner as the proceeds of the sale of a tax lien to a person other than
the city. Any real property acquired by said city in the manner aforesaid may
be assigned by the City Council, for a public use, or sold at public sale in
the same manner as other real property of the city is sold. In the event of
the assignment of any such property for public use the same shall be paid
for as in the case of the purchase of other property for such use at the price
determined by the City Council, and the consideration for such assignment
as well as the proceeds of any such public sale shall be deposited in the fund
out of which such property was paid for on the foreclosure sale. Whenever
the balance in any fund shall be more than would be necessary to redeem
outstanding obligations payable from said fund and to properly carry out
the provisions of this section, the Comptroller may certify that fact to the
City Council which, upon such certificate, may direct that the excess or
§ C19-14 CHARTER § C19-15
C:233
portion thereof be included as a part of the estimated revenues in the next
succeeding annual estimate.
§ C19-16. Sale by Mayor. [Amended 11-4-2008 by L.L. No. 10-2008]
The Mayor, or such other officer as may be empowered by an ordinance
of the City Council shall, notwithstanding the provisions of any general,
special or local law, or any provision of this Charter, sell any property
acquired by said city pursuant to the provisions of § C19-15 of this Article,
if not assigned by the City Council for a public use or if not sold at a
public sale in accordance with the provisions of section thirty-seven of the
Second Class Cities Law, upon such terms for such sum as the City Council
may, by resolution, fix and determine and said Mayor, or other officer so
empowered, on behalf of said city shall execute, acknowledge and deliver a
deed therefor.
§ C19-17. Leasing property by Mayor. [Amended 11-4-2008 by L.L.
No. 10-2008]
The Mayor, or such other officer as may be empowered by an ordinance
of the City Council, shall, notwithstanding the provisions of any general,
special or local law, or any provision of this Charter, lease any property
acquired by said city pursuant to the provisions of § C19-15 of this Article,
if not assigned by the City Council for a public use or if not sold or leased
at a public auction sale in accordance with the provisions of section thirtyseven
of the Second Class Cities Law, upon such terms and for such sums
as the City Council may, by resolution, fix and determine, subject, however,
to the provisions of the general zoning ordinances of the city, and said
Mayor, or other officer so empowered, on behalf of said city shall execute,
acknowledge, and deliver a lease therefor.
§ C19-18. Final judgment to be binding.
Every final judgment in an action to foreclose a tax lien shall be binding
upon, and every conveyance upon a sale pursuant thereto, shall transfer
to and vest in the purchaser all the right title and interest, and estate in
and claim upon the real property affected by such judgment, of the plaintiff,
each defendant upon whom the summons is served, each person claiming
from, through or under such a defendant by title accruing after the filing
of notice of pendency of the action or after the entry of judgment and
filing of the judgment roll in the proper County Clerk's office, and each
person not in being when the judgment is rendered, who afterwards may
become entitled to a beneficial interest attaching to, or an estate or interest
in such real property or any portion thereof, provided that the person
presumptively entitled to such beneficial interest, estate or interest is a
party to such action or bound by such judgment. So much of section two
hundred seventeen of the Civil Practice Act as requires the court to allow
a defendant to defend an action after final judgment shall not apply to an
action to foreclose a tax lien. Delivery of the possession of real property
affected by a judgment to foreclose a tax lien may be compelled in the
§ C19-15 YONKERS CODE § C19-18
C:234
manner prescribed in section nine hundred eighty-five of the Civil Practice
Act.
§ C19-19. Surplus of proceeds.
Any surplus of the proceeds of the sale, after paying the expenses of the
sale, and paying all taxes and assessments which became due and payable
on and after the day of the date mentioned in the advertisement of the sale
under which the foreclosed transfer of tax lien was issued, and satisfying
the amount of the tax lien and interest and the costs of the action, must be
paid into court, for the use of the person or persons entitled thereto. If any
part of the surplus remains in court for the period of three months, and no
application has been made therefor, the court must, and, if an application
therefor is pending, the court may direct such surplus to be invested at
interest, for the benefit of the person or persons entitled thereto, to be paid
upon the direction of the court.
§ C19-20. When no bids received. [Amended 11-4-2008 by L.L. No.
10-2008]
If no bid other than a bid made for and on behalf of the city be received
for a tax lien on any parcel of property at a duly advertised sale and it
shall appear to the Commissioner of Finance that the taxes, assessments,
penalties and interest, due and unpaid, amount to so large a proportion of
the value of the property that the security is insufficient to attract bidders,
then and in that event the Commissioner of Finance and the Corporation
Counsel shall investigate the facts and fix a lesser amount for which in
their judgment a tax lien bearing twelve per centum interest can be sold.
A certificate in writing, signed by them, shall be submitted to the City
Council, setting forth the amount so determined by them, together with a
brief statement of the reasons for such reduction, which certificate shall
include the total amount of the taxes, assessments, penalties and interest,
due and unpaid, the assessed value of such parcel of real estate, the value
of the land as the same appears on the last preceding assessment roll.
If the City Council shall by resolution approve said certificate, it shall
be filed with the Commissioner of Finance, and thereafter such reduced
amount shall constitute the tax lien upon said real property for the items
therein enumerated, unless the same be increased as hereinafter provided,
which reduced amount shall bear interest at the rate of eight per centum
per annum computed from the date of such certificate until fully paid, or
until the tax lien thus fixed, together with the lien for any other taxes,
assessments, and penalties and interest becoming due thereafter, shall be
sold. The Commissioner of Finance shall forthwith advertise the tax lien for
such reduced amount for sale to the highest bidder in the manner provided
for the advertisement for the sale of ordinary tax liens. Such tax liens
shall bear interest at twelve per centum and shall be sold to the person
bidding the highest amount of money in excess of the reduced amount so
fixed by the Commissioner of Finance and Corporation Counsel, provided
that if the bidding reaches the original amount of the tax lien on the real
property affected, together with all interest and penalties thereon, the sale
§ C19-18 CHARTER § C19-20
C:235
shall proceed in the manner provided in section four of this Article; if
such tax lien be sold for a sum greater than the reduced amount fixed as
aforesaid with interest and penalties thereon, then such greater amount
shall be considered the tax lien upon the real property affected thereby.
If no bid shall be received at such sale, the Commissioner of Finance and
Corporation Counsel shall reconsider their determination and may submit
a new certificate in the manner hereinbefore provided, and if such new
certificate be approved by the City Council and filed with the Commissioner
of Finance, he or she shall proceed again as hereinbefore directed. Such
procedure shall be repeated until a tax lien for such taxes, assessments, and
accrued interest shall be sold.
§ C19-21. Vacation, invalidity, etc., of transfer of tax lien. [Amended
11-4-2008 by L.L. No. 10-2008]
If a transfer of a tax lien be vacated or be set aside or canceled, or if it
be adjudged in any action that a transfer of tax lien is invalid or defective,
or not sufficient to transfer a tax lien to the purchaser thereof, or if in any
action to foreclose a tax lien, it be adjudged that the entire tax lien is void
and not a valid lien on the premises which it purports to affect, and that
the complaint be dismissed, or if in any action a sale of the property is
directed to be made subject to any easement and hence the amount of the
lien cannot be obtained upon sale of the property, the holder may surrender
such transfer of tax lien, together with a certified copy of such judgment or
decree, and also an assignment to the city of such judgment directing sale
to the Commissioner of Finance and thereupon shall be repaid by the city
the amount paid for such transfer of tax lien, with interest from the time of
such payment at the rate of six per centum unless a lower rate be set forth
in the transfer of tax lien, in which event at such lower rate, and the city
shall pay the taxed costs and disbursements of any action or proceeding in
which such adjudication is made.
§ C19-22. Procedure when lien exceeds selling price. [Amended
11-4-2008 by L.L. No. 10-2008]
When it shall appear to the Commissioner of Finance that the taxes or
assessments, or both, due and unpaid, together with the interest and
penalties thereon, which may have been levied upon a parcel of real estate
subject to easements which were in existence prior to the levying of such
taxes or assessments, equal or exceed the sum for which, under ordinary
circumstances, such parcel of real estate would sell subject to such
easements, the Commissioner of Finance, with the approval of the City
Council may settle and adjust such unpaid taxes or assessments or both
with the interest and penalties thereon, and when it shall appear to the
Commissioner of Finance that such parcel of real estate would sell under
ordinary circumstances subject to such easements for only a nominal sum,
then the Commissioner of Finance with the approval of the City Council may
cancel such unpaid taxes and assessments together with the interest and
penalties thereon. Before the sale of a tax lien or whenever the city shall
have bid in any tax lien if the Commissioner of Finance shall believe that
§ C19-20 YONKERS CODE § C19-22
C:236
there is a doubt as to the validity of such lien, or any part thereof, or that
there is lack of sufficient evidence to support the lien or any part thereof,
he or she may refer the matter to the Corporation Counsel, who shall
investigate the law and the facts and report his or her recommendations
in writing to the City Council, and if the Corporation Counsel shall so
recommend, the City Council may by ordinance, cancel or reduce such lien.
§ C19-23. Partial invalidity of lien.
If, in any action to foreclose a tax lien, it shall be adjudged that some, but
not all of the items constituting such tax lien are void and not a valid lien
on the premises covered by such tax lien, or if in any action or proceeding
it be adjudged that a transfer of tax lien is invalid or defective, as to some
though not as to all of the items transferred, the holder of the transfer of
tax lien, by instrument in writing duly acknowledged, shall retransfer to the
city the items thus affected, and shall be repaid by the city such portion of
the amount paid for such transfer of tax lien as may be applicable to the
items thus affected, with interest from the time of such payment at the rate
of six per centum unless a lower rate be set forth in the transfer of tax lien,
in which event at such lower rate, and the city shall pay the taxed costs
and disbursements of any action or proceeding, other than an action to
foreclose the tax lien, in which such adjudication is made. The provisions of
this section shall not apply to a tax lien which has been reduced as provided
in § C19-20 of this Article, unless by such an adjudication the amount of the
tax lien which shall remain valid and enforceable, be reduced below the sum
bid for the same and the interest thereon at the rate to which the holder of
the transfer of tax lien is entitled, and the amount repaid by the city shall
not exceed the difference between the sum to which the tax lien has been

§ C19-24. Notices by interested parties of invalidity. [Amended
11-4-2008 by L.L. No. 10-2008]
Any person interested in or holding a lien upon any real property affected
by any unpaid tax lien or transfer of tax lien may file a written notice
with the Commissioner of Finance claiming that a transfer of tax lien is
invalid or defective or that a tax lien which has been transferred pursuant
to this Article or which is advertised to be transferred is invalid, defective,
void, or ineffectual, or should be vacated or set aside. The Commissioner
of Finance shall transmit all such notices to the Corporation Counsel, who
shall examine into the facts and proceedings resulting in the tax lien or
transfer of tax lien mentioned in such notice; before a determination is
had the Corporation Counsel shall serve a copy of such notice upon the
holder of the transfer of tax lien which is thus questioned or which transfers
the items thus questioned and shall give such holder an opportunity to be
heard. The Corporation Counsel shall certify in writing his or her opinion
upon the matters and questions raised by such notice, and if he or she
concludes that a defense in an action to foreclose the tax lien would succeed
in whole or in part he or she shall so certify, and shall recommend what
§ C19-22 CHARTER § C19-24
C:237
action shall be taken by the city concerning the same. If the Corporation
Counsel concludes that such defense would succeed in whole or in part and
recommends repayment by the city of the amount paid for a transfer of tax
lien which would be applicable to any item, he or she shall state the reasons
for such recommendation, and if it be approved by the City Council the city
shall require the surrender of the transfer of tax lien or the retransfer to
it of the item or items of tax lien which are found to be void or defective,
and shall make repayment therefor in the same manner as if such transfer
of tax lien, tax lien or items had been adjudicated in the manner provided in
§§ C19-21 and C19-23 of this Article. Neither the provisions of this section
nor any act or proceeding thereunder shall impair or in any other manner
affect the rights or remedies of any person interested in, or holding any lien
upon, real property to question the validity of any tax, assessment, or tax
lien, or any part or item of any tax lien.

of this Article by the holder of any tax lien, unless action to foreclose the tax
lien or transfer of tax lien upon which such claim is founded be commenced
within four years from the time of the sale resulting in such transfer of tax
lien. Nor shall any claim be made against the city under §§ C19-21 or C19-23
of this Article, unless within ten days after the commencement of any action
or proceeding to vacate, set aside or cancel a transfer of tax lien, or a tax
lien or an item mentioned in a transfer of tax lien, or unless within ten days
after the service of any pleading or other paper in an action or proceding
in which any transfer of tax lien, or item mentioned in a transfer of tax
lien, is brought into question, sought to be set aside, vacated, or cancelled,
or which sets forth or pleads any defense to an action to foreclose a tax
lien, notice in writing be served upon the Corporation Counsel setting forth

transfer of tax lien, or his or her attorney, and demanding that the city take
up the prosecution or defense of the action or proceeding. All proceedings
in such action or proceeding shall be stayed for thirty days or such shorter
time as the Corporation Counsel shall stipulate in writing. It shall be the
duty of the Corporation Counsel to examine the questions raised, and, in
order to protect the interests of the city, he or she shall have the right to be
substituted for the attorney of record of the holder of the transfer of tax lien,
or appear as attorney of record for the holder of any such transfer of tax
lien, to conduct or defend any such action or proceeding in the name of the
holder of the transfer of tax lien, and to bring any other action or proceeding
for, on behalf of and in the name of the holder of such transfer of tax lien
as he or she may deem advisable, to take appeals, and to argue appeals
taken by the adverse party, as he or she may deem advisable. It shall be

matters, actions and proceedings relating to tax liens and transfers of tax
liens; to intervene on behalf of the city or of the holder of a transfer of tax
lien in, or to make the city a party to any action in which he or she believes
it to be to the interest of the city so to do, by reason of any matter arising
§ C19-24 YONKERS CODE § C19-25
C:238
under or relating to any tax lien or transfer of tax lien, or advertisement
of sale of tax liens. In any action or proceeding in which the Corporation
Counsel pursuant to this section shall be substituted, or shall appear, it
shall be without expense to the holder of the transfer of tax lien, and all
costs recovered on behalf of such holder of a transfer of tax lien in any
action or proceeding conducted or defended by the Corporation Counsel
shall belong to the city and shall be collected, applied and disposed of in the
same manner as are other costs recovered by the city.
§ C19-26. Vacation or cancellation of lien surrendered to city.
[Amended 11-4-2008 by L.L. No. 10-2008]
If a transfer of tax lien be vacated or be set aside or canceled, or if it be
adjudged that a transfer of tax lien is invalid or defective or insufficient to
transfer a tax lien to the purchaser thereof, or if in any action to foreclose
a tax lien, it be adjudged that a tax lien is not a valid lien on the premises
which it purports to affect, because of some irregularity in the proceedings
had, and if, in pursuance to any such adjudication, the purchaser of said
transfer of tax lien shall have surrendered such transfer of tax lien to
the Commissioner of Finance and shall have been repaid by the city the
amount paid for such transfer of tax lien, with interest and costs and
disbursements of the said action or proceeding in which such adjudication
was made, then and in that event, the tax lien which was purported to be
transferred and assigned in such transfer of tax lien shall remain as a valid
lien upon the premises which it affects, except to such extent as it may have
been adjudged irregular or invalid, and the Commissioner of Finance shall
proceed to sell anew, as provided in § C19-1 of this Article, so much of the
said tax lien as is not valid as if no prior sale purporting to transfer the said
tax lien had taken place.

No. 10-2008]

as in this Article provided, shall be lost, the Commissioner of Finance may
receive evidence of such loss, and on satisfactory proof of the fact shall
execute and deliver a duplicate to such person or persons who shall appear
entitled thereto, and may also, in his or her discretion, require a bond of
indemnity to the City of Yonkers.

11-4-2008 by L.L. No. 10-2008]

IN THE MATTER OF THE FORECLOSURE OF TAX LIENS BY

CHARTER OF THE CITY OF YONKERS.
PETITION OF FORECLOSURE OF TAX LIENS BY THE CITY OF
YONKERS
PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that on ____________________ the Commissioner
of Finance of the City of Yonkers filed in the office of the Westchester
County Clerk a list of parcels of property on which the City of Yonkers

by an action in rem pursuant to § C 19-30 Article XIX of the Charter of
the City of Yonkers.
The above-captioned proceeding is hereby commenced to enforce the
payment of delinquent taxes or other lawful charges which have
accumulated and become liens against certain property. The parcels to
which this proceeding applies are as follows: (insert descriptions and
the names of the owners of record of each such parcel as of the date of
the filing of the foreclosure list attached to petition.)

C:241
1. The tax account's certification and address;
2. The name of the last known owner;

All persons having an interest in the real property described in
the foreclosure list are hereby notified that the filing of the list
constitutes the commencement by the City of Yonkers of an action in
the Supreme Court, County of Westchester, to foreclose the tax liens
therein described by an action in rem and that the list constitutes
a notice of pendency of action and a complaint by the City of

§ C19-32 YONKERS CODE § C19-33
C:242
§ C19-33. Mailing Notice of Foreclosure. [Added 4-12-2011 by L.L.
No. 5-2011]
A. Parties entitled to notice. The Commissioner of Finance shall on or
before the date of the first publication of the petition and notice above
set forth cause a notice to be mailed to (i) each owner and any other
person whose right, title or interest was a matter of public record as of
the date the petition with foreclosure list was filed which right, title or
interest will be affected by the termination of the redemption period,
and whose name and address are reasonably ascertainable from the
public record, including the records in the offices of the Surrogate of
Westchester County, or from material submitted to Commissioner of
Finance pursuant to subdivision D of this section, and (ii) any other
person who has filed a notice of interest pursuant to § C19-37 of this
Article which has not expired.
B. Notification method.
(1) Such notice shall be sent to each such party both by certified mail
and ordinary first class mail, subject to the provisions of paragraph
4 of this subdivision. The notice shall be deemed received unless
both the certified mailing and the ordinary first class mailing are
returned by the United States postal service within forty-five days
after being mailed. In that event, the Commissioner of Finance or
his or her agent shall attempt to obtain an alternative mailing
address from the United States postal service. When notice is
required to be sent to the New York State Commissioner of
Taxation and Finance, an alternative notice may be used by the
Commissioner of Finance, in accordance with instructions
prescribed by the Commissioner of Taxation and Finance.
(2) If an alternative mailing address is found, the Commissioner of
Finance shall cause the notice to be mailed to such owner at such
address both by certified mail and by ordinary first class mail.
Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, such owner
may redeem the parcel in question or serve a duly verified answer
to the petition of foreclosure until either the thirtieth day after such
mailing, or the date specified by the notice of foreclosure as the last
day for redemption, whichever is later.
(3) If no alternative mailing address can be found, then in the case of
any owner, the Commissioner of Finance shall cause a copy of such
notice to be posted as provided herein on the property to which the
delinquent tax lien relates; in the case of a non-owner, the
Commissioner of Finance shall cause a copy of such notice to be
posted in his or her office and in the office of the Westchester
County Clerk. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary,
the party to whom such notice is directed may redeem the parcel in
question or serve a duly verified answer to the petition of
foreclosure until either the thirtieth day after such posting or
§ C19-33 CHARTER § C19-33
C:243
delivery, or the date specified by the notice of foreclosure as the
last day for redemption, whichever is later.
(4) Where an owner is listed as "unknown" on the tax roll and the name
of such owner cannot be found in the public record, the notice shall
be mailed to the property address by ordinary first class mail
addressed to "occupant" and a copy thereof shall be posted on the
property to which the tax lien relates.
C. Posting of notice. When a notice is required to be posted on the
property to which the delinquent tax lien relates pursuant to this
section, the posting shall be deemed sufficient if it is either (i) affixed to
a door of a residential or commercial structure on the premises, or (ii)
attached to a vertical object, such as a tree, post or stake, and plainly
visible from the road. Provided, that if, when visiting the premises for
this purpose, the Commissioner of Finance or his or her agent should
find thereon an occupant of suitable age and discretion, he or she may
deliver such notice to such occupant in addition to or in lieu of posting
it. The process of so posting or delivering such notice shall warrant the
imposition of an extra charge of one hundred dollars against the parcel,
in addition to any other charges authorized by this Article and without
regard to any limitations set forth therein.
D. Changes of address. It shall be the responsibility of any party entitled to
notice pursuant to this section to notify the Commissioner of Finance
when his, her or its address changes. Such notification need not be in
any particular form as long as it is in writing, affirmatively states that
such party's address has changed or uses language to that effect, and
sets forth the new address. It shall not suffice to submit to the
Commissioner of Finance an item that merely displays the new address,
such as a check upon which the new address has been imprinted, or a
letter or envelope which uses the new address as the return address,
unless such submission includes language clearly indicating that such
address is that party's new address. In the event that a foreclosure
proceeding is challenged on grounds of lack of notice, and the party
raising this issue failed to provide a current address to the
Commissioner of Finance pursuant to this paragraph, the court having
jurisdiction may take such failure into account when evaluating
whether reasonable notice was given.
E. Public record. For purposes of this section, the public record shall be
deemed to consist of the books or records maintained by the
Westchester County Clerk in which the property is located, the books or
records kept by the clerk of the Surrogate's Court of Westchester
County in which the property is located pursuant to section twenty-five
hundred two of the surrogate's court procedure act, the tax rolls in the
possession of the Commissioner of Finance dated from the applicable
lien date forward.
F. Content of notice. The notice to be so mailed shall consist of (a) a copy
of the petition, provided that such copies need not include the
§ C19-33 YONKERS CODE § C19-33
C:244
descriptions or the names of the owners of any parcels in which the
addressee does not have an interest, and (b), a statement substantially
as follows:
To the _______________________ (property owner, lien holder, party
claiming interest)
You are presumed to own or have a legal interest in one or more

rights in that property.
To avoid loss of ownership or of any other rights in the property,
all unpaid taxes and other legal charges must be paid prior to
_______________ (insert the last date to redeem) or you must interpose
a duly verified answer in the proceeding. You may make payment to
The City of Yonkers, Commissioner of Finance, 40 South Broadway,
Room 210, Yonkers, New York 10701, in the amount of all such unpaid
taxes and legal charges prior to that date. You may wish to contact an
attorney to protect your rights.
After _______________ (insert the last date to redeem), a court will
transfer the title of the property to the City of Yonkers by means of a
court judgment.
Should you have any questions regarding this notice, please call
______________ (insert the name of the Commissioner of Finance) at
(914) 377-6160.
(1) An affidavit of mailing of such notice shall be executed.

as provided by law.
(3) The service of the notice required by this section shall be deemed
to be equivalent to the service of a notice of petition pursuant to
section four hundred three of the civil practice law and rules.
(4) (a) Nothing contained herein shall be construed to preclude the
Commissioner of Finance from issuing, at his or her discretion,
a duplicate of any such notice, clearly labeled as such, through
means other than ordinary first class mail, including but not
limited to personal service, registered or certified mail,
facsimile transmission, or electronic mail.
(b) Nothing contained herein shall be construed to preclude the
Commissioner of Finance from issuing at his or her discretion,
one or more informal notices to an owner or other party prior
to issuing the notice required by this section.

§ C19-34. Presumption of validity. [Added 4-12-2011 by L.L. No.
5-2011]
It shall not be necessary for the City to plead or prove that all steps and
proceedings required by law for the assessment and levy of the taxes or
other lawful charges against the parcels of real property set forth in the
petition and all such taxes or other lawful charges and the lien thereof shall
be presumed to be valid. A respondent alleging any jurisdictional defect
or invalidity in the tax, or in the proceeding for the enforcement thereof,
must particularly specify in his or her answer such jurisdictional defect
or invalidity and must affirmatively establish such defense. The provisions
of this Article shall apply to and be valid and effective with respect to all
respondents even though one or more of them be infants, incompetents,
absentees, or non-residents of the State of New York.

(c) The failure of the Commissioner of Finance to mail any such
discretionary notice, or the failure of an intended recipient to
receive such a notice, shall not invalidate any tax or prevent
the enforcement of the same as provided by law.
(d) Any notice mailed by ordinary first class mail pursuant to
subdivision one of this section may also be mailed in duplicate
by certified mail at the option of the Commissioner of Finance.
A. At any time up to the redemption deadline date, any person may redeem
any parcel on the foreclosure list by paying to the Commissioner of
Finance the full amount of the tax lien stated on the foreclosure list,
plus accrued taxes, interest and late payment charges.
B. The person redeeming shall be entitled to a certificate of redemption
from the Commissioner of Finance describing the parcel in the same
manner in which it is described in the foreclosure list. Upon the filing of
such certificate in the office of the Westchester County Clerk, the Clerk
shall mark "redeemed" and the date of such filing opposite the
description of such parcel on such list. Such notation shall operate to
cancel the notice of pendency of action with respect to such parcel, and
the foreclosure action shall be deemed withdrawn with respect to such
parcel.
A. In the event the City should hold more than one tax lien against a
parcel, the liens need not be redeemed simultaneously. However, the
liens must be redeemed in reverse chronological order, so that the lien
with the most recent lien date is redeemed first, and the lien with the
earliest lien date is redeemed last. Notwithstanding the redemption of
one or more of the liens against a parcel as provided herein, the
foreclosure of any open liens held by the City shall proceed according to
§ C19-33 YONKERS CODE § C19-36

the provisions of this Article as long as the earliest lien remains
unredeemed.
B. (1) Whenever one or more liens against a parcel are redeemed as
provided herein, but the earliest lien remains unredeemed, the
receipt issued to the party redeeming shall include a statement in
substantially the following form: "This parcel remains subject to
one or more delinquent tax liens. The payment you have made will
not postpone the foreclosure of the outstanding lien or liens.
Continued failure to pay the entire amount owed will result in the
loss of the property."
(2) Failure to include such a statement on the receipt shall not
invalidate any tax lien or prevent the enforcement of the same as
provided by law.
C. When all of the liens against the parcel have been redeemed, a
certificate of redemption shall be issued upon request, as provided
under § C19-35 of this Article.
A. At any time up to the redemption deadline date, any person who has any
interest in any parcel on the foreclosure list, and who wishes to
preserve that interest during the pendency of the foreclosure action,
may serve a verified notice of interest upon the Corporation Counsel.
Such notice shall specify by tax identification account number the
parcel or parcels to which it pertains and shall set forth the nature and
amount of the interest in the parcel.
B. At any time up to the redemption deadline date, any person who has any
interest in any parcel on the foreclosure list, and who has a legal
defense or objection to the foreclosure of the tax lien on such parcel,
may serve a verified answer upon the Corporation Counsel. Such
answer shall specify by tax identification account number the parcel or
parcels to which it pertains and shall set forth the nature and amount of
the alleged interest in the parcel, along with the factual and legal basis
for the defense or objection to the foreclosure.
C. Any such notice of interest or answer must be filed in the office of the
Westchester County Clerk.

by the redemption deadline date, or by the deadline specified in the notice
mailed pursuant to § C 19-38 if such a notice was mailed to such person,

foreclosure may be granted without regard for, and in extinguishment of,

triable issue of fact, request the court to refer the matter immediately
for a hearing.
C. Upon the hearing, there shall be a presumption that the tax lien is valid
in all respects. A person alleging any jurisdictional defect or invalidity
in the tax lien must particularly specify in his or her answer such
jurisdictional defect or invalidity and must affirmatively establish such
defense. Proof that the tax was paid together with any interest or
penalty which may have been due, or that the property was not subject
to the tax, shall constitute a complete defense. Any hearing shall be
given preference over all other causes and actions.
D. If the Commissioner of Finance determines that a notice of interest duly
served upon him or her is without merit, he or she shall either move the
court for summary judgment or, if there appears to be a triable issue of
fact, request the court to refer the matter immediately for a hearing.
The person asserting the validity of the interest shall have the burden of
proving it.
E. If no such motion is made to challenge a notice of interest duly served
upon the Commissioner of Finance, the interest alleged in said notice of
interest shall be deemed admitted.
A. At any time up to the date two weeks prior to the redemption deadline
date, any eligible owner of a parcel on the foreclosure list may apply to

§ C19-39 YONKERS CODE § C19-41
C:248
the Commissioner of Finance to enter in a delinquency agreement with
respect to that parcel.
B. The Commissioner of Finance is hereby authorized and directed to
make rules and regulations regarding the eligibility of persons to enter
into such agreements. In making the rules and regulations, the
Commissioner of Finance shall take into consideration the goals of
encouraging resident homeownership, maintaining and using property
in compliance with the law and City policies, discouraging abandoned
or vacant buildings and generally restricting the availability of such
agreements to persons with bona fide financial need.
C. A delinquency agreement for any parcel shall require payment to the
Commissioner of Finance of the full amount of any tax lien against that
parcel on the foreclosure list, plus interest and late payment charges
accrued to date; plus any other past due installment of taxes,
assessments, fees or charges, including accrued interest and late
payment charges, against that parcel, in the following manner: A
down96 at the time of execution of the agreement. The balance of the
total amount shall be paid in periodic installments over a specified
period of time not to exceed five years. Interest shall accrue on the
outstanding balance at the same rate provided generally for taxes in
§ C18-7 of the City Charter. The agreement shall provide that all or any
part of the outstanding balance may be paid ahead of schedule to the
Commissioner of Finance, with no penalty and with only such interest
as has accrued to the date of payment. The Commissioner of Finance is
authorized to make rules and regulations regarding the terms,
execution and enforcement of delinquency agreements and to
incorporate in each delinquency agreement additional and different
terms and condition, as he or she deems appropriate, consistent with
the provisions of this section and the applicable rules and regulations.
D. All rules and regulations promulgated by the Commissioner of Finance
pursuant to this section, including all amendments thereto, shall be
filed in the office of the City Clerk and officially communicated to the
City Council.
E. A delinquency agreement shall not be assignable unless specifically
permitted in writing by the Commissioner of Finance.
F. The court may, on motion of the Corporation Counsel, grant a stay of
proceedings, prior to entry of final judgment in foreclosure, as to any
parcel for which delinquency agreement has been executed.
G. Default on a delinquency agreement shall be deemed to occur when any
payment required under the agreement, either of the outstanding
balance or of an installment of current taxes, assessments, fees and
other charges, is not paid within 30 days of its due date under the
agreement or when such parcel is sold and the agreement is not

assigned to the new owner or upon the occurrence of any other event
designated in the agreement as a default. Upon default the Corporation
Counsel may make a motion to the court to vacate the stay with respect
to that parcel. The motion shall be made on notice to the owner of the
parcel and to any other person who has requested, in writing, that he or
she be notified of any default on the agreement. If the court finds that
a default on the agreement has occurred, it shall vacate the stay and
enter final judgment in foreclosure as to that parcel.
H. Upon compliance with all terms of the agreement and payment of all
amounts due under the agreement, the foreclosure proceeding shall be
withdrawn and discontinued as to that parcel, and the notice of
pendency of action as to such parcel shall be canceled.
A. The Commissioner of Finance may at any time prior to final judgment
withdraw any parcel of real property from a foreclosure proceeding
under this Article for one or more of the following reasons:
(1) There is reason to believe that there may be a legal impediment to
the enforcement of the tax lien affecting such parcel;
(2) With respect to any unpaid tax levied or imposed against property,
property of New York State or United States where it is determined
that the lien cannot be enforced;
(3) The enforcement of the lien has been stayed by the filing of a
petition pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code of 1978 (Title Eleven of
the United States Code), whereby the requirements as prescribed
by § 1140 of the Real Property Tax Law shall be applicable to such
lien.
(4) If the tax district were to acquire the parcel, there is a significant
risk that it might be exposed to a liability substantially in excess of
the amount that could be recovered by enforcing the tax lien;
(5) The owner of the parcel has entered into a delinquency agreement
to pay the taxes in installments pursuant to § C19-41 of this Article
and has not defaulted thereon;
(6) The owner of the parcel has been deployed by the military and (i)
the parcel has been included on a petition for foreclosure, (ii) has
been demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Commissioner of
Finance that the parcel is residential, (iii) the property is eligible
for the extended redemption period pursuant to § 1113 of the Real
Property Tax Law.
(7) The tax lien has been or is to be sold pursuant to § C19-4 of this
Article.
§ C19-41 YONKERS CODE § C19-42
C:250
B. Procedure.
(1) Upon the withdrawal from foreclosure of any parcel of real
property, the Commissioner of Finance shall issue a certificate of
withdrawal, setting forth the facts which render the parcel eligible
for withdrawal from foreclosure. The certificate shall be filed with
the Clerk of the City of Yonkers.
(2) If the parcel has been included on a list of delinquent taxes that has
been filed pursuant to § C19-31 of this Article, the Commissioner of
Finance shall file a copy of the certificate of withdrawal with the
Westchester County Clerk within ten business days from the
issuance of the certificate. The Westchester County Clerk shall note
the word "withdrawn" and the date of such filing opposite the
description of such parcel on the list.
C. Effect. The filing of such a certificate shall have the effect of
withdrawing the affected parcel from foreclosure; provided, that (a) the
filing shall have no effect upon the tax lien or liens against the affected
parcel, nor if the parcel has been included on a foreclosure list that has
been filed pursuant to § C19-31 of this Article, upon the notice of
pendency with respect to any such parcel, unless the lien should be
cancelled pursuant to subdivision six of this section or such other law as
may be applicable; and (b) if the lien is not cancelled, the foreclosure
proceeding may be reinstated in the manner provided in subdivision D
of this section, or a supplementary proceeding to enforce collection of
the delinquent tax may be commenced in the manner provided in this
section.
D. Reinstatement.
(1) The Commissioner of Finance shall reinstate a withdrawn
foreclosure proceeding if (i) he or she determines that the parcel is
no longer eligible for withdrawal from foreclosure, or (ii) the City
Council adopts a resolution directing the Commissioner of Finance
to reinstate such proceeding.
(2) The Commissioner of Finance shall issue a certificate of
reinstatement setting forth the reasons for the reinstatement of the
proceeding.
(3) If the parcel has been marked "withdrawn" on the foreclosure list
that has been filed pursuant to § C19-31 of this Article, the
Commissioner of Finance shall file a copy of the certificate with the
Westchester County Clerk within ten business days from the
issuance of the certificate. The Westchester County Clerk shall note
the word "reinstated" and the date of the filing of the certificate of
reinstatement opposite the description of such parcel on the list.
(4) The Commissioner of Finance shall file a petition of foreclosure
pertaining to the affected parcel as soon thereafter as is
§ C19-42 CHARTER § C19-42
C:251
§ C19-43. Final judgment. [Added 4-12-2011 by L.L. No. 5-2011]
practicable, but in no event shall such petition be filed sooner than
twenty-one months after the lien date.
E. Supplementary proceedings. In addition to any other available
remedies under this Article, if a foreclosure proceeding has been
withdrawn, the Commissioner of Finance may commence a
supplementary proceeding to collect the delinquent taxes in the manner
provided by § 990 of the Real Property Tax Law if (a) he or she
determines that doing so would be an effective means to enforce
collection of the delinquent tax, or (b) the governing body of the tax
district adopts a resolution directing the enforcing officer to commence
such a proceeding. Such a proceeding may be commenced within one
year from the issuance of a certificate of withdrawal, notwithstanding
the fact that the enforcing officer may have previously proceeded
pursuant to the provisions of this article.
F. Cancellation. After a foreclosure proceeding has been withdrawn, the
City Council may cancel the delinquent tax lien if it determines that
there is no practical method to enforce the collection of the delinquent
tax lien and that a supplementary proceeding to enforce collection of
the tax would not be effective. A copy of the resolution directing the
cancellation of the lien shall be filed with the Commissioner of Finance.
A. For all parcels for which neither an answer nor a notice of interest has
been served or for which an answer or notice of interest has been
served but has been determined by the court to be without merit, the
court shall make a final judgment authorizing and directing the
Commissioner of Finance to prepare, execute and record a deed
conveying to the City of Yonkers title to the parcels and awarding to the
City immediate and complete possession of the parcels. The description
used in the deed shall be that contained in the foreclosure list and may
also include any other description contained in the conveyance to the
last known owners of the parcels. Upon the execution of the deed, the
City of Yonkers shall own each parcel in fee simple absolute free and
clear of all liens and encumbrances existing at the time the deed is
executed, and all other persons who may have had any interest in or
upon any parcel shall be barred and forever foreclosed of all such
interest.
B. For any parcel for which an answer has been duly served and which has
been determined by the court to state a meritorious defense, the court
shall make a final judgment dismissing the foreclosure action with
respect to the parcel and canceling the notice of pendency of action
with respect to the parcel, or granting such other relief as the court
may deem just and proper.
C. For any parcel for which a notice of interest has been duly served and
which has been either admitted by the City or determined by the court

extending, widening, altering, straightening, altering of grade, grading,
regrading, paving, surfacing, narrowing, and discontinuing of public

a map or plan of the proposed improvement to be made, and such map or
plan has been deposited in the office of the City Clerk. After the deposit of
such map or plan, the City Council shall cause such ordinance, with a notice
of the time of a meeting of the City Council to hear allegations in regard to
such improvement, to be published in the official newspaper or newspapers
of the said city, once in each week for two successive weeks; and shall
cause a copy of such ordinance and notice to be served upon the owners
or occupants of the lands contained in the assessment district, if any, and
upon the parties interested in the lands to be taken for such improvement,
by certified mail addressed to the addresses listed for said land by the
Department of Finance of the City of Yonkers in its address book of real
properties, entitled, "Official Address Book of Real Properties," and where
more than one address appears in said book, the ordinance and notice shall
be mailed to each of said addresses, at least ten days before the meeting
of the City Council. At the meeting of the City Council appointed in such
notice for the hearing of allegations, or at any adjournment thereof, the City
Council must hear the allegations of persons interested who appear; and
at any subsequent meeting, the City Council may take any action in regard
to such ordinance that it may deem proper. Whenever, after publication
of notice for hearing of allegations and service thereof in regard to the
improvement directed by any ordinance, such ordinance, is amended by
increasing or reducing the portion of the city to be assessed, such amended
ordinance shall not be passed until after such ordinance and notice shall
have been published and served, and a meeting to hear allegations in
regard to the improvement directed therein held as hereinabove provided.
The provisions of this section shall not apply to streets dedicated and the
acceptance of such dedicated streets, as provided in Article XXI.
§ C20-3. Claims against city. [Amended 11-4-2008 by L.L. No.
10-2008]
Unless a claim for damages arising from the alteration of the grade or
the discontinuance of a public street, or any part thereof, be filed with
the Corporation Counsel by the owner of the building, structure or land
alleged to be damaged thereby, or by his or her authorized attorney, within
six weeks after an ordinance directing such improvement shall take effect,
§ C20-1 YONKERS CODE § C20-3
C:260
all such alleged damages shall be deemed to be waived and shall not
afterwards be recoverable. No building or other structure shall be deemed
to have sustained damages by reason of the alteration of the grade of any
public street, highway or place, unless such building or structure shall
have been built with reference to conform to the previously established
grade; and no assessment heretofore levied or to be hereafter levied, upon
any land for the improvement of a public street, shall be subject to attack
or declared void or reduced on account of the alteration of the grade of
such street, highway or place, unless there was upon such land, prior to
the improvement, a building or other structure built with reference to,
or to conform with the previously established grade of such street. The
Corporation Counsel, subject to the approval of the Commissioner of Public
Works and the City Council, may compromise and settle, in the same
manner as other claims against the city, any claim for damages arising from
the alteration of the grade or the discontinuance of a public street.
§ C20-4. Acquisition of lands. [Amended 11-4-2008 by L.L. No.
10-2008]
After any ordinance directing the laying out, opening, extending, widening,
altering or straightening of any public street shall take effect the
Commissioner of Public Works may acquire for the city any lands needed for
any of such improvements by gift, or by purchase at a price approved by the
City Council.
Assessment with Acquisition
§ C20-5. Acquisition procedures.
Whenever any ordinance directing the laying out, opening, extending,
widening, altering, straightening, altering the grade, narrowing or
discontinuing of any public street; laying out, opening, enlarging, improving
and maintaining public squares, parks and playgrounds, or any ordinance
directing the making of any local improvement requiring the taking of any
property, right or easement in land for any purpose authorized by law,
shall take effect and the lands, rights, interest or easements needed for
any such improvement shall not have been acquired as provided for in the
last preceding section, or whenever a claim for damages alleged to have
been caused by alteration of grade or discontinuance of a public street shall
have been filed with the Corporation Counsel, and such claim shall not have
been compromised and settled, as provided in § C20-3 of this Article, the
Commissioner of Public Works by the Corporation Counsel shall apply to the
County Court of Westchester County, or to the Supreme Court at a special
term held in the judicial district in which said county shall then be situated,
for the appointment of three persons as commissioners to estimate and
assess the expense of the improvement, and to inquire into and appraise the
compensation to be paid for the property to be taken for such improvement
or the damages occasioned by the alteration of grade or discontinuance
of a public street as the case may be, and also the benefits to be derived
therefrom by the owners of land and buildings affected thereby.
§ C20-3 CHARTER § C20-6
C:261
§ C20-6. Notice by Corporation Counsel.
Notice of application, and of the time and place thereof, signed by the
Corporation Counsel, shall be served upon the owners or occupants of the
lands contained in the assessment district, if any, and the parties interested
in the lands to be taken for such improvement, or alleged to be damaged
by reason of an alteration of grade or discontinuance of a public street, by
publishing the same in the official newspaper or newspapers of the city for
at least ten days prior to the time named in such notice for the making of
such application. The Corporation Counsel shall cause a copy of such notice
to be served at least ten days prior to the time named therein for the making
of such application, upon the owner or occupant of every lot or building, any
part of which is to be taken for such improvement, or alleged to be damaged
by an alteration of grade or discontinuance of a public street, and upon the
owners or occupants of the lands contained in the assessment district if any.
Such service shall be made by certified mail addressed to the addresses
listed for said land by the Department of Finance of the City of Yonkers in
its address book of real properties, entitled, "Official Address Book of Real
Properties," and where more than one address appears in said book, the
notice shall be mailed to each of said addresses.
§ C20-7. Appointment of Commissioners. [Amended 11-4-2008 by
L.L. No. 10-2008]
At the time and place specified in the notice, or at such other time to
which the court may adjourn the proceeding, the Commissioner of Public
Works, by the Corporation Counsel, shall make application to said court
for the appointment of three or more Commissioners; and upon proof by
affidavit being filed of the publication of such notice and service thereof, as
required by the last preceding section, and upon hearing the Corporation
Counsel on behalf of the city and also the parties interested, who appear
and desire to be heard, the court shall, by its order, appoint three or
more freeholders of the city, who are not interested in any of the land
required for such improvement or contained in the assessment district,
if any, or alleged to be damaged by reason of an alteration of grade or
discontinuance of a public street, nor of kin to any owner or occupant
thereof, as Commissioners to inquire into and appraise the compensation to
be paid for the parcel or parcels of land to be taken for such improvement
or damages as aforesaid, and the benefits to be derived therefrom by the
owners of land and buildings affected thereby, and to estimate and assess
the expenses of the improvement. If it shall appear at any stage of said
proceeding that any owner or party interested in any of the lands proposed
to be taken, for such improvement, or damaged as aforesaid, is an infant,
or has been judicially declared to be incompetent to manage his or her
affairs and has no general guardian or committee, the court shall appoint a
guardian ad litem of such person for the purposes of such proceeding. The
Corporation Counsel shall forthwith file with the City Clerk certified copies
of all orders made in any such proceeding.
§ C20-6 YONKERS CODE § C20-8
C:262
§ C20-8. Action by Commissioners. [Amended 11-4-2008 by L.L. No.
10-2008]
The Commissioners so appointed shall thereupon each take and subscribe
an oath that he or she is not interested in any of the property to be taken for
the purpose of such improvement, or alleged to be damaged as aforesaid,
or in any of the property included in the assessment district, if any, nor
of kin to any person so interested, and that he or she will discharge the
duties imposed upon him or her as such Commissioner without favor or
partiality. The Commissioners shall thereupon cause a notice of the time and
place at which they will meet to enter upon their duties, to be published
for at least two successive days, exclusive of Sundays and holidays, in the
official newspaper or newspapers of the city, and the Commissioners shall
also serve a copy of said notice upon the owners or occupants of the lands
contained in the assessment district, if any, and upon the parties interested
in the lands to be taken for such improvement, or alleged to be damaged
by reason of an alteration of grade or discontinuance of a public street, by
certified mail at least ten days prior to the date of the meeting addressed to
the addresses listed for said land by the Department of Finance of the City
of Yonkers in its address book of real properties, entitled, "Official Address
Book of Real Properties," and where more than one address appears in said
book, the notice shall be mailed to each of said addresses.
At the time and place specified in the notice, or subsequently at an
adjourned meeting, the said Commissioners shall view the premises
proposed to be taken, or alleged to be damaged as aforesaid, and the
property included in the assessment district, and shall receive and hear any
legal evidence that may be offered by any party interested. After hearing
the allegations and proofs of the several parties interested, they shall
ascertain and award to the respective owners of the property to be taken, or
damaged as aforesaid, and to all other persons interested in said property,
such amount as in their opinion will be just compensation or damages
to them, respectively, as the case may be. If there shall be a building or
buildings situated wholly or partly upon any of the lands so to be taken, the
Commissioners shall also determine the value for removal of such building
or buildings; or, if such building is only in part upon the land so to be taken,
then the value for removal of the part of the same that is upon the land to
be taken. The Commissioners must also make an assessment upon all the
pieces or parcels of land within the assessment district, apportioning the
total expense upon every piece or parcel of land according to the benefit as
nearly as can be ascertained which it is deemed to receive by the making of
the improvement.
§ C20-9. Inability to serve.
If any of the Commissioners so appointed decline to serve, or be or become
incapable of acting by reason of absence, death, sickness or other disability
or incapacity, the court appointing such Commissioners may, upon the
application of any party interested, and upon a ten days' notice to all
§ C20-8 CHARTER § C20-9
C:263
parties who have appeared in the proceeding, appoint a Commissioner or
Commissioners in place of those declining or unable to serve.
§ C20-10. Report of Commissioners.
The said Commissioners or a majority of them shall, as soon as may be,
make their written report, in tabular form, upon the matters referred to
them, in which report they shall set forth the whole expense of the proposed
improvement, and the several items thereof, including the incidental
expenses referred to in § C20-20 of this Article, and describe with all
practicable certainty the several parcels of land and the buildings, when
the buildings are owned separately from the land, to be taken for such
improvement, or damaged as aforesaid, and of all other lands included in
the assessment district, if any, either by metes and bounds or by reference
to a map attached to the report, and the names and residences of the
owners thereof, and of all other persons having a legal interest therein,
so far as the same have been ascertained by the Commissioners, and the
particular rights and interest respectively of such owners or other persons,
so far as can be ascertained and the amount of compensation to be paid
to such respective owners or other persons interested in the property so to
be taken or damaged as aforesaid; the amount assessed upon each piece
or parcel of land, and on the different interests therein, the balance of
award to be received by different parties over the assessment on their
respective land; the balance of assessment to be paid by each person, the
assessment on whose land amounts to more than the award, and with so
many and such different columns and statements as may be necessary to
designate the interest of the parties in the lands or rights required for the
improvement, and their liabilities in relation thereto. If any owners or other
persons interested in the property are unknown, that fact shall be stated
in said report. Such report, with all the evidence, if any, taken before such
Commissioners, shall be by them delivered to the Corporation Counsel.
§ C20-11. Filing of report. [Amended 11-4-2008 by L.L. No.
10-2008]
Upon receipt of such report and evidence, the Corporation Counsel shall
file the same with the City Clerk for examination by all parties interested,
and he or she shall give notice by mail to all parties who have appeared
at any stage in the proceeding, that such report is so filed and shall also
publish once in the official newspapers notice that such report is so filed,
and that the Commissioners of Appraisal and Assessment will meet at the
time and place therein specified, not less than ten days from the publication
and service of such notice, to review their report. During such time the said
report may be examined, free of expense, by all interested, and, at the time
and place so specified, any such person may be heard thereon, and may
present objections thereto in writing accompanied by such affidavits as he
or she may think proper. The Commissioners shall, as soon as convenient
thereafter, review their report, correct the same where they shall deem
proper, and file it with the City Clerk. At the time of filing said report the
Commissioners shall also file a certificate of their proceedings, which may
§ C20-9 YONKERS CODE § C20-11
C:264
be read in evidence, and shall be presumptive evidence as to the facts
therein stated. In case of any alteration of an assessment or award being
made, after such hearing, they shall, before filing their report, cause to be
published once in the official city newspapers and serve upon all parties
who have appeared at any stage in the proceeding by mail a notice that such
report has been altered and deposited with the City Clerk, and that at a time
and place therein stated, not less than ten days from the publication and
service of such notice, they will meet to hear and receive objections thereto,
and as often as such alteration is made, like notice shall be given. At the
time and place mentioned in such notice, the Commissioners shall attend
and hear and receive objections and affidavits on behalf of any person
whose award or assessment shall have been altered. The expense caused
by such alteration shall be assessed by the Commissioners, and shall not
be deemed an alteration of an assessment so as to require publication and
service of the notice thereof. The Corporation Counsel must then cause to
be published once in the official city newspapers and serve upon all parties
who have appeared at any stage in the proceeding by mail a notice that the
report has been completed and filed, and that application to have the report
confirmed will be made to the court, at a time and place to be specified in
said notice not less than ten days from the publication and service thereof,
that the Commissioner of Public Works, at a time and place to be stated in
such notice, will apply to the court for the confirmation of said report. A
copy thereof shall be served either personally, or by mail upon all the parties
interested in the property so to be taken, or damaged as aforesaid or within
the assessment district as the case may be, who have appeared at any stage
in the proceeding, or upon the attorneys for such parties as have appeared
by attorney, at least ten days before the time stated in said notice for said
application.
§ C20-12. Confirmation of report.
At the time and place designated in the notice, or at such other time and
place to which the court shall adjourn the matter, the court, upon proof of
service of said notice as required by the last preceding section, and after
hearing the Corporation Counsel and all parties interested who shall desire
to be heard upon such hearing, and who shall file in said court duly verified
objections to said report, or any part thereof, may by its order confirm the
same, or separately without alteration, so much thereof as relates to any
of the separate pieces or parcels of land referred to therein, if such report
shall embrace more than one parcel of land; or with such alteration, except
as to the amount of compensation or damages, or the amount of assessment
for benefit, as the case may be, as it shall deem proper; or it may set the
said report aside as to all or any of the parcels of land embraced therein.
§ C20-13. If report set aside.
If the said report be set aside, either in whole or in part, it shall be referred
by the court for rehearing before the same Commissioners, as to the whole
or any part of said report as to which it shall have been set aside. The
proceedings upon such rehearing shall be conducted in the same manner as
§ C20-11 CHARTER § C20-13
C:265
prescribed in this Article for the original hearing, and the Commissioners
shall make a like report thereon, and the same proceedings shall be had
for the confirmation of such second report, as are herein prescribed for the
confirmation of the original report.
§ C20-14. Filing of confirmed report; collection and payment of
assessments and awards. [Amended 11-4-2008 by L.L. No. 10-2008]
Whenever any such report shall be confirmed in whole or in part, in the
manner aforesaid, the Corporation Counsel shall cause a copy thereof, and
of the order confirming the same, each duly certified, to be filed in the office
of the City Clerk and of the Commissioner of Finance. The Corporation
Counsel shall also serve by mail upon all parties who have appeared at
any stage of the proceeding or upon the attorneys for such parties as have
appeared by attorneys, a copy of such order with notice of entry thereof
and upon such filing of the certified copy of said report in the office of the
City Clerk, said Clerk shall endorse thereon the day, hour and minute of
such filing and from such time the assessments embraced therein shall be
a lien on the real property against which the same are assessed superior to
all other liens and encumbrances. Thereupon the said report, or so much
thereof as has been confirmed, and the confirmation thereof shall be final
and conclusive, unless an appeal be taken therefrom within the time and
in the manner provided by law for appeals from final orders. After the
filing of the certified copy of the report in the office of the Commissioner
of Finance he or she shall pay to each person to whom an award shall
have been made in such report, or to his or her legal representatives or
assigns, the amount of said award in excess of assessments against him or
her, provided however, that no such payment shall be made until the time
to appeal has expired. After the filing of such certified copy in the office of
the City Clerk, the City Clerk, under the direction of the City Council, shall
make an assessment list, which shall be a correct schedule of the several
assessments in said report, which have not been deducted from awards
made, or which shall exceed in amount the amount of the award on the
same property, and shall certify the same to the Commissioner of Finance
with a warrant attached thereto for the collection of the assessments stated
therein, in the same form as near as may be, as for the collection of taxes,
and signed in the same manner.
§ C20-15. Leases and other agreements.
Where the whole of any lot required to be taken for such improvement is
subject to a lease or other agreement, all the covenants and stipulations
contained in such lease or agreement shall, upon the final confirmation
of such report, as hereinbefore provided, cease and determine and be
absolutely discharged. Where a part only of such lot shall be required and
taken, as aforesaid, the said covenants and stipulations shall cease and
determine and be discharged so far only as relates to such part with respect
to which compensation has been made to all parties interested therein.
§ C20-13 YONKERS CODE § C20-16
C:266
§ C20-16. Removal of buildings. [Amended 11-4-2008 by L.L. No.
10-2008]
If a building is on any of the land taken for such improvement, the value
of which building, for removal, shall have been ascertained and reported
by the Commissioners aforesaid, and such report as to such parcel shall
have been finally confirmed in the manner aforesaid, the owner of such
parcel of land, upon filing with the City Clerk, within ten days after such
final confirmation, a written notice that he or she elects to remove such
building from the land so taken, at any time within thirty days after the
final confirmation of such report of the said Commissioners, or within such
further time as the Commissioner of Public Works may prescribe. If such
owner shall not, within the time above stated, file such notice with the
City Clerk, the Commissioner of Finance shall sell at auction to the highest
bidder for cash, such building, or so much thereof as shall stand upon the
land so taken, with the right to remove the same at any time within thirty
days after the city shall have taken possession of such land, and the amount
received in payment therefor shall be applied toward the compensation to
be paid for the property to be taken for such improvement. If such owner
shall elect to remove such building, the value of the same for removal as
appraised by said Commissioner, shall be deducted from the amount of
compensation awarded to him or her, and the remainder thereof shall be
in full for all compensation to be made to him or her by reason of such
improvement.
§ C20-17. Proceedings by city to be continued.
Whenever proceedings have been begun by the city, under the
Condemnation Law or under this Article, to acquire any real estate or
interest therein, including proceedings for acquiring property for street
openings, the court in which such proceedings are pending may at any stage
of such proceedings authorize the city, if in possession of the real estate,
rights or easements sought to be taken, to continue in possession thereof,
and may stay all actions or proceedings against it, on account thereof, or,
if the city is not in possession, may authorize the city to take immediate
possession of the real estate, rights or easements sought to be taken and
to demolish any structure located thereon, upon giving such security or
depositing such sum of money as the court may direct, to be held as security
for the payment of the compensation which may finally be awarded. In
case possession is retained or taken under this section, the condemnation
proceeding cannot thereafter be abandoned.
§ C20-18. Acquisition of additional real property.
When used in this section or in § C20-19 of this Article, unless otherwise
expressly stated or unless the context of subject matter otherwise requires,
the word "improvement" shall be construed as synonymous with the phrase
"laying out, widening, extending or relocating a park, public place, highway
or street." The term "excess lands" or the term "additional lands" or the
term "additional real property" shall be construed as synonymous with the
§ C20-16 CHARTER § C20-18
C:267
phrase "real property in addition, or additional to the real property needed
or required for laying out, widening, extending or relocating a park, public
place, highway or street." The City of Yonkers in acquiring real property
for an improvement may acquire more real property than needed for the
actual construction of the improvement. The City Council of the City of
Yonkers may by ordinance authorize the city to acquire additional real
property in connection with any improvement and direct that the same
be acquired with the real property to be acquired for the improvement;
provided that such additional real property shall be not more than sufficient
to form suitable building sites abutting on the improvement. The title to
which the City of Yonkers shall acquire additional real property shall be
fee simple absolute. Additional real property shall be acquired by the city
in connection with a street improvement only when the title acquired for
the improvement shall be in fee. The acquisition of title to additional real
property in connection with an improvement shall be authorized in the same
manner and at the same time as the acquisition of title to the real property
required for the improvement is authorized. When the acquisition of title
to additional real property in connection with an improvement shall have
been authorized, title to such additional real property shall be acquired
by the city in the manner and according to the procedure, except in such
respects as are herein set forth, provided for the acquisition of title to real
property required for the improvement and in the same proceeding in which
title to the real property required for the improvement shall be acquired.
[Amended 11-4-2008 by L.L. No. 10-2008]
Every ordinance which shall authorize the acquisition of additional real
property in connection with any improvement shall provide that the City
Engineer shall make a plain and accurate map showing the real property
to be acquired for the improvement and such additional real property
to be acquired in connection with the real property to be acquired for
the improvement. When additional real property is to be taken by
condemnation, the Commissioner of Public Works when applying to the
County Court of Westchester or the Supreme Court for the appointment of
Commissioners to estimate and assess the expense of the improvement and
to inquire into and appraise the compensation to be paid for the property to
be taken for such improvement, shall cause to be separately described such
additional real property to be so taken in the notice of the application for
the appointment of Commissioners and in the petition presented upon such
application, and such notice and petition shall state what part of the real
property to be condemned is required for the improvement, and what part
thereof is to be acquired as additional real property. The acquisition of such
additional real property when duly authorized shall be deemed to be for a
public purpose.
Whenever proceedings shall have been begun by the city under the
Condemnation Law or under this Article to acquire any real estate or any
interest therein or whenever proceedings have been begun for acquiring
property for street openings in which proceedings additional real property
is to be acquired, the court in which such proceedings are pending may at
any stage of such proceedings, authorize the city to continue in possession
§ C20-18 YONKERS CODE § C20-18
C:268
of such additional real property or any part of the same, or to take
immediate possession of such additional real property or any part thereof
in the same manner now authorized by law in connection with the real
property required for such improvement. Title to such additional real
property shall vest in the city at the same time and subject to the same
conditions as apply to other lands acquired for the improvement.
Whenever an ordinance shall have been adopted as in this section provided,
for the purpose of an "improvement" as in this section defined, such
ordinance may be amended by authorizing the acquisition of lands
additional to those required for the improvement. All provisions of law now
applying to the payment by the city for lands taken under the provisions
of this Article shall apply with reference to the payment for additional real
property taken hereunder.
After title to the real property required for the improvement and to the
additional lands shall have vested in the city, the additional lands may
be either held and used by the city, or sold or leased by it as provided
by law. The City Council may provide that such additional lands shall be
sold or leased subject to such restrictions, covenants or conditions as to
location of buildings with reference to the real property acquired for the
improvement, or the height of buildings or structures, or the character of
construction and architecture thereof, or such other covenants, conditions
or restrictions as it may deem proper; and such additional lands shall be
sold or leased subject to such restrictions, covenants or conditions, if any, as
may be prescribed, which shall be set forth in the instrument of conveyance
or lease.[Amended 11-4-2008 by L.L. No. 10-2008]
§ C20-19. Assessment of expenses. [Amended 11-4-2008 by L.L. No.
10-2008]
In every proceeding in which lands additional to those required for the
improvement shall be acquired, the City Council shall have power by
ordinance to provide that the whole of the expense of any such improvement
be assessed upon the property deemed benefited, or, that the whole or a
portion of such expense, which shall be specified in such ordinance, be
borne by the city at large and the remainder, if any, assessed upon the
property deemed benefited, provided however, that not more than fifty per
cent of such expense shall be assessed upon the property deemed benefited,
except by a two-thirds vote of all the members of the Council.
Where part of a parcel of real property shall be acquired for an
improvement, and the remainder or a portion of the remainder of such
parcel in the same ownership shall be acquired in the same proceeding
as excess lands, the portion of the damages due to the acquisition of
the real property required for the improvement, shall be determined and
stated separately from the entire damage due to each such owner. In
determining the damages due to the acquisition of that portion of such
parcel, which is required for the improvement, which shall be the portion
thereof properly assessable, the same rule shall be applied as would govern
the determination of damages for the taking of the real property required
§ C20-18 CHARTER § C20-19
C:269
for the improvement, in case no excess lands were acquired. Where part
of a parcel of real property shall be acquired for the improvement, and the
remainder or a portion of the remainder thereof in the same ownership shall
be acquired in the same proceeding, as excess lands, the damages due to
the acquisition of title to the real property required for the improvement,
which shall constitute the portion of the owner's total damages as to such
parcel, on account of the proceeding, which shall be properly assessable,
shall, in every case, equal the amount which would be awarded to such
owner in case only that part of his or her real property, which shall be
required for the improvement, were acquired.
The aggregate of damages due to the acquisition of the real property
required for the improvement shall be determined by the court or other
tribunal authorized to determine the compensation to be paid to the owners
and when so determined be assessed as a part of the damages in the
proceeding. The real property acquired by the city in addition to that
required for the improvement shall be subject to assessment for benefit
due to the improvement and shall bear the proper share of the cost and
expense of the proceeding. The assessment, which shall be levied in any
proceeding, upon the real property acquired in addition to that required for
the improvement shall not in the case of any parcel assessed exceed onehalf
the value thereof. Nothing in this section contained shall be construed
as authorizing the awarding to an owner, part of whose real property is
taken for the improvement, and the remainder or a portion of the remainder
of whose real property is taken as additional lands, any greater amount of
compensation than such owner shall be entitled to, by reason of the taking
of his or her real property for the improvement and as additional lands,
considered together as one parcel.
The provisions of this section and of § C20-18 of this Article shall be
construed as supplementing and extending the effect of the provisions of
the other section of this Article so as to provide for the acquisition of
title to additional lands in connection with an improvement and for the
levying of assessments for benefit in such proceedings and nothing in
this section and § C20-18 of this Article contained shall be construed as
limiting the effect of the provisions of the other sections of this Article in
their application to the acquisition of title to real property required for an
improvement when acquired in a proceeding in which additional lands shall
or shall not be acquired or to the levying of assessments for benefit in such
proceedings, except as the provisions of the other sections of this Article
are in this section and in § C20-18 of this Article expressly so limited in their
application.
§ C20-20. Computation and assessment of total cost. [Amended
9-22-1970 by L.L. No. 11-1970; 11-4-2008 by L.L. No. 10-2008]
Upon the completion of any local improvement the Commissioner of

that it may deem proper. Whenever, after publication of the notice for
hearing of allegations and service thereof in regard to the improvement
directed by any ordinance, such ordinance is amended by increasing or
reducing the portion of the city to be assessed, such amended ordinance
shall not be passed until after such ordinance and notice shall have been
published and served and a meeting to hear allegations in regard to the
improvement directed therein held as hereinabove provided.

the city directed to be assessed, apportioning the expense upon each lot and
parcel of land according to the benefit as nearly as can be ascertained which
it is deemed to have received by the making of such improvement or work,
and for that purpose must make out an assessment roll in which must be
entered the names of the persons assessed so far as he or she can ascertain
the same, and the amount assessed against them, respectively, with a brief
description of the lots or parcels of land assessed.
§ C20-24. Notice regarding assessment roll. [Amended 4-27-1965

roll and has deposited it in his or her office where it may be examined
by any person interested until the time specified in such notice, when the
City Assessor will first hear the allegations and objections of all persons
interested in the assessment.
§ C20-25. Hearing. [Amended 7-22-1970 by L.L. No. 11-1970;
11-4-2008 by L.L. No. 10-2008]
At the time and place designated in such notice the City Assessor must hear
the allegations and objections of all persons interested, who appear, and
the assessment books must be open for the examination and inspection of
all parties interested. The City Assessor may adjourn from time to time as
deemed necessary, and may amend or correct such assessment roll as he or
she deems proper.
§ C20-26. Oaths. [Amended 7-22-1970 by L.L. No. 11-1970;
11-4-2008 by L.L. No. 10-2008]
When completed, an oath substantially in the following form must be
written or printed upon or attached to the assessment roll, and be signed
and sworn to by the City Assessor namely: "I, the undersigned, the City
Assessor of the City of Yonkers, being duly sworn, depose and say that the
foregoing assessment roll was made by me in pursuance of an ordinance
of the City Council; that due legal notice of a hearing was given, and
the assessment roll was by me adopted, after such notice and allegations
thereunder, and is, according to the best of my knowledge and belief, a just
and true assessment as against the persons or property to be benefited,
and according to the benefit derived." And he or she must sign a certificate
substantially in the following form, which must also be written or printed
upon or attached to the assessment roll: "I do hereby certify that the
foregoing assessment roll is a true record of my determination of the
same, after having heard allegations thereon, and I have fixed the amount
assessed against the respective persons and property therein named as
therein set forth, and the same is just and true." And thereupon the
assessment roll must be delivered to the City Clerk.
§ C20-27. Confirmation of assessment roll. [Amended 5-25-1971 by
L.L. No. 12-1971; 11-4-2008 by L.L. No. 10-2008]
When a local assessment roll is delivered to the City Clerk, he or she must
report it to the City Council at its next meeting. The City Council shall
give notice, to be published twice in the official newspaper or newspapers,
and shall cause a copy of said notice to be served upon the owners or
occupants of the lands contained in the assessment district, in the manner
provided in § C20-24 of this Article, that such assessment roll is filed with
the City Clerk and that at a time to be specified in such notice, which
shall not be less than ten days from the first publication thereof, it will
proceed to a consideration of such assessment roll. Prior to said day, any
person may file with the City Clerk written objections to such assessment
roll or any part thereof, which objections shall be read before the City
§ C20-24 CHARTER § C20-27
C:273
Council before any action shall be taken on such assessment roll. At the
time so appointed, or at some other time to which it may adjourn for that
purpose, the City Council or a committee thereof may hear the allegations
of any person interested who shall have filed such objections, and may
take proof in relation thereto. Such allegations and proof shall be confined
to the matters stated in such written objections. The City Council may
thereupon either confirm such assessment or may set the same aside and
order a new assessment. In no event, however, shall the City Council delay
in acting upon such assessment for a period in excess of ninety days after
the ordinance providing for the confirmance of the assessment first appears
on the City Council agenda. Whenever the City Council shall confirm an
assessment for a local improvement, the City Clerk shall enter on the
minutes of the City Council the date, hour and minute of such confirmation,
and from the time of such confirmation the assessments embraced in the
assessment roll shall be a lien on the real property against which the same
are assessed, superior to all other liens and encumbrances. After the roll is
confirmed, it must be delivered by the City Clerk to the Commissioner of
Finance.
§ C20-28. Council may correct assessment. [Amended 7-22-1970 by
L.L. No. 11-1970]
The City Council may correct, cancel or remit any assessment for a local
improvement, made by the City Assessor as aforesaid, believed by it to have
been erroneously assessed and may remit, cancel or adjust the interest or
penalties on any such assessment.
§ C20-29. Procedure when Council sets aside assessment.
[Amended 7-22-1970 by L.L. No. 11-1970]
The City Council has the power, when in its judgment there is any
irregularity, omission, error or lack of jurisdiction in any of the proceedings
relating thereto, to set aside the whole of a local assessment and thereupon
to cause a reassessment to be made. In such case, it shall pass an ordinance
designating the improvement involved, the whole expense thereof,
including all interest thereon to the date of the passage of such ordinance
on obligations issued by the city to pay the expense of such improvement
and the part or portion of the city deemed to be benefited thereby; and
it may direct the City Assessor to assess the lots and parcels of land
in such territory described, for such expense, according to the benefits
received, and proceed in all respects as in cases of local assessments;
and such reassessment has the same valid and binding force as if it had
originally been properly made. An ordinance setting aside the whole of a
local assessment and directing a reassessment thereof must provide that
any moneys paid on the assessment set aside, with interest at a rate
determined by the City Council not exceeding the rate received by the city
on such money, must be credited on the amount of the new assessment
against the property on which the assessment was paid, and that in case the
amount so paid exceeds the amount reassessed on the same property, such
§ C20-27 YONKERS CODE § C20-29
C:274
surplus, including the interest aforesaid, must be paid to the person who
may have paid the same.
§ C20-30. Payment of assessments. [Amended 5-13-1980 by L.L. No.
4-1980; 11-4-2008 by L.L. No. 10-2008]
A local assessment, if payable in one (1) sum, or the first installment, if
payment in installments, becomes due on the first of the month following
the month in which the assessment roll is received by the Commissioner
of Finance, if it is received on or before the 15th day of the month; and
if received after the 15th day of the month, then such assessment or
installment becomes due and payable on the 15th day of the month
following the month in which the assessment roll is received; and if payable
in installments, succeeding payments become due in each succeeding year
on the day and month the first installment became due. If any assessment
is payable in installments, there shall be added to the amount of each
installment, subsequent to the first installment, interest at the rate of
six per centum (6%) per annum computed from the date when the first
installment became due to the date when such subsequent installment shall
become due, unless such subsequent installment shall be previously paid, in
which event such interest shall be computed to the date of payment. To any
assessment or installment thereof paid after the same shall become due,
there shall be added interest at the rate of fifteen per centum (15%) per
annum, computed from the date when the same became due to the time
of payment, in addition to the interest to be added to any installment as
hereinbefore provided.
§ C20-31. Notice that payments are due. [Amended 4-27-1965 by
L.L. No. 6-1965; 11-4-2008 by L.L. No. 10-2008]
At least ten (10) days before the first installment is payable the
Commissioner of Finance must give notice by publication, for two (2)
successive days in the official newspaper or newspapers, requiring the
persons assessed or the owners or occupants of the lots assessed to pay the
same to the Commissioner at the Commissioner's office when due. No other
notice or publication shall be required for any of the future installments
due.
§ C20-32. Recovery of payments by tenant. [Amended 11-4-2008 by
L.L. No. 10-2008]
Any tenant, or other person, or a corporation, having a divided or undivided
interest in any land may pay all or any part of the taxes or assessments
due on such land, with the interest or charges due or charged thereon,
and recover by action against any person or corporation the amount, or
proportion of the amount, so paid, which such person or corporation ought
to have paid; or may retain the same from any rent due or accruing from
him or her or it to such person or corporation for the land so taxed.

Upon the application in writing of any person desiring to pay the tax or
assessment on or to redeem from sale heretofore made by the City of
Yonkers for an unpaid tax or assessment, a part of any lot of land, or
one or more lots of land, upon which, with other lots of land, a tax or
assessment has been levied, or upon the application of the Commissioner of
Finance, the City Assessor shall apportion in writing the tax or assessment
on such lot or lots of land, or the amount for which the same shall have
been sold, between the land which the applicant desires to pay the tax
or assessment upon, or to redeem, and the remaining part thereof, and
like proceedings may be had thereafter as if the land had been separately
assessed, and a separate amount of tax or assessments levied upon each.
Such apportionment shall be made in duplicate, and filed with the
Commissioner of Finance. But no apportionment shall be made of any taxes
or assessments upon any lot or plot of land unless a map of the entire lot
or plot and the portion or portions thereof for which the apportionment is
asked shall have been filed with the City Assessor; and a copy thereof shall
be filed with the Commissioner of Finance after the apportionment is made.

made to the Supreme Court within 30 days after the giving of the notice
of such determination. A proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil Practice
Law and Rules shall not be instituted unless the amount of any tax sought
to be reviewed, with penalties and interest thereon, if any, shall be first
deposited with the Comptroller and there shall be filed with the Comptroller
an undertaking, issued by a surety company authorized to transact business
in New York State, in such amount as a Justice of the Supreme Court
shall approve, to the effect that if such proceeding be dismissed or the tax
§ 15-4 YONKERS CODE § 15-6
C:404
confirmed, the petitioner will pay all costs and charges which may accrue
in the prosecution of the proceeding, or, at the option of the applicant,
such undertaking filed with the Comptroller may be in a sum sufficient to
cover the taxes, penalties and interest therein stated in such determination,
plus the costs and charges which may accrue against it in the prosecution

application.
§ 15-7. Refunds.
§ 15-8. Remedies exclusive.
The remedies provided by §§ 15-6 and 7 of this article shall be exclusive
remedies available to any corporation, association or person for the review
of tax liability imposed by this article.
§ 15-9. Proceedings to recover tax.
A. In the manner provided in this section, the Comptroller shall refund or
credit, without interest, any tax erroneously, illegally or
unconstitutionally collected or paid, if written application to the
Comptroller for such refund shall be made within one year from the
payment thereof. Whenever a refund is made by the Comptroller, the
reasons therefor shall be stated. The Comptroller may, in lieu of any
refund required to be made, allow credit therefor in payments due from
the applicant.
B. An application for a refund or credit made as herein provided shall be
deemed an application for a revision of any tax, penalty or interest
complained of, and the Comptroller may receive evidence with respect
thereto. After making his determination, the Comptroller shall give
notice to the corporation, association or person interested, who shall be
entitled to review such determination by a proceeding pursuant to
Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules, provided that such
proceeding is instituted within 30 days after the giving of the notice of
such determination and provided that a final determination of tax due
was not previously made. Such a proceeding shall not be instituted
unless an undertaking is filed with the Comptroller in such amount and
with such sureties as a Justice of the Supreme Court shall approve to
the effect that if such proceeding be dismissed or the tax confirmed, the
petitioner will pay all costs and charges which may accrue in the
prosecution of such proceeding.
C. A corporation, association or person shall not be entitled to a revision,
refund or credit of a tax under this section where it or he has had a
hearing or an opportunity for a hearing as provided in this article or has
failed to avail itself or himself of the remedies therein provided.
A. Whenever any corporation or association or any of its officers or any
other person shall fail to collect, retain and pay over any tax or to pay
§ 15-6 CHARTER § 15-9
C:405
any tax penalty or interest imposed by this article, as herein provided,
the Corporation Counsel shall, upon the request of the Comptroller,
bring or cause to be brought an action to enforce the same on behalf of
the City of Yonkers in any court of the State of New York or of any other
state or of the United States. If, however, the Comptroller believes that
any corporation, association or person subject to the provisions of this
article is about to cease business, leave the state or remove or dissipate
the assets out of which the tax or penalties might be satisfied, and that
any such tax or penalty will not be paid when due, he may declare
such tax or penalty to be immediately due and payable and may issue a
warrant immediately.
B. As an additional or alternate remedy, where the tax is not paid within 10
days after the close of any harness-race meeting, or where the
Comptroller believes that any corporation, association or person
subject to the provisions of this article is about to cease business, leave
the state or remove or dissipate the assets out of which the tax or
penalties might be satisfied, or for any other similar reason he deems it
necessary to protect the revenues under this article, he may issue a
warrant directed to the Sheriff of the County of Westchester
commanding him to levy upon and sell the real and personal property of
the corporation, association or person liable for the tax which may be
found within the City for the payment of the amount thereof, with any
penalties and interest, and the cost of executing the warrant, and to
return such warrant to the Comptroller and to pay to him the money
collected by virtue thereof within 60 days after the receipt of such
warrant. The Sheriff shall, within five days after the receipt of the
warrant, file with the County Clerk of the County of Westchester a copy
thereof, and thereupon such Clerk shall enter in the judgment docket
the name of the corporation, association or person mentioned in the
warrant and the amount of the tax, penalties and interest for which the
warrant is issued and the date when such copy is filed. Thereupon, the
amount of such warrant so docketed shall become a lien upon the title
to and interest in real and personal property of the corporation,
association or person against whom the warrant is issued. The Sheriff
shall then proceed upon the warrant in the same manner, and with like
effect, as that provided by law in respect to executions issued against
property upon judgment of a court of record, and for services in
executing the warrant, he shall be entitled to the same fees, which he
may collect in the same manner. In the discretion of the Comptroller, a
warrant of like terms, force and effect may be issued and directed to
any officer or employee of the Department of Finance and Management
Services, and in the execution thereof such officer or employee shall
have all the powers conferred by law upon sheriffs, but shall be entitled
to no fee or compensation in excess of the actual expenses paid in the
performance of such duty. If a warrant is returned not satisfied in full,
the Comptroller may from time to time issue new warrants and shall
also have the same remedies to enforce the amount due thereunder as if
the City had recovered judgment therefor and execution thereon had
been returned unsatisfied.

to a penalty of 5% of the amount of the tax due, plus interest at the rate of
1% of such tax for each month of delay. Such penalties and interest shall

association or person, any other provision of this article to the contrary
notwithstanding.
D. To delegate his functions hereunder to a Deputy Comptroller or other
employee or employees of the Department of Finance and Management
Services.
E. To assess, reassess, determine, revise and readjust the taxes imposed
by this article.

him, shall have power to administer oaths and take affidavits in relation

under this article. The Comptroller shall have power to subpoena and

performance of his duties hereunder and of the enforcement of this
article and to examine them in relation thereto and to issue
commissions for the examination of witnesses who are out of the state
or unable to attend before him or excused from attendance.
B. A Justice of the Supreme Court either in court or at chambers shall have
power summarily to enforce by proper proceedings the attendance and
testimony of witnesses and the production and examination of books,
papers and documents called for by the subpoena of the Comptroller
under this article.
§ 15-10 CHARTER § 15-12

be paid and disposed of in the same manner as other revenues from this
article. Unpaid penalties and interest may be enforced in the same manner
as the tax imposed by this article.

of the Racing, Pari-Mutuel Wagering and Breeding Law, pursuant to which
it is enacted.

§ 15-18. Records.
Every utility subject to tax under this section shall keep such records of its

destruction within that period or may require that they be kept longer.
§ 15-19. Returns. [Amended 6-27-1950 by L.L. No. 3-1950]
Every utility subject to tax hereunder shall file, on or before September

on which the return is required to be filed.

unsatisfactory to the Comptroller of the City of Yonkers, and if a corrected

by notice from the Comptroller of the City of Yonkers, or if no return is
made for any period, the Comptroller of the City of Yonkers shall determine
the amount of tax due from such information as he is able to obtain and,
if necessary, may estimate the tax on the basis of external indices or
otherwise. The Comptroller of the City of Yonkers shall give notice of
such determination to the person liable for such tax. Such determination
shall finally and irrevocably fix such tax, unless the person against whom
it is assessed shall, within 30 days after the giving of notice of such
determination, apply to the Comptroller of the City of Yonkers for a hearing,
or unless the Comptroller of the City of Yonkers of his own motion shall
reduce the same. After such hearing, the Comptroller of the City of Yonkers
shall give notice of his decision to the person liable for the tax. The decision
of the Comptroller of the City of Yonkers may be reviewed by a proceeding
under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules of the State of New
York, if application therefor is made within 30 days after the giving of notice
of such decision. An order to review such decision shall not be granted
unless the amount of any tax sought to be reviewed, with interest and
penalties thereon, if any, shall be first deposited with the Comptroller of the
City of Yonkers and an undertaking filed with him, in such amount and with
such sureties as a Justice of the Supreme Court shall approve, to the effect
that if such proceeding be dismissed or the tax confirmed, the applicant
will pay all costs and charges which may accrue in the prosecution of such
proceeding, or at the option of the applicant, such undertaking may be
in a sum sufficient to cover the tax, interest, penalties, costs and charges
aforesaid, in which event the applicant shall not be required to pay such
tax, interest and penalties as a condition precedent to the granting of such

postpaid envelope, addressed to such person at the address given by him
in the last return filed by him under this article or, if no return has been
filed, then to such address as may be obtainable. The mailing of such notice
shall be presumptive evidence of the receipt of the same by the person to
whom addressed. Any period of time, which is determined according to the
provisions of this article by the giving of notice, shall commence to run from
the date of mailing of such notice.
§ 15-23. Penalty for late payment.

article, the Corporation Counsel shall, upon the request of the Comptroller
of the City of Yonkers, bring an action to enforce payment of the same. The
proceeds of any judgment obtained in any such action shall be paid to the
Comptroller of the City of Yonkers. Each such tax and penalty shall be a lien
upon the property of the person liable to pay the same, in the same manner
and to the same extent that the tax and penalty imposed by § 186-b of the
Tax Law is made a lien.
§ 15-27. Power of Comptroller.

pertinent to the action or proceeding, and no more. Nothing herein
shall be construed to prohibit the delivery to a person, or his duly

Comptroller and the Commissioner of Taxation and Finance, shall
§ 15-53 YONKERS CODE § 15-54
C:446
pay from such fund on or before the specified date or within 30
days after such receipt, whichever is later, to the Comptroller of the
City of Yonkers, as the Chairman of such Financial Control Board
may direct in any such certificate, the amount so certified.
(4) In the event that the amount of revenues in the fund shall at any
time be more than the amount necessary to pay the maximum
amount of principal of and interest on obligations, issued pursuant
to Subsection B(3), payable in any consecutive twelve-month
period, and such fact is certified to the Comptroller and the
Commissioner of Taxation and Finance by the Chairman of the New
York State Financial Control Board for the City of Yonkers, such
excess shall be paid to the Comptroller of the City of Yonkers for
deposit in the Treasury of the City of Yonkers to the credit of the
City Treasury. Said certificate of the Chairman of the New York
State Financial Control Board for the City of Yonkers shall also
specify the amount to be paid and the date when payment is
requested to be made, and such payment shall be made on or
before the specified date or within 30 days after receipt of such
certificate, whichever is later.
(5) Revenues in such fund shall be kept separate and shall not be
commingled with any other money in the custody of the
Comptroller or the Commissioner of Taxation and Finance. All
deposits of such revenues shall, if required by the Comptroller and
the Commissioner of Taxation and Finance, be secured by
obligations of the United States or of the state having a market
value equal at all times to the amount of such deposits, and all
banks and trust companies are authorized to give security for such
deposits. Any such revenues in such fund may, in the discretion of
the Comptroller and the Commissioner of Taxation and Finance, be
invested in obligations of the United States or of the state or in
obligations the principal of and interest on which are guaranteed
by the United States or by the state.
C. Disposition of net collections from the additional 0.5% rate of sales and
compensating use taxes in the City of Yonkers shall be as follows:

0.5% rate of sales and compensating use taxes authorized by
Section 1210 of the New York State Tax Law, the City shall use the
net collections from such additional 0.5% rate solely for the support
of education, unless the City Council votes, on an additional basis,
to use such net collections for a different purpose of the City;
provided, however, that the requirements of Paragraph B of
Subdivision 5B of Section 2576 of the New York State Education
Law are met.

10-10-1989 by G.O. No. 10-1989; 6-23-1998 by G.O. No. 3-1998;
5-31-2005 by G.O. No. 7-2005153]
A tax is hereby imposed on each deed at the time of delivery by a grantor
to a grantee when the consideration for real property and any improvement
thereon (whether or not included in the same deed) exceeds $25,000. The
153. Editor's Note: This local law provided that it shall take effect 7-1-2005.
§ 15-59 CHARTER § 15-60
C:449
tax shall be at the rate of 1 1/2% of the consideration. Where any real
property is situated partly within and partly without the boundaries of

the total consideration attributable to that portion of such real property
situated within the City of Yonkers or to the interest in such portion.
§ 15-61. Presumptions and burden of proof.
For the purpose of the proper administration of this article and to prevent
evasion of the tax hereby imposed, it shall be presumed that all deeds are
taxable. Where the net consideration includes property other than money,

or interest therein. Such presumptions shall prevail until the contrary is
established, and the burden of proving the contrary shall be on the taxpayer.

from tax. Evidence of the payment of the tax shall be affixed to the deed.
The Comptroller may provide for the use of stamps as evidence of payment
and that they shall be affixed to the deed before it is recorded.
§ 15-63. Returns.
A. A joint return shall be filed by both the grantor and the grantee for each
deed, whether or not a tax is due thereon. Such returns shall be filed
with the Comptroller at the time of payment of any tax imposed
hereunder or, in the case of a deed not subject to tax, before the
recording of such deed. Filing shall be accomplished by delivering the
return to the Comptroller. The Comptroller shall prescribe the form of
the return and the information which it shall contain. The return shall
be signed under oath by both the grantor or his agent and the grantee
or his agent. Where either the grantor or grantee has failed to sign the
return, it shall be accepted as a return, but the party who has failed to
sign the return or file a separate return shall be subject to the penalties
applicable to a person who has failed to file a return, and the period of
limitations for assessment of tax or of additional tax shall not apply to
such party.
B. Returns shall be preserved for three years and thereafter until the
Comptroller permits them to be destroyed.
C. The Comptroller may require amended returns to be filed within 20
days after notice and to contain the information specified in the notice.
D. If a return required by this article is not filed or if a return when filed is
incorrect or insufficient on its face, the Comptroller shall take the

C:450
§ 15-64. Exemptions.
necessary steps to enforce the filing of such a return or of a corrected
return.
E. Where a deed has more than one grantor or more than one grantee, the
return may be signed by any one of the grantors and by any one of the
grantees; provided, however, that those not signing shall not be
relieved of any liability for the tax imposed by this article.
A. The following shall be exempt from the payment of the tax imposed by
this article and from filing a return:
(1) The State of New York, or any of its agencies, instrumentalities,
public corporations (including a public corporation created
pursuant to agreement or compact with another state) or political
subdivisions.
(2) The United States of America, and any of its agencies and
instrumentalities, insofar as they are immune from taxation;
provided, however, that the exemption of such governmental
bodies or persons shall not relieve a grantee from them of liability
for the tax or from filing a return.
B. The tax imposed by this article shall not apply to any of the following
deeds:
(1) A deed by or to the United Nations or other worldwide international
organizations of which the United States of America is a member.
(2) A deed by or to any corporation, association, trust, community
chest, fund or foundation organized and operated exclusively for

include an organization operated for the primary purpose of
carrying on a trade or business for profit, whether or not all of its
profits are payable to one or more organizations described in this
subsection.
(3) A deed to any governmental body or person exempt from payment
of the tax pursuant to Subsection A of this section.

§ 15-65. Determination of tax.
If a return required by this article is not filed, or if a return when filed
is incorrect or insufficient, the amount of tax due shall be determined by
the Comptroller from such information as may be obtainable, including
the assessed valuation of the real property or interest therein. Notice of
such determination shall be given to the person liable for the tax. Such
determination shall finally and irrevocably fix the tax unless the person
against whom it is assessed, within 30 days after the giving of notice of
such determination, shall apply to the Comptroller for a hearing, unless
the Comptroller, of his own motion, shall redetermine the same. After
such hearing, the Comptroller shall give notice of his determination to
the person against whom the tax is assessed. The determination of the
Comptroller shall be reviewable for error, illegality or unconstitutionality of
any other reason whatsoever by a proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil
Practice Law and Rules if application therefor is made to the Supreme Court
within four months after the giving of the notice of such determination.
A proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules shall
not be instituted unless the amount of any tax sought to be reviewed,
with penalties and interest thereon, if any, shall be first deposited with the
Comptroller and there shall be filed with the Comptroller an undertaking,
issued by a surety company authorized to transact business in this state and
approved by the Superintendent of Insurance of this state as to solvency
and responsibility, in such amount and with such sureties as a Justice of
the Supreme Court shall approve, to the effect that if such proceeding be
dismissed or the tax confirmed, the petitioner will pay all costs and charges
which may accrue in the prosecution of the proceeding; or, at the option
of the applicant, such undertaking filed with the Comptroller may be in a
sum sufficient to cover the taxes, penalties and interest thereon stated in
such determination plus the costs and charges which may accrue against
it in the prosecution of the proceeding, in which event the applicant shall
not be required to deposit such taxes, penalties and interest as a condition
precedent to the application.

provisions of a contract made prior to the effective date of this
article.
(6) A deed from a mere agent, dummy, straw man or conduit to his
principal or a deed from the principal to his agent, dummy, straw
man or conduit.
A. In the manner provided in this section, the Comptroller shall refund or
credit, without interest, any tax, penalty or interest erroneously,
illegally or unconstitutionally collected or paid if application to the
Comptroller for such refund shall be made within one year from the
payment thereof. Whenever a refund is made by the Comptroller he
shall state his reason therefor in writing. Such application may be made
by the grantor, grantee or other person who has actually paid the tax.
§ 15-64 YONKERS CODE § 15-66
C:452
§ 15-67. Remedies exclusive.
The remedies provided by §§ 15-65 and 15-66 of this article shall be
exclusive remedies available to any person for the review of tax liability
imposed by this article; and no determination or proposed determination
of tax or determination on any application for refund shall be enjoined or
reviewed by an action for declaratory judgment, an action for money had
and received or by any action or proceeding other than a proceeding in a
nature of a certiorari proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law
and Rules; provided, however, that a taxpayer may proceed by declaratory
judgment if he institutes suit within 30 days after a deficiency assessment is
made and pays the amount of the deficiency assessment to the Comptroller
prior to the institution of such suit and posts a bond for costs as provided in
§ 15-65 of this article.
§ 15-68. Proceedings to recover tax.
The Comptroller may, in lieu of any refund required to be made, allow
credit therefor on payments due from the applicant.
B. An application for a refund or credit made as herein provided shall be
deemed an application for a revision of any tax, penalty or interest
complained of, and the Comptroller may receive evidence with respect
thereto. After making his determination, the Comptroller shall give
notice thereof to the applicant, who shall be entitled to review such
determination by a proceeding pursuant to Article 78 of the Civil
Practice Law and Rules, provided that such proceeding is instituted
within four months after the giving of notice of such determination and
provided that a final determination of tax due was not previously made.
Such a proceeding shall not be instituted unless an undertaking is filed
with the Comptroller in such amount and with such sureties as a Justice
of the Supreme Court shall approve to the effect that if such proceeding
be dismissed or the tax confirmed, the petitioner will pay all costs and
charges which may accrue in the prosecution of such proceeding.
C. A person shall not be entitled to a revision, refund or credit under this
section of a tax, interest or penalty which had been determined to be
due pursuant to the provisions of § 15-65 of this article where he has
had a hearing or an opportunity for a hearing, as provided in said
section, or has failed to avail himself of the remedies therein provided.
No refund or credit shall be made of a tax, interest or penalty paid after
a determination by the Comptroller made pursuant to this section
unless it be found that such determination was erroneous, illegal or
unconstitutional or otherwise improper, by the Comptroller after a
hearing, or on his own motion, or in a proceeding under Article 78 of
the Civil Practice Law and Rules, pursuant to the provisions of said
section, in which event refund or credit without interest shall be made
of the tax, interest or penalty found to have been overpaid.
§ 15-66 CHARTER § 15-68
C:453
§ 15-69. General powers of Comptroller.
In addition to the powers granted to the Comptroller in this article, he is
hereby authorized and empowered:
A. Whenever any grantor or grantee shall fail to pay any tax, penalty or
interest imposed by this article as herein provided, the Corporation
Counsel shall, upon the request of the Comptroller, bring or cause to be
brought an action to enforce the payment of the same on behalf of the
City of Yonkers in any court of the State of New York or of any other
state or of the United States. If, however, the Comptroller in his
discretion believes that any such grantor or grantee subject to the
provisions of this article is about to cease business, leave the state or
remove or dissipate the assets out of which the tax or penalty might be
satisfied, and that any such tax or penalty will not be paid when due, he
may declare such tax or penalty to be immediately due and payable and
may issue a warrant immediately.
B. As an additional or alternate remedy, the Comptroller may issue a
warrant directed to the Sheriff of Westchester County commanding him
to levy upon and sell the real and personal property of the grantor,
grantee or other person liable for the tax which may be found within the
City, for the payment of the amount thereof, with any penalty and
interest, and the cost of executing the warrant, and to return such
warrant to the Comptroller and to pay to him the money collected by
virtue thereof within 60 days after the receipt of such warrant. Said
sheriff shall, within five days after the receipt of the warrant, file with
the Clerk of Westchester County a copy thereof, and thereupon such
Clerk shall enter in the judgment docket the name of the person
mentioned in the warrant and the amount of the tax, penalty and
interest for which the warrant is issued and the date when such copy is
filed. Thereupon, the amount of such warrant so docketed shall become
a lien upon the title to and the interest in real and personal property of
the person against whom the warrant is issued. The Sheriff shall then
proceed upon the warrant in the same manner, and with like effect, as
that provided by law in respect to executions issued against property
upon judgments of a court of record and for services in executing the
warrant, he shall be entitled to the same fees, which he may collect in
the same manner. In the discretion of the Comptroller, a warrant of like
terms, force and effect may be issued and directed to an officer or
employee of the Department of Finance and Management Services,
and, in the execution thereof, such officer or employee shall have all the
powers conferred by law upon sheriffs, but shall be entitled to no fee or
compensation in excess of the actual expenses paid in the performance
of such duty. If a warrant is returned not satisfied in full, the
Comptroller may from time to time issue new warrants and shall also
have the same remedies to enforce the amount due thereunder as if the
City had recovered judgment therefor and execution thereon had been
returned unsatisfied.

length of time as may be required for the proper administration of this

powers and duties under this article. The Comptroller shall have power
to subpoena and require the attendance of witnesses and the
production of books, papers and documents to secure information

enforcement of this article and to examine them in relation thereto and
to issue commissions for the examination of witnesses who are out of
the state or unable to attend before him or excused from attendance.
B. A Justice of the Supreme Court either in court or at chambers shall have
power summarily to enforce by proper proceedings the attendance and

deputies or any officers or employees of the Department of Finance and
Management Services, designated to serve such process.
A. Any person failing to file a return or to pay any tax within the time
required by this article shall be subject to a penalty of 8% of the amount
of tax due, plus interest at the rate of 1% of such tax for each month of
delay or fraction thereof, except the first month, after such return was
required to be filed or such tax became due, but the Comptroller, if
satisfied that the delay was excusable, may remit all or any part of such
penalty, but not interest, at the rate of 8% per year. Such penalties and
interest shall be paid and disposed of in the same manner as other
revenues from this article. Unpaid penalties and interest may be
enforced in the same manner as the tax imposed by this article.
B. Any grantor, grantee or officer of a corporation failing to file a return
required by this article, or filing or causing to be filed or making or
causing to be made or giving or causing to be given any return,

statement required or authorized by this article which is willfully false,

imprisonment for not more than one year, or both such fine and
imprisonment.

paid or that information has not been supplied pursuant to the
provisions of this article shall be presumptive evidence thereof.
D. Any person willfully simulating, altering, defacing, destroying or
removing any evidence of the filing of a return or the payment of a tax
provided for in this article shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishment
for which shall be a fine of not more than $1,000 or imprisonment for

§ 15-73. Notices and limitations of time.
A. Except in accordance with proper judicial order or as otherwise
provided by law, it shall be unlawful for the Comptroller or any officer
or employee of the Department of Finance and Management Services to

relating to any return provided for by this article. The officers charged

action or proceeding, in either of which events the court may require
the production of, and may admit in evidence, so much of said returns
or of the facts shown thereby, as are pertinent to the action or

the delivery to a grantor or grantee of a deed or to any subsequent
owner of the real property conveyed by such deed or to the duly
authorized representative of any of them of a certified copy of any
return filed in connection with the tax on such deed, nor to prohibit the
delivery of such a certified copy of such return or of any information
contained in or relating thereto to the United States of America or any
department thereof, the State of New York or any department thereof,
the City of Yonkers or any department thereof, provided that the same is
required for official business, nor to prohibit the inspection for official

the last return filed by him pursuant to the provisions of this article, in
any application made by him, or in any deed which is the subject of the
notice, or, if no return has been filed or application made or address
stated in the deed, then to such address as may be obtainable. The

a deed without such proof. The Mayor is also authorized to enter into
similar agreements with real estate title insurance companies saving them
harmless from any liability arising out of their cooperation in collecting the

where no return has been filed as provided by law, the tax may be
assessed at any time.

assessment of an additional tax, a taxpayer has consented in writing
that such period be extended, the amount of such additional tax due

Yonkers income tax surcharge on residents of the City of Yonkers
adopted by the City of Yonkers pursuant to authority granted by Article
30-A of the Tax Law.

accuracy thereof are approved by the State Tax Commission as
fairly and equitably reflecting net earnings from self-employment
within the City of Yonkers.
(3) Allocation by formula. If Subsection B(2) of this section does not
apply to the taxpayer, the portion of net earnings from selfemployment
allocable to the City of Yonkers shall be determined by
multiplying net earnings from self-employment, within and without
the City of Yonkers, by the average of the following three
percentages:
(a) Property percentage. The percentage computed by dividing
the average of the value, at the beginning and end of the
taxable year, of real and tangible personal property connected
with the net earnings from self-employment and located within
the City of Yonkers by the average of the value, at the
beginning and end of the taxable year, of all real and tangible
personal property connected with the net earnings from selfemployment
and located both within and without the City of
Yonkers. For this purpose, "real property" shall include real
property, whether owned or rented.
(b) Payroll percentage. The percentage computed by dividing the
total wages, salaries and other personal service compensation
paid or incurred during the taxable year to employees in
connection with the net earnings from self-employment
derived from a trade or business carried on within the City of
Yonkers by the total of all wages, salaries and other personal
service compensation paid or incurred during the taxable year
to employees in connection with the net earnings from selfemployment
derived from a trade or business carried on both
within and without the City of Yonkers.
(c) Gross income percentage. The percentage computed by
dividing the gross sales or charges for services performed by
or through an agency located within the City of Yonkers by the
total of all gross sales or charges for services performed within
and without the City of Yonkers. The sales or charges to be
allocated to the City of Yonkers shall include all sales
negotiated or consummated, and charges for services
performed, by an employee, agent, agency or independent
contractor chiefly situated at, connected by contract or
otherwise with or sent out from offices or other agencies of the
trade or business from which a taxpayer is deriving net
earnings from self-employment, situated within the City of
Yonkers.
C. Other allocation methods. The portion of net earnings from selfemployment
allocable to the City of Yonkers shall be determined in
accordance with rules and regulations of the State Tax Commission if it
shall appear to the Tax Commission that the net earnings from self-

employment are not fairly and equitably reflected under the provisions
of Subsection B of this section.
D. Special rules for real estate. Income and deductions from the rental of
real property and gain and loss from the sale, exchange or other
disposition of real property shall not be subject to allocation under
Subsection B or C of this section but shall be considered as entirely
derived from or connected with the place in which such property is
located.
A. Accounting periods. A taxpayer's taxable year under this article shall be
the same as his/her taxable year from federal income tax purposes.
B. Change of accounting periods. If a taxpayer's taxable year is changed
for federal income tax purposes, his/her taxable year for purposes of
this article shall be similarly changed. If a taxable period of less than 12
months results from a change of taxable year, the exclusion allowable
under § 15-116 of this article shall be prorated under regulations of the
State Tax Commission.
C. Accounting methods. A taxpayer's method of accounting under this
article shall be the same as his/her method of accounting for federal
income tax purposes. In the absence of any method of accounting for
federal income tax purposes, net earnings from self-employment within
the City of Yonkers shall be computed under such method as in the
opinion of the State Tax Commission clearly reflects net earnings from
self-employment within the City of Yonkers.
D. Change of accounting methods.
(1) If a taxpayer's method of accounting is changed for federal income
tax purposes, his/her method of accounting for purposes of this
article shall be similarly changed.
(2) If a taxpayer's method of accounting is changed, other than from an
accrual to an installment method, any additional tax which results
from adjustments determined to be necessary solely by reason of
the change shall not be greater than if such adjustments were
ratably allocated and included for the taxable year of the change
and the preceding taxable years beginning after 1983, not in excess
of two, during which the taxpayer used the method of accounting
from which the change is made.
(3) If a taxpayer's method of accounting is changed from an accrual to
an installment method, any additional tax for the year of such
change of method and for any subsequent year, which is
attributable to the receipt of installment payments properly
accrued in a prior year, shall be reduced by the portion of tax for
any prior taxable year attributable to the accrual of such

§ 15-120. Estimated tax.
Every taxpayer having net earnings from self-employment shall make a
declaration of his/her estimated tax and shall pay his/her estimated tax in
the same manner and subject to the same requirements, to the greatest
extent possible, as provided in §§ 655 and 656 of the New York State Tax
Law, if his net earnings from self-employment can reasonably be expected
to exceed $15,000. No declaration or payment of estimated tax shall be
required for taxable years beginning in 1984.
§ 15-121. Withholding tax from wages.
Withholding of the City of Yonkers earnings tax on nonresidents' wages
shall commence on November 1, 1984. With respect to payment of wages
made on or after November 1, 1984, the provisions contained in Part V of
Article 22 of the New York State Tax Law relating to withholding of tax
on wages shall be applicable with the same force and effect as if those
provisions had been incorporated in full in this section and had expressly
referred to the tax imposed by this article, except where inconsistent with
the provisions of this article, except that the term "aggregate amount"
contained in Subdivision (a)(1), (2), (3) and (4) of § 674 of the Tax Law
shall mean the aggregate of the aggregate amounts of New York State
personal income tax, City earnings tax on nonresidents authorized pursuant
to Article 2-E of the General City Law or Article 30-B of the New York
State Tax Law, City personal income tax on residents authorized pursuant

A. General. On or before the 15th day of April following the close of the
taxable year, every person subject to the tax shall make and file a
return, and any balance of the tax shown due on the face of such return
shall be paid therewith. The State Tax Commission may, by regulation,
provide for the filing of returns and payment of the tax at such other
times as it deems necessary for the proper enforcement of this article.
The State Tax Commission may also provide by regulation that any
return otherwise required to be made and filed under this article by any
nonresident individual need not be made and filed if such nonresident
individual had, during the taxable year to which the return would
relate, no net earnings from self-employment within the City of Yonkers.
Any regulation allowing such waiver of return may provide for
additional limitations on and conditions and prerequisites to the
privilege of not filing a return.
§ 15-119 CHARTER § 15-122
C:487
B. Husband and wife. If husband and wife, both of whom are nonresidents
of the City of Yonkers, file separate New York State personal income tax
returns on a single form, the State Tax Commission may require the
filing of separate returns under this article on single form; and if the
sum of the payments by either spouse, including withheld and
estimated taxes, exceeds the amount of the tax for which such spouse is
separately liable, the excess may be applied by the State Tax
Commission to the credit of the other spouse if the sum of the payments
by such other spouse, including withheld and estimated taxes, is less
than the amount of the tax for which such other spouse is separately
liable. If the sum of the payments made by both spouses with respect to
the taxes for which they are separately liable, including withheld and
estimated taxes, exceeds the total of the taxes due, refund of the excess
may be made payable to both spouses or, if either is deceased, to the
survivor; provided, however, that the provisions of this subsection shall
not apply if the return of either spouse includes a demand that any
overpayment made by him or her shall be applied only on account of his
or her separate liability. However, an overpayment by a spouse and
interest thereon shall be credited against past-due support or the
amount of a default in repayment of a guaranteed student loan or state
university loan owed by the other spouse, of which the State Tax
Commission has been notified pursuant to § 171-c or § 171-d or § 171-e
of the Tax Law, as the case may be, unless the spouse not liable for pastdue
support or a default in repayment of a guaranteed student loan or
state university loan includes a demand that the overpayment and
interest thereon attributable to such spouse not be credited against the
past-due support or the default in repayment of a guaranteed student
loan or state university loan owed by the other spouse. [Amended
7-20-1984 by L.L. No. 9-1984]
C. Decedents. The return for any deceased individual shall be made and
filed by his/her executor, administrator or other person charged with
his/her property. If a final return of a decedent is for a fractional part of
a year, the due date of such return shall be the 15th day of the fourth
month following the close of the twelve-month period which began with
the first day of such fractional part of the year.
D. Individuals under a disability. The return for an individual who is unable
to make a return by reason of minority or other disability shall be made
and filed by his/her guardian, committee, fiduciary or other person
charged with the care of his/her person or property (other than a
receiver in possession of only a part of his/her property) or by his/her
duly authorized agent.
E. Estates and trusts. The return for an estate or trust shall be made and
filed by the fiduciary.

or Article 30 or 30-A of the Tax Law and under Article 22 of the Tax

the provisions of local laws imposed under the authority of Article 30-B
of the Tax Law, Article 2-E of the General City Law or Article 30 or 30-A

to sign on behalf of the partnership.
C. Certification. The making or filing of any return, declaration, statement
or other document or copy thereof required to be made or filed
pursuant to this article, including a copy of a federal return, shall
constitute a certification by the person making or filing such return,
declaration, statement or other document or copy thereof that the
statements contained therein are true and that any copy filed is a true
copy.
A. General. If an individual changes his/her status during his/her taxable
year from resident to nonresident, or from nonresident to resident, he/
she shall file a return as a nonresident for the portion of the year during
which he/she is a nonresident if he/she is subject to the tax imposed by
this article or, if not subject to such tax, an information return for the
portion of the year during which he/she is a nonresident, subject to such
exceptions as the State Tax Commission may prescribe by regulation.
Such information return shall be due at the same time as the return
required by Article IX of this chapter for the portion of the year during

his/her taxable year for federal income tax purposes were limited to the
period of his/her nonresident status.
C. Special accruals.
(1) If an individual changes his/her status from resident to
nonresident, he/she shall, regardless of his/her method of
accounting, accrue for the portion of the taxable year prior to such
change of status any items of income, gain, loss or deduction
accruing prior to the change of status, if not otherwise properly
includable (whether or not because of an election to report on an
installment basis) or allowable for City of Yonkers earnings tax
purposes for such portion of the taxable year or a prior taxable
year. The amounts of such accrued items shall be determined as
such accrued items were includable or allowable for federal selfemployment
tax purposes.

C:490
§ 15-127. Extension of time for payment.
The State Tax Commission may grant a reasonable extension of time for
payment of a tax or estimated tax (or any installment), or for filing any
return, declaration, statement or other document required pursuant to

or not because of such an election to report on an installment basis)
or allowable for federal self-employment tax purposes for such
portion of the taxable year or a prior taxable year. The amounts of
such accrued items shall be determined as if such accrued items
were includable or allowable for federal self-employment tax
purposes. [Amended 10-9-1984 by L.L. No. 12-1984]

this subsection shall be taken into account in determining Cityadjusted
wages earned or net earnings from self-employment
within the City of Yonkers for any subsequent taxable period.
(4) Where an individual changes his/her status from resident to
nonresident, the accruals under this subsection shall not be
required if the individual files with the State Tax Commission a
bond or other security acceptable to the Commission, conditioned
upon the inclusion of amounts accruable under this subsection in
the determination of the City of Yonkers income tax surcharge

years as if the individual had not changed his/her resident status. In
such event, the tax under this article shall not apply to such

chargeable to such tenant-stockholder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a

duplicate shall state the hotel to which it is applicable. Such certificate

for the tax. The operator and any officer of any corporate operator shall
be personally liable for the tax collected or required to be collected
under this article, and the operator shall have the same right in respect

or other term basis, the rent so paid, charged, billed or falling due shall
be subject to the tax herein imposed to the extent that it covers any
portion of the period on and after the effective date. Where any tax has
been paid hereunder upon any rent which has been ascertained to be
worthless, the Commissioner may, by regulation, provide for credit and/
or refund of the amount of such tax upon application therefor as
provided in § 15-166 of this article.
E. For the purpose of the proper administration of this article and to
prevent evasion of the tax hereby imposed, it shall be presumed that all
rents are subject to tax until the contrary is established, and the burden
of proving that a rent for occupancy is not taxable hereunder shall be
upon the operator or occupant. Where an occupant claims exemption

from the expiration of the period covered thereby. The Commissioner
may permit or require returns to be made by other periods and upon
such dates as he/she may specify. If the Commissioner deems it
necessary in order to ensure the payment of the tax imposed by this
article, he/she may require returns to be made for shorter periods than
§ 15-160 YONKERS CODE § 15-162
C:510
§ 15-163. Payment of tax.
At the time of filing a return of occupancy and of rents, each operator shall
pay to the Commissioner the taxes imposed by this article upon the rents
required to be included in such return, as well as all other monies collected
by the operator acting or purporting to act under the provisions of this
article; even though it be judicially determined that the tax collected is
invalidly required to be filed, shall be due from the operator and payable to
the Commissioner on the date prescribed herein for the filing of the return
for such period, without regard to whether a return is filed or whether the
return which is filed correctly shows the amount of rents and taxes due
thereon. Where the Commissioner in his/her discretion deems it necessary
to protect revenues to be obtained under this article, he/she may require
any operator required to collect the tax imposed by this article to file with
him/her a bond, issued by a surety company authorized to transact business
in this state and approved by the Superintendent of Insurance of this state
as to solvency and responsibility, in such amount as the Commissioner
may find to secure the payment of any tax and/or penalties and interest
due or which may become due from such operator. In the event that the
Commissioner determines that an operator is to file such bonds, he/she
shall give notice to such operator to that effect, specifying the amount
of the bond required. The operator shall file such bond within five days
after the giving of such notice unless, within such five days, the operator
shall request in writing a hearing before the Commissioner at which the
necessity, propriety and amount of the bond shall be determined by the
Commissioner. Such determination shall be final and shall be complied with
within 15 days after the giving of notices thereof. In lieu of such bond,
securities approved by the Commissioner or cash in such amount as he/she
may prescribe may be deposited with him/her, which shall be kept in the
custody of the Commissioner, who may at any time, without notice to the
depositor, apply them to any tax and/or interest or penalties due, and for
that purpose the securities may be sold by him/her at public or private sale
without notice to the depositor thereof.
those prescribed pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this section
and upon such dates as he/she may specify.
B. The forms of return shall be prescribed by the Commissioner and shall
contain such information as he/she may deem necessary for the proper
administration of this article. The Commissioner may require amended
returns to be filed within 20 days after notice and to contain the
information specified in the notice.
C. If a return required by this article is not filed, or if a return is
incorrectly filed or is insufficient on its face, the Commissioner shall
take such steps as he/she deems necessary to enforce the filing of such
return or of a corrected return.
§ 15-162 CHARTER § 15-164
C:511
§ 15-164. Determination of tax.
If a return required by this article is not filed or if a return, when filed,
is incorrect or insufficient, the amount of tax due shall be determined by
the Commissioner from such information as may be obtainable, and, if
necessary, the tax may be estimated on the basis of external indices, such
as number of rooms, locations, scale of rents, comparable rents, type of
accommodations and service, number of employees and/or other factors.
Notice of such determination shall be given to the person liable for the
collection and/or payment of the tax. Such determination shall finally and
irrevocably fix the tax unless the person against whom it is assessed,
within 30 days after giving notice of such determination, shall apply to the
Commissioner for a hearing or unless the Commissioner on his/her own
motion shall redetermine the same. After such hearing, the Commissioner
shall give notice of his/her determination to the person against whom the
tax is assessed. The determination of the Commissioner shall be reviewable
for error, illegality, unconstitutionality or any other recognizable basis
whatsoever by proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and
Rules if application therefor is made to the Supreme Court within 30 days
after the giving of the notice of such determination. A proceeding under
Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules shall not be instituted unless
the amount of any tax sought to be reviewed, with penalties and interest
thereon, if any, shall be first deposited with the Commissioner and there
shall be filed with the Commissioner an undertaking, issued by a surety
company authorized to transact business in this state and approved by the
Superintendent of Insurance of this state as to solvency and responsibility,
in such amount as a Justice of the Supreme Court shall approve to the effect
that, if such proceedings be dismissed or the tax confirmed, the petitioner
will pay all costs and charges which may accrue, including reasonable
counsel fees, in the prosecution of the proceeding, or, at the option of the
applicant, such undertaking filed with the Commissioner may be in a sum
sufficient to cover the taxes, penalties and interest thereon stated in such
determination plus the costs and charges, including reasonable counsel
fees, which may accrue against it in the prosecution of the proceedings,
in which event the applicant shall not be required to deposit such taxes,
penalties and interest as a condition precedent to the application.
§ 15-165. Disposition of revenues.
All revenue resulting from the imposition of the tax under this article shall
be paid into the treasury of the City and shall be credited to and deposited
in the general fund of the City.
§ 15-166. Refunds.
A. In the manner provided in this section, the Commissioner shall refund
or credit, without interest, any tax, penalty or interest erroneously,
illegally or unconstitutionally collected or paid if application to the
Commissioner for such refund shall be made within one year from the
payment thereof. Whenever a refund is made by the Commissioner he/

§ 15-167. Reserves.
In cases where the occupant or operator has applied for a refund and
has instituted a proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and
Rules to review a determination adverse to him/her on his/her application
for refund, the Commissioner shall have the option of crediting future tax
payments to meet the cost of any settlements or judgments or, at his/her
she shall state his/her reason therefor in writing. Such application may
be made by the occupant, operator or other person who has actually
paid the tax. Such application may also be made by an operator who
has collected and paid over such tax to the Commissioner provided
that the application is made within one year of the payment by the
occupant to the operator, but no actual refund of monies shall be made
to such operator until he/she shall first establish to the satisfaction of
the Commissioner, under such regulations as the Commissioner may

fluid ounces," but not as "one quart 24 fluid ounces"; 1 1/4 pounds may
be expressed as "one pound four ounces").

measure; when the commodity is solid, semisolid, viscous or a mixture
of solid and liquid, the markings shall be in terms of weight, except
where otherwise provided by the Office of Licensing, provided that if
the commodity is packaged in an aerosol container, the declaration
shall be in terms of net weight, including the propellant. [Amended

such qualifying words as "and up" or "extra," etc. If an additional charge is
to be made, the consumer must be notified in advance.
§ 31-25. Quantity count to be supplemented.
A declaration of quantity in terms of count shall be supplemented by a
declaration of the weight, measure or size of the individual units of the
commodity or of the total weight or measure of the commodity, unless a
declaration of count alone is fully informative to the customer.
§ 31-26. Weights or measures to be supplemented.

supplemented by a declaration of the count or size of the individual units
of the commodity, unless a declaration of weight or measure alone is fully

be supplemented by a declaration in units of the metric system.
§ 31-28. Use of English language required.

except in conformity with this regulation.

to fail to disclose an estimated delivery date or an estimated range of
delivery dates, conspicuously in writing on the contract for the sale of the

beyond the originally promised date is caused by a strike, the delivery
date can be extended by an amount of time equal to the duration of the

a new delivery date fails to meet this new delivery date, five-percent
monthly interest shall be paid to the consumer on the money deposited.

solely by the consumer.
G. Nothing in this regulation shall be construed to waive any right that a
customer has under the common law or by statute.

delivery disclosed on the contract unless the consumer is notified, in
writing or by oral communication confirmed in writing within one day,
of the delay and the anticipated date or range or delivery dates.
B. If the automobile has not been delivered within 45 days of the estimated
delivery date, the consumer at his option may:

§ 31-79 YONKERS CODE § 31-80
C:674
§ 31-81. Sale of consumer services.
§ 31-82. Regulations regarding repairs.
requests a refund pursuant to the provisions of this section, the refund
must be made within two weeks of the request.
D. When a delay in the delivery beyond the originally promised date is
caused by a strike, the amount of time of the delay equal to the duration
of the strike shall not be counted in computing the 45 days referred to
in Subsection B of this section.
E. There is no violation of this section when the failure to deliver is caused
by the consumer.
A. It shall be a violation of this code for any merchant or other person
engaged in the sale of consumer services to be performed in the future

complete the performance of that service; or
(2) Commence and complete the performance of that service on the
date or dates agreed upon with the consumer, unless:
(a) The consumer is notified, in writing or by oral communication
to be confirmed in writing within one day, of the delay and the
revised date of commencement and/or completion; and
(b) The consumer agrees to the revised dates.
B. If the merchant or other person providing the service shall fail to
comply with the requirement to disclose a commencement and/or
completion date as provided in Subsection A, or if the service has not
been performed within the period of time disclosed, the consumer, at
his option may:
(1) Cancel the contract with full refund for uncompleted portions of
the work, provided that the consumer has paid in advance therefor;
or
(2) Negotiate a new commencement and/or completion date with the
merchant.
A. It shall be a violation for a merchant removing consumer goods from
the possession of the consumer for the purpose of repair:
(1) To fail to give the consumer:
(a) A receipt.
§ 31-80 CHARTER § 31-82
C:675
(b) A written estimate of the cost of the repair before commencing
work, except when the merchant or its employees involved are
illiterate.
(2) To fail to secure a written authorization signed by the consumer to
repair the consumer goods at the written estimated price before
commencing work.
(3) To fail to deliver upon request by the consumer any part replaced
unless the consumer had knowledge that such part was defective
and in need of replacement at the time he relinquished possession
to the merchant, e.g., torn auto upholstery, broken auto windows,
watch crystals or radio cases, or unless the consumer expressly
waives this requirement in writing. Exhibit and tender of a replaced
part to the consumer in lieu of delivery is sufficient where such
part:
(a) Is too large to be easily moved;
(b) Must be returned to the manufacturer in order for the
consumer to take advantage of a parts warranty; or
(c) Is purchased by the merchant from the consumer for
rebuilding.
(4) To charge a total price, excluding tax, which is more than 20%
above the written estimate, unless a revised estimate has been
submitted and accepted by the consumer.
(5) To fail to deliver the repaired item, together with a final bill for the
work completed on the promised completion date, unless the
consumer is notified in writing of the delay and the anticipated
completion date. If complete repair is delayed for an unreasonable
period of time, the consumer shall have the right to the immediate
return of the property without charge.
B. The estimate of repair price may be orally communicated to the
consumer if:
(1) By reason of time and/or distance, it is impractical to deliver a
written estimate and obtain a signed authorization before the day
agreed upon for repairs to commence; and
(2) An oral agreement to proceed is reached with the consumer before
the actual repair is commenced and a copy of a written estimate is
mailed to the consumer before any work is commenced.213
C. The provisions in this section relating to written estimates and signed
authorization for work to commence shall be applicable to home
improvements, repairs and additions. It shall be a violation of this code
for a contractor to fail to commence and complete home improvement
213. Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code; see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I.

commenced within a reasonable time thereafter; or
(2) A full refund is made for uncompleted portions of the work, but only
after having been paid in advance therefor.

then such quantity shall be clearly stated.
E. There shall be within each retail establishment a prominently posted
sign, poster or placard as to where a rain check may be obtained by the
public.
F. It shall not be made a condition precedent to the issuance of a rain
check that the purchaser prepay the purchase price or any part thereof.

§ 33-6. Construction of provisions.
This chapter, while regulating newsracks in public rights-of-way, is not to be
construed as a sanction of them. The First Amendment of the Constitution
of the United States and the Constitution of the State of New York have
been interpreted by the courts as prohibiting the banning of newsracks.

acquiescence in, liability for or assuming the risks of the placement of
newsracks in the City, whether they are in conformity with the provisions of
this chapter or not.

interested person, a reasonable opportunity to be heard in order to
show cause why the determination or action appealed from should
not be upheld. The burden of proof shall be on the appellant to show
that such determination or action was not supported by substantial
evidence. The Board shall make a final determination at the conclusion
of the hearing or as soon thereafter as is practicable. In the event
that a distributor is successful in reversing a determination that the
claimed violation was of a nature which warranted removal pending a
final determination, no fee shall be imposed for removal and storage of
the newsrack which was the subject of the appeal, and failure to comply
with such determination shall not serve as a basis for prosecution under
§ 33-4D hereof.
F. Nothing contained in this chapter shall be interpreted to limit or impair
the exercise by the City of its police power, in the event of an
emergency, to remove any newsrack which presents a clear and present
danger of imminent personal injury or property damage to users of the
public streets of this City.

SEXUALLY-ORIENTED BUSINESSES  Uses pursuant to which the Yonkers

General Ordinance No. 2-1996:
§ 43-8 YONKERS CODE § 43-8
C:872
The City Council of the City of Yonkers hereby recognizes that there
are some uses which, because of their very nature, are recognized as
having serious objectionable operational characteristics, particularly when
several of them are located in close proximity, thereby having a deleterious
effect upon the adjacent areas. This finding of the existence of adverse
secondary impacts is supported by reports and studies conducted by other
municipalities which have been reviewed by this Council, including but
not limited to the "Adult Entertainment Study" published by the New
York City Department of City Planning in September 1994, the Report
of the Attorney General's Working Group for the Regulation of Sexually
Oriented Businesses in the State of Minnesota, and reports from different
departments, bureaus and boards of the City of Yonkers. The unrestrained
proliferation of such uses is inconsistent with existing development and
future plans for the City of Yonkers in that such uses often result in
influences on the community which increase the crime rate and undermine
the economic, moral and social welfare of the community. The deleterious
effect of such uses change the economic, social and moral character of
the existing community and adversely affect existing businesses and
community and family life. Special regulation of these uses is necessary
to ensure these adverse effects will not contribute to the blighting or
downgrading of the surrounding neighborhoods. The purpose of this
ordinance is to prevent the unrestricted proliferation of such uses while
respecting the constitutional rights of the operators of such establishments
and to ensure that the effects of such uses will not adversely affect the
health, safety and economic well-being of the community, and particularly
the youth of the community, by enacting criteria for the establishment
of adult entertainment uses; and which include the following uses as
defined herein: adult book store or video store, adult theaters, peep shows,
massage establishments or adult entertainment uses or establishments.

General Regulations
§ 43-18. Application of regulations.
§ 43-19. Zoning chapter prescribes minimum requirements.
In interpreting and applying the provisions of this chapter, they shall be
held to be the minimum requirements adopted for the promotion of the
public health, safety, comfort, convenience and general welfare. The lot or
yard areas required by this chapter for a particular structure shall not be
included as a part of the required lot or yard areas of any other structure.
If the lot or yard areas required by this chapter for a particular structure
are diminished, the existence of such structure shall be deemed to be a
violation of this chapter. The lot or yard areas of structures existing at
the time of the passage of this chapter shall not be diminished below the
requirements herein provided for structures hereafter erected, and such
required areas shall not be included as a part of the required areas of any
structure hereafter erected.
§ 43-20. Relation to other regulations.
A. Except as hereinafter provided, no building or structure, or part
thereof, and no lot or land, or part thereof, shall hereafter be used
except in conformity with the use regulations herein prescribed. Any
use that does not conform to the use regulations of this chapter shall be
deemed a nonconforming use, except that uses granted by special use
permit by the Planning Board and approved by the City Council
pursuant to Article VII shall be deemed to be conforming uses. Any use
of a parcel of land or lot, or use of a building or structure for which a
use variance has been granted by the Zoning Board of Appeals pursuant
to Article VIII shall be deemed to be a nonconforming use.
B. Except as hereinafter provided, no building or structure or part thereof
shall hereafter be erected, structurally altered, enlarged or rebuilt
except in conformity with the dimensional regulations herein
prescribed. Any building or structure that does not conform to the
dimensional regulations of this chapter shall be deemed a
nonconforming structure, irrespective of the use to which it is put.
Buildings or structures for which area variances have been granted by
the Zoning Board of Appeals pursuant to Article VIII shall be deemed to
be nonconforming buildings or nonconforming structures.
C. Any legally established existing use of a building or structure, lot or
land, or part thereof, which use constitutes a nonconforming use under
the provisions of this chapter, may be continued, subject to the
provisions of § 43-21 of this chapter.
A. This chapter shall not repeal, abrogate, annul or in any way impair or
interfere with any existing provisions of law or ordinance or any rules
or regulations previously adopted or issued or which shall be adopted
§ 43-18 CHARTER § 43-20
C:895
§ 43-21. Nonconforming uses, buildings and structures.
or issued pursuant to law relating to the use of buildings, structures,
lots or land, provided that, where this chapter imposes a greater
restriction upon the use of buildings, structures, lots or land or upon
the height of structures or requires larger lots or yards than are
imposed or required by such existing provisions or regulations, the
provisions of this chapter shall control.
B. Conflicting standards. This chapter shall not be deemed to affect in any
manner whatsoever any easements, covenants or other agreements
between parties, provided, however, that where this chapter imposes a
greater or lesser restriction upon the use of buildings or land, or upon
the erection, construction, establishment, movement, alteration or
enlargement of buildings than are imposed by other ordinances, rules,
regulations, licenses, certificates or other authorizations, or by
easements, covenants or agreements, the more restrictive
requirements shall prevail.
C. Other applicable codes, standards and regulations of the City of
Yonkers. There are many other applicable codes, standards and
regulations pertaining to the use of land in the City of Yonkers in

A. Continuation of a nonconforming use, building or structure.
(1) Except as otherwise provided herein, the lawfully permitted use of
land, buildings or structures and the lawfully permitted existence
of buildings or structures at the time of adoption of this chapter
may be continued, although such use, building or structure does
not conform to the standards specified in this chapter for the
§ 43-20 YONKERS CODE § 43-21
C:896
district in which such land, buildings or structures are located.
Similarly, whenever a zoning classification or the restrictions
affecting property within a district shall be changed hereafter so
as to render nonconforming a use, building or structure then
presently or theretofore lawfully existing, such use, building or
structure may nevertheless continue subject to the conditions set
forth below. Said uses shall be deemed nonconforming uses and
said buildings and structures which are dimensionally
nonconforming shall be deemed nonconforming buildings and
nonconforming structures respectively.
(2) Any use in existence as of the effective date of this chapter which is
by this chapter granted only by special use permit in the district in
which it is located shall be presumed to have a special use permit to
the extent such use is legally conforming as of the date immediately
prior to the effective date of this chapter.
(3) No unlawful use of lands, buildings or structures existing at the
time of passage of this chapter shall be deemed a nonconforming
use and no unlawful building or structure existing at the time of
passage of this ordinance shall be deemed a nonconforming
building or nonconforming structure.
B. Change of a nonconforming use of land, building or structure.
(1) The nonconforming use of land may be continued; provided,
however, that no such nonconforming use shall be physically
enlarged or intensified, nor shall it be extended to occupy a greater
area of land than that occupied by such use at the time of the
adoption of this chapter, unless specifically allowed by other
provisions in this chapter, nor shall any such nonconforming use be
moved in whole or in part to any other portion of the lot or parcel of
land occupied by such nonconforming use at the time of the
adoption of this chapter.
(2) A building or structure the use of which does not conform to the
use regulations for the district in which it is situated shall not be
enlarged, extended or altered structurally unless the use therein is
changed to a conforming use, or except to conform to an order of
the Commissioner of the Department of Housing and Buildings to
either correct an unsafe condition or to conform to the
requirements of applicable laws or ordinances.
(3) No nonconforming use shall be changed to another nonconforming
use, except as provided in § 43-21F.
C. Abandonment of a nonconforming use. If a nonconforming use ceases
for any reason for a period of 12 consecutive months, or is changed to a
conforming use, any future use of the land, building or structure shall
be in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. Substantial
cessation of activities consistent with or required for the operation of
such nonconforming use or substantial vacancy of the building or
§ 43-21 CHARTER § 43-21
C:897
structure in which the nonconforming use was conducted, together
with substantial cessation of activities consistent with or required for
the operation of such nonconforming use shall be deemed to constitute
a discontinuation thereof within the meaning of this chapter,
irrespective of whether an intention to abandon the nonconforming
use may exist. On application, prior to the expiration of the twelvemonth
period as specified herein, the Zoning Board of Appeals may
extend the period for up to six additional months upon a finding that
it is not reasonable in its application to the particular premises, taking
into consideration the characteristics of the use, the investment which
has been made in it, the circumstances of the discontinuance and the
suitability of the building or structure for a permitted use or a use
granted by special use permit. If any building or structure in which any
nonconforming use is conducted or maintained is hereafter removed,
the subsequent use of the land on which such building or structure was
located and the subsequent use of any building or structure thereon
shall be in conformity with the standards specified by this chapter for
the district in which such land is located.
D. Nonconforming buildings or structures. A building or structure that is
conforming in use but does not conform to the lot dimension, yard
dimension, height, building coverage, floor area ratio, off-street
parking, loading or similar dimensional requirements of this chapter
shall be deemed to be a nonconforming building or nonconforming
structure. No permit shall be issued that will result in the increase of
any dimensional nonconformity, but any building or structure or portion
thereof may be altered to decrease its dimensional nonconformity.
E. Reconstruction of a nonconforming use, building or structure. Should a
building or structure, the use of which or the use of a portion of which is
nonconforming, or which is dimensionally nonconforming, be destroyed
or damaged by any means to an extent exceeding in aggregate costs
50% of the valuation of the structure as assessed for City taxes, it shall
not thereafter be reconstructed or used except in conformity with the
provisions of this chapter. Should a building or structure, the use of
which or the use of a portion of which is nonconforming or which is
dimensionally nonconforming, be destroyed or damaged by any means
to an extent exceeding in aggregate costs 50% of the assessed valuation
of the structure as assessed for City taxes, it may be reconstructed and
any accompanying nonconforming use continued, provided that the
reconstruction is commenced within one year of the date of such
damage and completed within two years of said date, and further
provided that it shall be reconstructed in accordance with a plan
approved by the Zoning Board of Appeals pursuant to § 43-144K so as to
result, where reasonable, in greater conformity with this chapter.
F. Change to another nonconforming use. On application, any
nonconforming use of land, buildings or structures may be changed to
another nonconforming use upon approval by the Zoning Board of
Appeals, based upon a finding that the proposed use is more
§ 43-21 YONKERS CODE § 43-21
C:898
appropriate to the district than the existing nonconforming use
pursuant to § 43-144K. In permitting such change, the Zoning Board of
Appeals may impose whatever conditions and safeguards it may deem
necessary or appropriate to further the purposes of this chapter.
G. Improvement of a nonconforming use. In order that nonconforming
uses may gradually be brought into greater conformity with this
chapter and the adverse external effects of such nonconforming uses
may be reduced, the owner of the land, building or structure so used
may be permitted to make limited changes to such building, structure
or use in conjunction with a site plan or building plan as appropriate
whereby, through landscaped screening and buffer areas, control of
noise, smoke, odors, lighting, architectural changes, location and layout
of parking lots and access drives, or by any other appropriate means,
these purposes may be achieved. Such plan shall be presented to the
Zoning Board of Appeals pursuant to § 43-144K, which Board may then
grant approval or approval with modifications, provided that said
agency finds that the purposes of this section and this chapter shall be
met. If required, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall refer such an
application for whatever other approvals may be necessary.
H. Certificate of occupancy establishing legality of a nonconforming use,
building or structure. Subject to the provisions of § 43-152 of this
chapter, upon application to the Commissioner of the Department of
Housing and Buildings by the owner of a building or structure, or lot or
land devoted to a nonconforming use, or by the owner of a
nonconforming building or structure, and submission of evidence
establishing the legality of such nonconforming use or nonconforming
building or structure, said owner shall be entitled to receive from the
Commissioner of the Department of Housing and Buildings a certificate
of occupancy or a use permit with an endorsement thereon specifying
the date of establishment or construction and the legality of such
nonconforming use or nonconforming building or structure, and
specifying individually each element of nonconformity.
I. Termination of nonconforming use for cause. The Board of Occupancy
may revoke the certificate of occupancy or use permit issued to a
nonconforming use upon proof satisfactory to it that the conditions of
operation or maintenance of premises are such as to constitute a public
nuisance, by reason of injury to the adjacent property or to the general
neighborhood.
J. Dumps or junkyards to be fully enclosed. (Note: This section was
adopted in the City of Yonkers, New York, Zoning Ordinance of 1968.)
Notwithstanding the provisions of § 43-21H, a dump or junkyard
existing in any district at the effective date of this chapter shall be fully
enclosed in a permanent building within three years of the date on
which this chapter was adopted. If such use is not so enclosed by said
date, the Commissioner of the Department of Housing and Buildings
shall revoke the certificate of occupancy for such use, and such use
shall forthwith be terminated by the owner or lessee of the premises.

which exist as of the date of the adoption of this chapter, and for which
a valid certificate of occupancy and/or certificate of completion has
been granted by the City of Yonkers and which meet the requirements
and conditions of the grant of such certificate of occupancy and/or

ARTICLE VI
Supplementary Use and Dimensional Regulations
§ 43-32. Applicability of supplementary use and dimensional
regulations; waiver or modification.
§ 43-33. Supplementary regulations for all uses and districts.
A. The use and dimensional regulations contained in this article are
supplemental and additional to the use and dimensional regulations
provided for in Article V of this chapter. Where the standards or
regulations provided for herein (in Article VI) conflict with those of
other requirements of the chapter, the standards of this article shall
apply.
B. The approving agency may, when reasonable, waive compliance or
modify the supplemental requirements as provided for in this article
(Article VI) in connection with an approval, an approval with
modification or disapproval of a development application, except that
any waiver or modification of a dimensional requirement as provided
for in this article (Article VI) shall be subject to the grant of an area
variance by the Zoning Board of Appeals as provided for in § 43-86 of
this chapter. The waiver or modification of nondimensional
supplemental requirements of this article by the approving agency shall
be granted only upon a showing by the applicant that:
(1) Compliance with such requirements would result in an unnecessary
hardship, or that the benefits to the neighborhood or City of
Yonkers of granting such a waiver outweigh the detriments thereof;
and
(2) When such requirements are found not to be requisite in the
interest of the public health, safety and general welfare, or are
found to be inappropriate to the particular use for which approval
is being sought.
A. Lot for every building or structure. Every building or structure
hereafter erected shall be located on a lot. There shall be no more than
one principal building or structure and its accessory buildings or
structures on one lot, for single- and two-family detached dwellings.
B. Yard for every building or structure. No yard, court or other open space
provided about any building or structure for the purpose of complying
with the provisions of this chapter shall be included as any part of the
yard, court or open space for any other building or structure. No yard,
court or any other open space on one lot shall be considered as a yard,
court or open space for a building on any other lot.
C. Required street frontage. Every lot shall be required to front on a street
which is recorded on the Official City Map.
§ 43-32 CHARTER § 43-33
C:907
D. Conformity required for apportionments and subdivisions. Where a lot
is formed hereafter from part of a lot already occupied by a building or
structure, such separation shall be effected in such manner as not to
impair conformity with any of the requirements of this chapter with
respect to the existing building or structure and all yards and other
required spaces in connection therewith, and no permit shall be issued
for the erection of a building or structure on the new lot thus created
unless it complies with all the provisions of this chapter.
E. Irregularly shaped lots. Where a question exists as to the proper
application of any of the requirements of this chapter to a particular lot
because of its peculiar or irregular shape, the Commissioner of the
Department of Housing and Buildings shall determine how the
requirements of this chapter apply.
F. New buildings or structures on lots smaller than the minimum required
area or dimension.
(1) A permit may be issued for the erection of a building or structure
for a single-family detached dwelling on a lot for which a valid
conveyance has been recorded prior to July 3, 1968,
notwithstanding that the area or dimensions of such lot are less
than that required for the district in which such lot is located,
provided that:
(a) The lot met the zoning requirements at the time the deed to the
lot was recorded or the title to the lot was conveyed;
(b) All yard setbacks and other building-related requirements
which are in effect at the time of the obtaining of the building
permit are complied with; and
(c) The ownership of such lot was not the same as any other lot or
lots contiguous thereto as of July 3, 1968. If the opposite is the
case, such other lot or lots, or so much thereof as may be
necessary, shall be combined with the first-named lot to make
one or more conforming lots, whereupon a permit may be
issued, but only for conforming lots when so combined.
(2) Where the required area or dimensions of lots are changed by an
amendment to this chapter, any lot legally in existence on that date
and made nonconforming by such amendment may be built upon as
provided in this section.
G. Use of yards. No accessory use, building or structure shall be permitted
within any minimum required yard except as may be specifically
permitted in Article VI, Supplementary Use and Dimensional
Regulations, and Article VII, Special Use Permits, of this chapter.
H. No reduction of required yards. No lot shall be so reduced in area as to
make any yard or court smaller than the minimum required under this
chapter.
§ 43-33 YONKERS CODE § 43-33
C:908
I. Front yards and side-front yards on corner lots. The owner of a corner
lot in a residence district may elect either yard fronting on a street as
the front yard, with any other yard fronting on a street then becoming a
side-front yard. However, where the majority of lots in any block are
developed, the front yard shall be on the same side as the front yards of
such other lots. Also, in the instance where the approving agency or the
Commissioner of the Department of Housing and Buildings finds that,
on the street chosen for the side-front yard for a corner lot for a singlefamily
or two-family dwelling, there is an average setback of existing
buildings, from which no building departs too greatly, the agency or
Commissioner may require the side-front yard on such corner lot to be
equal in depth to such average setback.
J. Front yards.
(1) In all districts where a front yard is required, a through lot shall
have a front yard on both street frontages and no rear yard shall be
required.
(2) In any residence district where 25% of a block frontage is improved
with buildings of the same type, the front yard of a building shall be
required to exceed the minimum dimension prescribed in Table
43-3247 for such district if the average alignment of the two nearest
buildings exceeds such minimum dimension. Such front yard shall
extend to such average alignment; provided, however, that in no
case shall such front yard be required to exceed by more than 15
feet the minimum permitted front yard prescribed in Table 43-3248
for the district in which such building is situated. In a one-family
district and a two-family district, however, where 25% of a block
frontage is improved with buildings of the same type and the front
yard of such buildings is less than the minimum dimension
prescribed in the Schedule of Dimensional Regulations (Table
43-3249) for such districts, the front yard shall be permitted to
extend to such average alignment.
(3) Wherever a portion of a front yard or side-front yard is being taken
for the widening or improvement of any street right-of-way, the
buildings or structures on such a lot shall be required to measure
the yard setbacks from the taking line rather than the existing
right-of-way line.
K. Side yards of existing lots narrower than 50 feet. For each one foot by
which a lot in a residential district is narrower than 50 feet, 1 1/2 inches
may be deducted from the required minimum width of any side yard
and three inches from the sum of the required widths of both side yards
for buildings or structures not exceeding 2 1/2 stories or 35 feet;
247. Editor's Note: Table 43-3 is included at the end of this chapter.
248. Editor's Note: Table 43-3 is included at the end of this chapter.
249. Editor's Note: Table 43-3 is included at the end this chapter.
§ 43-33 CHARTER § 43-33
C:909
provided, however, that no side yard shall be narrower at any point than
three feet in any case. [Amended 10-12-2004 by G.O. No. 6-2004]
L. Rear yards of existing lots with less than 100 feet of lot depth. For each
one foot by which a lot in a residence district is less than 100 feet deep,
three inches may be deducted from the required minimum rear yard
setback; provided, however, that no required rear yard shall be less
than 15 feet deep in any case.
M. Yard requirements for condominium units. The entire building or
buildings and structures constituting a condominium shall comply with
all dimensional requirements of this chapter, except that the individual
apartments or dwelling units need not comply with the dimensional
regulations relating to minimum required lot area, width and yard
requirements.
N. Floor area ratios.
(1) Calculation of floor area ratios shall be consistent with the
definition thereof provided in Article II, Definitions, of this chapter
and the provisions as provided in this section.
(2) In a B District, a building combining nonresidential and residential
uses shall not exceed a floor area ratio determined by the following
formula:
Where:
f = Permitted floor area ratio
a = Number of stories devoted in whole or in part to residential
uses
b = Number of stories devoted exclusively to nonresidential uses
s = Total number of stories.
In no case shall the permitted floor area ratio exceed 1.50.
(3) In a BA District, a building combining nonresidential and
residential uses shall not exceed a floor area ratio determined by
the following formula:
§ 43-33 YONKERS CODE § 43-33

f = Permitted floor area ratio
a = Number of stories devoted in whole or in part to residential
uses
b = Number of stories devoted exclusively to nonresidential uses
s = Total number of stories
In no case shall the permitted floor area ratio exceed 5.0.
O. Exceptions to the height limitations of the Schedule of Dimensional
Regulations (Table 43-3250). The height limitations provided for in the
Schedule of Dimensional Regulations (Table 43-3) shall not apply to:
(1) Rooftop bulkheads, elevator penthouses, water towers, water
tanks, monitors, fire towers, hose towers or cooling towers, radio
antennas, stage towers or scenery lofts, provided that such
features shall be erected only to the heights necessary to
accomplish the purpose they are intended to serve. The total area
covered by such features shall not exceed 20% of the horizontal
area of the roof on which they are located or 10% of the lot area,
whichever is the lesser, except that such limitation shall not apply
on a designated development site. Where the lot on which they are
located is in or adjacent to a residence district, such features shall
be set back from the edge of the roof at least one foot for each one
foot by which such features exceed the maximum height otherwise
specified for the district in which they are located. [Added
5-19-2009 by G.O. No. 3-2009]
(2) Parapet walls or cornices which do not exceed the maximum height
requirement for the district in which they are located by more than
five feet.

C:912
R. Protection of adjacent properties. In order to enhance the safety of
residents and provide protection to buildings and persons associated
with adjacent properties, the approving agency may require that steep
slopes, retaining walls and/or rock cuts that are created by new
development and that will remain as a feature of the final site
development comply with the required minimum setback distance and
be constructed and/or created no closer to the property line than the
required setback. A fence of appropriate material may be required to be
erected within the new development property line and a second fence
to serve as an additional safety barrier and warning device shall be
erected between the property line and the steep slope, retaining wall,
and/or cut. [Added 4-9-2013 by G.O. No. 2-2013251]
S. Steep slope sureties. [Added 4-9-2013 by G.O. No. 2-2013]
(1) Completion of work. To ensure compliance with all requirements of
stormwater control measures of an approved permit, the approving
agency may require the applicant to provide a performance
guarantee or surety, prior to construction, in the form of a
performance bond, escrow account certification, or irrevocable
letter of credit from an insured financial institution. The guarantee
shall be for the full cost of all stormwater, erosion and
sedimentation control work to be performed on the property for
purposes of steep slope protection subject to the permit and shall
be payable solely to the City of Yonkers. The approving agency, with
the assistance of the City Engineer, shall determine the amount
based on the final design plans and actual construction costs.
(2) Maintenance of facilities. Where stormwater management and
erosion control facilities are to be operated and maintained by the

development, the approving agency shall require the developer to
provide the City of Yonkers with a written guarantee satisfactory to
the Corporation Counsel to ensure maintenance during the life of
the facility of all approved stormwater management and erosion
control facilities. Additionally, an operations and maintenance
manual shall be produced by the developer, reviewed and approved
by the City, prior to placing the facilities into operation. Changes to
the system, if any, shall be reflected in the manual and shall be
submitted to the City at the time of any such change.

community residential facility for the disabled for up to 14 persons shall
be subject to the following procedural requirements, in addition to
those others required by this chapter, and shall be subject to the same
dimensional standards and requirements for that of a detached singlefamily
dwelling within the district in which it is located.
(1) If a sponsoring agency intends to establish a community residential
facility for the disabled for up to 14 persons but does not have a
specific site selected, it may notify the Mayor of Yonkers, in writing,
of its intentions and include in such notice a description of the
nature, size and community support requirements of the program.
(2) If such a site has been selected by the sponsoring agency, it shall
notify the Mayor of Yonkers, in writing, and include in such notice
the specific address of the site, the type of community residence,
the number of residents and the community support requirements
of the program. Such notice shall also contain the most recently
published data, compiled pursuant to § 463 of the Social Services
Law, which can reasonably be expected to permit the City to
evaluate all such facilities affecting the nature and character of the
area wherein such proposed facility is to be located.
(3) The Mayor shall refer such a notice to the Planning Board, which
shall have 40 days after the receipt of such notice to:
(a) Approve the site recommended by the sponsoring agency;
(b) Suggest one or more suitable sites within the City of Yonkers
which could accommodate such a facility; or
(c) Object to the establishment of a facility of the kind described
by the sponsoring agency because to do so would result in such
a concentration of community residential facilities for the
mentally disabled in the municipality or in the area in
proximity to the site selected or a combination of such facilities
with other community residences or similar facilities licensed
by other agencies of state government that the nature and
character of the areas within the City would be substantially
altered.
§ 43-33 YONKERS CODE § 43-34
C:914
(4) Such response shall be forwarded to the sponsoring agency and the
commissioner of the office of the department responsible for
issuing the license and operating certificate of the proposed facility
("commissioner" hereafter in this section). If the Planning Board
does not respond within 40 days, the sponsoring agency may
establish the proposed community residence at the site
recommended in its notice.
(5) Prior to forwarding a response to the sponsoring agency and the
commissioner, the Planning Board may hold a public hearing
pursuant to the requirements of this chapter, including public
notice and posting of signs.
(6) If the Planning Board approves the site recommended by the
sponsoring agency, the sponsoring agency shall seek to establish
the facility at the approved site.
(7) If the site or sites suggested by the Planning Board are satisfactory
with regard to the nature, size and community support
requirements of the program of the proposed facility and the area
in which such site or sites are located does not already include an
excessive number of community residential facilities for the
mentally disabled or similar facilities licensed by other state
agencies, the sponsoring agency shall seek to establish its facility
at one of the sites designated by the Planning Board.
(8) If the Planning Board suggests a site or sites which are not
satisfactory to the sponsoring agency, the agency shall so notify the
Planning Board, which shall have 15 days to suggest an alternative
site or sites for the proposed community residential facility.
(9) In the event that the Planning Board objects to establishment of a
facility in the City because to do so would result in such a
concentration of community residential facilities for the mentally
disabled or combination of such facilities and other facilities
licensed by other state agencies that the nature and character of
areas within the City would be substantially altered; or the
sponsoring agency objects to the establishment of a facility in the
area or areas suggested by the Planning Board; or in the event that
the Planning Board and sponsoring agency cannot agree upon a
site, either the sponsoring agency or the Planning Board may
request an immediate hearing before the commissioner to resolve
the issue. The commissioner shall personally or by a hearing officer
conduct such a hearing within 15 days of such a request.
(10) In reviewing any such objections, the need for such facilities in the
City shall be considered as shall the existing concentration of such
facilities and other similar facilities licensed by other state
agencies in the City or in the area in proximity to the City selected
and any other facilities in the City or in the area in proximity to the
site selected providing residential services to a significant number
§ 43-34 CHARTER § 43-34
C:915
of persons who have formerly received inpatient mental health
services in facilities of the Office of Mental Health or the Office
of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities. The
commissioner shall sustain the objection if he determines that the
nature and character of the area in which the facility is to be based
would be substantially altered as a result of establishment of the
facility. The commissioner shall make a determination within 30
days of the hearing.
(11) Review of a decision rendered by a commissioner pursuant to this
section may be had in a proceeding, pursuant to Article 78 of the
Civil Practice Law and Rules, commenced within 30 days of the
determination of the commissioner.
(12) A licensing authority shall not issue an operating certificate to a
sponsoring agency for operation of a facility if the sponsoring
agency does not notify the municipality of its intention to establish
a program as required by this section. Any operating certificate
issued without compliance with the provisions of this section shall
be considered null and void, and continued operation of the facility
may be enjoined.

Department of Housing and Buildings.
(3) Failure to keep a valid license or operating certificate on file with
the Department of Housing and Buildings, or other violations of the
applicable standards and regulations of this chapter and the City
Code, shall be valid grounds upon which a certificate of occupancy

open-air parking areas shall be provided on the same lot as the
principal use or building or on a separate lot, provided that
such parking structures and open-air parking areas on a
separate lot are no more than 300 feet, measured by the
shortest publicly available route for pedestrian travel, from the
property line nearest the entrance of the principal use or
building which such parking serves to the pedestrian entrance
of such parking structure or open air parking area closest to
such property line, and further provided that as a condition of
its approval, the agency approving a site plan shall require a
legal instrument satisfactory to the Corporation Counsel of the
City of Yonkers assuring the continued existence and use of
such semipublic parking for the duration of the principal use or
building which such parking serves. [Added 5-19-2009 by
G.O. No. 3-2009]
(3) Where a semipublic parking structure is constructed within the
main walls of the principal building to which it is accessory, or on
the same lot or wholly below the level of the first nonparking floor
of such principal building, the floor area of such semipublic garage
shall be excluded from the computation of gross floor area of such
principal building, its floor area ratio and its lot coverage but shall
adhere to the setback and height restriction for principal buildings
on the lot.
(4) When such a semipublic parking structure is constructed outside
the main walls of the principal building to which it is accessory or
in whole or in part above the level of the first nonparking floor of
such principal building, the floor area of such semipublic parking
structure shall be included in the computation of the gross floor
area of such principal building, its floor area ratio and its lot
coverage but shall meet the setback and height requirements as
provided for herein.
(5) All semipublic open-air parking areas shall be set back a minimum
of five feet from any property line and 10 feet from any building on
the same lot, except that, where such parking area is at average
level at least 10 feet below the level of the lowest nonparking floor,
§ 43-44 YONKERS CODE § 43-44
C:970
§ 43-45. Planned Multi-Use (PMD) District. [Added 12-9-2005 by
G.O. 13-2005; amended 5-2-2006 by G.O. No. 5-2006]
the boundaries of such parking area may be at a minimum distance
of five feet from such building.
(6) All semipublic parking structures which are not constructed wholly
within or below the principal building shall be set back from a
property line at a minimum of one foot for every one foot in height
above average finished grade measured at the midpoint of the
parking structure facing that property line. However, in no event
shall such a setback be less than 15 feet. No such semipublic
parking structure shall exceed a height of five levels, including the
roof level, or 50% of the permitted height of the principal building
within the district, whichever is the lesser.
(7) Except on a designated development site, no semipublic parking
structure provided below the principal building to which it is
accessory shall contain more than five parking levels above the
lowest grade. [Amended 5-19-2009 by G.O. No. 3-2009]
(8) All such semipublic parking structures and open-air parking areas
shall be constructed in accordance with the requirements of Article
X, Off-Street Parking and Loading.
(9) When a semipublic parking structure is located within a residential
zone or adjacent to a residential zone boundary or residential use,
an all-season evergreen buffer of a minimum width of 10 feet, and a
height of at least six feet when planted and at least 15 feet when
fully grown, shall be provided adjacent to the property line for
whatever length the semipublic garage is exposed to such
residential district boundary or use.
C. Public parking garages and public parking lots. Off-street parking
accessory to a principal use of building on a designated development
site may be provided in one or more public parking garages or public
parking lots, provided that such parking garages and parking lots are
no more than 500 feet, measured by the shortest available publicly
available route for pedestrian travel, from the property line nearest the
entrance of the principal use or building which such parking serves to
the pedestrian entrance of such parking garage or parking lot closest to
such property line. [Added 5-19-2009 by G.O. No. 3-2009]
A. Zoning objectives. The purpose of the PMD District is to provide for, and
to foster, the comprehensive planning of large scale, integrated mixeduse
commercial and high-density residential developments on tracts of
80 or more acres pursuant to a Comprehensive Development Plan
("CDP").
B. Zoning Map amendments. The City Council may, pursuant to the
provisions of Article XIII of the Zoning Ordinance (as supplemented by
§ 43-44 CHARTER § 43-45
C:971
Subsection C of this § 43-45), amend the Zoning Map of the City of
Yonkers to designate tracts to be included in the PMD District, provided
that such designation shall be limited to tracts of at least 80 acres and
that each such designation shall be accompanied by the adoption of a
CDP for each tract so designated. Upon such designation and adoption,
such tract shall become a "PMD tract" for all purposes of the Zoning
Ordinance.
C. Petition for amendment; CDP requirements.
(1) Any person making a petition to the City Council to amend the
Zoning Map of the City of Yonkers to include additional lands in the
PMD District shall, in addition to submitting such other
documentation and information as may be required pursuant to
Article XIII of the Zoning Ordinance, submit a CDP covering the
entire tract sought to be included, drawn at a scale of one inch
equals 100 feet, together with a copy thereof on a single sheet
measuring 11 inches by 17 inches, which complies with the site
plan requirements (which, as applied in the PMD District, shall be
mandatory) set forth in § 43-168C(7) of the Zoning Ordinance, and
which includes, in addition to such requirements, the location and
ownership (whether public or private) of all roads and drives
proposed on the site.
(2) The CDP shall include a legend or a schedule setting forth:
(a) The aggregate maximum gross floor area and the finished floor
elevation of the first floor of all buildings proposed for
development in the PMD tract; and
(b) The proposed number and dimensions of required parking
spaces for the PMD tract, in accordance with the provisions of
Subsection G of this § 43-45.
(3) The CDP shall, with respect to each building (as that term is
defined in § 43-8 of the Zoning Ordinance) set forth the proposed
use or uses of such building designated in terms of one or more of
the following five categories of uses: residential; office; retail;
hotel/conference center; and movie theater. In the alternative, a
proposed CDP may show the PMD tract divided into any number of
"development modules," to include one or more buildings and
surrounding land area, and in such case shall designate the
proposed use or uses (from among the five general categories listed
above) for each development module. The designation of such
development modules shall not constitute a subdivision, nor shall
such development modules constitute, without more, lots, blocks,
parcels, or tracts, as those terms are defined in the Zoning
Ordinance.
(4) If and in the event that a PMD tract is so located as to be subject to
the provisions of the Yonkers Affordable Housing Ordinance,
Article XV of the Zoning Ordinance, and if the CDP for such PMD
§ 43-45 YONKERS CODE § 43-45
C:972
tract proposes multifamily development as that term is defined in
§ 43-193, then the CDP shall, in addition to the matters required
to be set forth pursuant to the foregoing Subsection C(1) through
(3), designate the total number of dwelling units proposed for
development in the PMD tract.
D. Dimensional standards and requirements.
(1) The dimensional standards and requirements set forth in this
Subsection D shall apply in the PMD District. Such standards and
requirements, as well as the provisions of a CDP adopted by the
City Council with respect to a PMD tract, shall apply to, run with,
and bind, each PMD tract as a whole, notwithstanding that such
PMD tract may be comprised of more than one lot or parcel of land
as those terms are defined in § 43-8 of the Zoning Ordinance, and
that a PMD tract may, from time to time, in the course of
development or following development, be subdivided,
resubdivided, traversed by public or private roads or streets,
conveyed in separate ownership, leased, converted to
condominium ownership, or otherwise divided.
(2) For the purpose of determining floor area ratios as well as for all
other computations requiring a determination of the area of the
PMD tract, such area shall be fixed and determined as of the date of
adoption by the City Council of a Zoning Map Amendment pursuant
to Subsection B of this § 43-45, designating a PMD tract included in
the PMD District, and shall include the entire area of the PMD
tract. The area of a PMD tract shall include all land areas and all
areas of streams or water bodies lying within the boundaries of the
PMD tract, including areas proposed to be offered to the City of
Yonkers for dedication, but shall exclude any existing public streets
abutting or crossing the PMD tract. The area of a PMD tract shall
not be deemed to have been reduced or diminished:
(a) By the subsequent inclusion or creation therein of public
rights-of-way, parkland, or other public lands;
(b) Upon the taking of any portion thereof by eminent domain or
otherwise; or
(c) By operation of any ordinance, rule, or regulation (whether
now in effect or hereafter adopted) of the City of Yonkers
providing for subtraction of wetlands, slopes, or other
environmentally sensitive lands in the determination of land
area.
(3) Table 43-3, Schedule of Dimensional Regulations, and Subsection D
of § 43-41, Subsection F of § 43-43, Subsection B of § 43-74, and
Subsection B of § 43-151, of the Zoning Ordinance shall not apply
in the PMD District.
§ 43-45 CHARTER § 43-45
C:973
(4) All determinations relating to setbacks, building coverage, floor
area ratios, and parking and loading requirements in the PMD
District shall be made with reference to the boundaries of the PMD
tract, and treating the PMD tract as a single lot, notwithstanding
that the PMD tract may constitute more than one lot or parcel, or
that the PMD tract may be, or may have been, divided in
accordance with the provisions of Subsection I of this § 43-45; or
that one or more public streets may be established in, or traverse,
the PMD tract.
(5) Dimensional requirements in the PMD District shall be as shown on
the CDP adopted by the City Council with respect to a PMD tract,
subject, however, to the following limitations on bulk and height:
(a) The maximum floor area ratio shall be 1.6. The term "gross
floor area" as applied in the PMD District, shall not include the
floor area of:
[1] Any floor or portion thereof used for parking; or
[2] Any area used exclusively for the storage of goods or
equipment incidental to a retail use; or
[3] Any external terrace or walkway at least one side of which
is open and not enclosed by a full-height wall, irrespective
of whether such terrace or walkway is at or above ground
level, and whether or not the same is roofed or otherwise
covered.
(b) The maximum permitted height for all nonresidential uses
(excluding hotels) shall be no more than seven stories or 90
feet, whichever is the greater, measured from the finished floor
elevation of the first floor of each building as shown on the
CDP.
(c) The maximum permitted height for all residential uses and
hotels shall be no more than 16 stories or 180 feet, whichever
is the greater, measured from the finished floor elevation of the
first floor of each building as shown on the CDP.
(d) In the case of any mixed-use building (that is, a building
proposed for both residential and nonresidential uses) such
building shall, for the purpose of determining the applicable
maximum permitted height, be considered a residential
building if at least 20% of the gross floor area of the building
including and above the first floor thereof (and excluding
parking) is dedicated to residential uses, and otherwise shall
be considered a nonresidential building.
(e) In determining building height in the PMD District, the
exclusions provided in Subsection O of § 43-33 shall apply. In
addition, roof- mounted mechanical equipment and the
§ 43-45 YONKERS CODE § 43-45
C:974
structures supporting such equipment, and decorative
architectural features (such as clock towers) which may be
constructed over, or project from, a building but which do
not increase its interior volume, shall be excluded from the
determination of building height. Any floor used solely for
parking or to house mechanical equipment, or a combination
of parking and mechanical equipment, shall not be considered
a story.
(f) The maximum building coverage shall be 50%.
E. Uses subject to site plan approval. All uses permitted in the PMD
District shall be subject to site plan review and approval pursuant to the
provisions of Article IX of the Zoning Ordinance except as and to the
extent the standards set forth therein are varied or modified pursuant
to this Subsection E.
(1) The initial site plan submitted for the development of a PMD tract
may include all or a portion of the PMD tract, and shall comply in
all material respects with the CDP adopted by the City Council in
respect of such PMD tract. Any site plan amendment required
pursuant to § 43-111 of the Zoning Ordinance shall be limited to
include only so much of the PMD tract as shall be affected by such
amendment.
(2) No site plan or site plan amendment shall be approved by the
Planning Board unless the Planning Board determines that such
site plan (or site plan amendment) complies in all material respects
with the CDP adopted by the City Council.
(3) For purposes of this Subsection E, a site plan (or site plan
amendment) shall be deemed not to comply with the CDP adopted
by the City Council if:
(a) The use specified in such site plan for any building or
development module is not among the Uses specified for such
building or development module in the CDP; or
(b) The height of any building shown on such site plan exceeds the
height of such building as specified on the CDP by more than
one story; or
(c) The aggregate gross floor area of all buildings proposed for
development in the PMD tract exceeds the maximum gross
floor area specified in the CDP pursuant to Subsection C of this
§ 43-45 by more than 5%.
(4) As respects the application of § 43-105 (Standards of review for site
plan approval) of the Zoning Ordinance, the site plan for
development of a PMD tract shall be deemed adequate for the
purpose of the determinations required pursuant to § 43-105A
§ 43-45 CHARTER § 43-45
C:975
through D if such site plan is in substantial conformity with the CDP
for such PMD tract.
(5) As respects the application of § 43-110 (Occupancy prior to
completion) of the Zoning Ordinance, recognizing the scope of
development contemplated in the PMD District and the necessity to
phase such development over a period of time, if the Commissioner
of the Department of Housing and Buildings determines that any
building or group of buildings, or any use, in the PMD tract is
substantially complete, that it meets the requirements of all
applicable building, fire, and life safety codes and ordinances, and
that safe and adequate access has been provided to such building,
group of buildings or use, the Commissioner of Housing and
Buildings may issue a permanent certificate of use and occupancy
with respect to any such building, group of buildings, or use
notwithstanding that remaining elements of the approved site plan
have not been commenced or completed.
(6) As respects the application of § 43-111 (Amendments to approved
site plan) of the Zoning Ordinance, the Commissioner of the
Department of Housing and Buildings may authorize changes and
adjustments to an approved site plan, notwithstanding that such
changes and adjustments might otherwise be considered
"substantial" pursuant to Subsection B of § 43-111, without the
necessity for review and approval of an amended site plan by the
Planning Board, if the Commissioner of Housing and Buildings
determines that such change involves a change in the location,
arrangement, or function of proposed buildings shown on the
approved site plan without materially increasing the scale of such
buildings or changing the uses thereof.
(7) The provisions of § 43-112 of the Zoning Ordinance shall not apply
in the PMD District. An approved site plan for a PMD tract shall
expire if construction of site improvements or buildings does not
commence within 48 months after final approval of such site plan,
and if construction of the foundation of at least one building shown
on the site plan is not completed within said period of time.
F. Uses subject to supplemental requirements.
(1) To the extent that any use permitted in the PMD District is
designated in Table 43-1 as being permitted with supplemental
requirements (Ps), the supplementary use and dimensional
regulations set forth in Article VI shall, in the PMD District, serve
as guidelines only, and shall not be mandatory.
(2) The provisions of Subsection C of § 43-34, Subsection K of § 43-36,
Subsection A of § 43-43, Subsection C(2) through (4) of § 43-43,
§ 43-44, Subsection I(1) and (2) of § 43-74, and Subsection D(4) of
§ 44-43, shall not apply in the PMD District.
G. Off-street parking and loading.
§ 43-45 YONKERS CODE § 43-45
C:976
(1) The provisions of Article X (Off-Street Parking and Loading) of the
Zoning Ordinance shall, with the exception of the first sentence of
§§ 43-127, 43-134A(1), and 43-128 through 43-130, and as modified
in this Subsection G, apply in the PMD District; provided, however,
that the PMD tract shall, for purposes of Article X, constitute a
single lot, and provided further that consistent with the objectives
of the PMD District to provide for integrated mixed-use commercial
and residential development, and recognizing that the cycles of
peak use of required parking facilities vary with respect to different
uses, the total number of required parking spaces within a PMD
tract shall be as shown on the CDP adopted by the City Council for
such parcel.
(2) Whenever, pursuant to this § 43-45, the City Council adopts a CDP
for a PMD tract, the City Council shall, based upon a showing of the
variety of uses proposed for a PMD tract and the varied cycles of
peak intensity of such uses, determine the total number of parking
spaces required to safely and adequately serve the PMD tract,
which total number may be less than that which would be required
if the parking requirements for all uses in the PMD tract were
determined separately.
(3) If, and in the event that, the City Council determines, pursuant to
the foregoing Subsection G(2), that the parking requirement for a
PMD tract shall be less than that which would be required if the
parking requirements for all uses in such PMD tract were
determined separately, the CDP adopted with respect to such PMD
tract shall include a table setting forth the proposed parking usage,
by percentage, of the following five general categories of uses, to
the extent each appears in the CDP for such PMD tract: residential;
office; retail; hotel/conference center; and movie theater. If,
following the adoption of the CDP for a PMD tract, any application
for site plan approval or site plan amendment shall show an
increase in the intensity (square footage of nonresidential uses and
number of units for residential uses) of any such proposed general
category of use of five percentage points from that shown on the
CDP for such general category of use, or shall show an increase of
five percentage points or more in the aggregate intensity of all uses
from that shown on the CDP, the Planning Board shall, in
considering such application, review the parking requirement
shown on the CDP to determine whether such requirement, as
determined by the City Council, continues to be appropriate in light
of any such change. The Planning Board may, following such
review, revise the parking requirement for such PMD parcel, either
upward or downward, upon the determination of the number of
parking spaces required to safely and adequately serve the PMD
tract in light of such change; provided, however, that if the total
gross floor area reflected in any such application for site plan
approval is less than the gross floor area shown on the CDP than
§ 43-45 CHARTER § 43-45
C:977
the total number of required parking spaces shall be reduced in
proportion to such reduction in gross floor area.
(4) All parking spaces and loading spaces provided in a PMD tract shall
be deemed "off-street parking spaces and off-street loading spaces"
for purposes of all requirements of the Zoning Ordinance,
notwithstanding that such parking spaces and loading spaces may
be provided on public or private streets or roads within the PMD
tract, subject only to the requirement that such parking spaces and
loading spaces lie entirely within the PMD tract, and that such
spaces are not so located as to obstruct the safe flow of traffic.
(5) Any provision of § 43-134 notwithstanding, in a PMD tract where
parking is parallel to a curb or along the wall of a building, spaces
shall be eight feet wide by 20 feet long for all spaces.
H. Signs.
(1) In keeping with the mixed-use nature of the PMD tract, and for the
purpose of fostering the orderly commercial development thereof
and the flow of traffic and pedestrians therein, certain restrictions
and limitations on the erection and display of signs set forth in
Chapter 47 shall not apply to internal signs or to external wall
signs. "Internal signs" shall mean those signs which identify
businesses, advertise goods and services, or provide directional
information within the PMD tract, and which are not visible (or are
only occasionally or incidentally visible) from outside the PMD
tract, as set forth below. "External wall signs" shall mean those
signs which identify businesses within the PMD tract, and which
are set back a minimum of 200 feet from the closest residence that
is not in the PMD tract.
(2) The provisions of §§ 47-7, 47-8C, 47-8E, and 47-13A, B(1), and (2) of
the Code of the City of Yonkers shall not apply to internal signs in
the PMD tract. Further, any provision of § 47-7C(6) to the contrary
notwithstanding, the maximum height of an external wall sign shall
be 10 feet.
(3) As respects § 47-13B(3) of the Code of the City of Yonkers, the onethousand-
foot limiting distance from a public park shall not apply to
internal signs as measured from a public park that is not in the
PMD tract. Further, any provision of § 47-13 to the contrary
notwithstanding one roof sign and one wall sign (neither of which
need be an internal sign) identifying by name the project developed
in the PMD tract, may be erected in the PMD tract. Such single roof
or wall sign shall not be subject to the dimensional limitations set
forth in § 47-7D(6).
(4) As used in § 43-8 of the Zoning Ordinance, the term "premises"
shall be deemed to include the entire PMD tract.
§ 43-45 YONKERS CODE § 43-45
C:978
(5) Notwithstanding any contrary provision of § 47-7J of the Code of
the City of Yonkers, the term "billboard" shall not include the
display of outdoor advertising by means of pasting or painting
posters, pictures, or reading material, or any combination thereof,
on or within a bus shelter, kiosk, news rack, or similar advertising
panel structure erected, installed, or maintained in a PMD tract.
(6) As used in §§ 47-7A(8) and 47-7B(2) of the Code of the City of
Yonkers, the term "corporation or enterprise" shall refer to each
separate store, service establishment, or other business, located in
the PMD tract. Further, the PMD tract itself shall, for the purposes
of these subsections, be considered a "corporation or enterprise"
and each entrance thereto shall be considered a "location."
(7) Directional signs and street name signs erected within the PMD
tract for the purpose of directing pedestrians and/or motorists to
specific streets, locations, or businesses in the PMD tract may be
placed as required and shall not be limited in number pursuant to
§§ 47-7A(8) and 47-7B(2) notwithstanding that such signs may
constitute "ground signs" or "pole signs" as limited in those
subsections.
(8) With respect to each entrance from a public street to and within the
PMD tract, in addition to such signs as may otherwise be allowed
pursuant to Chapter 47 of the Code of the City of Yonkers, four
signs each not exceeding 100 square feet in total area per sign face
and not more than 35 feet in height, which set forth the name of the
project or development constituting the PMD tract, as well as one
sign at each such entrance containing a directory of the various
businesses and uses within the PMD tract, each not exceeding 100
square feet in total area and not more than 20 feet in height, may
be erected, either within the PMD tract, or outside the PMD tract
(and outside the PMD District) adjacent to a public street providing
access to the PMD tract.
I. Subdivision of PMD tract. A PMD tract may, for purposes of dedication,
the creation of public roads and rights-of-way, sale, lease, mortgage, or
other disposition or financing, be subdivided or re-subdivided,
converted to condominium or cooperative ownership, or otherwise
divided into lots, parcels, tracts, or Development Modules, and may be
sold, leased, mortgaged, or otherwise alienated or encumbered,
without regard to any minimum lot area or to any other dimensional or
bulk requirement or development control set forth in this § 43-45 or
elsewhere in the Zoning Ordinance, and any such action shall not be
deemed to constitute or to create a "Subdivision" as that term is defined
is § 46-1 of the City of Yonkers Code provided, however, that all lots,
parcels, tracts, or Development Modules so created shall be developed
and used only in accordance with the CDP for such PMD tract or, if final
site plan approval has been granted with respect to a PMD tract, in
accordance with such approved site plan. Upon application to the Tax
Assessor of the City of Yonkers by the owner, lessee, or mortgagee of a
§ 43-45 CHARTER § 43-45
C:979
§ 43-46. Designated development sites. [Added 5-19-2009 by G.O.
No. 3-2009]
The City Council may, upon petition by one or more applicants, designate
an area within the CB and/or GC Districts of not less than 10 acres in the
aggregate and comprised of one or more parcels and/or lots as a single
designated development site for the purpose of effecting the comprehensive
redevelopment of an area of the City. The following supplemental
regulations shall apply to a designated development site:
lot, parcel, tract, or Development Module (including, without limitation,
a condominium unit) created pursuant to this Subsection I, the Tax
Assessor shall assign tax lot designations to any and all lots, parcels,
tracts, or Development Modules created pursuant hereto,
notwithstanding that such lots, parcels, tracts, or Development
Modules may not otherwise meet dimensional or bulk requirements or
development controls provided in any law, ordinance, rule or regulation
of the City of Yonkers.
J. Amendments to CDP. A CDP for a PMD tract, once adopted by the City
Council, may not be amended other than by action of the City Council
upon a petition submitted in accordance with the provisions of Article
XIII of the Zoning Ordinance. Such amendment shall, for all purposes of
such Article XIII, be deemed an amendment to the Zoning Map and
shall be subject to all of the standards and procedures, including
without limitation the filing, notice, and fee requirements, of Article
XIII.
K. Affordable housing. If and to the extent that a PMD tract is so located as
to be subject to the Yonkers Affordable Housing Ordinance, Article XV
of the Zoning Ordinance, and includes multifamily development, as that
term is defined in § 43-193, then such multifamily development shall
comply with the provisions of Article XV for so long as such Article XV
shall remain in effect pursuant to the provisions of § 43-192 subject,
however, to the following:
(1) As respects the application of § 43-195, if the CDP for the PMD
tract proposes development, in the aggregate, of more than 500
multifamily units, then any provision of § 43-195 to the contrary
notwithstanding, the provisions of Subsection B of § 43-195 shall
apply to the PMD tract, and the required set-aside of assisted units
shall be reduced to 10% of the maximum aggregate number of
multifamily units authorized for construction in such PMD tract.
A. The dimensional regulations of this chapter, including but not limited to
the supplementary regulations in § 43-33 of this chapter, shall apply to
the entire tract designated as a designated development site and not to
any of the individual parcels and/or lots which comprise the designated
development site or any of the individual lots into which the designated
development site is subdivided, and regardless of the ownership of the
§ 43-45 YONKERS CODE § 43-46
C:980
§ 43-47. South Broadway District. [Added 11-22-2011 by G.O. No.
4-2011]
parcels and/or lots shall be used only in accordance with the approved
site plan for the designated development site.
B. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the parcels and/or
lots which comprise a designated development site or the lots into
which a designated development site is subdivided may be separated by
public or private streets or rights-of-way.
C. The individual lots into which a designated development site is
subdivided shall not be required to comply with the lot and dimensional

for existing buildings when compliance with the parking
analysis as outlined below can be established.
[2] The Planning Board may reduce the parking requirements
in Table 43-4, Schedule of Parking Regulations, up to 50%
for new development when compliance with the parking
analysis as outlined below can be established.
[3] A parking analysis shall be submitted to the Planning
Board to identify existing parking availability and demand
within the project area. The analysis shall include all onstreet
parking within 500 feet of the site located within
any commercial district and shall include all side streets
for 100 feet from the commercial street(s). The analysis
shall identify all available on-street parking and
commercial off-street parking facilities within the area.
The occupancy and turnover rates of these spaces shall be
identified during the peak weekday a.m. and p.m. period
and during the midday weekend period for at least two
separate occasions or as determined necessary by the
262. Editor's Note: Table 43-3 is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 43-74 CHARTER § 43-74
C:1025
Planning Board. The Planning Board may reduce on-site
parking requirements by 50% of any established excess
parking capacity identified by the parking analysis. In
addition, the Planning Board may reduce required on-site
parking by the number of metered parking spaces
provided along the street frontage of the site. The parking
analysis shall identify any public transportation within 500
feet of the site and the type and location of residential
neighborhoods within 1,500 feet to assist the Planning
Board in determining actual parking demands.
[4] The Planning Board may determine that a fee in lieu of
parking may be used in place of the provision of parking
for a development. The Planning Board may in that case
consult with the Traffic Engineer and the Yonkers Parking
Authority about the potential to provide alternate parking
solutions via payment by the applicant.
[5] All uses proposed in any planned neighborhood
commercial development shall be subject to review for
parking impact. The reduction in parking allowed in a
planned neighborhood commercial development shall be
based upon the mix of uses that are initially proposed. The
Planning Board shall review all new or expanded uses to
the same standard as was required for the initial
placement of the planned neighborhood commercial
development. New or expanded uses may be permitted
only subject to a finding that the conditions that initially
allowed the planned neighborhood commercial
development remain in effect.
(c) Design standards.
[1] Developments shall be designed to complement the
existing historic and/or traditional design elements found
in the surrounding commercial area. The presence of zero
front yard setbacks, true shop windows for first-floor retail
uses and operable windows for upper-level office uses, a
mix of uses that fosters a sidewalk shopping experience,
street front entrances and the primacy of the pedestrian
over the automobile shall be the primary design feature of
these developments.
[2] Materials used for building shall complement the
materials found in the surrounding commercial
neighborhood. Traditional materials such as brick, stone,
wood siding, metal storefronts and windows are preferred
to plastic, vinyl, artificial stone and siding materials.

Variances
§ 43-85. Use variances.
§ 43-86. Area variances and departure or variation from
dimensional requirements of special use permit requirements.
A. The Zoning Board of Appeals, on appeal from a decision or
determination by the Commissioner of the Department of Housing and
Buildings, shall have the power to grant use variances, as defined
herein.
B. No such use variance shall be granted by the Zoning Board of Appeals
without a showing by the applicant that applicable zoning regulations
and restrictions have caused unnecessary hardship. In order to prove
such unnecessary hardship, the applicant shall demonstrate to the
Zoning Board of Appeals that, for each and every permitted use under
the zoning regulations for the particular district where the property is
located:
(1) The applicant cannot realize a reasonable return, provided that
lack of return is substantial as demonstrated by competent
financial evidence.
(2) The alleged hardship relating to the property in question is unique
and does not apply to a substantial portion of the district or
neighborhood.
(3) The requested use variance, if granted, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood.
(4) The alleged hardship has not been self-created.
C. The Zoning Board of Appeals, in the granting of use variances, shall
grant the minimum variance that is deemed necessary and adequate to
address the unnecessary hardship proven by the applicant and at the
same time preserve and protect the character of the neighborhood and
the health, safety and welfare of the community.
A. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall have the power, on appeal from a
decision or determination of the Commissioner of the Department of
Housing and Buildings, to grant area variances as defined herein.
B. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall also have the power to permit a
departure or variation from the dimensional requirements for a special
use permit, as specified in Article VII of this chapter. Such a
determination shall be made based upon the consideration of the
criteria set forth in § 43-86C of this chapter.
C. In making its determination, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall take into
consideration the benefit to the applicant if the variance is granted, as
§ 43-85 CHARTER § 43-86
C:1041
§ 43-87. Imposition of conditions.
The Zoning Board of Appeals shall, in the granting of both use variances and
area variances, have the authority to impose such reasonable conditions
and restrictions as are directly related to and incidental to the proposed
use of the property. Such conditions shall be consistent with the spirit and
intent of this chapter or local law and shall be imposed for the purpose
of minimizing any adverse impact such variance may have on the
neighborhood or community.
§ 43-88. Expiration of permits for variances.
A variance granted by the Zoning Board of Appeals pursuant to Article VIII
shall be deemed to have expired unless:
weighed against the detriment to the health, safety and welfare of
the neighborhood or community by such grant. In making such
determination, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall also consider:
(1) Whether an undesirable change will be produced in the character
of the neighborhood or a detriment to nearby properties will be
created by the granting of the variance.
(2) Whether the benefit sought by the applicant can be achieved by
some method feasible for the applicant to pursue, other than the
variance.
(3) Whether the requested variance is substantial.
(4) Whether the proposed variance will have an adverse effect or
impact on the physical or environmental conditions in the
neighborhood or district.
(5) Whether the alleged difficulty was self-created, which
consideration shall be relevant to the decision of the Zoning Board
of Appeals but shall not necessarily preclude the granting of the
variance.
D. The Zoning Board of Appeals, in the granting of such variances, shall
grant the minimum variance that it deems necessary and adequate and
at the same time preserve and protect the character of the
neighborhood and the health, safety and welfare of the community.
A. The lot or land, where no building or structure is involved, shall have
been put into use within 12 months after the date of issue of such
variance, for the purpose for which such permit was granted.

days from the receipt of such referral to issue its recommendations to
the Zoning Board of Appeals. In the event that the Westchester County
Planning Board recommends modification or disapproval of an application,
the Zoning Board of Appeals shall not act contrary to such recommendation
except by a vote of a majority plus one.
§ 43-91. through § 43-93. (Reserved)
C. The entire building or structure for which such variance was granted
shall have been completed according to filed plans within three years
after the date of such permit.
A. The Zoning Board of Appeals may reasonably extend the period of time
beyond those provided for in § 43-88 at the time of its decision on the
variance. Such an extension shall be made only upon a showing by the
applicant that the time periods provided for in § 43-88 would not
reasonably allow for the commencement or completion of the
development for which the variance is sought, and provided that such
an extension would not cause a detriment to the character of the
neighborhood and the health and safety of the community.
B. The Zoning Board of Appeals may also grant an extension of time for
the commencement of construction for a building or structure for which
a variance was previously granted, following the original granting of
such variance, provided that the variance has not already expired. Such
extension shall only be granted upon a showing by the applicant that
the circumstances and conditions upon which the variance was
originally granted have not substantially changed.
C. In the event that a permit for a variance has expired, the applicant shall
be required to make a new application to the Zoning Board of Appeals
for renewal of the variance permit, in accordance with the procedures
contained within this article.

15% without mitigation to control erosion of the stockpile and
to capture and control any migrating sediment caused by
erosion.
(p) Retaining wall height shall not exceed six feet in height within
the setbacks (and four feet in height in the front yard setback
or in any setback adjoining a street) and 10 feet in height, to
the extent practicable, without stepping back a minimum of six
feet between stacked walls. Terraces created due to setback
walls shall be landscaped to minimize the visual impacts, with
vegetation in such areas to be consistent with the design and
long-term maintenance requirements of the subject retaining
walls.

§ 43-108. Performance guaranties.
No final certificate of occupancy shall be issued until all improvements
shown on the approved site plan are installed or a sufficient performance
guaranty has been posted with the Planning Director for improvements
not yet completed. The sufficiency of such performance guaranty shall be
determined by the Planning Director after consultation with the approving
agency, the Corporation Counsel and other officials and agencies of the City
of Yonkers as appropriate. Such performance guaranty shall be provided to
the City in accordance with § 33, Subdivision 8, of Article 3 of the General
City Law.
§ 43-109. Bonds or performance guaranties in connection with a
site plan.
A. The approving agency may, in its sole discretion, require that the

property and for a width on the applicant's property that is
sufficient to provide a minimum of 10 feet of approximate level
ground parallel with the brook to work within for brook clearance
of the removal of obstructions in the brook or on its bank. The City
may require a greater width if it is reasonably required for access
and maintenance in easement area or if the State of New York or
any of its agencies or the County of Westchester requires a greater
width.
(5) Any sewer or drainage easement shall be in writing and in
recordable form and provide the City with the right to enter upon
the easement area at the City's option to repair or maintain the
sewer pipe and facilities within the easement area. The easement
shall also contain a provision prohibiting the construction of any
building or other structure on or over the sewer easement. The
easement shall also contain a provision permitting the owner of the
property to reroute the sewer or drainage easement in the future
with the approval of the all the agencies having jurisdiction thereof,
provided also that a sewer or drainage sewer easement replacing
the original easement is conveyed to the City of Yonkers. The form
of the easement in every case shall be such that is in form
satisfactory to the Corporation Counsel and the approving agency.
G. Other utilities. Prior to the granting of final approval, the developer
shall have arranged with all serving utilities, including, without
limitation, electric, gas and telephone utilities, for the underground
installation of the utilities' distribution supply lines, and service
connections in accordance with the provisions of the applicable
standard terms and conditions incorporated as a part of its tariff, as the
same are then on file with the State of New York Board of Public Utility
Commissioners, and shall submit to the approving agency prior to the
granting of final approval a written instrument from each serving utility
which shall evidence full compliance with the provisions of this
subsection; provided, however, that the approving agency, in its sole
discretion, may permit developments on lots which abut existing streets
where overhead utility distribution supply lines have theretofore been
installed on any part thereof to be supplied with electric and telephone
service from such overhead lines or extension thereof, but in such event
the service connection from such overhead lines shall be installed
underground.

accordance with specifications approved as a part of the site plan.
(3) Any application to construct or alter any building or structure or to
establish any use in any nonresidential district or any
nonresidential use in any district shall include provisions for a
buffer screening area at least five feet in width along any lot line
abutting a lot in a residential district, unless otherwise specified in
this chapter.
(4) Any application to construct a development of multifamily
dwellings shall include provisions for a buffer screening area at
least five feet in width along any lot line within or abutting a
residential district. These requirements may be waived by the
approving agency in situations where it determines that adjoining
land uses, topographic features or existing vegetation satisfy the
same purpose. The approving agency may allow the substitution of
a wall or fence of location, height, design and materials approved
by it, and meeting the requirements of § 43-41D for part or all of
the required planting. Where such a buffer screening area is
required, it shall be of evergreen planting of such type, height,
spacing and arrangement as in the judgment of the approving
agency will screen the activity involved from the neighboring
residential area. Non-evergreen planting may seasonally
supplement evergreen planting but shall not take its place. The
plan and specifications for such planting shall be filed with the
plans for the use of the lot.
(5) All required landscaping shall be properly trimmed and maintained
in good condition at all times.

provided herein.
B. Fee in lieu of parking.
(1) In lieu of providing all or a portion of the required off-street parking
spaces, an applicant may request the City Council to accept,
following an affirmative vote in favor thereof by the Planning
Board, a cash payment to the City of Yonkers Parking Reserve Fund
to satisfy the number of parking spaces required in this chapter:
The City Council may at its discretion accept all or a portion of the
offered fee in lieu of parking in substitution for all or a portion of
the required parking spaces. Where appropriate, it may require the
submission of studies and plans demonstrating that practical
considerations preclude the provision of such parking spaces by
the applicant.
(2) The amount of the fee in lieu of parking required in such cases shall
be established and reviewed on an annual basis by the Planning
Board and approved by the City Council, based on the projected
construction cost for municipal provision of the required parking
spaces, operating costs where the parking spaces are not revenue
producing and any loss in taxes resulting from municipal provision
of such parking spaces. Provision may be made for periodic
payment of an amount to cover operation and maintenance costs.
(3) By acceptance of the fee in lieu of parking, the City of Yonkers
undertakes to provide parking of a type, location and quantity
appropriate for the particular use within a reasonable period of
time, taking into account the existing supply and demand for
parking in the area of said use. The City may charge for the use of
§ 43-131 CHARTER § 43-132
C:1069
such spaces an amount generally consistent with the charge for
other publicly provided parking in the same area.
(4) At least that portion of the fee in lieu of parking which is based on
the projected construction cost shall be placed in the City of
Yonkers Parking Reserve Fund. The expenditure of revenues from
such Parking Reserve Fund shall be limited exclusively to those
actions designed to increase the quantity and/or the quality of
parking spaces available to serve properties within the district in
which the fee in lieu of parking has been accepted.
C. Shared parking. The agency approving a site plan may allow off-street
parking and loading spaces required for uses, buildings or structures
on the same or on adjacent lots to be provided in a common semipublic
parking lot, or more than one said lots, or in a semipublic parking
garage, subject to the following:
(1) The total capacity of the common facility shall be the sum of the
requirements of each individual use, except that said total capacity
may be reduced by the approving agency, provided that the
applicant provides credible evidence to the satisfaction of the
approving agency that the peak parking demand of the two or more
uses sharing such a facility do not coincide, and that the
accumulated parking demand at any one time of the two or more
uses sharing the facility shall not exceed the total capacity of the
facility. Such evidence shall indicate the use of the facility by
residents, employees, customers and visitors on both weekdays and
weekends and both during the day and overnight.
(2) As a condition of its approval, the approving agency shall require a
legal instrument satisfactory to the Corporation Counsel of the City
of Yonkers assuring the continued existence and use of such shared
parking spaces in connection with the uses, buildings and
structures that they serve. Such instrument shall also guarantee
that, upon termination of such use, each individual participant shall
provide off-street parking and loading spaces for its own use in
accordance with all requirements of this chapter.
(3) No shared parking facility shall be located more than 300 feet from
any of the uses, buildings or structures which it serves as measured
from the property line of the use, building or structure to the
property line of the shared parking facilities.
D. Shared parking in the GC, CB and DW Districts. The agency approving a
site plan may allow off-street parking and loading spaces required for
uses, buildings or structures on the same or different lots to be
provided in one or more semipublic parking structures or semipublic
open-air parking areas, and in the GC, CB and DW District, one or more
public parking garages or public parking lots, subject to the following:

§ 43-132 YONKERS CODE § 43-132
C:1070
§ 43-133. Location of off-street parking and loading spaces.
(1) The total capacity of the common facility shall be the sum of the
requirements of each individual use, except that said total capacity
may be reduced by the approving agency, providing the applicant
provides credible evidence to the satisfaction of the approving
agency that the peak parking demands of the two or more uses
sharing such a facility do not coincide, and that the accumulated
parking demand at any one time of the two or more uses sharing
the facility shall not exceed the total capacity of the facility. Such
evidence shall indicate the use of the facility by residents,
employees, customers and visitors on both weekdays and weekends
and both during the day and overnight.
(2) As a condition of its approval, the approving agency shall require a
legal instrument satisfactory to the Corporation Counsel of the City
of Yonkers assuring the continued existence and use of such shared
parking spaces in connection with the uses, buildings and
structures that they serve. Such instrument shall also guarantee
that upon termination of such use, each individual participant shall
provide off-street parking and loading spaces for its own use in
accordance with all requirements of this chapter.
(3) No shared semipublic parking facility shall be located more than
300 feet and no shared public parking facility shall be located more
than 500 feet, measured by the shortest publicly available route for
pedestrian travel, from the property line of the uses, buildings or
structures which such shared parking facility serves to the
pedestrian entrance of such shared parking facility closest to such
property line.
A. Off-street parking spaces shall be provided in accordance with the
following requirements:
(1) Single- and two-family dwellings. Off-street parking spaces shall be
provided on the same lot as the structure or use they serve and

within the rear yard, except that, for multifamily residential
buildings which have views of the Hudson River, parking may be
located in other yards so as to preserve such views of the river.
(3) In nonresidential districts, required off-street parking spaces may
not be located within the minimum front and side yard setback, and
not closer than 10 feet to the principal building on the lot, subject
to review and approval in accordance with § 43-134, as

C:1073
§ 43-134. Design and layout of off-street parking and loading
spaces.
A. Layout. All off streets parking lots shall be designed in accordance with
the following requirements:
(1) Unobstructed access from a parking or loading area to and from a
street shall be designed so as to not require the backing of any
vehicle across a sidewalk or into a street, except for permitted
single- and two-family dwellings. One of the minimum required
parking spaces for each dwelling unit in a single- or two-family lot
may have its access obstructed by the other parking space provided
for that same dwelling unit.
(2) In order to provide maximum efficiency, minimize curb cuts and
encourage safe and convenient traffic circulation, an applicant may
apply, or the agency approving a site plan may require, that an
interconnection of parking lots via access drives within and
between adjacent lots be provided. The agency may require written
assurance such as deed restrictions, satisfactory to the Corporation
Counsel, binding the owner and his heirs and assigns to permit and
maintain such interconnection of parking lots.
(3) Off-street parking areas shall be designed to prevent the
maneuvering of vehicles into or out of parking spaces or the
storage of vehicles within any portion of an entrance driveway or
driveway that is within 10 feet of the right-of-way line of any road.
(4) No required off-street parking space, including adjacent parking
access lanes or maneuvering space, shall be located within the
existing or proposed right-of-way of any road, nor within 10 feet of
any existing or proposed right-of-way line of a public street or
highway. Fire lanes shall be provided to give access to buildings for
fire fighting, as required by the Commissioner of the Department of
Housing and Buildings.
(5) Parking spaces shall be usable without requiring excessive
maneuvering when all other spaces are occupied by vehicles. The
approving agency shall make a determination of whether the
parking space is usable. Parking spaces that are not usable shall
not count towards satisfying any parking requirement and shall not
be approved.
(6) In order to provide visibility and definition at the ends of parking
aisles, a planted area enclosed by concrete curbing shall be
provided. Applicants shall be encouraged to provide such planted
areas as shown in Illustration No. 30.
§ 43-134 YONKERS CODE § 43-134
C:1074
(7) Dead-end parking aisles shall not be permitted except where
unavoidable, as determined by the approving agency.
(8) Concrete wheel stops or raised curbing or other appropriate means
shall be provided as required by the approving agency and shall be
so located as to prevent the overhang of any vehicle into any
pedestrian sidewalk or landscaped area or required buffer area.
(9) Each parking space shall be not less than 8 1/2 feet wide and 18
feet long, except that, where parking is parallel to a curb or along
the wall of a building, spaces shall be 8 1/2 feet wide by 24 feet
long for all spaces other than the front end and back end of the line
of spaces provided, which may be 20 feet in length. (See
Illustration No. 31.) Parking spaces for the handicapped shall be in
accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and the New
York State Uniform Fire Prevention and Building Code. The
approving agency may allow perimeter parking spaces to be 17 feet
long where a two-foot bumper overhang space is provided, which
§ 43-134 CHARTER § 43-134
C:1075
space shall not count toward the amount of required planting or
planted buffer area.
(10) The side perimeter of each parking space shall be delineated by
painted lines on the pavement. These and other markings in
parking areas shall conform to the specifications shown in
Illustration No. 31.
§ 43-134 YONKERS CODE § 43-134
C:1076
(11) The facilities provided in any parking area and their arrangement
shall not be changed without due consideration and approval by the
Planning Board. Furthermore, any modification of fire lanes in a
parking area shall also be reviewed and approved by the City Fire
Commissioner.
(12) Parking aisles and parking stalls shall be provided in accordance
with the specifications shown in Illustration No. 32, except that for
parking lots of less than 10 cars a one-way parking aisle for angled
parking may be 12 feet and a two-way aisle may be 18 feet in width.
§ 43-134 CHARTER § 43-134
C:1077
(13) The approving agency may, on the recommendation of the Traffic
Engineer, waive or grant exceptions or modifications to the
dimensions required in this subsection, based on consideration of
expected turnover, nature of occupancy, volume and pattern of
traffic circulation, vehicle size, angle of parking, nature of the
structure and accepted engineering practice.
B. Off-street loading spaces.
(1) Off-street loading berths shall be located entirely upon the lot, and
no truck or trailer truck occupying any such berth shall project into
or encroach upon a public sidewalk or upon the roadway of a public
street.
(2) Such truck loading and unloading berths may be provided within
the building lines or on the same lot as the building or in an area
designed to serve jointly two or more buildings within the same
block, provided that such joint area is adequate in both capacity
and general layout.
(3) Each off-street loading space shall measure at least 15 feet in
width, at least 14 feet in height, and 40 feet in length, exclusive of
access and turning areas, except that adjacent loading spaces may
be each 12 feet in width.
C. Paving and grading.
(1) Parking areas, aisles, parking spaces and private roadways and
driveways shall be paved with an impervious surface in accordance
with Yonkers building codes. However, the approving agency may
§ 43-134 YONKERS CODE § 43-134
C:1078
require paving with material that is not impervious if drainage
conditions on the site, upstream or downstream of the site, warrant
it, or to allow for settling in a particular area.
(2) A parking area shall be drained so as to properly dispose of all
surface water falling thereon.
(3) In off-street parking lots or garages a parking space shall have a
minimum grade of 1% and a maximum grade of 8% or as required

E. Parking lot landscaping.
(1) Except for parking serving single- and two-family dwellings,
suitable landscaping shall be provided, as required by the agency
approving the site plan, along the periphery of all parking lots,
parking garages and loading spaces where they abut streets, public
spaces and residential districts. Such screening shall be in
accordance with the requirements of § 43-121H.
(2) Except for parking lots accessory to one- or two-family dwellings,
and parking lots with less than 20 total spaces, parking lots and
loading spaces shall be curbed, screened and landscaped with
appropriate trees, shrubs, ground cover and other plant materials
within the parking lot to assure the establishment of a safe,
convenient and attractive facility. Such landscaping shall be
planted and maintained in accordance with the following
requirements:
(a) At least 6% of the total parking lot area shall be so landscaped,
and at least one tree, of not less than three inches caliper, shall
be provided within such parking lot for each 12 parking
spaces.
(b) Raised planting islands as shown in Illustration No. 30 shall be
provided as necessary to guide vehicle movement and to
separate opposing rows of parking spaces and to provide
adequate space for plant growth, pedestrian circulation and
vehicle overhang. Such raised planting islands and the
landscaping within them shall be designed and arranged so as
to provide vertical definition to major traffic circulation aisles,
entrances and exits, to channel internal traffic flow, to prevent
indiscriminate diagonal movement of vehicles and to provide
cooling shade and visual relief from the visual monotony and
summer heat of a large paved parking lot. Curbs of such
islands shall be designed so as to facilitate surface drainage
and to prevent vehicles from overhanging sidewalks and
damaging landscaping materials.
§ 43-134 CHARTER § 43-134
C:1079
(3) The selection, amount and location of all landscaping materials
shall be subject to approval by the agency approving the site plan,
based upon considerations of the adequacy of the proposed
landscaping to serve its intended purpose with minimal
maintenance problems, including plant care, snow plowing and leaf
removal.
(4) All landscaping shall continue to be maintained in a healthy
growing condition throughout the duration of the use, building or
structure which it is intended to serve. Any planting not so
maintained shall be replaced with new plants at the beginning of
the next, immediately following, growing season.
(5) The placement of landscaping shall not obstruct a driver's vision at
traffic intersections or driveway openings.
F. Parking signage. Appropriate signs shall be provided in parking lots and
parking garages to direct internal traffic flow. Such signs shall
§ 43-134 YONKERS CODE § 43-134
C:1080
§ 43-135. Parking lot or facility operation and maintenance.
Required off-street parking facilities shall be maintained so long as the
use, building or structure exists which the facilities are designed to serve.
Required parking spaces developed for specific uses, buildings or structures
shall be reserved for the tenants, employees, residents, customers and
guests who make use of such uses, buildings or structures.
§ 43-136. Deferred parking improvement.
Where the agency approving a site plan determines, in connection with its
review of a site plan, that less than the required number of parking or
loading spaces may be required to satisfy the intent of this chapter, such
agency may defer the paving and improvement of a portion of the lot, but
for not more than 1/3 of the total number of parking spaces required by
this chapter. In all cases, it shall be expressly demonstrated on the site plan
that sufficient space remains for the provision of the total amount of offstreet
parking as required, and the site plan shall bear such a designation.
Such unimproved portion of the parking lot shall be used and maintained
as additional landscaped grounds until required for parking. Written
guaranties, satisfactory to the Corporation Counsel, shall be submitted by
the applicant ensuring the improvement of such spaces within six months of
the date of written notice to the property owner by the agency, stating that
all or a portion of such spaces have now been determined to be necessary
and should be so improved.

carrying cost (which includes a mortgage with principal and interest
payments, property taxes and homeowners' insurance, and may also
include homeowners' association fees or maintenance or carrying costs,
but excludes utilities) not exceeding at any time 33% (or such higher
percentage as permitted by the applicable housing finance program) of
the annualized monthly gross income of the household occupying the

exceeding at any time 30% of the annualized monthly gross income of

meeting (at the time of rental or sale) the affordability criteria in
§ 43-198 of this chapter as from time to time adjusted for Westchester
County by the United States Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD). Such units shall be the primary residence of the
occupants, and subletting and assignments to avoid these requirements
shall be prohibited.
B. All affordable housing units subject to purchase shall have resale-price
limitations (enforced by covenants running with the land, restrictions
on registration of title, or any other appropriate legal mechanism
approved by the AHTF Committee or the City) which will ensure that,
for a minimum period 30 years, or the minimum period term of
affordability required by a government entity providing subsidies,
whichever is greater, from the time of their first sale, such housing units
are sold or resold only to, and at a price affordable to, a household
which is, at the time of purchase, in the same group (referred to in
§ 43-198 of this chapter) as was the seller at the time such previous
owner first occupied the unit.
§ 43-196 YONKERS CODE § 43-199

that, by appropriate covenants enforceable by the AHTF Committee or
the City, for a period of at least 30 years, or the minimum period term of
affordability required by a government entity providing subsidies,
whichever is greater, from the time of first rental, such units are
affordable to, and are re-rented only to, a household which is, at the
time of re-rental, in the same income group as was the previous tenant
at the time such previous tenant first occupied the unit.
D. Affordable housing units for rental may be converted to units for sale,
subject, however, to the same ownership eligibility standards as
applicable to units for sale for the remainder of the affordability period
from original occupancy referred to in the previous sentence. All
tenants in place at the time initial notice of conversion is provided who
meet the income qualifications set forth in § 43-198 of this chapter (as
at that time adjusted) shall be permitted to purchase their unit at a
price affordable to them as defined herein and in accordance with
Article 9-B of the Real Property Law or § 352-eee of the General
Business Law.
E. Exempt transfers.
(1) The affordability and other restrictions on resale and/or occupancy

between spouses or former spouses ordered as a result of a
judicial decree of divorce or separation agreement (not
including transfers to third parties).

regarding management or disposition of HUD-owned projects
or projects for which HUD is MIP.
(2) However, transfers referred to in Subsection E(1)(a) and (b) do not
extinguish such restrictions (whatever be the legal mechanism
through which the restrictions are enforced) which shall be fully
complied with in the event of any subsequent sale or rental of a unit
not specifically exempted hereby.
(3) An exempted transfer as heretofore provided in this subsection
shall not toll the running of the minimum thirty-year period
referred to in this section.
F. This section shall not be interpreted as in any way affecting or
diminishing, and shall apply together with, occupancy criteria (to be

C:1109
§ 43-200. Applicant prescreening; qualification and enforcement.

Downtown Districts
[Added 12-28-2011 by G.O. No. 5-2011]
§ 43-219. Purpose statements.
The following districts comprise the downtown districts:
A. D-MX Mixed-Use District. The D-MX Mixed-Use District is a high
concentration of commercial, residential and institutional
developments in the downtown. The D-MX District encourages groundfloor
commercial uses to activate the street-level environment. In order
to create a concentration of pedestrian-oriented commercial uses
networked throughout the D-MX District, certain streets are designated
"key streets" and require commercial ground-floor uses within a
storefront design.
(1) Key streets. The key streets of the D-MX District are shown in Map
A: Key Streets.269 The purpose of key streets is to preserve and
enhance the pedestrian-oriented commercial environment and
promote economic development focused on active uses such as
retail, restaurant, service and entertainment uses. To achieve this,
regulations require certain ground-floor uses, a storefront design
at the street level, and increased transparency requirements. The
following streets are designated as key streets in the D-MX District:
(a) Main Street between Buena Vista Avenue and Getty Square/
North and South Broadway.
(b) New Main Street between Getty Square/North and South
Broadway and Vark Street/Park Hill Avenue.
(c) Nepperhan Street between Buena Vista Avenue to Warburton
Avenue.
(d) Dock Street from Buena Vista Avenue to Warburton Avenue.
(e) Riverdale Avenue/Warburton Avenue between Prospect Street
and Wells Avenue.
(f) South Broadway/North Broadway between Nepperhan Avenue
and Manor House Square.
(g) Palisade Avenue between Main Street/Getty Square and Elm
Street.
B. D-IRT Downtown Industrial Research and Technology District. The DIRT
District supports the industrial uses in the northern portion of
downtown. This district with its close proximity to the Metro-North and
Amtrak train lines is a prime location for office, industrial, research and

development and technology-based uses. It also allows certain
commercial uses to serve the work force. Residential uses are
prohibited to avoid conflicts with industrial users and encroachment
into industrial land.
C. UR-LD Low-Density Urban Residential District. The UR-LD Urban
Residential Low-Density District is intended to address urban
neighborhoods, adjacent to the downtown, that contain a mix of singlefamily,
detached and attached two-family, and townhouse dwellings.
The UR-LD District is intended to maintain the residential environment
of these urban neighborhoods, continuing the development patterns of
these areas established in mid-to-late-nineteenth and early-twentieth
centuries.
D. UR-MD Medium-Density Urban Residential District. The UR-MD Urban
Residential Medium-Density District is intended to address urban
neighborhoods, adjacent to the downtown, that contain a mix of all
dwelling types, including apartment house dwellings. The UR-MD
District is intended to maintain the residential environment of these
urban neighborhoods, continuing the development patterns of these
areas established in mid-to-late-nineteenth and early-twentieth
centuries.
E. UR-HD High-Density Urban Residential District. The UR-HD Urban
Residential High-Density District encourages a high-density residential
development, located adjacent to the downtown to increase the
downtown residential population, build a critical mass for the
commercial uses located downtown and take advantage of existing
transportation resources. Limited commercial establishments are also
allowed at select locations within the district.
A. Principal uses. The schedule of principal uses permitted within the
downtown districts is shown in Table 43-6, Schedule of Principal Uses
and UR-HD Accessory Uses.270 Principal uses are allowed as permitted
(P), permitted with supplemental standards (Ps) or special uses (S). In
addition, the following use regulations apply:
(1) Within the D-MX District, certain uses are required on the ground
floor of key streets in order to create a concentration of pedestrianoriented
uses. See § 43-219A(1) and Map A271 for key street
designations. Table 43-6, Schedule of Principal Uses and UR-HD
Accessory Uses shows those uses that are required on the ground
floor of buildings along the key streets.

(2) Security gates. Security gates are discouraged in the downtown
districts. If security gates are installed:
(a) New construction and substantial improvement.
[1] Security gates must be located on the inside of windows of
any building constructed after the adoption of the
downtown districts, (December 28, 2011). For substantial
rehabilitation involving the replacement of the storefront,
all security gates must be located inside of the windows.
[2] When security gates are engaged, the screening must be
designed to permit viewing into the business. Security
gates must be of a lattice-type design. The lattice-type
design must provide a minimum openness of 75% when
engaged and allow for viewing inside the building when
engaged.
[3] Security gates must be opened, raised or otherwise
removed from view during business hours.
(b) Minor alterations.
[1] When minor building rehabilitation requires replacement
of security gates, new security gates must be of the
seventy-five-percent open lattice-type design.
§ 43-223 CHARTER § 43-223
C:1135
[2] Replacement of any security gates requires a lattice-type
design. The lattice-type design must provide a minimum
openness of 75% when engaged and allow for viewing
inside the building when engaged.
[3] When minor rehabilitation includes the exterior storefront,
no new exposed hoods for security gates are permitted on
the exterior of a storefront.
[4] Security gates must be open, raised or otherwise removed
from view during business hours.
B. Residential. The following design standards apply to new residential
structures:

structures, and additions to buildings or structures within the URLD
and UR-MD Districts will be reviewed against and should
comply with the design guidelines of the Downtown Neighborhood
Design Guidelines for the City of Yonkers, including architectural
standards and landscape requirements.
(2) Single-family and two-family.
(a) Windows or other architectural features are required on all
facades in order to avoid the appearance of blank walls and
facades. Windows must be set into or projected out from the
facade, in order to provide depth and shadow, and be of a
consistent style. Porches, bay windows and special elements
are required to vary the articulation along a street.
(b) The front entry must be the predominant feature on the front
elevation of a home and be emphasized as an integral part of
the building design with features such as front porches, raised
steps and stoops, roof overhangs, columns and decorative
railings, to help create a protected entry area and enhance its
appearance.
(c) The pitch, design and scale of roofs of new dwellings should be
similar to the roof forms of surrounding dwellings.

attached townhouse units.
(b) The front facade of townhouses must be articulated through
windows, front porches, raised steps and stoops, projected
entrances and overhangs to create substantial shadows and
visual interest.
(c) There must be a unifying architectural theme for a townhouse
development. Each townhouse unit in the development must
utilize a common vocabulary of architectural forms, elements,
materials and colors. The townhouse development shall cause,
by means of legal instruments acceptable to the approving
agency and the Corporation Counsel of the City of Yonkers,
there to be an agreement amongst the owners to maintain the
original, approved architectural theme of the townhouses
during the life of the development.
(d) Windows must be set back into or projected out from the
facade, to provide depth and shadow, and be of a consistent
style. In addition, three-dimensional elements, such as bay
windows, should be incorporated to provide dimensional
elements on a facade.
(e) When the building adjacent is new construction it must respect
the neighboring building.

setback of the development as a whole, as determined by
the existing front setbacks of townhouses on either side.
[2] The townhouse unit must match the existing building
heights as determined by adjacent townhouses on either
side, with exceptions for accommodation of grade
changes. Where grade changes occur, the rhythm of
building heights within the overall development must be
maintained.
[3] The townhouse unit must match or complement the roof
form of the group on the front facade. If certain
architectural details are common to the roof design of the
street-facing facade of the townhouse development as a
whole, such as cornices or dormers, the townhouse unit
must include this in roof design.
[4] The cornice height of the townhouse unit must match the
cornice height of the townhouses on either side, with
exceptions for accommodation of grade changes. Where
grade changes occur, the rhythm of building cornice
heights within the development as a whole must be
maintained.
[5] The townhouse unit must match the first-floor elevation
and the rhythm of front entrances as determined by
adjacent townhouses on either side, with accommodation
for grade changes. Where grade changes occur, the
rhythm of first-floor elevations and entrances within the
development as a whole must be maintained.
[6] The townhouse unit must match the fenestration pattern of
the development as a whole.
[7] Architectural features, such as porches, steps and stoops,
cornices and bay windows, that are common to the

A. Off-street parking lots.
(1) Location. Accessory off-street parking lots are prohibited in the
front or side front setbacks.
(2) Required landscape.
(a) General requirements. The following landscape is required for
off-street parking in the downtown districts:
[1] Perimeter parking lot landscape is required for all parking
lots and must be established along the edge of the parking
lot.
[2] Interior landscape is required for off-street parking lots of
20 or more spaces.
[3] All planting materials used must be of good quality and
meet the American Standard for Nursery Stock, latest
edition, as published by the American Nursery and
Landscape Association, hereafter referred to as "ANLA,"
for sizes, grading, root spread, dimension of root ball, and
quality. The use of native species is encouraged. Size and
density of plant material, both at the time of planting and
at maturity, are additional criteria to be considered when
selecting plant material. All landscape must use
noninvasive species.
[4] All landscape materials must be installed in accordance
with the current planting procedures established by
ANLA. Planting material should be grown in a climate
similar to or more severe than that of the City of Yonkers,
typical of its species in branch structure, free of cultural or
mechanical injury, insect eggs or their larvae and plant
diseases, and is accompanied by certification of inspection
from authorities having jurisdiction over use and
shipment. All plant material must be installed so that soil is
of sufficient volume, composition and nutrient balance to
sustain healthy growth.
[5] All landscape must be maintained in good condition,
present a healthy, neat and orderly appearance, and be
kept free of weeds, refuse and debris.
(b) Perimeter landscape. A perimeter landscape yard is required
for all off-street parking lots, and the landscape treatment
must run the full length of the parking lot where it abuts a
street, excluding driveways and access points. The perimeter
parking lot landscape yard must be improved as follows:
[1] The perimeter landscape yard must be a minimum of five
feet in width.
§ 43-225 CHARTER § 43-225
C:1149
[2] A single hedge row is required, planted with one shrub
every 36 inches on center, spaced linearly. The shrubs
must measure a minimum of 36 inches in height at
planting and a minimum of 48 inches to a maximum of 60
inches in height at maturity. In addition, an ornamental
fence a minimum of four feet in height is required along
the perimeter landscape yard.
[3] Alternatively, a low wall the height of which provides
effective screening to a maximum height of three feet may
be used instead of shrubs and an ornamental fence. Where
possible, plant materials must be installed between the
sidewalk and the wall to provide a softening effect on the
wall.
[4] All perimeter parking lot landscape areas must be
protected with raised concrete, Belgian block or granite
curbs.
(c) Interior landscape. For off-street parking lots consisting of 20
or more spaces, interior parking lot landscape is required.
[1] One parking lot island must be provided between every 10
contiguous parking spaces. As part of site plan approval,
parking lot island locations may be varied based on
specific site requirements or design scheme, to be
approved as part of the landscape plan, but the total
number of islands must be no less than the amount
required: one island for every 10 spaces.
[2] In addition to parking lot islands, additional landscaped
areas must be provided within the interior of parking lots.
All rows of parking spaces must terminate in a parking lot
island or landscaped area. The minimum landscaped area,
including parking lot islands, is 10% of the parking lot
area. Perimeter parking lot landscape is not considered
part of the ten-percent calculation and is not included in
the area used to calculate the required 10%.
[3] Parking lot islands or landscaped areas must be at least
125 square feet in area. However, parking lot islands must
be the same dimension as the parking stall. Double rows of
parking must provide parking lot islands that are the same
dimension as the double row.
[4] Parking lot islands or landscaped areas must be at least six
inches above the surface of the parking lot and protected
with concrete, Belgian block or granite curbing, except
where designed to apply sustainable techniques allowing
the flow and access of stormwater. Such islands and
landscaped areas must be properly drained and irrigated
§ 43-225 YONKERS CODE § 43-225
C:1150
as appropriate to the site conditions to ensure
survivability.
[5] Shade trees must be the primary plant materials used in
parking lot islands and landscaped areas. One shade tree
is required for every parking lot island or landscaped area.
If the island extends the width of a double row, then two
shade trees are required.
[6] Shrubs must be planted within the parking island to
provide a second layer of planting for visual interest.
[7] A minimum of 75% of every parking lot island must be
planted in live ground cover, perennials or ornamental
grasses. Mulch is required to fill in planting areas for early
growth protection until the ground cover is established
and covers the planting area. It is encouraged to mulch
bare areas for three to five years, or until the plant
material is fully established in the parking islands.
[8] Plant materials must not be installed to create visibility
concerns for automobiles and pedestrians.

districts, (December 28, 2011), requires site plan review and
approval. Site plan review will consider the following site design
standards in the review and approval of new curb cuts:
(a) The location of new curb cuts will minimize potentially
dangerous traffic movements and will not create a hazard for
pedestrians.
§ 43-225 CHARTER § 43-225
C:1153
(b) The property owner has considered the use of alternate
methods as a means to minimize curb cuts, including, but not
limited to, cross-access easements and shared parking.
(c) New curb cuts are discouraged on key streets (Map A)281 and
may be permitted only after proof of efforts at access by curb
cuts on other streets has been considered.
(2) Single-family and two-family detached and attached dwellings
located on corner lots must provide parking access from the side
front setback. For the purposes of this provision, the side front
setback is defined as the longer front setback. Access must be
designed to minimize curb cuts along front setbacks along the
block face.
E. Cross-access easements.
(1) Uses with adjacent parking areas are encouraged to provide a
cross-access to allow circulation between sites. Joint-use driveways
are encouraged where feasible. If cross-access is provided, as a
condition of its approval, the approving agency requires a legal
instrument satisfactory to the Corporation Counsel of the City of
Yonkers assuring the continued existence and use of such crossaccess
with the uses and structures that it serves.
(2) Cross-access easements must incorporate the following:
(a) Internal circulation allows the smooth circulation of traffic
between both parking lots and safe access to and from the
street.
(b) Driveways shall meet City standards. No driveway may exceed
24 feet in width.
(c) Bump-outs and other design features are required to make it
visually obvious that the abutting properties are tied together.

Artisans & Industry Special District
[Added 3-22-2016 by G.O. No. 2-2016]
§ 43-230. Legislative Intent.
Yonkers grew as a City that made things. Carpets, elevators, electrical
cable, and sugar are ground into the city's soil and history. We are still a
City that builds famous trademarks. In order to continue this tradition, it is
necessary for the City to insure that there is sufficient land for the best of
modern industrial users to come to Yonkers. The Artisans & Industry Special
District Zone is conceived with the idea that not all industrial uses belong
together, that not all industrial uses belong in close proximity to residences
and that the economic growth of the City would be best served by creating
a setting that would foster the best industrial uses, those that produce good
jobs, and that are forward looking in terms of trends in the economy over
other industrial uses for which there are adequate spaces elsewhere in the
City.
§ 43-231. Location.
As shown on the attached map at Figure X, and on the Yonkers Zoning
Map288 this district shall constitute the zoning on Block 2071, Block 2073,
Block 2179 and Block 2183.
§ 43-232. Dimensional regulations.
The dimensional regulations pertaining to the Artisans and Industry Special
District shall be the same as the dimensional regulations pertaining to the
"I" Industry Zone.
§ 43-233. Parking.
A. Buildings, structures, and uses existing at the time of passage of this
article shall be exempted from required parking. Alterations that do not
increase the gross square footage of the building, or the structure
existing in the Artisans & Industry Special District are exempt from
providing new or additional off-street parking.
B. Parking or loading spaces existing at the time of passage of this article
shall not be eliminated or reduced in number except that the location,
size, layout of such existing spaces may be changed in conjunction with
site plan review.
C. New buildings and structures. Parking shall be provided as per the
requirements contained in Article X, Off-Street Parking and Loading, for
any new buildings, structures or increases in gross square footage of
existing buildings.

§ 43-235. Signage in Artisan and Industry Special District.
[Amended 12-10-2019 by Ord. No. 12-2019]
A. Certain retail, restaurant, eating and drinking establishment, indoor
commercial recreation, health club and gymnasium and personal
service uses are permitted in the Artisans and Industry Special District
on the ground floor only. The gross square footage of these retail,
restaurant, eating and drinking establishment, indoor commercial
recreation, health club and gynasium and personal service uses shall
not exceed, in total, an area equal to or less than 20% of the gross floor
area of the building.
B. Ground floor. For the purposes of the Artisans and Industry Special
District, the term "ground floor" shall mean that story of a building or
structure that has direct access from the adjacent street or land. In
cases where a building or structure has access on more than one level
due to the slope of the land and the construction of the building or
structure, the owner may select the floor that will be considered the
ground floor for all retail, restaurant, eating and drinking
establishment, indoor commercial recreation, health club and
gymnasium and personal service uses. Such "ground floor" designation
shall apply to all future retail, restaurant, eating and drinking
establishment, indoor commercial recreation, health club and
gymnasium and personal service uses in the building.
C. Primary entrance. For the purpose of regulating signage for the certain
retail, restaurant, eating and drinking establishment, indoor
commercial recreation, health club and gymnasium and personal
service uses, a primary entrance to these uses shall be established and
designated when the building permit is applied for.
A. Signage restrictions. Due to the National Register of Historic Places
designation of the buildings in the district and the City's interest in
preserving the aesthetic resource, signage shall be limited in the
following manner.
B. Retail, restaurant, eating and drinking establishment, indoor
commercial recreation, health club and gymnasium and personal
service uses. Signage for these uses shall be located at the exterior
primary entrance leading directly to the use and shall be located no
higher on the building or structure than immediately above the ground
floor windows. Such signage shall be sized so as to not cover
architectural features of the building including, but not limited to,
window sills, window lintels, belt courses, and the like. Signage for
retail, restaurant eating and drinking establishment, indoor commercial
recreation, health club and gymnasium and personal service uses shall
§ 43-234 YONKERS CODE § 43-235
C:1160
not be permitted elsewhere on the building except as a part of a flushmounted
directory sign no larger than three feet by three feet adjacent
to entrances that are not the primary entrance to the use.

Design Review Board
[Adopted 12-9-1997 by G.O. No. 15-1997290291]
§ 44-7. Title.
The title of the body hereunder created shall be and is the "Yonkers Design
Review Board" (hereinafter referred to as "Board").
§ 44-8. Purposes.
The City Council hereby finds that excessive uniformity, dissimilarity,
inappropriateness or poor quality of design in the exterior appearance
of buildings or other structures erected or altered can adversely affect
the desirability of the immediate and neighboring areas and, by so doing,
impair the benefits of occupancy of existing property in such areas, impair
the stability in value of both improved and unimproved real property in
such areas, prevent the most appropriate development and use of such
areas, produce degeneration of property in such areas with attendant
deterioration of conditions affecting the health, safety, comfort and general
welfare of the inhabitants thereof, and contribute to the diminution of the
taxable value of real property in such areas and their ability to support
municipal services provided therefor. It is the purpose of this article to
prevent these and other potentially harmful effects resulting from such
unattractive exterior appearance of buildings and other structures erected
or altered, and thus to promote the public health, safety and welfare, to
conserve the value of buildings, to encourage the most appropriate use of
land and to improve the physical and visual appearance of the city.
§ 44-9. Creation and organization.
There is hereby created a Design Review Board which shall consist of five
members, who shall serve without compensation. Such members shall be
specially qualified by reason of training or experience in art, architecture,
engineering, graphic design, landscape architecture, community planning,
land development, real estate or other relevant business or profession, to
judge the effects of a proposed building or structure or alteration thereof
upon the desirability, property values and development of surrounding
areas. At least two members of such Board shall be registered architects.
The members of such Board shall be appointed by the Mayor and confirmed
by the City Council, and the Chairman thereof shall be designated by the
Mayor and confirmed by the City Council. Of the members first appointed,
one shall hold office for the term of one year, two for the term of two
years, and two for the term of three years from and after their respective
appointments. Their successors shall be appointed by the Mayor and
confirmed by the City Council for a term of three years from and after the
290.

Three members of the Board shall constitute a quorum for the transaction
of business as provided by Section 41 of the General Construction Law.
§ 44-12. Powers and duties.
A. All meetings of the Design Review Board shall be held at the call of the
Chairman and at such other times as such Board may determine, but a
meeting shall be held within 30 days of the date of any application or
referral to it. Such Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings showing
the vote of each member upon every question, or, if any member is
absent or fails to vote, indicating such fact, and shall also keep records
of its examination and other official actions.
B. The Board shall have the power from time to time to adopt, amend and
repeal rules and regulations not inconsistent with law or this Code,
governing its procedure and the transaction of its business, after public
hearing by the Board following five days' notice in a newspaper of
general circulation in the City of Yonkers, and subject to the approval of
the City Council. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board shall have
no jurisdiction, powers or duties until the City Council shall have
adopted the first version of such rules and regulations.
C. Every rule and regulation, every amendment or appeal thereof and
every order, requirement, decision or determination of the Board shall

attached hereto and made a part hereof,292 no change may be made to
the exterior appearance of any building, structure or lot (as such terms
are defined in § 43-8 in the Yonkers Code), or anything attached

C:1166
§ 44-13. Procedure.
The Design Review Board shall have 62 days (45 for referrals as provided
above) in which to act upon a matter before it. Such limit shall be measured
from the date of the meeting at which the Board receives an application.
Such time limit may be extended by mutual agreement with the applicant.
Failure to act on the part of the Board within the time limit specified, or as
may be extended, shall be deemed to constitute approval.
§ 44-14. Standards.
In examining plans or proposals, the Design Review Board shall disapprove
any design which would cause or contribute to one or more of the harmful
effects set forth in § 44-8 of this Code by reason of:
Yonkers, or anything attached thereto, including without limitation any
paint color, siding, sign, flagpole, fence, security grille, flag or awning,
or anything such as a window sign visible from the exterior, until the
city agency or official having final approval authority has received a
written report from the Design Review Board, or 45 days has passed
since referral of the matter to the Design Review Board, whichever first
occurs.
C. In order to effectuate the purposes hereof, the Board may develop and
adopt other principles for design evaluation, not inconsistent herewith,
including design guidelines for specified circumstances. For any and all
such design guidelines, the Board may provide, within specified
circumstances, for staff review and issuance of certificates of
appropriateness without further review and approval by the Board. Any
such principles or design guidelines shall be adopted in accordance
with the provisions set forth above for the adoption by the Board of
rules and regulations.
D. Notwithstanding the above provisions, when the Landmarks
Preservation Board has authority under Article I of Chapter 45 of the
Yonkers Code to issue or deny a certificate of appropriateness for the
same building, structure or lot, or when the Planning Board has
authority under Yonkers Code to issue or deny a site plan approval or
special exception use permit for the same building, structure or lot,
then the Design Review Board shall not have final approval authority
but shall function in an advisory capacity to such Landmarks
Preservation Board or Planning Board. Neither Board may, however,
issue any such certificate, approval or permit until it has received a
written report from the Design Review Board, or 45 days has passed
since referral of the matter to the Design Review Board, whichever first
occurs.
A. Excessive dissimilarity or inappropriateness in relation to any other
structure existing or for which a permit has been issued, or to any other
structure included in the same permit application, facing upon the same
or intersecting street and within 500 feet of the proposed new
§ 44-12 CHARTER § 44-14
C:1167
§ 44-15. Guiding principles for Design Review Board.
In reviewing applications for conformity to the above standards, the design
shall be evaluated by the following criteria:
structure, in respect to one or more of the following features: cubical
content; gross floor area; building area or height of roof; or other
significant design features, such as paint color, siding, materials or
style of architectural design.
B. Excessive similarity to any other structure existing or for which a
permit has been issued, or to any other structure included in the same
permit application, facing upon the same or intersecting street and
within 500 feet of the proposed new structure, in respect to one or more
of the following features of exterior design and appearance: apparently
identical front, side or other elevations visible from a street;
substantially identical size and arrangement of either doors, windows,
porticoes or other openings or breaks in the elevation facing the street,
including reverse arrangement; or other significant identical features of
design, such as but not limited to material, roof line, height or other
design elements.
C. The quality of building and overall site design, in respect to one or more
of the following features: the relationship to and character of the
adjacent neighborhood; consideration of architectural style, bulk,
dimensions, materials, and location on the site and in relation to
development on adjoining properties, the natural terrain and
vegetation.
A. The facades of the building shall be of such material, color and/or
texture, massing, fenestration, signs and advertising as not to be
discordant or incongruous with comparable architectural elements of
other buildings, identified in § 44-14 above, which, by reason of their
proximate location, are visually related to the facades of nearby
buildings. The facades shall not contain any feature or element which
shall be so disproportionate by normal architectural standards or so
garish that it detracts or may in the future detract from title
appearance of nearby buildings or groupings of buildings.
B. Any projections from the facades shall be so positioned and designed as
to be harmonious with other proximate buildings. Consideration shall
be given to avoiding monotony in the development of contiguous
facades of adjacent buildings and also to avoid excessive and
unattractive disruption and irregularity in the continuity of adjacent
facades.
C. Doors, windows, openings, porticoes and other projections or
architectural features shall be arranged, wherever possible, to enable
adjoining buildings to complement each other.
§ 44-14 YONKERS CODE § 44-15
C:1168
§ 44-16. Limitations.
§ 44-17. Appeals.
Notwithstanding the provisions of § 43-67A of the Yonkers Code, any person
aggrieved by an action of the Design Review Board in approving or
disapproving an application before it may take an appeal to and request a
variance from the Zoning Board of Appeals.
D. The facade of a building and the open areas adjacent to building
entrances and pedestrian walks shall be bordered with appropriate
shrubbery or plantings of a decorative character. Pedestrian walks and
sitting areas shall be surfaced so that they will easily be maintained and
be neat and attractive in appearance.
E. Vehicular parking areas, utility buildings and structures, garbage and
refuse disposal facilities and other service areas or entrances shall
utilize plantings, trees, shrubs or other methods where feasible to
shield unsightly and incongruous features from the public view, to avoid
large, unrelieved paved or surfaced areas and to minimize the effect of
these features on the overall appearance of the development.
F. Design and development of the rear facade shall be reviewed as well as
the front facade so as to create an attractive exposure and entranceway
for the public utilizing or viewing the rear of the premises.
A. The Board shall restrict its considerations to a reasonable and
professional review of the proposal and plans, leaving full responsibility
for the design and development to the applicant. The Board shall not
design or assist in the design of any buildings or structures submitted
for approval.
B. The Board shall not unduly restrict new or innovative building types,
materials or methods.
C. In its endeavor to improve the quality of design, the Board shall
consider cost as one factor along with design in its efforts to achieve the
objectives of this article.
A. In making its determination, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall take into
consideration the benefit to the applicant if the variance is granted, as
weighed against the detriment to the health, safety and welfare of the
neighborhood or community by such grant. In making such
determination the Board shall also consider:
(1) Whether an undesirable change will be produced in the character
of the neighborhood or a detriment to nearby properties will be
created by the granting of the variance;
(2) Whether the benefit sought by the applicant can be achieved by
some method feasible for the applicant to pursue, other than
variance;
§ 44-15 CHARTER § 44-17
C:1169
§ 44-18. Violations.
Violations of the provisions of this article shall be subject to the provisions
of Chapter 43, entitled "Zoning," Article XIII, § 43-108.
§ 44-19. Fees.
Each application to the Design Review Board shall be accompanied by a
fee equal to 1% of project cost (as determined by the Yonkers Building
Department) but not less than $50 nor more than $500.
(3) Whether the requested variance is substantial;
(4) Whether the proposed variance will have an adverse effect or
impact on the physical or environmental conditions in the
neighborhood or district; and
(5) Whether the alleged difficulty was self-created, which
consideration shall be relevant to the decision of the Board of
Appeals, but shall not necessarily preclude the granting of the
variance.
B. The Board of Appeals, in the granting of such variances, shall grant the
minimum variance that it shall deem necessary and adequate and at the
same time preserve and protect the character of the neighborhood and
the health, safety and welfare of the community.
C. The Board of Appeals shall, in the granting of such variances, have the
authority to impose such reasonable conditions and restrictions as are
directly related to and incidental to the proposed use of the property.
Such conditions shall be consistent with the spirit and intent of this
article and shall be imposed for the purpose of minimizing any adverse
impact such variance may have on the neighborhood or community.

ARTICLE I
General Provisions
§ 45-1. Purpose.
A. The City Council of the City of Yonkers hereby finds and declares that it
is desirable to take measures to provide for the designation of historic
districts and landmarks in furtherance of the following public purposes,
which are found to promote the economic benefits, the cultural and
educational advantages and the general welfare of the City of Yonkers:
(1) To provide for the protection, enhancement, perpetuation and use
of those districts, sites, buildings, structures and objects which are
illustrative of the growth and development of our nation, our state
and our city and which are of particular historic or aesthetic value
to Yonkers.
(2) To recognize and ensure the preservation of those elements of the
City's past which represent the many and varied architectural,
artistic, technological and cultural achievements which cannot be
duplicated or otherwise replaced.
(3) To promote the use and preservation of historic districts and
landmark buildings, structures, sites and objects as a means of
providing enjoyment and unique educational benefit by
perpetuating the physical evidence of Yonkers' past.
(4) To stabilize and improve property values of such historic districts,
buildings, structures, sites and objects and otherwise promote their
reuse.
(5) To protect and enhance the City's attractions to tourists and
visitors and the support and stimulus to business and industry
thereby provided.
(6) To foster civic pride in those elements of the City's past which have
given Yonkers its unique character and set it apart from other
communities.
B. The City Council of the City of Yonkers hereby further finds and
declares that demolition or decay of historic landmarks and
inappropriateness or poor quality of design in the exterior appearance
of landmarks or buildings erected in historic districts adversely affects
the desirability of the immediate area and neighboring areas for
residential, commercial or other uses and, by so doing, impairs the
benefits of occupancy of existing property, impairs the stability and
value of both improved and unimproved real property and reduces the
taxable value of real property in relation to the cost of municipal
services provided for the benefit of such real property.

this article for the designation of a landmark or historic district.
A. No application for approval of a zone change, variance, special
exception, subdivision, site plan, building permit, demolition permit or

event shall the moratorium be for more than 180 days.
B. Notwithstanding the requirements of § 45-7A, applications for building
permits or sign permits may be granted during the City's consideration
of a proposed landmark or historic district designation. Building
permits and sign permits shall be granted after the Board has issued an
approval of the work proposed in the form of a certificate of
appropriateness. An application seeking a certificate of
appropriateness pursuant to this section (§ 45-7B) shall be processed,
reviewed, granted or denied based upon procedures and criteria
identical to those in effect for established landmarks or historic
districts.
A. Notwithstanding any other ordinance, code, rule or regulation
concerning the issuance of building, demolition, subdivision, or other
permits or approvals, none of the following activities shall be
commenced without the issuance of a certificate of appropriateness:
(1) Any alteration or repair which causes any material change in
appearance of any feature of a building, structure, site or object in
a designated historic district or of a designated landmark.
(2) Any new construction in a designated historic district.
(3) Any demolition or removal of a building, structure, site or object in
a designated historic district or of a designated landmark.
B. The certificate of appropriateness required by this section shall be in
addition to and not in lieu of any building, sign or other permit that may
be required by any state or local requirement or regulation. Nothing in
this article shall preclude compliance with all other applicable state and
local requirements, including but not limited to the necessity of
obtaining a building permit. Even if a certificate of appropriateness is
issued as provided in this article, a person shall still be required to
obtain a building permit if a building permit is required for the activity
§ 45-6 CHARTER § 45-8
C:1183
approved in the certificate of appropriateness. Issuance of a building
permit by the Bureau of Housing and Buildings shall not relieve any
person from the requirement of obtaining a certificate of
appropriateness or from fully complying with all of the requirements of
this article.
C. An application for a certificate of appropriateness shall be submitted to
the Board in such form and including such written information and data
and such plans, elevations, drawings, etc., as the Board may require.
D. In passing upon an application for a certificate of appropriateness, the
Board shall not consider changes to interior spaces, except in cases
where the interiors have been duly designated as interior landmarks.
E. Within 90 days after an application is filed, the Board shall hold a
meeting open to the public and shall then determine whether the
proposed change will be appropriate to the preservation of the district
or the landmark in view of the purposes of this article. In exercising this
power, the Board shall:
(1) Regarding landmarks, apply the United States Secretary of the
Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation and Guidelines for
Rehabilitating Historic Buildings and shall consider, in addition to
any other pertinent factors, the historical and architectural style,
general design arrangement, texture, material and color of
component(s) or sign(s) involved and the relationship thereof to
other buildings, structures, sites or objects in the immediate
neighborhood or district.
(2) Regarding historic districts, the Board shall apply the United
States Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation and
Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings. The Board may
adopt additional guidelines for individual historic districts which
are more restrictive than those prescribed by the United States
Secretary of the Interior and which shall address alterations,
additions, new construction, demolition, siting, landscaping and
relocation of buildings, structures or objects. The Board may also
take into consideration the visual relationship between the
property in question and existing buildings, structures, sites or
objects either immediately adjacent to or in the surrounding area
and the character of the district and the extent to which a new or
altered building, structure, site or object would be harmonious with
or incongruous to the historic and architectural qualities or
distinctive aspects of the district.
F. With respect to demolition or removal in whole or in part of a landmark
or building, structure, site or object in an historic district, the Board
shall apply the United States Secretary of the Interior's Standards for
Rehabilitation and Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings and
shall consider whether:
§ 45-8 YONKERS CODE § 45-8
C:1184
(1) The building, structure, site or object is of such architectural or
historic interest that its demolition or removal would be to the
detriment of the public interest.
(2) Retention of the building, structure, site or object would help
preserve and protect an historic place or area of historic interest in
the City.
(3) Retention will promote the general welfare by maintaining and
increasing real estate values and encouraging interest in American
history, architecture and culture.
G. If the Board approves the application, the Board shall issue a certificate
of appropriateness, which shall specify the work or activity to be done.
In issuing the certificate, the Board may prescribe any conditions that it
deems to be necessary to carry out the intent and purposes of this
article. A certificate issued pursuant to this section shall relate solely to
proposed plans and representations included in or accompanying the
application. It shall be unlawful to deviate from the representations and
plans, including any modifications required as a condition for the
issuance of such certificate, unless and until an amended certificate
shall be applied for and issued.
H. If the Board determines that a certificate of appropriateness should not
be issued, the Board shall notify the applicant, in writing, of such
determination, and of the Board's reasons therefor, and shall file such
notice with the City Clerk and the Director of the Bureau of Housing
and Buildings. Unless the action of the Board is reversed on appeal, no
building permit, permit for a sign, permit for demolition or removal or
other permit shall be issued in an historic district or involving a
landmark if a certificate of appropriateness has been denied.
I. If a certificate of appropriateness has been approved, then a building
permit or any other approval issued for the same work or activity by any
other agency of the City shall be consistent with the terms and
requirements of the certificate of appropriateness.
J. Notwithstanding the other provisions of the section, if the Board fails to
issue a certificate of appropriateness or notify the applicant of its
determination not to issue a certificate within 90 days after such
application therefor is filed, or within such additional time period as the
Board and the applicant may agree, such application shall be deemed
approved.
K. Nothing contained in this article shall be construed as authorizing the
Board, when acting with respect to an application for a certificate of
appropriateness or when adopting regulations in relation thereto, to
waive any code, ordinance, regulation or law of the City of Yonkers. In
exercising its powers and performing its functions under this article
regarding the construction, reconstruction, alteration, removal, repair,
demolition or use of any building, structure, site, object or sign, the
Board may impose determinations or conditions which are more
§ 45-8 CHARTER § 45-8
C:1185
§ 45-9. Unsafe buildings.
Except for action taken pursuant to § 56-83, no activity authorized in the
remainder of Article IX of Chapter 56, Building and Electrical Code, shall be
approved for any landmark or in any historic district unless prior notice has
been given to the Board and the Board is given an opportunity to present
information to the Bureau of Housing and Buildings. Regarding actions
taken pursuant to § 56-83, the Bureau of Housing and Buildings shall inform
the Board of the nature of activities undertaken in historic districts or to
any landmark.
§ 45-10. Economic hardship.
restrictive than those prescribed in other applicable codes, ordinances,
regulations and laws.
L. Any certificate of appropriateness shall expire 12 months from the date
of issuance if the work authorized thereby is not commenced by the end
of such twelve-month period; and further, such certificate shall also
expire and become null and void if such authorized work is suspended
and abandoned for a period of 12 months after being commenced. Any
period or periods of time during which the right to use any such
certificate is stayed, due to judicial action, shall be excluded from the
computation of the 12 months.
M. Any action requiring a building permit and a certificate of
appropriateness shall also require a certificate of completion or
occupancy from the Bureau of Housing and Buildings. The Bureau of
Housing and Buildings shall issue a certificate of completion or
occupancy when the work or activity authorized in the certificate of
appropriateness has been completed according to the terms and
requirements contained therein. [Amended 6-23-1992 by G.O. No.
3-1992]
N. If a building permit is required, then the fee for the certificate of
appropriateness shall be 10% of the fee for a building permit
established in Chapter 56, Building and Electrical Code, and shall be
paid in addition to the fee for the building permit. If no building permit
is required, then there shall be no fee to obtain a certificate of
appropriateness. All fee payments shall be made to the Comptroller.
[Amended 6-23-1992 by G.O. No. 3-1992]
O. The Board may adopt a list of types of activities of lesser impact for
which the Director of Planning may grant certificates of
appropriateness, and may establish procedures for this purpose. The
Director may exercise discretion within such listed activities to grant or
deny certificates of appropriateness or to determine that an action
should instead be referred to the Board. An applicant may not apply to
both the Board and Director regarding the same action. The applicant
may appeal the Director's determination to deny a certificate under this
section to the Board. [Added 10-14-1997 by G.O. No. 13-1997]
§ 45-8 YONKERS CODE § 45-10
C:1186
A. An applicant whose certificate of appropriateness has been denied or
approved with conditions may apply for appropriate relief from the
requirements of this article or conditions imposed by the Board on the
grounds that such requirements or conditions imposed will result in a
hardship.
B. In order to prove the existence of hardship, an applicant shall establish
that it is unable to make any economically viable use of the property,
whether for income-producing purposes or for private use.
C. In order to prove the existence of hardship, an applicant whose
certificate of appropriateness for a proposed demolition has been

I. Upon a finding by the Board that, without the granting of the relief
requested, all reasonable use of or return from a designated landmark
or property within an historic district will be denied a property owner,
then the Board shall delay granting the relief requested for a period not
to exceed 90 days. During this period of delay, the Board shall
investigate plans and make recommendations to the City Council and
other municipal agencies to allow for a reasonable use of or return from
the property or to otherwise preserve the property. Such plans and
recommendations may include but are not limited to a relaxation from
the provisions of any other Code, ordinance, law or requirement of the

code modifications and/or changes in zoning regulations. If, by the end

relief requested, the property still cannot be put to a reasonable use or
the owner cannot obtain a reasonable economic return therefrom, then
the Board shall issue a certificate of economic hardship granting
appropriate relief from the requirements of this article.
J. All decisions of the Board on hardship applications shall be in writing. A

cause the property to deteriorate, decay or become damaged or
otherwise to fall into a state of disrepair.

shall order or direct the construction, removal, alteration or demolition

direction.

OUTDOOR SIGNS
§ 47-1. Short title; statement of legislative purpose and findings.
A. This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Sign Ordinance,"
hereinafter referred to as "this chapter."
B. Findings. [Added 3-8-1994 by G.O. No. 5-1994]
(1) Having received a report from City planning staff concerning the
proliferation of certain signs in the City of Yonkers, the City Council
of the City of Yonkers hereby finds that the existence and
proliferation of billboards and similar signs along the City's
thoroughfares, and on rooftops and sides of buildings, has resulted
in a visual blight that detracts from the appearance and orderliness
of the City, obscuring its vistas and its neighborhoods.
Furthermore, a number of signs are located near existing homes
and apartment buildings, lending an unsightly appearance to a
number of the City's neighborhoods and undermining the quality of
life of residents of those neighborhoods. Rooftop signs particularly
undermine the aesthetic and architectural integrity of the
cityscape.
(2) In addition, signs are by their nature designed to attract attention,
and therefore signs placed within sight of roadways are intended to
distract drivers, as well as pedestrians. Flashing, rotating and
animated signs are by their nature particularly distracting.
Therefore, traffic safety can only be furthered by reasonable and
appropriate limitations upon signs in the City of Yonkers, which
includes a number of heavily traveled avenues and parkways.
(3) Off-site signs, with their periodically changing content, present
special aesthetic and traffic safety problems, and commercial signs
constitute the overwhelming proportion of all off-site signs. In
addition, owners of businesses have a unique interest in
advertising the activities on the premises of their businesses, to
which weight must be given. Similarly, because noncommercial
permanent signs constitute a negligible proportion of the signs in
the City and equitable treatment of such signs has been the subject
of judicial concern, it would be inappropriate and misguided to be
overly restrictive and prohibit such signs merely because other
signs have been prohibited. Where such signs pose the additional

on the ground in the vicinity of such ground sign or said premises for
which he or she may be responsible.
G. Maintenance. The owner of any sign, as defined and regulated by this
chapter, shall properly paint, at least once every two years, all parts and
supports of said sign.
H. Bond and liability insurance.

on an exterior wall. [Amended 7-18-1996 by L.L. No. 5-1996]
(2) Said surety bond and liability policy shall be renewed annually,

sufficiency, and shall be for a term coextensive with the period for
which the permit or license is issued or renewed as hereinafter
required.
(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsection H(1) and (2) of this
section, the Corporation Counsel may, upon the recommendation of
the Commissioner, approve public liability and property damage
insurance policies with coverage limits less than those herein

that might emanate from the sign.

GREEN BUILDINGS
§ 50-1. Short title; statement of purpose; legislative findings.
A. This chapter shall be known as "the Yonkers Green Buildings Code."
B. The purpose of this legislation is to establish a City of Yonkers policy to
plan, design, construct, manage, renovate, and maintain its facilities
and buildings to be sustainable and to encourage certain commercial
and residential developers to do the same.
C. Legislative findings.
(1) The City of Yonkers is dedicated to the mutually compatible goals of
economic vitality, social equality and environmental stewardship.
(2) The City of Yonkers is dedicated to the environmental health and
safety of its employees, and to efficient and effective work.
(3) Municipal governments should assume the role of leadership in
promoting the efficient use of natural resources providing for the
long-term protection and enhancement of our environment, our
economy and the health of our citizens and future generations.
(4) Buildings are one of the heaviest consumers of natural resources
and account for a significant portion of the greenhouse gas
emissions that affect climate change. In the United States,
buildings account for 38% of all CO2 emissions. Buildings
represent 73% of electricity consumption.
(5) The Yonkers Green Development Standards will address specific
environmental impacts of development in Yonkers. Use of these
standards will conserve natural resources, increase energy and
water efficiency and improve indoor air quality to maintain longterm
value, reduce operating costs, and ensure more comfortable
and healthy buildings in Yonkers.
(6) It is in the best interest of the people of Yonkers that all municipal
buildings constructed, expanded, or renovated should be modern
facilities, combining the most energy-efficient design, the most
environmentally sustainable systems, with maximum access and
benefit to employees and the public.
(7) The City of Yonkers should encourage the use of the Yonkers Green
Building Standards in certain commercial and residential
developments.

§ 51-2 CHARTER § 51-4
C:1233
§ 51-5. Application criteria.
Upon the submission of an application, EIC, acting on behalf of the City

EIC on such forms as have been prepared by EIC and made available to
property owners on the website of EIC and at the City of Yonkers
offices.
B. Every application submitted by a property owner shall be reviewed by
EIC, acting on behalf of the City of Yonkers, which shall make a positive
or negative determination on such application based upon the criteria
enumerated in the Enabling Act and § 51-5 of this chapter. EIC may also
request further information from the property owner where necessary
to aid in its determination.
C. If a positive determination on an application is made by EIC, acting on
behalf of the City of Yonkers, the property owner shall be deemed a
qualified property owner and shall be eligible to participate in the
Program in accordance with § 51-6 of this chapter.
A. The property owner may not be in bankruptcy and the property may not
constitute property subject to any pending bankruptcy proceeding;
B. The amount financed under the Program shall be repaid over a term not
to exceed the weighted average of the useful life of renewable energy
systems and energy efficiency improvements to be installed on the
property as determined by EIC;

financing to the property owner;
D. The property owner is current in payments on any existing mortgage on
the qualified property;

other financing parties may set from time to time.
A. A qualified property owner may participate in the Program through the
execution of a finance agreement made by and between the qualified
property owner and a financing party, to which EIC, on behalf of the
City of Yonkers, shall be a third-party beneficiary (the "finance
agreement"). Upon execution and delivery of the finance agreement,
§ 51-4 YONKERS CODE § 51-6
C:1234
§ 51-7. Terms and conditions of repayment.
The finance agreement shall set forth the terms and conditions of
repayment in accordance with the following:
§ 51-8. Levy of annual installment amount and creation of annual
installment lien.
the property that is the subject of the finance agreement shall be
deemed a "benefited property."
B. Upon execution and delivery of the finance agreement, the benefited
property owner shall be eligible to receive funds from the financing
party for the acquisition, construction, and installation of a qualified
project, together with eligible costs and financing charges approved by
EIC and by the financing party, provided the requirements of the
Enabling Act, the municipal agreement and this chapter have been met.
C. The finance agreement shall include the terms and conditions of
repayment of the secured amount and the annual installment amounts.
D. EIC may charge fees to offset the costs of administering the Program
and such fees, if not paid by the financing party, shall be added to the
secured amount.
A. The principal amount of the funds loaned to the benefited property
owner for the qualified project, together with eligible costs and
financing charges approved by EIC and by the financing party, shall be
specially assessed against the benefited property and will be evidenced
by a benefit assessment lien recorded against the benefited property on
the land records on which liens are recorded for properties within the
City of Yonkers. The special benefit assessment shall constitute a
"charge" within the meaning of the Enabling Act and shall be collected
in annual installments in the amounts certified by the financing party in
a schedule provided at closing and made part of the benefit assessment
lien. Said amount shall be annually levied, billed and collected by EIC,
on behalf of the City of Yonkers, and shall be paid to the financing party
as provided in the finance agreement.
B. The term of such repayment shall be determined at the time the finance
agreement is executed by the benefited property owner and the
financing party, not to exceed the weighted average of the useful life of
the systems and improvements as determined by EIC, acting on behalf
of the City of Yonkers.
C. The rate of interest for the secured amount shall be fixed by the
financing party in conjunction with EIC, acting on behalf of the City of
Yonkers, as provided in the finance agreement.
A. Upon the making of the loan pursuant to the finance agreement, the
secured amount shall become a special benefit assessment lien on the
benefited property in favor of the City of Yonkers. The amount of the
§ 51-6 CHARTER § 51-8
C:1235
benefit assessment lien shall be the secured amount. Evidence of the
benefit assessment lien shall be recorded by EIC, on behalf of the City
of Yonkers, in the land records for properties in the City of Yonkers.
Such recording shall be exempt from any charge, mortgage recording
tax or other fee in the same manner as if recorded by the City of
Yonkers. The benefit assessment lien shall not be foreclosed upon by or
otherwise enforced by the City of Yonkers.
B. The finance agreement shall provide for the repayment of the secured
amount in installments made at least annually, as provided in a
schedule attached to the benefit assessment lien (the "annual
installment amount"). The annual installment amount shall be levied by
EIC, on behalf of the City of Yonkers, on the benefited property in the
same manner as levies for municipal charges, shall become a lien on the
benefited property as of the first day of January of the fiscal year for
which levied (the "annual installment lien") and shall remain a lien until
paid. The creation or any recording of the annual installment lien shall
be exempt from any charge, mortgage recording tax or other fee in the
same manner as if recorded by the City of Yonkers. Payment to the
financing party shall be considered payment for this purpose. Such
payment shall partly or wholly discharge the annual installment lien.
Delinquent annual installment amounts may accrue financing charges
as may be provided in the finance agreement. Any additional financing
charges imposed by the financing party pursuant to the finance
agreement shall increase the annual installment amount and the annual
installment lien for the year in which such overdue payments were first
due.
C. The benefit assessment lien shall be reduced annually by the amount of
each annual installment lien when each annual installment lien
becomes a lien. Each annual installment lien shall be subordinate to all
municipal liens, whether created by Section 902 of the RPTL or by any
other state or chapter. No portion of a secured amount shall be
recovered by the City of Yonkers, EIC, or an assignee upon foreclosure,
sale or other disposition of the benefited property unless and until all
municipal liens are fully discharged. Each annual installment lien,
however, shall have priority over all nonmunicipal liens, irrespective of
when created, except as otherwise required by law.
D. Neither the benefit assessment lien nor any annual installment lien
shall be extinguished or accelerated in the event of a default or
bankruptcy of the benefited property owner. Each annual installment
amount shall be considered a charge upon the benefited property and
shall be collected by EIC, on behalf of the City of Yonkers, at the same
time and in the same manner as real property taxes or municipal
charges. Each annual installment lien shall remain a lien until paid.
Amounts collected in respect of an annual installment lien shall be
remitted to EIC, on behalf of the City of Yonkers, or the financing party,
as may be provided in the finance agreement.
§ 51-8 YONKERS CODE § 51-8
C:1236
§ 51-9. Verification and report.
EIC, on behalf of the City of Yonkers, shall verify and report on the
installation and performance of renewable energy systems and energy
efficiency improvements financed by the Program in such form and manner
as the authority may establish.
§ 51-10. Separability.
If any clause, sentence, paragraph, section, or part of this chapter shall
be adjudged by any court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such
judgment shall not affect, impair or invalidate the remainder thereof, but
shall be confined in its operation to the clause, sentence, paragraph,
section, or part thereof involved in the controversy in which such judgment
shall have been rendered.
Part VI: Fire and Buildings
Chapter 55
FIRE AND BUILDING CODE
E. EIC shall act as the City of Yonkers agent in collection of the annual
installment amounts. If any benefited property owner fails to pay an
annual installment amount, the financing party may redeem the
benefited property by paying the amount of all unpaid municipal liens
thereon, and thereafter shall have the right to collect any amounts in
respect of an annual installment lien by foreclosure or any other
remedy available at law. Any foreclosure shall not affect any subsequent
annual installment liens.
F. EIC, on behalf of the City of Yonkers, may sell or assign for
consideration any and all benefit assessment liens and annual
installment liens to financing parties that provide financing to qualified
properties pursuant to finance agreements. The financing parties may
sell or assign for consideration any and all benefit assessment liens and
annual installment liens received from EIC, on behalf of the City of
Yonkers, subject to certain conditions provided in the administration
agreement between EIC and the financing party. The assignee or
assignees of such benefit assessment liens and annual installment liens
shall have and possess the same powers and rights at law or in equity as
the City of Yonkers would have had if the benefit assessment lien and
the annual installment liens had not been assigned with regard to the
precedence and priority of such lien, the accrual of interest and the fees
and expenses of collection.

regulation. [Amended 7-18-1996 by L.L. No. 5-1996]
C. In the event that a building, structure or staging is exempt from the
application of the New York Uniform Code due to its existence prior to
the date upon which the New York Uniform Code became effective in
the City of Yonkers, then the substantive provisions of the Code of the
City of Yonkers as they existed in June 1989 shall be applicable to such
building, structure or staging enforceable pursuant to the procedures
and penalties hereby enacted. Nothing herein shall be construed as an
approval, acknowledgment or exemption of any building, structure or

such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
C. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of
floodwaters;
D. Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damages;
E. Regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert
floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and
F. Qualify for and maintain participation in the National Flood Insurance
Program.

permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood
damages. This article shall not create liability on the part of the City of
Yonkers, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, for any flood damages that result from reliance on
this article or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
A. Designation of local administrator. The City Engineer is hereby
appointed local administrator to administer and implement this article
§ 56-146 YONKERS CODE § 56-147
C:1322
by granting or denying floodplain development permits in accordance
with its provisions.
B. Floodplain development permit. A floodplain development permit is
hereby established for all construction and other development to be
undertaken in areas of special flood hazard in this community for the
purpose of protecting its citizens from increased flood hazards and
insuring that new development is constructed in a manner that
minimizes its exposure to flooding. It shall be unlawful to undertake any
development in an area of special flood hazard, as shown on the Flood
Insurance Rate Map enumerated in § 56-146B(1)(a), without a valid
floodplain development permit. Application for a permit shall be made
on forms furnished by the local administrator and may include, but not
be limited to, plans, in duplicate, drawn to scale and showing the
nature, location, dimensions, and elevations of the area in question;
existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials, and drainage
facilities, and the location of the foregoing.
C. Application for permit. The applicant shall provide the following
information as appropriate. Additional information may be required on
the permit application form.
(1) The proposed elevation, in relation to mean sea level, of the lowest
floor (including basement or cellar) of any new or substantially
improved structure to be located in Zones A1-A30, AE or AH, or
Zone A if base flood elevation data are available. Upon completion
of the lowest floor, the permittee shall submit to the local
administrator the as-built elevation, certified by a licensed
professional engineer or surveyor.
(2) The proposed elevation, in relation to mean sea level, to which any
new or substantially improved nonresidential structure will be
floodproofed. Upon completion of the floodproofed portion of the
structure, the permittee shall submit to the local administrator the
as-built floodproofed elevation, certified by a professional engineer
or surveyor.
(3) A certificate from a licensed professional engineer or architect that
any utility floodproofing will meet the criteria in § 56-148E,
Utilities.
(4) A certificate from a licensed professional engineer or architect that
any nonresidential floodproofed structure will meet the
floodproofing criteria in § 56-148G, Nonresidential structures.
(5) A description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered
or relocated as a result of proposed development. Computations by
a licensed professional engineer must be submitted that
demonstrate that the altered or relocated segment will provide
equal or greater conveyance than the original stream segment. The
applicant must submit any maps, computations or other material
required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
§ 56-147 CHARTER § 56-147
C:1323
to revise the documents enumerated in § 56-146B(1), when notified
by the local administrator, and must pay any fees or other costs
assessed by FEMA for this purpose. The applicant must also
provide assurances that the conveyance capacity of the altered or
relocated stream segment will be maintained.
(6) A technical analysis, by a licensed professional engineer, if required
by the local administrator, which shows whether proposed
development to be located in an area of special flood hazard may
result in physical damage to any other property.
(7) In Zone A, when no base flood elevation data are available from
other sources, base flood elevation data shall be provided by the
permit applicant for subdivision proposals and other proposed
developments (including proposals for manufactured home and
recreational vehicle parks and subdivisions) that are greater than
either 50 lots or five acres.
D. Duties and responsibilities of local administrator. Duties of the local
administrator shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
(1) Permit application review. The local administrator shall conduct the
following permit application review before issuing a floodplain
development permit:
(a) Review all applications for completeness, particularly with the
requirements of Subsection C, Application for permit, and for
compliance with the provisions and standards of this article.
(b) Review subdivision and other proposed new development,
including manufactured home parks, to determine whether
proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If
a proposed building site is located in an area of special flood
hazard, all new construction and substantial improvements
shall meet the applicable standards of § 56-148, Construction
standards, and, in particular, § 56-148B, Subdivision proposals.
(c) Determine whether any proposed development in an area of
special flood hazard may result in physical damage to any other
property (e.g., stream bank erosion and increased flood
velocities). The local administrator may require the applicant
to submit additional technical analyses and data necessary to
complete the determination. If the proposed development may
result in physical damage to any other property or fails to meet
the requirements of § 56-148, Construction standards, no
permit shall be issued. The applicant may revise the
application to include measures that mitigate or eliminate the
adverse effects and resubmit the application.
(d) Determine that all necessary permits have been received from
those governmental agencies from which approval is required
by state or federal law.
§ 56-147 YONKERS CODE § 56-147
C:1324
(2) Use of other flood data.
(a) When the Federal Emergency Management Agency has
designated areas of special flood hazard on the community's
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) but has neither produced
water surface elevation data (these areas are designated Zone
A or V on the FIRM) nor identified a floodway, the local
administrator shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any
base flood elevation and floodway data available from a
federal, state or other source, including data developed
pursuant to § 56-147C(7), as criteria for requiring that new
construction, substantial improvements or other proposed
development meet the requirements of this article.
(b) When base flood elevation data are not available, the local
administrator may use flood information from any other
authoritative source, such as historical data, to establish flood
elevations within the areas of special flood hazard, for the
purposes of this article.
(3) Alteration of watercourses:
(a) Notification to adjacent communities and the New York State
Department of Environmental Conservation prior to permitting
any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submittal of
evidence of such notification to the Regional Director, Region
II, Federal Emergency Management Agency.
(b) Determine that the permit holder has provided for
maintenance within the altered or relocated portion of said
watercourse so that the flood-carrying capacity is not
diminished.
(4) Construction stage.
(a) In Zones A1-A30, AE and AH, and also Zone A if base flood
elevation data are available, upon placement of the lowest floor
or completion of floodproofing of a new or substantially
improved structure, obtain from the permit holder a
certification of the as-built elevation of the lowest floor or
floodproofed elevation, in relation to mean sea level. The
certificate shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision
of a licensed land surveyor or professional engineer and
certified by same. For manufactured homes, the permit holder
shall submit the certificate of elevation upon placement of the
structure on the site. A certificate of elevation must also be
submitted for a recreational vehicle if it remains on a site for
180 consecutive days or longer (unless it is fully licensed and
ready for highway use).
(b) Any further work undertaken prior to submission and approval
of the certification shall be at the permit holder's risk. The local
§ 56-147 CHARTER § 56-147
C:1325
administrator shall review all data submitted. Deficiencies
detected shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the
project unless immediately corrected.
(5) Inspections. The local administrator and/or the developer's
engineer or architect shall make periodic inspections at
appropriate times throughout the period of construction in order to
monitor compliance with permit conditions and enable said
inspector to certify, if requested, that the development is in
compliance with the requirements of the floodplain development
permit and/or any variance provisions.
(6) Stop-work orders.
(a) The local administrator shall issue, or cause to be issued, a
stop-work order for any floodplain development found ongoing
without a development permit. Disregard of a stop-work order
shall subject the violator to the penalties described in
§ 56-146E of this article.
(b) The local administrator shall issue, or cause to be issued, a
stop-work order for any floodplain development found

in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing
structures constructed below the base flood level, provided the
items in § 56-149A(4)(a) through (l) have been fully considered. As
the lot size increases beyond the 1/2 acre, the technical
justification required for issuing the variance increases.
(2) Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon determination that:
(a) The proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure's continued designation as an historic structure.
(b) The variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic
character and design of the structure.
(3) Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and
substantial improvements and for other development necessary for
the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided that:
(a) The criteria of Subsection B(1), (4), (5) and (6) of this section
are met;
(b) The structure or other development is protected by methods
that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create
no additional threat to public safety.

§ 56-150. through § 56-161. (Reserved)
(4) Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would
result.
(5) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard,
to afford relief.
(6) Variances shall only be issued upon receiving written justification
of:
(a) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
(b) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
(c) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
or extraordinary public expense; create nuisances cause fraud
on or victimization of the public; or conflict with existing local
laws or ordinances.
(7) Notification.
(a) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted for a building with
the lowest floor below the base flood elevation shall be given
written notice over the signature of a community official that:
[1] The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below
the base flood level will result in increased premium rates
for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100
of insurance coverage; and
[2] Such construction below the base flood level increases
risks to life and property.
(b) Such notification shall be maintained with the record of all
variance actions as required in § 56-147D(8) of this article.

ARTICLE XIV
Floodway and Floodway-Fringe Area Control
§ 56-162. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the following
meanings, unless the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
CHANNEL  A natural or artificial watercourse of perceptible extent, with
a definite bed and banks to confine and conduct continuously or periodically
flowing water. Channel flow is that water which is following in a defined
"channel."
DEVELOPMENT  Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real
estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining,
dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations.
FLOOD  A temporary rise in a stream's flow or stage that results in water
overlapping its banks and inundating areas adjacent to the channel or an
unusual and rapid accumulation of runoff or surface water from any source.
FLOOD ELEVATION DETERMINATION  A determination of the water
surface elevations of the one-hundred-year flood, that is, the level of
flooding that has a one-percent chance of occurrence in any given year.
FLOODPROOFING  Any combination of structural and nonstructural
additions, changes or adjustments to structures, including utility and
sanitary facilities, which would preclude the entry water. Structural
components shall have the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy.
FLOODWAY  The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent
portion of the floodplain that must be reserved in order to discharge the
one-hundred-year flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface
elevation more than one foot at any point, assuming equal conveyance
reduction outside the channel from the two sides of the floodplain. The same
is delineated on the Flood Insurance Rate Map of the City as A Zones and V
Zones.
MANUFACTURED HOME  A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with
or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities.
It does not include park trailers, travel trailers and other similar vehicles.
MANUFACTURED HOME PARK SUBDIVISION  A parcel of land which
has been divided into two or more lots for rent or sale and the placement of
mobile homes.
MUNICIPAL PERMIT  Any permit, grants or licenses issued by the City of
Yonkers, including but not limited to building, grading, demolition, clearing
and excavation permits and subdivision and site plan approvals.
ONE-HUNDRED-YEAR FLOOD  The base flood having a one-percent
chance of annual occurrence as shown on the official plan map.
§ 56-162 CHARTER § 56-162
C:1335
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT  Any repair, reconstruction or
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of the
market value of the structure either before the improvement is started or, if
the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage
occurred. For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement"
is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor
or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that
alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does
not, however, include any alteration to comply with existing state or local
health, sanitary, building or safety codes or regulations.
§ 56-163. General provisions.
A. Lands to which article applies. This article shall apply to all lands within
the jurisdiction of the City identified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map
of the City of Yonkers as either Floodway Districts (A Zones and V
Zones) or Floodway-Fringe Districts (B Zone). In all areas covered by
this article, no development shall be permitted except upon a permit to
develop, granted by the City as provided herein.
B. Enforcement officer. The Commissioner of the Department of Housing
and Buildings of the City is hereby designated as the enforcement
officer under this article. [Amended 7-18-1996 by L.L. No. 5-1996]
C. Rules for interpretation of district boundaries. The boundaries of the
Floodway and Floodway-Fringe Districts shall be determined by scaling
distances on the Flood Insurance Rate Map of the City of Yonkers.
Where interpretation is needed to the exact location of the boundaries
of the districts as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map of the City of
Yonkers, as for example where there appears to be a conflict between a
mapped boundary and actual field conditions, the enforcement officer
shall make the necessary interpretation. In such cases where the
interpretation is contested, the Board of Zoning Appeals will resolve the
dispute. The elevation for the location in question shall be the
governing factor in locating the district boundary on the land. The
person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to present his case to the Board and to submit
his own technical evidence, if he so desires.
D. Compliance. No development located within known flood hazard areas
of this City shall be located, extended, converted or structurally altered
without full compliance with the terms of this article and other
applicable regulations.
E. Abrogation and greater restrictions. It is not intended by this article to
repeal any existing additional restrictions imposed by ordinance.
However, where this article imposes greater restrictions, the provisions
of this article shall prevail.
F. Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of
this article shall be held to be minimum requirements.
§ 56-162 YONKERS CODE § 56-163
C:1336
§ 56-164. Development permit.
G. Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection
required by this article is considered reasonable for regulatory
purposes. Larger floods may occur or the flood height may be increased
by man-made or natural causes, such as ice jams, bridge openings
restricted by debris and unforeseen events. This article does not imply
that areas outside Floodway and Floodway-Fringe District boundaries
will be free from flooding or flood damages. This article shall not create
any warranty or guaranty whatsoever on the part of the City or any
officer or employee thereof.
H. Appeal. Where a request for a permit to develop is denied by the
enforcement officer, the applicant may apply for such permit to the
Zoning Board of Appeals. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall set a date
for a hearing, give notice and proceed as provided by ordinance for
hearing appeals.
A. Permit required. No persons, firm or corporation shall start any
development, building, structure or other substantial improvement or
cause the same to be done without first obtaining a separate permit for
each such development.
B. Administration. The Commissioner of the Department of Housing and
Buildings or his duly authorized representative shall administer and
implement the provisions of this article. These duties shall include but
not be limited to: [Amended 7-18-1996 by L.L. No. 5-1996]
(1) Review all development permits to assure that sites are reasonably
safe from flooding and that the requirements of this article have
been satisfied.
(2) Review permits for proposed development to assure that all
necessary permits have been obtained from those federal, state and
local governmental agencies from which prior approval is required.
(3) Notify adjacent communities and the Division of Water Resources
of the state prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse
and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Insurance
Administration.
(4) Assure that maintenance is provided within the altered or relocated
portion of said watercourse so that the flood-carrying capacity is
not diminished.
(5) Verify and record the actual elevation, in relation to mean sea level,
of the lowest floor, including the basement, of all new or
substantially improved structures.
(6) Verify and record the actual elevation, in relation to mean sea level,
to which the new or substantially improved structures have been
floodproofed.

ARTICLE XVI
Stormwater Management and Erosion and Sediment Control
[Added 12-11-2007 by L.L. No. 12-2007]
§ 56-174. Findings of fact.
It is hereby determined that:
§ 56-175. Purpose.
The purpose of this article and Article XVII of Chapter 43, Zoning, is
to establish minimum stormwater management requirements and controls
to protect and safeguard the general health, safety, and welfare of the
A. Land development activities and associated increases in site impervious
cover often alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and
increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding, stream
channel erosion, or sediment transport and deposition;
B. This stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of
waterborne pollutants, including siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and
other desirable species;
C. Clearing and grading during construction tends to increase soil erosion
and add to the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and
aquatic habitat;
D. Improper design and construction of stormwater management
practices can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff, thereby
increasing stream bank erosion and sedimentation;
E. Impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil, thereby
decreasing groundwater recharge and stream base flow;
F. Substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts on
the waters of the municipality;
G. Stormwater runoff, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be
controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff
from land development activities;
H. The regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development
activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater
runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion, stream, channel erosion, and
nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the
public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety.
I. Regulation of land development activities by means of performance
standards governing stormwater management and site design will
produce development compatible with the natural functions of a
particular site or an entire watershed and thereby mitigate the adverse
effects of erosion and sedimentation from development.
§ 56-174 CHARTER § 56-175
C:1347
public residing within this jurisdiction and to address the findings of fact in
§ 56-174 hereof. This article and Article XVII of Chapter 43, Zoning, seeks
to meet those purposes by achieving the following objectives:

General Permit for Stormwater Discharges from Municipal Separate
Stormwater Sewer Systems (MS4s), Permit No. GP-02-02, or as
amended or revised;
B. Require land development activities to conform to the substantive
requirements of the NYS Department of Environmental Conservation
State Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (SPDES) General Permit
for Construction Activities GP-02-01 or as amended or revised;
C. Minimize increases in stormwater runoff from land development
activities in order to reduce flooding, siltation, increases in stream
temperature, and streambank erosion and maintain the integrity of
stream channels;
D. Minimize increases in pollution caused by stormwater runoff from land
development activities which would otherwise degrade local water
quality;
E. Minimize the total annual volume of stormwater runoff which flows
from any specific site during and following development to the
maximum extent practicable; and
F. Reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion and nonpoint
source pollution, wherever possible, through stormwater management
practices and to ensure that these management practices are properly
maintained and eliminate threats to public safety.
A. The municipality shall designate a Stormwater Management Officer
who shall accept and review all stormwater pollution prevention plans
and forward such plans to the applicable municipal board. The
Stormwater Management Officer may review the plans; upon approval
by the City Council engage the services of a registered professional
engineer to review the plans, specifications and related documents, at a
cost not to exceed a fee schedule established by said governing board;
or accept the certification of a licensed professional that the plans
conform to the requirements of this article and Article XVII of Chapter
43, Zoning.
B. All land development activities subject to review and approval by the
Planning Board of the City of Yonkers under (subdivision, site plan, and/

years. The purpose behind this article is to establish a program for
identifying and registering vacant buildings; to determine the
responsibilities of owners of vacant buildings and structures; and to speed
the rehabilitation of the vacant properties. It is the further intent of this City
Council that condominiums are exempt from coverage of this legislation.

Salvia Divinorum
[Adopted 3-22-2011 by L.L. No. 4-2011]
§ 71-5. Legislative intent.
A. The City Council of the City of Yonkers hereby intends to exercise its
powers to protect the health and safety of its residents, and in
particular its younger and most vulnerable residents, from the
increasing number of dangerous substances that are readily available.
B. This City Council hereby finds and determines that Salvia divinorum,
also known as "Salvia," "Diviner's Sage" or "Maria Pastora," or other
names is a powerful psychoactive herb which can be smoked or chewed
to produce hallucinogenic effects or visionary states.
C. This City Council also finds that Salvia divinorum like marijuana can be
smoked to produce a state of intoxication. Users have reported that
salvia produces hallucinations that reportedly can be more powerful
than LSD.
D. This City Council also finds and determines that Salvia divinorum is
native to the area of southern Mexico, and has historically been utilized
for its medicinal properties. In recent years, with the help of the
Internet, the leaves of Salvia divinorum, or the entire plant, have
become available almost anywhere in the United States.
E. This City Council further finds and determines that recent media
reports have uncovered that Salvia divinorum is being abused by
individuals, especially teenage children, in order to self-medicate for
depression.
F. This City Council finds that the parents of a Delaware student are
currently suing a distributor of Salvia divinorum, claiming that their
son's use of Salvia divinorum was the cause of his depression which is
alleged to have eventually resulted in his death by suicide.
G. This City Council determines that the long-term effects of Salvia
divinorum are unknown, but it has been shown to cause dysphoria in
humans, which, in the context of an underlying mood disorder, indicates
a heightened risk of suicide.
H. This City Council also finds that several states, and many countries
across the world, are taking action to try to curb the abuse of Salvia
divinorum, especially by younger children, in order to prevent any harm
as a result of its use.
I. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to prohibit the possession,
distribution and sale of Salvia divinorum in the City of Yonkers.

GRAFFITI

It has become apparent that the use of pens, writing and artistic devices,
spray cans and marking devices used in connection with the writing of
graffiti on walls and other places of public buildings and public property has
reached significant levels and proportions that immediate local attention
should be given this matter by this municipality. The defacing of such public
property and the use of foul language in many of the writings is harmful to
the general public and violative of the good and welfare of the citizens and

any person guilty of writing graffiti on public buildings and public property
shall be punished so that the punishment shall fit the crime.
§ 72-2. Permission required to write on property.

and -operated property and in the City public schools, with the
possession and/or use of guns, firearms and weapons or attachments to
electronic devices which are a replica of and cannot be easily
distinguished from actual guns, firearms and weapons. The possession
and, at times, use by simply displaying one of these imitation and/or
inoperable guns, firearms and weapons or attachments to electronic
devices has caused damage to life, limb and property in the City of
Yonkers since the Penal Law of the State of New York does not extend
its coverage to this area. Through the exercise of the police power
granted to municipal governments and in order to afford the residents
of the City of Yonkers greater safety and to protect their general
welfare from individuals, both adults and juveniles are prohibited from
using imitation, toy and inoperable pistols, revolvers, guns and other
weapons or attachments to electronic devices of any type that may be
readily mistaken for real guns, pistols, revolvers or weapons which are
used or could be usable for nefarious purposes or as threats or potential
threats to life, limb and property.
B. This section is not intended to forbid or restrict the sale, possession or
use of true and actual toy pistols, guns, revolvers or other weapons or
attachments to electronic devices, provided that the same are not
substantial duplicates of actual pistols, guns, revolvers or weapons in
appearance.
C. It shall be unlawful for any person to possess or use or attempt to use
any imitation, toy or inoperable pistol, revolver, gun, firearm or any
other weapon or attachments to electronic devices which substantially
duplicates an actual pistol, revolver, gun, firearm or other weapon
unless said imitation, toy or inoperable item or instrument shall be
colored in colors other than blue, black, grays, silver or aluminum, or is
marked with a nonremovable orange stripe which is at least one inch in
width and runs the entire length of the barrel on each side and the front
end of the barrel and along and around the handle of the gun, and
further provided, if resembling a gun or other firearm, that the barrel of
said item shall be closed with the same material of which the item itself
is made for a distance of not less than 1/2 inch from the front end of the
barrel of said item.
D. The provisions of Subsection C shall not apply to possession or display
of such an instrument by a licensed manufacturer or dealer of the same,
used solely in connection with his or her business. Further, any said
instrumentalities used in theatrical productions licensed in advance by
the City of Yonkers shall also be exempted when possessed, displayed
and used in connection with said licensed theatrical productions.

attachment to an electronic device which substantially duplicates an
actual pistol, revolver, gun, firearm or other weapon as described

F. If any clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivision, section, or part of this
section or the application thereof to any person, individual, corporation,
firm, partnership, entity, or circumstance shall be adjudged by any
court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unconstitutional, such
order or judgment shall not affect, impair, or invalidate the remainder
thereof, but shall be confined in its operation to the clause, sentence,
paragraph, subdivision, section, or part of this section, or in its
application to the person, individual, corporation, firm, partnership,
entity, or circumstance directly involved in the controversy in which

Public Nuisance Abatement
[Adopted 9-28-2010 by L.L. No. 5-2010366]
§ 75-22. Legislative findings; purpose.

of property in flagrant violation of the penal laws relating to controlled
substances, dangerous drugs, prostitution, stolen property and illegal use
or possession of weapons, as well as other provisions of state and local law,

public in the quality of life and total community environment, commerce in
the City, property values and the public health, safety and welfare. The City
Council further finds that the occurrence of such activities and violations is
detrimental to the health, safety and welfare of the City of Yonkers and of
the businesses thereof and visitors thereto. It is the purpose of this article
to authorize and empower the Police Commissioner to impose sanctions
and penalties for such public nuisances, and such powers may be exercised
either in conjunction with or apart from the powers contained in other

penalties imposed by the Commissioner pursuant to this article constitute
an additional and appropriate method of law enforcement in response to
the proliferation of the above-described public nuisances. These sanctions
and penalties are reasonable and necessary in order to protect the health
and safety of the people of the City of Yonkers and to promote the general
welfare.

Law shall receive notice at the time of arrest or summonsing on such
charge and by certified mail, return receipt requested, as soon thereafter as

the City of any vehicle, as such term is defined in Subdivision 14 of
§ 10.00 of the Penal Law, when such vehicle is operated or used by a
person who is arrested or issued a summons by any police officer of the

motor vehicle or other speed contest or exhibition of speed on a
highway as prohibited by § 1182 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law and such
person is convicted or pleads guilty to any offense arising out of such
arrest or summons. In order to establish its case in any action
commenced under this subsection, the City shall demonstrate, by a
preponderance of the evidence in the civil forfeiture proceeding, that
such person engaged in or aided or abetted in any motor vehicle or
other speed contest or exhibition of speed on a highway as prohibited

be commenced in the County of Westchester within 60 days after such
person has been convicted of any subdivision of § 1182 of the Vehicle
and Traffic Law, if brought pursuant to Subsection A of this section, or

also be provided to any lienholder. Notice pursuant to this section shall
be to the address recorded with the Department of Motor Vehicles of New
York State or any other state, territory, district, province, nation or other
jurisdiction, by certified mail, return receipt requested. The procedures set
forth in Chapter 109 of the Code of the City of Yonkers with respect to
impoundment, towing, storage and release of vehicles shall apply whenever
a person has been arrested for an offense under § 1182 of the Vehicle and
Traffic Law.
§ 85-3. Notice to City of owner's intention to transfer ownership or
possession of vehicle.
A. The owner of a vehicle subject to forfeiture pursuant to this article must
notify the City of any intention to transfer ownership or possession of
such vehicle, no later than 15 days prior to such transfer. Notice
provided pursuant to § 85-2 shall set forth the time and manner and
procedures for such notification to the City. The provisions of this
section shall remain in effect until the resolution of the forfeiture
proceeding; provided, however, that the notice requirement herein
shall expire as follows:
(1) If the vehicle may be subject to forfeiture pursuant to Subsection A
of § 85-1 of this chapter: (a) on the 61st day after any conviction of
any offense arising out of an arrest or summons for an offense
under § 1182 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law, in the event that the
City has not commenced a forfeiture proceeding pursuant to this
article prior to such day; or (b) on the day that the criminal action
or proceeding against the person arrested or summonsed for
violation of any provision of § 1182 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law is
terminated in favor of such person without a conviction, as set forth
in Subdivision 3 of § 160.50 of the Criminal Procedure Law.
B. Applicability.
(1) Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect the ability of an
entity that leases vehicles or a lienholder to exercise its lawful
rights to obtain possession of a vehicle under a contract or
applicable law.
(2) In the event of a transfer of title or possession pursuant to
Subsection B(1) of this subsection, the person or entity that affects
such transfer shall provide notice to the City of its action as soon as
practicable and in no event later than 72 hours subsequent to such
action.
C. A person who transfers title or possession of a vehicle without providing
notice to the City as required by this section shall be subject, upon a
judgment that the vehicle shall be forfeited, to a penalty in the amount
of $1,500 in addition to the fair market value of the vehicle at the time
of the arrest. Evidence of such fair market value may be established

with reference to publications such as, but not limited to, Kelley Blue
Book or NADA guide.
A. Upon receiving notification pursuant to § 85-3, the City may apply for a
court order, either prior to or subsequent to the commencement of the
civil forfeiture proceeding, to ensure that the vehicle remains available
pending the outcome of the civil forfeiture proceeding pursuant to this
chapter. In such an application, the City may request appropriate
measures including, but not limited to, an order of the court restraining
the transfer of title or possession of such vehicle, retention by the City
of the vehicle pending the outcome of the forfeiture proceeding, or a
bond in the amount of $1,500 plus the fair market value of the vehicle at
the time of the arrest, to be determined as set forth in Subsection C of
§ 85-3.
B. If a person is arrested or summonsed by any police officer of the
Yonkers Police Department for an offense under § 1182 of the Vehicle
and Traffic Law and such person is not convicted or does not plead
guilty to any offense arising out of such arrest or summons, any vehicle
retained pursuant to Subsection A of this section will be returned to him
or her, or in the event that another person has a superior right of
possession in such property, to such other person.
A. It shall be an affirmative defense to an action brought pursuant to this
article that the owner of the vehicle, other than the person arrested or
summonsed for an offense under § 1182 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law,
did not have actual or constructive knowledge that the vehicle would be
used or operated in violation of any such offenses or that the owner took
reasonable steps to prevent use of the vehicle by the person arrested or
summonsed.
B. Subject to the provisions of Subsection A of this section, the interest of
a lienholder in such vehicle shall not be subject to forfeiture pursuant to
this article; provided, however, that this provision shall not be
construed to entitle a lienholder to more than the outstanding balance
of the lien. For purposes of this subsection, the term "lienholder" shall
mean any person, corporation, partnership, firm, agency, association or
other entity who at the time of an arrest or summonsing pursuant to
this article has a financial interest recorded as a lien with the
Department of Motor Vehicles of New York State or any other state,
territory, district, province, nation or other jurisdiction, except that
"lienholder" shall not mean an entity that leases vehicles pursuant to a
written agreement subject to the New York State Personal Property
Law or the Uniform Commercial Code. Nothing in this provision shall
be construed to prevent a lienholder whose lien is not so recorded from
intervening in any action or proceeding under this article.

C:1659
§ 85-6. Hardship relief.
Following a determination by the court pursuant to this chapter that a
vehicle shall be forfeited, an owner may make a motion to the court for
relief from such determination. Such motion shall be made on notice to
the City. In order to obtain such relief, the owner must submit evidence
which establishes that the loss of the vehicle would cause a substantial
and unwarranted hardship because the owner has no reasonable access
to public transportation and to the use of another vehicle and lacks the
financial resources to purchase or lease another vehicle and that possession
of a vehicle is a necessary incident to his or her employment, business,
trade, occupation or profession; or to his or her travel to and from a class or
course at an accredited school, college or university or at a state approved
institution of vocational or technical training; or necessary to travel to
and from a necessary medical examination or necessary medical treatment
for such owner or a member of his or her household. Upon satisfactory
demonstration of these factors to the court, the court may grant relief from
the forfeiture determination upon such terms and conditions as will provide
maximum protection to the public safety, which may include, but not be
limited to, installation of an ignition interlock device in such vehicle.
§ 85-7. Settlement of claims.
Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, the Corporation
Counsel shall be empowered to compromise, settle, or adjust rights, claims,
demands or causes of action in favor of or against the City arising under
this chapter.
§ 85-8. Disposition of forfeited vehicles.
A. After a judicial determination of forfeiture, the Yonkers Police
Department shall effect seizure of the vehicle, if such vehicle has not
already been retained by the City pursuant to § 85-4 of this chapter,
unless relief from such judicial determination by the court pursuant to
§ 85-6 of this article would prevent such seizure, or the Corporation
Counsel has otherwise compromised, settled or adjusted the matter
pursuant to § 85-7 of this chapter, in a manner that renders such seizure
unnecessary. Following such seizure, the Yonkers Police Department
shall either:
(1) Retain such seized vehicle for the official use of its office, division
or department; or
(2) Transfer such seized vehicle to any City agency, department, board
or commission demonstrating need for such seized vehicle, so that
such seized vehicle may be put into official use by that agency,
department, board or commission; or
(3) Transfer such seized vehicle to any City-funded agency or
organization demonstrating need for such seized vehicle, so that
such seized vehicle may be put into use by the funded agency or

City Council on the enforcement of this article for the previous year. Such
report shall include appropriate statistical analysis and comment.
§ 85-11. Severability.
If any clause, sentence, subparagraph, subsection or section of this chapter
shall be held invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction, or the
application of this chapter to any person or set of circumstances shall
be held invalid, such invalidity or judgment shall not affect, impair, or

chapter directly involved in the controversy in which the judgment shall
have been rendered. To further this end, the provisions of this chapter are
hereby declared to be severable.

a part ownership or security interest, and who did not expressly or
impliedly permit the violation of law for which the truck or vehicle
was impounded and did not knowingly obtain an interest in the
truck or vehicle to avoid forfeiture, shall be entitled to payment for
his or her interest in such truck or vehicle in the course of a
forfeiture action brought pursuant to this section, after intervening
in such action in accordance with the Civil Practice Law and Rules.
In such action, awards to one or more persons in satisfaction of
such persons' interest in the forfeited dump truck or other vehicle

A. Legislative intent. The City of Yonkers hereby finds and determines that
littering within the City is a threat to the health, well-being and safety
of the residents of the City of Yonkers. As a result, the City has
determined to utilize any permissible technological means available to
reduce the incidence of littering. Therefore, the City has established a
policy and procedure set forth in this article to impose liability on the
owner of a vehicle in any instance where the image of the operator or
occupant of such vehicle is captured digitally or otherwise recorded
384. Editor's Note: For enforcement procedures for this chapter see Ch. 91, Garbage and
Refuse, Art. VI, Enforcement Procedures.
385. Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code; see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I.
§ 93-10 YONKERS CODE § 93-15
C:1698
throwing or depositing litter from such vehicle upon any street or other
public place within the City or upon private property.
B. Statement of authority. This article is authorized by the New York State
Constitution, the provisions of the New York Municipal Home Rule Law,
the relevant provisions of the Second Class Cities Law of the State of
New York, and the general police power vested with the City of Yonkers
to promote the health, safety and welfare of all residents and property
owners in the City.
C. Owner liability. The owner of a vehicle shall be liable for a civil penalty
imposed pursuant to this article if such vehicle is used or operated with
the permission of the owner; express or implied, in any instance where
a recorded image is obtained showing the operator or occupant
throwing or depositing litter from such vehicle upon any street or other
public place within the City of Yonkers or upon private property.
D. Notice of liability. A notice of liability shall be sent by the Commissioner
by first class mail to each person alleged to be liable as an owner of a
vehicle in violation of Article II of Chapter 93 of the Code of the City of
Yonkers, entitled "Recorded Images Violations." A notice of liability
shall contain the name and address of the person to be liable for the
violation as the owner; the registration of the vehicle involved in such
violation, the location where the violation occurred, the date and time
of such violation. Further, the notice of liability shall advise the person
charged of the court or tribunal having jurisdiction to adjudicate the
liability of the violation and the time in which he or she may contest the
liability alleged in the notice and that a failure to contest the notice in
the manner and time proscribed shall be deemed an admission of
liability.
E. Certificate as prima facie evidence. A certificate sworn to or affirmed by
the Commissioner primarily responsible for enforcing the provisions of
this chapter based upon a review of the recorded images shall be prima
facie evidence of the facts contained therein. Any recorded images shall
be available for inspection in any proceeding commenced in a court of
competent jurisdiction to adjudicate the liability of such violation.
F. Indemnification. If the owner of a vehicle liable for the civil penalty
imposed in accordance with this section was not the operator or
occupant of the vehicle at the time of violation, the owner may maintain
an action for indemnification against the operator or occupant for any
civil penalties paid as well as any costs, disbursements or attorney's
fees assessed against the owner.
G. Defenses.
(1) An owner shall have a valid defense to an allegation of liability
under this section if the vehicle in question had been reported to a
police department or agency as stolen prior to the time the
violation occurred, and had not been recovered by the time the
violation occurred. For the purposes of asserting this defense, it
§ 93-15 CHARTER § 93-15
C:1699
Chapter 94
LANDFILL PROJECTS
shall be sufficient that a certified copy of the police report on the
stolen vehicle be sent by first class mail to the court or tribunal
having jurisdiction to adjudicate the liability of the violation.
(2) An owner who is a lessor of a vehicle to which a notice of liability is
issued shall not be liable for the violation, provided that he or she
sends to the court or tribunal having jurisdiction to adjudicate the
liability of the violation a copy of the rental, lease or other such
contract covering such vehicle on the day of the violation, with the
name and address of the lessee clearly legible, within 30 days after
receiving notice of such violation. Failure to send such information
within the 30 days shall render the owner liable for the penalty
prescribed in this chapter. When the lessor complies with the
provisions of this subsection, the lessee of such vehicle on the date
of the violation shall be deemed to be the owner of such vehicle for
the purposes of this article.
(3) No owner of a vehicle shall be subject to a monetary fine under this
chapter if the operator of such vehicle was operating the vehicle
without the consent of the owner at the time of the violation.
However, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the operator
of such vehicle was operating the vehicle with the consent of the
owner at the time the violation occurred.
H. Nothing in this section shall preclude the Commissioner or any other
code or law enforcement officer from taking such other action in
connection with violations of any other applicable rules, regulations,
statutes or laws.
I. Any violation of this section shall constitute a Class II offense.

C:1728
§ 96-47. Use of best management practices; individual sewage
treatment systems.
contributes to violations of the municipality's MS4 SPDES permit
authorization.
A. Best management practices. Where the SMO has identified illicit
discharges as defined in § 96-40 or activities contaminating stormwater
as defined in § 96-46, the municipality may require implementation of
best management practices (BMPs) to control those illicit discharges
and activities.
(1) The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment
shall provide, at his or her own expense, reasonable protection
from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes
into the MS4 through the use of structural and nonstructural
BMPs.
(2) Any person responsible for a property or premises which is, or may
be, the source of an illicit discharge as defined in § 96-40 or an
activity contaminating stormwater as defined in § 96-46 may be
required to implement, at said person's expense, additional
structural and nonstructural BMPs to reduce or eliminate the
source of pollutant(s) to the MS4.
(3) Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid SPDES permit
authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial
activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with
the provisions of this section.
B. Individual sewage treatment systems; response to special conditions
requiring no increase of pollutants or requiring a reduction of
pollutants. Where individual sewage treatment systems are
contributing to the municipality's being subject to the special
conditions as defined in § 96-40 of this article, the owner or operator of
such individual sewage treatment systems shall be required to:
(1) Maintain and operate individual sewage treatment systems as
follows:
(a) Inspect the septic tank annually to determine scum and sludge
accumulation. Septic tanks must be pumped out whenever the
bottom of the scum layer is within three inches of the bottom of
the outlet baffle or sanitary tee or the top of the sludge is
within 10 inches of the bottom of the outlet baffle or sanitary
tee.
(b) Avoid the use of septic tank additives.
(c) Avoid the disposal of excessive quantities of detergents,
kitchen wastes, laundry wastes, and household chemicals.

involves:
[1] Relocating or extending an absorption area to a location
not previously approved for such.
[2] Installation of a new subsurface treatment system at the
same location.
[3] Use of alternate system or innovative system design or
technology.
(c) A written certificate of compliance shall be submitted by the
design professional to the municipality at the completion of
construction of the repair or replacement system.
A. The SMO may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a
person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or
threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and
substantial danger to the environment, to the health or welfare of
persons, or to the MS4. The SMO shall notify the person of such
suspension within a reasonable time thereafter, in writing, of the
reasons for the suspension. If the violator fails to comply with a
suspension order issued in an emergency, the SMO may take such steps
as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or to
minimize danger to persons.
B. Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person
discharging to the municipality's MS4 in violation of this article may
have his or her MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate
or reduce an illicit discharge. The SMO will notify a violator, in writing,
of the proposed termination of its MS4 access and the reasons therefor.
The violator may petition the SMO for a reconsideration and hearing.
Access may be granted by the SMO if he/she finds that the illicit
discharge has ceased and the discharger has taken steps to prevent its
recurrence. Access may be denied if the SMO determines, in writing,
that the illicit discharge has not ceased or is likely to recur. A person
commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises
terminated pursuant to this section without the prior approval of the
SMO.
§ 96-47 YONKERS CODE § 96-49
C:1730
§ 96-49. Industrial or construction activity discharges.
Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity SPDES
stormwater discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such
permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form
acceptable to the City prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4.
§ 96-50. Access to facilities; monitoring of discharges.
A. Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that the SMO must
inspect to enforce any provision of this article, or whenever the
authorized enforcement agency has cause to believe that there exists,
or potentially exists, in or upon any premises any condition which
constitutes a violation of this article.
B. Access to facilities. The SMO shall be permitted to enter and inspect
facilities subject to regulation under this article as often as may be
necessary to determine compliance with this article. If a discharger has
security measures in force which require proper identification and
clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the
necessary arrangements to allow access to the SMO.
C. Facility operators shall allow the SMO ready access to all parts of the
premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and
copying of records as may be required to implement this article.
D. The City shall have the right to set up on any facility subject to this
article such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the SMO to
conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's stormwater
discharge.
E. The City has the right to require the facilities subject to this article to
install monitoring equipment as is reasonably necessary to determine
compliance with this article. The facility's sampling and monitoring
equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper
operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices
used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to
ensure their accuracy.
F. Unreasonable delays in allowing the City access to a facility subject to
this article is a violation of this article. A person who is the operator of a
facility subject to this article commits an offense if the person denies
the City reasonable access to the facility for the purpose of conducting
any activity authorized or required by this article.
G. If the SMO has been refused access to any part of the premises from
which stormwater is discharged, and he/she is able to demonstrate
probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this article, or
that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine
inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with
this article or any order issued hereunder, then the SMO may seek
issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.
§ 96-49 CHARTER § 96-51
C:1731
§ 96-51. Notification of spills.
Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person
responsible for a facility or operation or responsible for emergency
response for a facility or operation has information of any known or
suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal
discharges or pollutants discharging into the MS4, said person shall take all
necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such
release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials said person
shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence
via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of nonhazardous
materials, said person shall notify the municipality, in person or by
telephone or facsimile, no later than the next business day. Notifications
in person or by telephone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed
and mailed to the municipality within three business days of the telephone
notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial
or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment
shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions
taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least
three years.
§ 96-52. Enforcement; penalties for offenses.
A. Notice of violation. When the City's SMO finds that a person has
violated a prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this article, he/
she may order compliance by written notice of violation to the
responsible person.
(1) Such notice may require, without limitation:
(a) The elimination of illicit connections or discharges;
(b) That violating discharges, practices, or operations shall cease
and desist;
(c) The abatement or remediation of stormwater pollution or
contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected
property;
(d) The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting;
(e) Payment of a fine; and
(f) The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs.
(2) If abatement of a violation and/or restoration of affected property is
required, the notice shall set forth a deadline within which such
remediation or restoration must be completed. Said notice shall
further advise that, should the violator fail to remediate or restore
within the established deadline, the work will be done by a
designated governmental agency or a contractor and the expense
thereof shall be charged to the violator.
§ 96-51 YONKERS CODE § 96-52
C:1732
§ 96-53. Appeal of notice of violation.
Any person receiving a notice of violation may appeal the determination of
the SMO to the Department of Engineering of the City of Yonkers within 15
days of its issuance, which Department shall hear the appeal within 30 days
after the filing of the appeal and, within five days of making its decision, file
its decision in the office of the City Clerk and mail a copy of its decision by
registered mail to the discharger.
§ 96-54. Corrective measures after appeal.
§ 96-55. Injunctive relief.
It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any provision or fail to comply
with any of the requirements of this article. If a person has violated or
continues to violate the provisions of this article, the SMO may petition for
a preliminary or permanent injunction restraining the person from activities
B. Penalties. In addition to or as an alternative to any penalty provided
herein or by law, any person who violates the provisions of this article
shall be guilty of a violation punishable by a fine not exceeding $350 or
imprisonment for a period not to exceed six months, or both, for
conviction of a first offense; for conviction of a second offense both of
which were committed within a period of five years, punishable by a
fine not less than $350 nor more than $700 or imprisonment for a
period not to exceed six months, or both; and upon conviction for a third
or subsequent offense all of which were committed within a period of
five years, punishable by a fine not less than $700 nor more than $1,000
or imprisonment for a period not to exceed six months, or both.
However, for the purposes of conferring jurisdiction upon courts and
judicial officers generally, violations of this article shall be deemed
misdemeanors, and, for such purpose only, all provisions of law relating
to misdemeanors shall apply to such violations. Each week's continued
violation shall constitute a separate additional violation.
A. If the violation has not been corrected pursuant to the requirements set
forth in the notice of violation or, in the event of an appeal, within five
business days of the decision of the City upholding the decision of the
SMO, then the SMO shall request the owner's permission for access to
the subject private property to take any and all measures reasonably
necessary to abate the violation and/or restore the property.
B. If refused access to the subject private property, the SMO may seek a
warrant in a court of competent jurisdiction to be authorized to enter
upon the property to determine whether a violation has occurred. Upon
determination that a violation has occurred, the SMO may seek a court
order to take any and all measures reasonably necessary to abate the
violation and/or restore the property. The cost of implementing and
maintaining such measures shall be the sole responsibility of the
discharger.

No. 7-2016; 4-10-2018 by G.O. No. 3-2018]
No removal of the pavement or disturbance of the surface of any street for
the purpose of making sewer connections or repairing sewers or pipes or
laying down gas or water pipes, steam pipes or electric conduits, cables or
ducts or introducing the same into buildings or placing building materials,
tar kettles, compressors, sidewalk fences or sidewalk bridges or crossing
the sidewalk other than usual use, or for any purpose whatever, shall be
made until a permit is first had from the City Engineer. The City Engineer
shall have the authority to grant, deny, suspend or revoke a permit for
cause. In all cases, where the removal of the pavement or disturbance of
the surface of any street is being done, an excavation license must also be
obtained from the Office of Consumer Protection.
§ 103-27. Use of power equipment.
In excavating cross trenches where conditions warrant it, excavation by
power equipment may be performed but only with special permission by the
City Engineer.
§ 103-28. Excavations.
A. Width of trench. Where trench excavation is made for pipes or conduits,
the width of the trench shall not exceed the outside diameter of the pipe
plus two feet. "Width of trench" shall mean the greatest distance
between trench walls, measured at any level of the trench from the
surface of the pavement down to the bottom of the trench and
measured at right angles to the direction of the pipe or conduit. Trench
walls may be vertical or sloped outward not to exceed one foot
horizontal to four feet vertical, except where sheeting is required (as
outlined elsewhere herein), in which case trench walls and sheeting
shall be vertical.
B. Excavated materials.
(1) In residential or semiresidential areas, all excavated materials shall
be laid compactly at the sides of the trench and shall be kept
trimmed up so as to give the least possible inconvenience to
vehicular and pedestrian travel and to owners or tenants of
adjoining property. A clear footway not less than four feet shall be
reserved and kept open in sidewalk areas, and, if necessary, boards
shall be put up to prevent the earth from running over into the
reserved space. Where trenches fall within street crossings and
private ways, they shall be steel-plated in such manner as the City
§ 103-26 CHARTER § 103-28
C:1781
Engineer may direct in order that the traffic of intersecting streets
may not be stopped and in order that entrance may be made to
houses, stores, factories, garages and other buildings and grounds
along the work. Where the scope of the work requires the opening
of more than 1/2 the width of the street paving, such opening shall
be performed in sections, one section to be completely backfilled
or covered with a steel plate before another section is opened so
as to provide for continuous passage of vehicular and/or pedestrian
traffic over at least 1/2 of the pavement width. In this respect,
sections shall be laid out for opening in accordance with directions
of the City Engineer prior to the start of the work.
(2) In business or major thoroughfare areas, all excavated materials
shall be completely removed from the site, and the work of
excavation is to be commenced as outlined in Subsection B(1)
above.
(a) In order to clarify somewhat the approximate areas where this
provision shall apply, the following is a list of locations hereby

(3) During the course of the work, gutters must be kept free of
obstruction to permit the flow of stormwaters, and free access to
the Water Bureau's stopcocks, hydrants and gates must be
maintained at all times. After the excavation has been completed,
the pavement and/or sidewalk areas adjacent to the work shall be
swept clean and all excess materials removed from the job site.
(4) Blasting and explosives.
(a) Blasting will not be permitted except at points more than 20
feet distant from existing drains, sewers or other structures,
and then only under such regulations as may be established by
the Engineer.
(b) Where blasting is permitted, it shall be done in accordance
with all City, county, state and federal ordinances, pertinent
laws and other regulations and with all orders given by the Fire
Department relative to the storing and handling of explosives,
the quantity of explosive for each blast and the firing of blasts.
Such ordinances, laws, regulations and orders shall not,
however, relieve the permittee of any responsibility for
damages caused by him in the performance of such work.415
(c) Prior to the firing of blasts, all persons in the vicinity shall be
given ample warning and cleared from the zone of danger.
Blasting shall be done only by experienced, licensed men. All
blasts shall be well covered, and provision shall be made to
protect all pipes, conduits, drains, sewers and structures and
all persons or property adjacent to the site of the work.

§ 103-29. Backfill.
through blasting, the permittee, at his own expense, shall
rebuild or repair the pipes or other structures and replace
the material surrounding or supporting the same to the
satisfaction of the Engineer or of the owner thereof.
A. As soon as practicable after sections of the various conduits, pipes and
structures have been completed and have developed the required
strength and durability, the trenches and other excavations in which
they have been constructed shall be carefully backfilled under, around
and over the pipes and structures with approved and selected materials
from the excavations or with borrowed backfill materials, and the
excavations shall be completely filled up to the existing surface.
B. The backfill material to be used between the bottom of the trench and
an elevation of two feet over the top of the pipe, conduit or other
structure shall be a selected material of a clayey loam, sandy loam or
sand, gravel and clay mixture free from clods, frozen lumps, particles of
stone, rock or gravel exceeding one inch in its longest dimension, and
other deleterious matter. Such material, when placed, shall be damp
and shall be spread in thin layers not exceeding six inches in thickness
and brought up at the same rate on both sides of the pipe, conduit or
structure. Each layer shall be thoroughly compacted by mechanical or
approved hand tampers for the full width of the layer before the next
layer is placed. When hand-tamping is permitted, it shall be done with a
tamper of approved weight and design and shall be done in such a
manner as to produce compaction of the backfill equal to the
compaction produced by mechanical tampers. Special care shall be
exercised in compacting the backfill below the horizontal diameter of
pipes and conduits in order to secure complete compacting without
dislodging the pipe or conduit. Backfill material shall not be dropped
directly on the pipe or conduit nor over the area occupied by the pipe or
conduit between the horizontal diameter and two feet above the top of
the pipe or conduit.
C. Material for the backfilling of the balance of the trench or excavation
from an elevation of two feet over the top of the pipe, conduit or other
structure to the existing surface shall be selected material from the
excavations of the same quality as described above or borrowed backfill
materials containing no stone, rock or gravel exceeding 12 inches in its
longest dimension. The total volume of such stones, rock or gravel shall
not exceed 30% of the volume of the backfill material. Segregation of
the larger particles into pockets shall be prevented.
D. The backfill to the top of the trench or other excavation shall be made in
layers not more than one foot in thickness after compaction. The
backfill material, when placed, shall be damp and shall be deposited
with its surface approximately horizontal, with a small crown along the
center line of the trench, and shall be thoroughly and completely
compacted with mechanical or approved hand tampers before the
§ 103-28 YONKERS CODE § 103-29
C:1784
succeeding layer is placed. From an elevation of nine feet over the
top of the pipe or conduit, compaction of wide excavations may be
made with a tamping roller which shall traverse the entire surface of
the backfill until there is no further decrease in the penetration of
the tamping feet of the roller. The top surface of the backfill shall be
mounded slightly and shall conform to the adjacent existing surface.
The permittee shall maintain the backfilled trench or other excavation
in a safe condition for traffic and the public until the date on which the
City or the permittee commences the pavement restoration.
E. In making excavations, all materials removed which comply with the
specifications for backfill materials shall be selected and segregated
from the other unsuitable excavated materials and separately stored,
apart from other materials. Such selected materials shall not be allowed
to become mixed with other materials unsuitable for backfill. Failure to
comply with this requirement may result, as determined by the City
Engineer, in the rejection of all the selected backfill materials, and the
permittee thereupon shall furnish from other approved sources, at his
own expense, the amount of approved materials which has been
rendered unsatisfactory by admixture with other materials.416
F. Whenever the excavations do not produce a sufficient quantity of
satisfactory material for making the required backfill, the necessary
amount of suitable material shall be furnished by the permittee from
other approved sources as described for borrowed backfill.
G. If such backfilling shall not be done in accordance with the provisions of
this article or if the pavement shall not be relaid in the manner and with
materials satisfactory to the City Engineer, the City Engineer may cause
a notice, in writing, to be served upon the person or corporation by
whom the fill or pavement was removed or, if such removal was for the
purpose of making a connection between any house or lot with any
sewer or pipes in the street or otherwise improving any house or lot,
upon the owner or occupant of such house or lot, requiring such person
or corporation, or the owner of such house or lot, to have such
backfilling properly done and to have such pavement properly relaid
within five days after service of such notice. Such notice may be served
upon the owner or occupant of a house or lot by leaving the same with
any person of adult age upon the premises or by posting the same
thereon or upon the contractor or his employees or agents. [Amended
6-14-2016 by G.O. No. 7-2016]
H. In case such backfilling shall not be done or in case the pavement or a
portion thereof shall not be relaid to the satisfaction of the City
Engineer within the time specified in such notice, it shall be lawful and
authority is hereby given to the Engineer to have such backfilling done
and to have such pavement or portion thereof relaid and put in proper
order and repair, in such manner as he may deem best, on account of
the person or corporation by whom such excavation was made or such

pavement was removed or from the owner of the premises for whose
benefit such excavation or such removal of pavement was made. Upon
the costs of such work being certified to the Comptroller of the City by
the City Engineer, the Comptroller shall pay the same, and the amount
so paid shall be collected, after demand for payment thereof shall have
been first made, in an appropriate action at law from the person or
corporation by whom such excavation or such removal of pavement was
made or from the owner of the premises for whose benefit the same was
made or from any other person responsible for the work. [Amended

I. Nothing contained in this article shall be deemed to prohibit the City
Engineer from demanding, before issuing a permit and as a condition
therefor, the deposit of such sum of money or other security as, in his
judgment, may be sufficient to pay the cost of properly backfilling an
excavation and relaying the pavement removed, together with the
expense of the inspection thereof and the expenses incidental to the
issuing of the permit and the making of refunds thereon. Nothing
contained in this article shall be deemed to prohibit the Engineer from
issuing a violation to the owner, occupant contractor or other person
responsible for the work on the building, lot, street sidewalk or other
property. [Amended 6-14-2016 by G.O. No. 7-2016]
A. The permittee shall be solely responsible for supporting and
maintaining excavations required hereunder and shall install sheeting,
shoring, bracing or other supports at the sides, ends, top and bottom of
excavations more than six feet deep with timber, steel or other
adequate and satisfactory materials. If, in the opinion of the City
Engineer, the sheeting, braces, shores, stringers, waling timbers or
other supports are not properly placed or are insufficient, the permittee
shall provide additional or stronger supports. The requirement of
sheeting and shoring or of the addition of supports shall not relieve the
permittee of his responsibility for their sufficiency or for any damage
that may occur.417
B. All temporary supports shall be removed as backfilling progresses. All
sheeting, shoring and supports in excavations over 12 feet deep
required for the purpose of preventing injury to pipes, other structures,
other property or persons shall be left in place, with the upper ends cut
off 18 inches below pavement level. Upon the removal of supports, all
voids shall be completely and compactly filled to the satisfaction of the
City Engineer.418
C. All the timber for sheeting, sheet piling, bracing, waling and shoring
shall be of merchantable stock, of such kind, size, thickness, strength,
quality and durability as will adequately support and protect the work

Customer-Owned or -Leased Currency- or Credit-Operated
Telephones, Including Public Telephones
[Adopted 4-26-1994 by G.O. No. 9-1994]
§ 103-107. Intent and purpose. [Amended 1-28-1997 by G.O. No.
3-1997; 11-25-1997 by G.O. No. 14-1997]
The City Council finds and declares that:
§ 103-108. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
CITY  The City of Yonkers.
COCOT  Any customer-owned or -leased currency-, debit- or creditoperated
telephone, as regulated by the Public Service Commission
pursuant to the New York State Public Service Law and applicable
regulations promulgated thereunder, and, only for the purposes of this
article, any public currency- or credit-operated telephone owned by the
local exchange company (presently known as "New York Telephone"). The
term includes all equipment or furniture ancillary to the telephone itself.
COMMISSIONER  The Commissioner of the Department of Public Works.
A. The random placement of unauthorized customer-owned or -leased
currency- or credit-operated telephones ("COCOT"), including public
telephones, in the public rights-of-way of the City can and does pose a
risk to the safe passage of pedestrian and vehicular traffic on or near
such locations, interferes with residents and businesses in the vicinity
of such COCOT's and is harming the City's continuing effort to promote
an aesthetically pleasing environment and overall rational planning for
the future of the neighborhoods of Yonkers.
B. Such unauthorized COCOT's represent a violation of the City's
regulatory and proprietary rights with respect to its streets, sidewalks
and rights-of-way, and fosters an unfortunate perception of disorder and
free rein to place obstructions and encroachments in City streets,
sidewalks and rights-of-way.
C. The regulation of COCOT's, including public telephones, is part of a
continuing program of managing vehicular and pedestrian traffic in the
City and of maintaining proprietary and regulatory control over the
City's own streets, sidewalks and rights-of-way.
D. The provisions hereinafter contained and enacted are primarily in
furtherance of and for the purpose of promoting the public safety and
general welfare of persons in the City in their use of public streets,
sidewalks and rights-of-way by balancing the limited public need for
access to telephones against the concerns set forth above.
§ 103-107 CHARTER § 103-108
C:1815
LICENSEE  The person responsible for placing and maintaining a COCOT
in a public right-of-way after receiving an approved permit from the City of
Yonkers.
LICENSING DIRECTOR  The Director of the Office of Licensing of the City
of Yonkers.[Added 1-28-1997 by G.O. No. 3-1997]
PARKWAY  The area, other than the sidewalk, between the curb or the
edge of the roadway and the property line adjacent thereto. "Parkway" shall
also include any area within a roadway that is not open to vehicular travel.
PLANNING DIRECTOR  The Director of the Planning Department of the
City of Yonkers.[Added 1-28-1997 by G.O. No. 3-1997]
RIGHT-OF-WAY  Any areas dedicated to public use for public street
purposes, and shall include but not be limited to roadways, parkways, alleys
and sidewalks.
ROADWAY  That portion of a street improved, designed or ordinarily used
for vehicular travel.
§ 103-109. Permit required. [Amended 1-28-1997 by G.O. No.

It shall be unlawful for any person, firm or corporation to erect, place,
maintain or operate on any public street or sidewalk or in any other public
right-of-way, including any governmental property or facility or in any place
requiring the user to stand in or otherwise occupy any public right-of-way
in the City any COCOT without first having obtained a permit from the
City specifying the exact location of such COCOT. The granting of a permit
shall not be construed to confer any contractual rights, or any property
rights other than a license to use the City's right-of-way and/or to operate
the COCOT, subject to revocation or expiration as set forth in this article;
and, except as may be specifically provided in this article, the standards for
renewal shall be identical to those for original issuance.

Complete Streets
[Adopted 9-27-2016 by G.O. No. 17-2016428]
§ 103-129. Complete Streets Policy.
A. Legislative intent and Complete Streets Policy. The City of Yonkers
seeks to improve the City's interconnected network of transportation
facilities which accommodate all modes of travel in a manner that is
consistent with neighborhood context and is supportive of community
goals by establishing a Complete Streets Policy to incorporate active
transportation into the planning, design and operation of all future City
streets projects, whether new construction, reconstruction,
rehabilitation or pavement maintenance. Active transportation
attempts to better integrate physical activity in our daily lives through
increased emphasis on walking, bicycling, and public transportation.
Active transportation improves public health, reduces traffic
congestion, enhances air quality, and supports local economic
development. Complete streets are streets that are planned, designed,
operated, and maintained to enable safe access for all users, and upon
which pedestrians, bicyclists, transit users, persons with disabilities,
and motorists of all ages and abilities are able to safely move along and
across. The City of Yonkers acknowledges the work of the Complete
Streets Advisory Board, which comprised various community
stakeholders and is led by the Living Your Fullest Everyday (LYFE)
Coalition in the City of Yonkers.
B. The City Engineer shall include bicycle, pedestrian, and transit facilities
in all street construction, reconstruction, rehabilitation and pavement
maintenance projects conducted by or on behalf of the City, as
appropriate, subject to the exceptions contained herein.
C. The City shall plan, design, build and maintain all bicycle, pedestrian
and transit facilities in accordance with accepted and appropriate
federal, state, and local standards and guidelines, but will consider
innovative and/or nontraditional design options, as appropriate.
D. The incorporation of bicycle, pedestrian and transit facilities shall be
mandated in all street construction, reconstruction, rehabilitation, and
pavement maintenance projects undertaken by or on behalf of the City,
except under one or more of the following conditions, where the City
Engineer must provide an explanation as to how the exception applies:
(1) The City Engineer determines there is insufficient space within the
right-of-way or insufficient need within the community to safely
accommodate such new facilities.
(2) The City Engineer determines that establishing such new facilities
would require excessive or disproportionate cost.
428. Editor's Note: This ordinance provided an effective date of 1-1-2017.
§ 103-129 CHARTER § 103-129
C:1833
(3) The City Engineer determines that the inclusion of such new
facilities would create a public safety risk for users of the public
right-of-way.
(4) The project is limited to routine or seasonal maintenance activities,
such as mowing, sweeping and pavement repairs.
(5) Bicyclists and pedestrians are prohibited by law from using the
facility.
E. The City Council and the Mayor shall receive an annual report from the
City Engineer on the City's consistency with this Policy with respect to
all street construction, reconstruction, rehabilitation, and pavement
maintenance under design or construction by or on behalf of the City.
This report shall be made available to the public on the City's website.
F. The City Engineer may establish rules, regulations and procedures
necessary for the implementation and administration of this article,
including, without limitation, creating a complete streets capital
projects checklist.
G. The City Engineer will review all planning studies and/or engineering
reports for street projects prepared by or on behalf of the City.

ARTICLE II
Main Thoroughfares
§ 104-3. Types of pavement.
For main thoroughfares, the following types of pavement are hereby
prescribed, approved and adopted, all to be in accordance with the
requirements set forth in this article:
§ 104-4. Small granite-block pavement.
A. Small granite block on concrete base.
B. Asphaltic concrete on concrete base.
C. Reinforced concrete.
A. Excavation. For small granite-block pavement, the roadbed shall be
excavated to subgrade and thoroughly rolled with a ten-ton roller until
the surface of the subgrade is solid and parallel with and 12 inches
below the proposed finished grade of the pavement where the thickness
of the concrete base is six inches. Where the base is in excess of six
inches, the surface of the subgrade will be lowered accordingly.
B. Concrete base. Upon the subgrade, prepared as above, shall be laid the
concrete base, six inches in depth, unless otherwise called for on the
plans and in the job specifications.
C. Sand cushion. Upon the concrete base, which shall be six inches below
the finished grade of the street, shall be spread a layer of sharp, clean
sand of about 1 1/2 inches in depth.
D. Paving blocks.
(1) The paving blocks shall be cut from first-quality, light-colored, finegrained
New Hampshire granite, or other granite equal thereto, of
the following dimensions: four to 4 1/2 inches in depth, four to 4 1/
2 inches in width, and seven to 11 inches in length.
(2) The blocks shall be so dressed that they may be laid with close
joints not exceeding 1/2 of an inch at the top. The head shall show
not more than 1/4 inch variation from a true plane, with square
corners and sharp edges. The top, bottom and sides shall form right
angles at their intersections. The sides and ends shall have no
depressions or projections exceeding 1/2 inch.
E. Laying blocks. The blocks shall be laid in the sand cushion, on edge, end
to end, across the roadway at right angles to the curb. They must be set
closely and evenly, true to line and grade, with joints broken with a lap
of at least two inches. Only practical and competent pavers shall be
employed for this work.
F. Ramming.
§ 104-3 CHARTER § 104-4
C:1839
(1) After the blocks are laid, they shall be rammed to a solid bearing
with uniform surface, true to the roadway on the established grade,
any low blocks being taken out by means of tongs and raised by
adding to the sand bed, and the whole rammed again to a fair and
even surface. No sand shall be placed in the joints; but, if permitted
by the Commissioner of Public Works, a small quantity of clean, dry
sidewalk grit may be put into the joints, in an amount only sufficient
to hold the blocks and prevent them from rocking. The joints shall
be adjusted and unsatisfactory blocks taken out with tongs. No
pinch bars shall be used except by special permission of the
Commissioner of Public Works.
(2) A sufficient number of rammers shall be employed so that all
pavement laid may be rammed and joints filled before work ceases
each day.
G. Cement grout filler.
(1) The filler shall be composed of one part of clean, sharp sand and
one part of portland cement with enough water added to make a
grout of the consistency of thin cream, mixed in a grout mixer to
ensure the accurate blending of the ingredients and delivered on
the work from a short pipe or other manner satisfactory to the
Commissioner of Public Works.
(2) The blocks shall be wet by sprinkling with hose or can and kept
moist until the grout is supplied.
(3) The grout shall be poured on the surface and broomed into the
joints until filled flush with the surface.
(4) After this grout has subsided into the joints and before the initial
set, the surface shall again be treated with a grout of the
consistency of thick cream, which shall be broomed smoothly over
the surface until the joints are full and flush with the top of the
blocks.
(5) On steep grades, where deemed desirable by the Engineer, joints
shall be filled to within 1/8 inch of the surface.
(6) No travel shall be allowed on the pavement during construction nor
for a period of at least six days after completion.
H. Asphaltic cement filler.
(1) The joint filler used shall be a mixture of paving cement, described
hereafter, and hot dry sand, in the proportion not to exceed one
part sand to one part paving cement by volume, or as much sand up
to this proportion as the paving cement will carry. The sand shall all
pass a ten-mesh sieve. It shall be clean and heated to a temperature
of not less than 300° F. nor more than 400° F. and shall be within
these limits when mixed with the paving cement. The paving
§ 104-4 YONKERS CODE § 104-4
C:1840
cement shall be heated in kettles, properly equipped with an
approved thermometer, to a temperature of not less than 275° F.
nor more than 350° F. and shall be poured when between these
limits.
(2) The mixture shall be made in a concrete carrier pushcart of seven
cubic feet in capacity or other approved receptacle.
(3) Approximately 2 1/4 cubic feet of the hot asphaltic cement shall be
poured into the cart, the hot sand then added in the proportion
indicated above and the mixture thoroughly stirred with a rake or
perforated hoe. The mixture shall then, without delay, be flushed on
the surface of the blocks and pushed into the joints by squeegees or
other approved means, reflushing or repouring, if necessary, until
the joints remain permanently filled, flush with the surface of the
pavement, but in no case will any surplus asphalt cement filler be
allowed to remain on the top of finished pavement. The asphalt
joints will be tested for depth after the pouring is finished and must
show at least four inches in depth of asphalt. The cart or containers
shall be entirely emptied before refilling.429
I. Heating appliances; all joints to be poured with filler during the day.
The appliances for heating the materials for filling the joints shall be of
such efficiency and number as will permit the pourers to follow closely
the rammers, and all joints of rammed pavement shall be poured with
the filler before the cessation of work for the day.
J. Asphaltic paving cement. The asphaltic paving cement shall be obtained
by the distillation of an asphaltic petroleum at a temperature not
exceeding 700° F. and shall comply with the following requirements:
(1) It shall be homogeneous.
(2) The melting point shall not be less than 115° F. nor more than
130° F. (ball-and-ring method).
(3) Solubility in carbon tetrachloride shall not be less than 98 1/2%.
(4) Penetration at 77° F. shall not be less than 60 nor more than 100,
the penetration test being made with a No. 2 needle for five
seconds under a load of 100 grams; and the penetration at 100° F.
shall not exceed 3 1/4 times its penetration at 77° F., the condition
of time and load being as above established. The contractor, before
beginning work, shall obtain from the Engineer a statement, in
writing, as to the penetration desired for any particular contract;
and a variation of not more than 10 points either way from this
penetration will be permitted.
(5) Ductility at 77° F. shall not be less than 40 centimeters at the
penetration called for.

(6) It shall not lose more than 1% by volatilization when maintained at
a temperature of 325° F. for five hours, nor shall the penetration of
the residue after such heating be less than 1/2 the original
penetration.
K. Period when traffic prohibited. No traffic of any description shall be
permitted on the pavement until the joints have been completely filled
with bituminous filler, as described, and it has hardened.
A. Excavation. For asphaltic-concrete pavement, the roadbed shall be
excavated to subgrade and thoroughly rolled with a ten-ton roller until
the surface of the subgrade is solid and parallel with the proposed
finished grade of the pavement. Depth below the finished grade shall be
determined by the thickness of the concrete base and the asphalticconcrete
top called for on the plans and in the job specifications.
B. Concrete base. Upon the subgrade, prepared as above, shall be laid the
concrete base, six inches in depth, unless otherwise called for on the
plans and in the job specifications.
C. Pavement to be one-course or two-course. The asphaltic-concrete
pavement shall be either one-course of two-and-one-half-inch
compacted thickness or two-course of three-inch compacted thickness,
as called for on the plans and in the job specifications.
D. One-course pavement. On the concrete base shall be placed an
asphaltic-concrete wearing course, to be leveled, raked and rolled with
a ten-ton roller to the satisfaction of the Engineer and to a compacted
thickness of 2 1/2 inches.

an approximate composition as follows: 73% sand, 16% mineral
filler and 11% asphalt cement. The above percentages are not
rigidly fixed and are subject to the final approval of the City's
testing agency. See Subsection I below.
(3) The binder course shall consist of a mixture of graded stone
aggregate, all passing a one-inch screen and all retained on a No.
10 screen, a graded fine aggregate of sand or stone screenings, all
of which shall pass a No. 10 screen, and asphalt cement, all to be
proportioned and mixed according to approved manufacturer's
specifications. It is intended that the paving mixture shall have an
approximate composition as follows: 75% coarse aggregate, 20%
fine aggregate and 5% asphalt cement. The above percentages are
not rigidly fixed and are subject to the final approval of the City's
testing agency. See Subsection I below.
(4) Broken stone shall be produced from tough, durable rock and shall
be free from elongated pieces, soft or disintegrated stone, dirt or
other objectionable material.
(5) Sand shall consist of clean, hard, durable grains, free from clay,
loam and other foreign materials.
(6) Mineral filler shall consist of limestone dust or other approved
material.
(7) Asphalt cement shall be refined asphalt and flux, of suitable
consistency for paving purposes.
G. Spreading and rolling.
§ 104-5 CHARTER § 104-5
C:1843
(1) Unless otherwise permitted by the Commissioner of the
Department of Public Works, the asphaltic concrete shall be placed
by means of a mechanical spreader so operated that the mixture as
spread is free from lumps, of uniform density and to the desired
cross section.
(2) After spreading, the mixture shall be thoroughly and uniformly
compressed by a three-wheel, power-driven roller, weighing not
less than 10 tons, as soon after being spread as it will bear the
roller without undue displacement. Delays in rolling freshly spread
mixture will not be tolerated. Rolling shall start longitudinally at
the sides and proceed toward the center of the pavement,
overlapping on successive trips by at least 1/2 the width of a rear
wheel. Alternative trips of the roller shall be of slightly different
lengths. The pavement shall then be subjected to diagonal rolling in
two directions with a tandem roller weighing not less than 10 tons,
the second diagonal rolling crossing the lines of the first.
(3) The speed of the roller shall not exceed three miles per hour and
shall at all times be slow enough to avoid displacement of the
mixture. Any displacements occurring as a result of reversing the
direction of the roller or from any other cause shall at once be
corrected by the use of rakes and of fresh mixture where required.
Rolling shall proceed continuously until all roller marks are
eliminated and until the finished course shall have a density not
less than 95% of the laboratory-compacted density. If the surface
course is being placed at a rate in excess of 300 square yards per
hour, the contractor shall use an extra roller. To prevent adhesion
of the mixture to the roller, the wheels shall be kept properly
moistened, but an excess of either water or oil will not be
permitted.
H. Smoothing irons. Heated smoothing irons shall be used to finish the
pavement along curbs, around manhole heads and elsewhere where
necessary.
I. Intent of specifications; approval of sources of supply for aggregates
and mineral filler.
(1) It is the intent of these specifications to secure a pavement that will
conform to the latest construction specifications of the Asphalt
Institute. The contractor shall submit samples with manufacturer's
specifications for the asphaltic-concrete mixtures he proposes to
use in the work, and these are to be examined and passed upon by
the testing agency engaged by the City. The contractor shall make
such changes in the formulas submitted as may be required by the
testing agency in order that the mixture delivered and used in the
work will be such as to produce the pavement required.
§ 104-5 YONKERS CODE § 104-5
C:1844
§ 104-6. Reinforced concrete pavement.
(2) Approval of sources of supply for aggregates and mineral filler shall
be obtained from the Commissioner of the Department of Public
Works before being used in the mixture.
A. Preparation of subgrade. For reinforced concrete pavement, the
subgrade of the roadway shall be prepared for the pavement by
excavating or filling and shall be thoroughly compacted with a ten-ton
roller and finished true to cross section with its surface parallel to and
the required depth below the finished pavement surface.
B. Description. The pavement shall be eight inches thick, unless otherwise
called for on the plans or in the job specifications, and shall be
reinforced with steel bars or steel-wire fabric of the size and spacing
called for on the plans or in the job specifications.
C. Pavement concrete, generally. All the requirements of the standard city
specifications for controlled concrete as to ingredients, composition
and design, mixing and placing shall apply to pavement concrete, with
the additional requirements set out in this section.
D. Class of concrete. Concrete shall be proportioned approximately as for
Class B concrete (Table C of the Standard Specifications), except that it
shall be required to give a flexural strength of not less than 550 pounds
per square inch at the age of 14 days when tested by the American
Society for Testing and Materials Standard Method of Test for Flexural
Strength of Concrete (using simple beam with third-point loading)
Designation C-78, as last amended.
E. Cement. Treated normal cement (air-entraining), Type 1-A, shall be
used, unless otherwise called for in the job specifications.
F. Equipment. All equipment for mixing and placing concrete must be on
the site and inspected and approved by the Engineer before concreting
operations are started.
G. Placing.
(1) Before any concrete is placed, it shall be tested and approved by
the Engineer. The subgrade, if dry, shall be wetted by sprinkling so
that a uniform, moist and compacted foundation is provided.
During the placing of concrete, a roller weighing not less than five
tons shall be maintained in readiness to reroll any defective areas
in the subgrade.
(2) The concrete shall be deposited on the subgrade rapidly in
successive batches directly from the mixer by means of an
approved broom and bucket or other acceptable discharging device
and shall be distributed to the required depth and for the entire
width of the slab by shoveling or other approved method. Rakes
§ 104-5 CHARTER § 104-6
C:1845
shall not be used for handling concrete, and special care shall be
exercised to prevent segregation.
(3) Unless otherwise specified or permitted by the Engineer, steel
reinforcement mats shall be installed by the strike-off method
whereby the concrete is first struck off by means of a template to
the required depth below the finished grade of the pavement, the
reinforcement is then placed and the remaining concrete placed on
top of the steel and finished in the required manner.
(4) The placing of steel and the top layer of concrete shall be done
immediately after the first strike-off. Should any portions of the
bottom layer of concrete develop initial set before being covered
with the top layer, such portions shall be removed and replaced
with newly mixed concrete at the contractor's expense.
H. Finishing.
(1) Competent concrete finishers shall be employed at all times for this
operation.
(2) The surface of the concrete shall be screeded by means of an
approved transverse machine in charge of an experienced operator.
Two machines shall be used whenever, in the judgment of the
Engineer, paving is progressing too rapidly to be properly finished
by one machine.
(3) If hand-finishing is authorized, the surface of the concrete shall be
struck off by means of two transverse screeds. The first or forward
screed shall be 12 inches in width, at least two feet longer than the
width of the slab, and shall be constructed of a channel or angle
irons weighing not less than 20 pounds per foot. It shall be
operated by four men. The second or follow-up screed shall be 10
inches in width, of the same length and construction as the first
screed, shall weigh not less than 15 pounds per foot and shall be
operated by two men. The screeds shall be moved forward with a
longitudinal and crosswise movement. Tamping shall be done only
after screeding and then only where the mortar fails to properly
come to the surface by screeding. The second screeding shall
follow in close succession to the first, care being taken to keep the
screed bearing directly on the side forms at all times and to secure
a smooth and even surface.
(4) After the transverse screeding has been completed, the concrete
surface shall be leveled and finished by the use of a mechanical
longitudinal or diagonal screed of a type approved by the Engineer
or by an approved type of longitudinal screed hand-operated from
bridges. Each section floated shall overlap the one previously
floated by not less than five feet.
(5) Following the longitudinal screeding or floating, and if ordered by
the Engineer, the surface shall be scraped with a metal
§ 104-6 YONKERS CODE § 104-6
C:1846
straightedge on a long handle operated from the edge of the
pavement so as to remove all excess mortar from the surface.
(6) After the screeding and scraping has been completed, the concrete
shall be finished by using a belt of wood, canvas or rubber not less
than 10 nor more than 12 inches in width. The belt shall be worked
with a longitudinal and crosswise motion. Care shall be observed in
the use of the belt so as not to permit the edges to dig into the
surface of the concrete or to work the crown out of the pavement.
(7) Immediately after the concrete has been belted, a trowel shall be
inserted between the form and the concrete for a depth of three
inches for the entire length of the slab and both sides of the joints.
(8) The surface of the pavement shall be tested after the belting with a
ten-foot straightedge laid parallel with the side of the pavement,
and any depressions exceeding 1/4 of an inch in depth shall be
corrected to the satisfaction of the Engineer.
(9) As soon as the concrete is sufficiently set, the surface shall be given
a broom finish, the broom being drawn across the surface in not
more than two strokes per width of broom.
(10) Necessary hand-finishing of joints and surface irregularities shall
be done with a wooden float from a bridge which shall not rest on
the concrete at any point. The longitudinal edges and all joints of
the concrete slab shall be carefully finished with an approved
edging tool.
(11) In edging concrete placed adjacent to a finished slab, an edging
tool having a lip at least 1/4 inch deeper than the tool used on the
finished slab shall be used.
I. Reinforcement.
(1) Reinforcing steel for the pavement shall be free from scale, grease,
injurious rust or other foreign substances which will tend to
prevent proper bonding to the concrete. The reinforcement shall be
welded steel-wire fabric or steel-bar mats of the design, weight and
dimensions as shown on the plan. The contractor shall have the
option between wire-fabric or bar mats.
(2) Reinforcement shall consist of longitudinal and transverse
members at right angles. All points of intersection of the members
shall be firmly connected in an approved manner.
(3) All such reinforcement shall be protected from moisture and shall
not be delivered upon the work until 10 days previous to placing.
(4) All reinforcements shall be approved by the Engineer as to
condition before being placed.
§ 104-6 CHARTER § 104-6
C:1847
(5) Steel fabric shall meet the requirements given for cold-drawn steel
wire for concrete reinforcement in the standard specifications of
the American Society for Testing and Materials Serial Designation
A82-34, except that a sample shall be taken as directed by the
Engineer. All welded steel fabric shall meet these requirements
after fabrication.
(6) Bar reinforcement shall be open-hearth and shall consist of
approved deformed bars of intermediate grade rolled from new
billets (no rerolled material or cold twisted bars will be accepted)
and shall withstand being bent cold through 180° without cracking
on the outside of the bent portion. When the steel to be tested is
under 3/4 inch in diameter, the test specimen shall be bent around
a pin whose diameter is equal to the diameter of the test specimen.
If it is 3/4 inch or over in diameter, it shall be bent around a pin
whose diameter is twice the diameter of the test specimen.
(7) In addition to these requirements, bars shall also meet all other
requirements given for intermediate grade reinforcement bars in
the current standard specifications of the American Society for
Testing and Materials Serial Designation A-15, except that samples
shall be taken and tests made as directed by the Engineer.
(8) If bar mats are to be fabricated by welding, plain bars may be used
instead of deformed.
J. Joints.
(1) Joints of the various types shall be placed and finished as shown on
the plan or as directed by the Engineer. Dowels and tie bars shall
be placed at such joints as indicated on the plans and of the size
and type called for.
(2) Expansion joints shall be placed at all street intersections and
elsewhere at four-hundred-foot intervals, unless otherwise called
for.
(3) Transverse contraction joints shall be placed at twenty-foot
intervals, unless otherwise called for.
(4) Construction joints shall be placed where shown on the plan or
directed. Transverse construction joints at the end of a day's
concreting shall in no case be less than 10 feet from the nearest
regularly located transverse joint.
(5) An approved premoulded, nonextruding joint filler shall be used at
all expansion joints. All joints shall be scaled with an approved
bituminous before the pavement is opened to traffic.
(6) All joints, dowels, bars and joint fillers shall be according to details
on the plan or as specified in the job specifications.
K. Forms.
§ 104-6 YONKERS CODE § 104-6
C:1848
(1) Forms for the pavement shall be made of steel and have a minimum
length of 10 feet for tangents and for curves of a radius of 400 feet
or more. For curves of a radius less than 400 feet, wooden side
forms of two-inch seasoned surfaced planks or steel side forms of
the proper curvature shall be used.
(2) These forms shall be of a depth equal to the depth of the concrete.
Steel forms shall have a minimum width of base equal to at least
the height of the form. The material used in manufacturing metal
side forms shall be at least 3/16 of an inch in thickness. All forms
shall be of approved section with a vertical face rounded on the
upper corner to not more than 1/4 of an inch radius. Forms shall
have a joint connection to ensure unbroken lines across the joint.
(3) All forms shall be straight, free from bends and warps at all times
and shall be cleaned thoroughly and oiled before concrete is placed
against them, this cleaning and oiling being repeated daily as forms
are moved ahead. The forms shall rest firmly on the thoroughly
compacted subgrade throughout the entire length, shall be joined
neatly and tightly and staked securely to line and grade at least 500
feet on each side in advance of the point of placing concrete by
using at least three bracing pins or stakes to each ten-foot length of
side form, so that they will resist the pressure of the concrete and
the impact of the temper without springing. Where wood forms are
used, there shall be additional stakes to prevent bulging, if so
directed by the Engineer. Forms for the curbing shall be of
materials similar to those specified for the pavement and shall be
so designed as to permit secure fastenings to the pavement forms,
which fastenings shall be so constructed that they will not obstruct
the correct finishing and edging of the top of the curbing. If wooden
forms are used, the stock shall not be less than 1 1/4 inches in
thickness.
L. Protection and curing.
(1) Traffic shall be excluded from the concrete by the erection and
maintenance of substantial barricades for the entire period during
which the pavement is to remain closed to traffic, and logs, ties or
other obstructions shall be placed at proper intervals so that traffic
cannot turn out or run on the pavement.
(2) During threatening weather, the concrete shall be protected with
canvas as soon as it is finished. Sufficient canvas to cover 200
linear feet of pavement slab shall be provided and available for
immediate use.
(3) Curing shall be done, at the contractor's option, in accordance with
any of the following methods:
(a) Quilted covers.
§ 104-6 CHARTER § 104-6
C:1849
[1] Approved quilted covers shall consist of outer covering
materials of burlap, cotton or other approved fabrics, the
bottom and top cover of which shall each weigh at least six
ounces per square yard of fabric, and an inner layer of
cotton batting or other approved material weighing at
least eight ounces per square yard. These mats shall be
quilted to securely hold the inner cotton batting lining in
place and shall be two feet greater in width, after
shrinking, than the pavement slabs being cured and shall
be securely held in place and weighted down to completely
cover the edges as well as the top of the pavement.
Adjoining quilts shall be lapped at least 12 inches.
[2] These quilted covers shall be laid directly on the pavement
as soon as the brooming is completed. They shall be
thoroughly wet and kept wet for the period shown on the
following Table 104-1.
(b) Bituminous or colorless cure.
[1] Single-spray equipment, of an approved type, will be
permitted if the coverage secured is even and satisfactory
to the Engineer. On any work where the coverage is not
even or for any reason unsatisfactory to the Engineer,
multiple-spray equipment of an approved type must be
used.
[2] The distributor shall be so constructed as to cover the
entire width of the slab at one time, and the nozzles shall
be so arranged that each spray will overlap the next by 1/2
its width.
[3] The concrete shall be protected with two layers of burlap
(or quilted covers as described above) laid directly on the
concrete as soon as completed. The strips shall be at least
two feet wider than the concrete and shall overlap not less
than 12 inches and must be thoroughly wet when placed.
The cover shall be left on the surface for at least 24 hours
and shall be kept wet until removed.
[4] Immediately after the cover is removed, the entire surface,
including the edges and side, shall be treated with
bituminous material A or B meeting the following

[5] The bituminous material shall be applied uniformly to the
surface at the rate of 1/10 gallon per square yard by means
of an approved pressure distributor. The rate of
application may be increased should the method of
application of any type of material fail to give an even
coating when applied at the rate specified. Any lightbrown
spots on the surface shall receive additional
coating.
[6] Colorless coating. The contractor shall coat the entire top
surface of the slab with a colorless curing compound,
applied uniformly by means of an approved pressure spray
distributor, at the rate of 30 square yards per gallon of
material. The material shall be so applied that the concrete
surface is completely coated and sealed at one application.
[7] When first applied, the material shall darken the surface
slightly. As the concrete hardens, the material shall dry to
a transparent, flexible and impervious film. The surface of
the hardened concrete shall not be discolored in any way.
[8] The application shall be made immediately after the
concrete has been deposited and finished and any surplus
water that has collected on the surface thereof has
disappeared but before any marked dehydration or surface
checking has started to occur.
§ 104-6 CHARTER § 104-6
C:1851
[9] Immediately after the forms have been removed, the sides
and edges shall be treated with colorless curing
compound.
[10] After the surface and sides have been coated as specified,
no further attention will be required, other than
adequately protecting the concrete from traffic for the
period of time required by the Engineer.
[11] Colorless curing compound. The sealing compound shall
consist of a straw-colored liquid having the following
characteristics:
[a] Viscosity at 64° F., 50 to 75 second Saybolt-Universal.
[b] Specific gravity at 64° F., 0.87 to 0.89, with a Reimann
plummet on an analytical balance.
[c] Total solids not less than 45% by weight.
[d] The compound shall not freeze when cooled to zero
degrees Fahrenheit
[e] The compound, when cooled to 28° F. and then
warmed to 100° F., shall show no separation.
[f] The compound can show slight haze when cooled
below 54° F.
[12] The material shall form a thin, flexible, transparent film
within 12 minutes at 70° F. when spread on a dry concrete
surface in reasonably dry atmosphere.
[13] It shall form a continuous coherent film (or membrane)
within 12 minutes when spread in a thin film on wet
concrete having a two-inch slump at 70° F. in reasonably
dry atmosphere. This film may be semitransparent.
[14] The compound shall not mix but shall form a continuous
coherent surface film when spread or poured on water.
[15] When dry, the film shall be transparent, flexible and
without breaks or pinholes.
[16] The dry film shall be substantially water- and
moistureproof.
[17] The contractor, if he cures the pavement by a patented
method, shall include in the unit price bid the cost of any
royalties paid to the patentees.
(c) Hay and water cure.
§ 104-6 YONKERS CODE § 104-6
C:1852
[1] The concrete shall be protected with two layers of burlap
(or quilted covers, as described above) laid directly on the
pavement as soon as the brooming has been completed.
The strips shall be at least two feet wider than the
pavement and shall overlap not less than 12 inches and
must be thoroughly wet when placed and kept wet by
spraying until the covering is placed. Sufficient cover for
the pavement laid in any single day must be provided. The
cover shall be kept wet until removed.
[2] Immediately after the cover is removed, the entire surface
of the pavement, including the edges and sides, shall be
wet thoroughly and covered with hay or buckwheat straw
to a depth of not less than six inches, which covering shall
be kept wet by sprinkling with water for the period shown
on the following Table 104-1.
[3] The interval of laying adjacent slabs, the period of opening
to traffic and the curing period shall be in accordance with
the following Table 104-1, depending upon the type of
cement used and the season of the year placed, except in
cases where a pavement is placed upon a bridge floor,
when the contractor shall proceed as directed by the
Engineer.

Paving of Secondary Streets
§ 104-7. Types of pavement. [Amended 12-11-1951 by G.O. No.
46-1951]
For secondary streets, the following types of pavement are hereby
prescribed, approved and adopted, both pavements to be in accordance
with the requirements set forth in this article:
§ 104-8. Four-inch penetrated macadam.
A. For temporary pavement, four-inch penetrated macadam.
B. For permanent pavement, asphaltic-concrete pavement on asphaltmacadam
base (penetration method).
A. Preparation of subgrade. The subgrade of the roadway shall be
prepared for the pavement by being dressed to the proper shape and to
a grade parallel to the finished grade of the street and four inches
below the same. All holes shall be properly filled with suitable, sound
material, inequalities of surface shall be leveled, and all unsuitable
material shall be removed. When thus prepared, the surface shall be
thoroughly rolled with a ten-ton roller to the satisfaction of the
Commissioner of Public Works.
B. One-and-one-half-inch trap rock. On the subgrade prepared as above
shall be laid a layer of one-and-one-half-inch crushed trap rock spread
by means of an approved road grader equipped with a blade to such a
depth that, after the application of the bituminous material, threefourths-
inch and three-eighths-inch trap rock hereinafter specified, the
compacted pavement will be four inches in thickness with a finished
surface conforming to the finished grade of the street. The stone thus
spread shall not be filled but shall be keyed together thoroughly by
rolling with a ten-ton roller. The surface shall be left smooth and of firm
texture, clean and free from dirt, clay or other material which would
prevent the easy penetration of the asphalt cement. If any stone spread
for this course becomes wet, it must be allowed to dry for the full depth
of the course before the pouring of the asphalt cement proceeds.
C. First coat of asphalt cement. The approved asphalt cement heated to a
temperature of not less than 275° F. and not more than 350° F. at the
time of application shall be applied uniformly on the surface when dry
to the amount of not less than two gallons to the square yard.
D. Three-fourths-inch trap rock. Three-fourths-inch crushed trap rock
without dust shall be spread over the surface by means of an approved
mechanical device in such quantity as to completely fill the voids in the
larger stone. This course shall then be rolled firm. The rolling shall be
continued, adding additional broken stone, if necessary, until the course
of stone is thoroughly compacted and its surface is true and even.
§ 104-7 CHARTER § 104-8
C:1855
§ 104-9. Asphaltic-concrete pavement on asphalt-macadam base.
[Amended 12-11-1951 by G.O. No. 46-1951]
The requirements for asphaltic-concrete pavement on asphalt-macadam
base (penetration method) are the same as those set forth in §§ 104-16 and
104-19 of this chapter.
E. Seal coat of asphalt cement and three-eighths-inch trap rock.
(1) After the three-fourths-inch stone is rolled to the satisfaction of the
Engineer, all loose stone shall be swept from the surface. Asphalt
cement for this coat shall be the same as for the first coat and shall
be applied at the rate of one gallon to the square yard, heated as
above. The surface shall then be covered with three-eighths-inch
trap rock and rolled until compacted. The rolling shall proceed
continuously until all roller marks are eliminated and no further
compression is possible. A sufficient amount of three-eighths-inch
stone shall be left on the surface to protect the road while setting
up.
(2) The asphalt cement shall be refined asphalt, of a combination of
refined asphalt and flux of suitable consistency for use in paving by
the penetration method. The probability is that New York State
Specifications Item 64P with penetration limits between 100 and
120 will be called for.
(3) For applying the asphalt cement, an approved pressure distributor
shall be used with a pressure of 50 pounds per square inch or more
as the Engineer may direct.
(4) All tanks and trucks for asphalt cement delivery shall be equipped
with suitable gauges and charts, properly certified, so that the
quantities actually delivered and applied can be readily and
accurately determined. The quantity of asphalt cement will be
determined on the basis of the number of gallons used at 60° F.

Parking Areas
§ 104-10. Prescribed pavement. [Amended 2-28-1950 by G.O. No.
6-1950]
For parking areas, including access and service roads, asphaltic-concrete
pavement on a broken-stone base, on a portland-cement base or on asphaltmacadam
base (penetration method) is hereby prescribed, approved and
adopted, the same to be in accordance with the requirements set forth in

§ 104-11. Asphaltic-concrete pavement. [Amended 2-28-1950 by
G.O. No. 6-1950; 7-3-1990 by L.L. No. 5-1990]
A. Excavation. The roadbed shall be excavated to subgrade and
thoroughly rolled with a ten-ton roller until the surface of the subgrade
is solid and parallel with the proposed finished grade of the pavement.
Depth below the finished grade shall be determined by the thickness of
the broken stone or concrete base and the asphaltic-concrete top called
for on the plans and in the job specifications.
B. Base. Upon the subgrade prepared as above shall be laid a base of
concrete, of broken stone or of asphalt macadam as called for and of
such thickness as shown on the plan and designated in the job
specifications.
C. Pavement to be one-course or two-course. The asphaltic-concrete
pavement shall be either one-course of two-inch or two-and-one-halfinch
compacted thickness or two-course of three-inch compacted
thickness, as called for on the plans and in the job specifications.
D. One-course pavement. On the broken-stone or concrete base shall be
placed on asphaltic-concrete wearing course, to be leveled, raked and
rolled with a ten-ton roller to the satisfaction of the Engineer and to a
compacted thickness of two inches or 2 1/2 inches, as called for on the
plans and in the job specifications.
E. Two-course pavement.
(1) On the broken-stone or concrete base shall be placed an asphalticconcrete
binder course, to be leveled, raked and rolled with a tenton
roller to the satisfaction of the Commissioner of the
Department of Public Works and to a compacted thickness of 1 1/2
inches. The surface of the binder course after compaction shall be
1 1/2 inches below and parallel to the established grade for the
finished pavement and shall be free from depressions exceeding 1/
4 inch, as measured with a ten-foot straightedge paralleling the
center line of the street.
(2) On the compacted binder course shall be placed a wearing course
of asphaltic concrete, either graded stone aggregate mix or sheet
§ 104-10 CHARTER § 104-11
C:1857
mix as called for in the job specifications. Such wearing course
shall be leveled, raked and rolled with a ten-ton roller to the
satisfaction of the Engineer and to a compacted thickness of 1 1/
2 inches. The surface of the wearing course after compaction shall
conform to the established grade for the finished pavement and
shall be free from depressions exceeding 1/8 inch as measured with
a ten-ton straightedge paralleling the center line of the street.
F. Materials.
(1) In the wearing course, the graded stone aggregate mix shall
consist of a graded stone aggregate passing a one-half-inch screen
and all retained on a No. 10 screen, a graded fine aggregate of sand
or stone screenings, all of which shall pass a No. 10 screen, a
mineral filler and asphalt cement, all of which are to be
proportioned and mixed according to approved manufacturer's
specifications. It is intended that the paving mixture shall have an
approximate composition as follows: 50% coarse aggregate, 36.5%
fine aggregate, 6% mineral filler and 7.5% cement. The above
percentages are not rigidly fixed and are subject to the final
approval of the City's testing agency. See Subsection I below.
(2) In the wearing course, the sheet mix shall consist of a graded sand
aggregate, all of which shall pass a No. 10 sieve, a mineral filler
and asphalt cement, all of which are to be proportioned and mixed
according to approved manufacturer's specifications. It is intended
that the paving mixture called for under this subsection shall have
an approximate composition as follows: 73% sand, 16% mineral
filler and 11% asphalt cement. The above percentages are not
rigidly fixed and are subject to the final approval of the City's
testing agency. See Subsection I below.
(3) The binder course shall consist of a mixture of graded stone
aggregate, all passing a one-inch screen and all retained on a No.
10 screen, a graded fine aggregate of sand or stone screenings, all
of which shall pass a No. 10 screen, and asphalt cement, all to be
proportioned and mixed according to approved manufacturer's
specifications. It is intended that the paving mixture shall have an
approximate composition as follows: 75% coarse aggregate, 20%
fine aggregate and 5% asphalt cement. The above percentages are
not rigidly fixed and are subject to the final approval of the City's
testing agency. See Subsection I below.
(4) Broken stone shall be produced from tough, durable rock and shall
be free from elongated pieces, soft or disintegrated stone, dirt or
other objectionable material.
(5) Sand shall consist of clean, hard, durable grains, free from clay,
loam and other foreign materials.
(6) Mineral filler shall consist of limestone dust or other approved
material.
§ 104-11 YONKERS CODE § 104-11
C:1858
(7) Asphalt cement shall be refined asphalt and flux, of suitable
consistency for paving purposes.
G. Spreading and rolling.
(1) Unless otherwise permitted by the Commissioner of the
Department of Public Works, the asphaltic concrete shall be placed
by means of a mechanical spreader so operated that the mixture as
spread is free from lumps, of uniform density and to the desired
cross section.
(2) After spreading, the mixture shall be thoroughly and uniformly
compressed by a three-wheel, power-driven roller, weighing not
less than 10 tons, as soon after being spread as it will bear the
roller without undue displacement. Delays in rolling freshly spread
mixture will not be tolerated. Rolling shall start longitudinally at
the sides and proceed toward the center of the pavement,
overlapping on successive trips by at least 1/2 the width of a rear
wheel. Alternative trips of the roller shall be of slightly different
lengths. The pavement shall then be subjected to diagonal rolling in
two directions with a tandem roller weighing not less than 10 tons,
the second diagonal rolling crossing the lines of the first.
(3) The speed of the roller shall not exceed three miles per hour and
shall at all times be slow enough to avoid displacement of the
mixture. Any displacements occurring as a result of reversing the
direction of the roller or from any other cause shall at once be
corrected by the use of rakes and of fresh mixture where required.
Rolling shall proceed continuously until all roller marks are
eliminated and until the finished course shall have a density not
less than 95% of the laboratory-compacted density. If the surface
course is being placed at a rate in excess of 300 square yards per
hour, the contractor shall use an extra roller. To prevent adhesion
of the mixture to the roller, the wheels shall be kept properly
moistened, but an excess of either water or oil will not be
permitted.
H. Smoothing irons. Heated smoothing irons shall be used to finish the
pavement along curbs, around manhole heads and elsewhere where
necessary.
I. Intent of specifications; approval of sources of supply for aggregates
and mineral filler.
(1) It is the intent of these specifications to secure a pavement that will
conform to the latest construction specifications of the Asphalt
Institute. The contractor shall submit samples with manufacturer's
specifications for the asphaltic-concrete mixtures he proposes to
use in the work, and these are to be examined and passed upon by
the testing agency engaged by the City. The contractor shall make
such changes in the formulas submitted as may be required by the
§ 104-11 CHARTER § 104-11
C:1859
testing agency in order that the mixture delivered and used in the
work will be such as to produce the pavement required.
(2) Approval of sources of supply for aggregates and mineral filler shall
be obtained from the Commissioner of the Department of Public
Works before being used in the mixture.

§ 104-12. Prescribed pavement.
For resurfacing over existing pavement, asphaltic-concrete pavement is
hereby prescribed, approved and adopted, the same to be in accordance
with the requirements set forth in this article.
§ 104-13. Asphaltic concrete on old bituminous pavement.
[Amended 7-3-1990 by L.L. No. 5-1990]
A. Preparation of old surface. Cleaning of the old pavement, adjusting of
manhole heads, patching holes and application of the tack coat as
required and as hereinafter specified shall be done sufficiently in
advance of placing the new wearing course so that this operation can
proceed without interruption. Special attention shall be given to
providing a well-compacted foundation for the new wearing course
around the manhole heads after adjusting.
B. Resurfacing procedure.
(1) On the old surface prepared as above shall be placed an asphalticconcrete
wearing course, two inches, more or less, in thickness
after compaction, on the existing pavement where and as directed

with asphaltic concrete compacted as directed before the new twoinch
wearing course is laid. Depressions over old sewer trenches or
elsewhere, if ordered, shall be filled up to the grade of the adjacent
pavement with a wedge course of asphaltic concrete thoroughly
rolled before the new two-inch wearing course is laid. The old
pavement shall be thoroughly cleaned and, if ordered by the
Commissioner of the Department of Public Works, treated with a
tack coat of liquid asphaltic product applied with a pressure
distributor at a rate of about 10/100 of a gallon per square yard or
as needed to ensure a thorough bond between the old road surface
and the new construction. Over the tack coat the contractor shall
spread asphaltic-concrete wearing course material, to be leveled,
raked and rolled with a ten-ton roller to the satisfaction of the
Commissioner of the Department of Public Works and feathered out
at the edges of the new work.
(2) At the discretion of the Commissioner of the Department of Public
Works, the tack coat may be omitted where there is sufficient life in
the old bituminous surface and resurfacing is two inches thick;
however, at all edges where the resurfacing course is to be
feathered out, the old pavement beneath shall be painted with the
tack coat material. Stone, brick and concrete gutters under the
resurfacing shall be similarly painted.

any holes found in the existing concrete foundation under
permanent pavements shall be filled in by the contractor with 1:3:5
concrete. At the discretion of the Commissioner, asphaltic-concrete
binder material may be used for this work instead of concrete.
(4) On curbed streets, the wearing course shall in general be raked out
along curbs so as to have a compressed thickness of about one inch.
Where the top of the curb is three inches or less above the existing
pavement in the gutter, the new wearing course shall be feathered
out and shall stop six inches from the curb or as directed by the
Commissioner.
C. Materials.
(1) In the wearing course, the graded stone aggregate mix shall
consist of a graded stone aggregate passing a one-half-inch screen
and all retained on a No. 10 screen, a graded fine aggregate of sand

C:1862
D. Tack coat. The tack coat shall be a quick-setting emulsified asphalt or
other type of liquid asphaltic product which, when applied to the
existing pavement, will ensure a thorough bond between the new
construction and the old road surface.
E. Spreading and rolling.
(1) Unless otherwise permitted by the Commissioner of the
Department of Public Works, the asphaltic concrete shall be placed
by means of a mechanical spreader so operated that the mixture as
spread is free from lumps, of uniform density and to the desired

§ 104-16. Prescribed types. [Amended 2-28-1950 by G.O. No.
6-1950]
For pavement base, the following types are hereby prescribed, approved
and adopted, all to be in accordance with the requirements set forth in this
article:
§ 104-17. Portland-cement concrete base.
§ 104-18. Broken-stone base.
A. Portland cement concrete.
B. Broken stone.
C. Asphalt macadam (penetration method).
A. Thickness. A portland-cement concrete base shall be six inches thick,
unless a greater thickness is called for on the plans or in the job
specifications.
B. Material. The concrete shall comply with all of the requirements of
standard city specifications for controlled concrete, Class D, using Type
I normal untreated portland cement. The size of the coarse aggregate
shall be two-inch to No. 4. The maximum allowable net water content
shall be eight gallons per sack of cement.
C. Joints. No longitudinal joints will be permitted unless specially ordered
by the Engineer, and transverse joints shall be made only at the end of
the day's work.
D. Finishing and curing.
(1) The surface shall be screeded and finished true to cross section
with its top surface parallel to and the required depth below the
finished pavement surface.
(2) Where the finished pavement is to be asphaltic concrete, the top of
the base shall be roughened slightly by raking to the satisfaction of
the Engineer, and the curing shall be done with an approved
bituminous material.
(3) Where the finished pavement is to be granite block, curing may be
done by other approved methods.
A. Broken-stone base shall be not less than three inches thick after
compaction and shall be of greater thickness if called for on the plans or
in the job specifications. It shall consist of one-and-one-half-inch trap
rock uniformly spread and compacted, after which trap rock
screenings, sand, or both, shall be applied in such quantities as to fill

C:1865
§ 104-19. Asphalt-macadam base (penetration method). [Amended
2-28-1950 by G.O. No. 6-1950]
the surface voids and thoroughly bind the course. After the material is
applied, it shall be thoroughly broomed in and rolled.
B. The base shall be constructed true to the cross section, with its top
surface parallel to and the required depth below the finished pavement
surface.
C. After the rolling is completed and before the application of the wearing
surface, the base course shall be primed by an application of 1/4 gallon
per square yard of asphalt cutback, Grade M.C. 4 for tank distribution
or Grade M.C. 1 for hand application.
A. Asphalt-macadam base shall be not less than three inches thick after
compaction and shall be of greater thickness if called for on the plans or
in the job specifications. It shall consist of a mixture of two parts of oneand-
one-half-inch and one part of three-fourths-inch trap rock uniformly
spread to such a depth that, after the application of the asphalt cement
and the small-size stone hereafter specified, the compacted base will be
of the thickness called for in the job specifications or directed by the
Engineer. The stone thus spread shall be thoroughly rolled with a tenton
power roller to the satisfaction of the Engineer. The surface shall be
left smooth, clean and of firm texture.
B. On this surface, when dry, the approved asphalt cement, heated to a
temperature of not less than 275° F. and not more than 350° F., shall be
applied to the amount of 1 1/4 gallons per square yard, unless this
quantity is changed by the Engineer. For this application of asphalt
cement, an approved pressure distributor shall be used, with a pressure
of 50 pounds per square inch or more as directed by the Engineer.
C. Immediately after the application of asphalt cement, three-eighths-inch
trap rock shall be spread over the surface in such quantity as to
completely fill the voids in the larger stone. This course shall then be
rolled, adding additional three-eighths-inch stone if necessary until
thorough compaction is secured and the surface is true to cross section
and in conformity with the established grade. Surplus three-eighthsinch
stone shall be broomed off before the wearing course is placed.
D. In the case of small jobs where it may be impractical to secure a
mixture of one-and-one-half-inch and three-fourths-inch sizes for the
large stone in the base, the use of one-and-one-half-inch stone may be
permitted at the discretion of the Engineer. Also on small jobs where
the use of hot asphalt cement is not practical, the Engineer may, at his
discretion, allow another type to be used.

of collection.

with a notice of violation for a vehicle whose registration plate number
is filed and the fee therefor paid prior to the time of issuance of a notice

plate number shall not be considered filed with the Office unless the

consideration in connection with such annual filing fee in the event that
such registration plate number is withdrawn from service, destroyed or

Office registration plate numbers during a fiscal year, the annual filing
fee for the same shall be prorated on a monthly basis in accordance

primary filing by each lessor for each fiscal year shall be made at least
30 days prior to the commencement of the fiscal year.
G. Where the United States postal authorities return to the Office a
delinquency notice forwarded by the Office to a name and address of a
lessee furnished by a lessor in accordance with provisions of this
section, such return notice shall be presumptive evidence of the
furnishing of an incorrect name and address by the lessor. The lessor
may, however, conclusively rebut such presumption if, within 60 days
after receiving notification from the Office of the returned mail notice,
the lessor shall provide to the Office a copy of the rental agreement or
lease agreement for such lessee containing the name and address
previously furnished to the Office. In the event that a lessor shall fail to
rebut the presumption established by this subsection, the lessor shall
be liable for all fines and penalties in accordance with the rules and
regulations promulgated by the Office.

during which the illegally parked vehicle was reported to any Police
Department as having been stolen, it shall be a valid defense to any charge
of a parking violation that the motor vehicle had been reported to the
police as stolen prior to the time the violation occurred and had not been
recovered by such time. For the purposes of asserting the defense provided
by this section, it shall be sufficient that a certified copy of the police report
of the stolen vehicle be mailed to the Office.

D. A respondent pleading not guilty or guilty with an explanation may
request a hearing. This shall be done at the time of pleading by
completing the reverse side of the notice of violation in accordance with
the instructions thereon.

guilty, the Office shall notify the person, in writing, by first-class mail, of
the date on which he must appear to answer the charge at a hearing to
be held by the Board. The form and content of such notice of hearing
shall be prescribed by the Director and shall contain a warning to
advise the person so pleading that failure to appear on the date
designated, or on any subsequent adjourned date, shall be deemed an
admission of liability and that a default judgment may be entered
thereon.
B. Whenever a plea of not guilty has been entered by a person in a timely
fashion and a hearing upon the merits has been demanded but has not
yet been held, the Office shall not issue any notice of fine or penalty to
the person prior to the date of the hearing.
C. Every hearing for the adjudication of a charge of a parking violation
shall be held before an ALJ in accordance with the rules and regulations
of the Board. All hearings shall be public. A respondent may be
represented by legal counsel. The ALJ shall not be bound by the rules of
evidence in the conduct of the hearing except rules relating to
privileged communications. No charges may be established except
upon proof by substantial evidence. All testimony shall be given under
oath or affirmation.
D. A record shall be made of every hearing either by stenographic
recordings or by mechanical or electronic methods as the Chief ALJ
shall determine. A transcript of such record shall be supplied to a
respondent on application and the payment of a fee as provided in the
rules of the Board and/or Office and payment of the cost of such
transcript.
E. The ALJ may, in his discretion or at the request of the respondent, on a
showing of good cause and need thereof, issue a subpoena to compel
the appearance at a hearing of the person who served the notice of
violation or of other persons to give testimony, and he may issue a
subpoena duces tecum to compel the production for examination or
introduction into evidence of any book, paper or other thing relevant to
the charges alleged.
F. In the case of a refusal to obey a subpoena, the Office may make
application to the Supreme Court pursuant § 2308 of the Civil Practice

§ 109-42. Final determinations; judgments.
G. The Office may, with or without the respondent's request or consent,
consolidate for hearing or appeal one or more charges pending against
such respondent. An adjournment may be requested by the respondent
up to 24 hours prior to the hearing, but not more than two
adjournments shall be granted except under extraordinary
circumstances.
A. The ALJ shall make a determination on the charges, either sustaining or
dismissing them. The ALJ shall not examine the prior violation record of
a person charged before making a determination. Where the ALJ
determines that the charges have been sustained, he may examine the
prior parking violations record prior to rendering a final determination.
Final determinations sustaining or dismissing charges shall be entered
on a final determination roll maintained by the Board, together with
records showing payment and nonpayment of penalties. A copy of such
judgment record or a transcript thereof may be filed in the office of the
Clerk of the City Court of Yonkers and/or in the office of the Clerk of the
County of Westchester and/or in such other county wherein the
respondent resides or is employed.
B. Where an operator or owner fails to enter a plea to a charge of a
parking violation or fails to appear on a designated hearing date or
subsequent adjourned date or fails, after a hearing, to comply with the
determination of an ALJ, as prescribed by this article, Charter Article
VIA, or by rule or regulation of the Board and/or the Office, such failure
to plead, appear or comply shall be deemed, for all purposes, an
admission of liability and shall be grounds for rendering and entering a
default judgment in an amount authorized by this chapter and the rules
and regulations of the Board and/or the Office.
C. Prior to rendering a default judgment after a failure to plead, appear or
comply, the Office shall notify the operator or owner, in writing, by firstclass
mail:
(1) Of the violation charged;
(2) Of the impending default judgment;
(3) That such judgment will be entered in the City Court of the City of
Yonkers or other court of civil jurisdiction or any other place
provided for the entry of civil judgments within the State of New
York; and
(4) That a default may be avoided by entering a plea or making an
appearance within 30 days of the sending of such notice.
D. Pleas entered or appearance made within the period authorized in
Subsection C of this section shall be in the manner prescribed in the
notice and not subject to additional penalty or fee. A notice of
impending default judgment shall not be required prior to the rendering
§ 109-41 CHARTER § 109-42

§ 109-45. Owner liability for failure of operator to comply with
traffic-control indications.
and entry thereof in the case of operators or owners who are
nonresidents of the State of New York. In no case shall a default
judgment be rendered or, where required, a notice of impending default
judgment be sent more than two years after the expiration of the time
prescribed for entering a plea. When a person has demanded a hearing,
no fine or penalty shall be imposed for any reason prior to the holding
of the hearing. If the hearing examiner shall make a determination on
the charges, sustaining them, he shall impose no greater penalty or fine
than those upon which the person was originally charged.
E. A judgment entered pursuant to the provisions of this section shall
remain in full force and effect for eight years, notwithstanding any
other provision of law.
A. In the event that a respondent shall have failed to comply with the
provisions of this chapter in that he has failed to pay final
determinations, judgments or default judgments for parking violations
entered against him on three or more notices of violations served upon
him within a period of 18 months, the Office shall certify such fact to the
Commissioner of Motor Vehicles of the State of New York; and upon
such certification, the Office shall notify the respondent by mail that
such certification has been made, identifying the judgments or final
determinations covered. The notification shall further inform the
respondent that the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles will deny any
registration or renewal of registration of the respondent's vehicle until
proof is provided that the respondent has complied with all judgments,
default judgments or final determinations so certified.
B. Upon payment by or on behalf of the respondent of all judgments or
determinations covered by the certification to the Motor Vehicle
Commissioner or upon the giving of proof that such judgments have
been paid, the Office shall issue a certificate attesting to the fact that
this chapter has been complied with, and such certificate shall be
delivered to the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles. The respondent shall
pay to the Office a fee of $10 for such certificate.
A. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Parking Violations
Office is hereby authorized and empowered to establish a
demonstration program imposing monetary liability on the owner of a
vehicle for failure of an operator thereof to comply with traffic-control
§ 109-42 YONKERS CODE § 109-45
C:1920
indications in accordance with the provisions of this section. The Traffic
Engineer, for purposes of implementation of such program, shall be
authorized to install and operate traffic-control signal photo violationmonitoring
devices at no more than 25 intersections at any one time.
B. Such demonstration program shall utilize necessary technologies to
ensure, to the extent practicable, that photographs produced by such
traffic-control signal photo violation-monitoring systems shall not
include images that identify the driver, the passengers, or the contents
of the vehicle; provided, however, that no notice of liability issued
pursuant to this section shall be dismissed solely because a photograph
or photographs allow for the identification of the contents of a vehicle,
provided that the City of Yonkers has made a reasonable effort to
comply with the provisions of this subsection.
C. The owner of a vehicle shall be liable for a penalty imposed pursuant to
this section if such vehicle was used or operated with the permission of
the owner, express or implied, in violation of Subdivision (d) of § 1111 of
the New York State Vehicle and Traffic Law, (hereinafter Vehicle and
Traffic Law) and such violation is evidenced by information obtained
from a traffic-control signal photo violation-monitoring system;
provided, however, that no owner of a vehicle shall be liable for a
penalty imposed pursuant to this section where the operator of such
vehicle has been convicted of the underlying violation of Subdivision (d)
of § 1111 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law.
D. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, no owner of a
vehicle shall be subject to a monetary fine imposed pursuant to this
section if the operator of such vehicle was operating such vehicle
without the consent of the owner at the time such operator failed to
obey a traffic-control indication. For purposes of this subsection, there
shall be a presumption that the operator of such vehicle was operating
such vehicle with the consent of the owner at the time such operator
failed to obey a traffic-control indication.
E. For purposes of this section, "owner" shall mean any person,
corporation, partnership, firm, agency, association, lessor, or
organization who at the time of the issuance of a notice of violation in
which a vehicle is operated:
(1) Is the beneficial or equitable owner of such vehicle; or
(2) Has title to such vehicle; or
(3) Is the registrant or co-registrant of such vehicle which is registered
with the Department of Motor Vehicles of the State of New York or
any other state, territory, district, province, nation or other
jurisdiction; or
(4) Uses such vehicle in its vehicle-renting and/or -leasing business; or
§ 109-45 CHARTER § 109-45
C:1921
(5) Is an owner of such vehicle as defined by § 128 or Subdivision (a) of
§ 2101 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law.
F. For purposes of this section, "traffic-control signal photo violationmonitoring
system" shall mean a device installed to work in conjunction
with a traffic-control signal which, during operation, automatically
produces two or more photographs, two or more microphotographs, a
videotape or other recorded images of each vehicle at the time it is used
or operated in violation of Subdivision (d) of § 1111 of the Vehicle and
Traffic Law.
G. A certificate, sworn to or affirmed by a technician employed by the
Traffic Engineer, or a facsimile thereof, based upon inspection of
photographs, microphotographs, videotape or other recorded images
produced by a traffic-control signal photo violation-monitoring system,
shall be prima facie evidence of the facts contained therein. Any
photographs, microphotographs, videotape or other recorded images
evidencing such a violation shall be available for inspection in any
proceeding to adjudicate the liability for such violation imposed
pursuant to this section.
H. An owner liable for a violation of Subdivision (d) of § 1111 of the Vehicle
and Traffic Law pursuant to this section shall be liable for monetary
penalties in accordance with a schedule of fines and penalties to be
promulgated by such Office. The liability of the owner pursuant to this
section shall not exceed $50 for each violation; provided, however, that
such Office may provide for an additional penalty not in excess of $25
for each violation for the failure to respond to a notice of liability within
the prescribed time period. Such Office shall adjudicate liability
imposed by this section.
I. An imposition of liability under this section shall not be deemed a
conviction as an operator and shall not be made part of the operating
record of the person upon whom such liability is imposed nor shall it be
used for insurance purposes in the provision of motor vehicle insurance
coverage.
J. A notice of liability shall be sent by first class mail to each person
alleged to be liable as an owner for a violation of Subdivision (d) of
§ 1111 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law pursuant to this section. Personal
service on the owner shall not be required. A manual or automatic
record of mailing prepared in the ordinary course of business shall be
prima facie evidence of the facts contained therein.
K. A notice of liability shall contain the name and address of the person
alleged to be liable as an owner for a violation of Subdivision (d) of
§ 1111 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law pursuant to this section, the
registration number of the vehicle involved in such violation, the
location where such violation took place, the date and time of such
violation and the identification number of the camera which recorded
the violation or other document locator number.
§ 109-45 YONKERS CODE § 109-45
C:1922
L. The notice of liability shall contain information advising the person
charged of the manner and the time in which he or she may contest the
liability alleged in the notice. Such notice of liability shall also contain a
warning to advise the persons charged that failure to contest in the
manner and time provided shall be deemed an admission of liability and
that a default judgment may be entered thereon.
M. The notice of liability shall be prepared and mailed by the Office or its
designee.
N. If an owner receives a notice of liability pursuant to this section for any
time period during which the vehicle was reported to the Police
Department as having been stolen, it shall be a valid defense to an
allegation of liability for a violation of Subdivision (d) of § 1111 of the
Vehicle and Traffic Law pursuant to this section that the vehicle had
been reported to the police as stolen prior to the time the violation
occurred and had not been recovered by such time. For purposes of
asserting the defense provided by this subsection, it shall be sufficient
that a certified copy of the police report on the stolen vehicle be sent by
first class mail, return receipt requested, to such Office.
O. If the owner liable for a violation of Subdivision (d) of § 1111 of the
Vehicle and Traffic Law pursuant to this section was not the operator of
the vehicle at the time of the violation, the owner may maintain an
action for indemnification against the operator.
P. An appeal of an adjudication of liability pursuant to this section may be
taken in accordance with this article.
Q. An owner who is a lessor of a vehicle to which a notice of liability was
issued pursuant to Subdivision H of this section shall not be liable for
the violation of Subdivision (d) of § 1111 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law,
provided that:
(1) Prior to the violation, the lessor has filed with the Office and paid
the required filing fee in accordance with the provisions of § 239 of
the Vehicle and Traffic Law; and
(2) Within 37 days after receiving notice from the Office of the date
and time of a liability, together with the other information
contained in the original notice of liability, the lessor submits to the
Office the correct name and address of the lessee of the vehicle
identified in the notice of liability at the time of such violation,
together with such other additional information contained in the
rental lease or other contract document, as may be reasonably
required by the Office pursuant to regulations that may be
promulgated for such purpose.
(3) Failure to comply with Subsection Q(1) or (2) of this section shall
render the owner liable for the penalty prescribed in this section.
§ 109-45 CHARTER § 109-45
C:1923
(4) Where the lessor complies with the provisions of this subsection,
the lessee of such vehicle on the date of such violation shall be
deemed to be the owner of such vehicle for purposes of this section,
shall be subject to liability for such violation pursuant to this
section and shall be sent a notice of liability pursuant to Subsection
H of this section.
R. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the liability of an
operator of a vehicle for any violation of Subdivision (d) of § 1111 of the
Vehicle and Traffic Law.
S. On or before October 1, 2009, and every four months thereafter, until
such time as the demonstration program authorized in Subsection A
hereof shall be fully operational, the Director of the Parking Violations
Office shall submit a written report to the City Council on the status of
said demonstration program. Such report shall include, but not be
limited to, the locations selected for inclusion in the demonstration
program and the cost to the City, both individually and collectively, of
each location included in such demonstration project.
T. The Director shall submit to the Governor, the temporary President of
the Senate, the Speaker of the Assembly and the City Council, an
annual report on the results of the use of a traffic-control signal photo
violation-monitoring system on or before July 1, 2010, and on the same
date in each succeeding year, in which the demonstration program is
operable. Such report shall include, but not be limited to:
(1) A description of the locations where traffic-control signal photo
violation-monitoring systems were used;
(2) The aggregate number, type and severity of accidents reported at
intersections where a traffic-control signal photo violationmonitoring
system is used for the year preceding the installation of
such system, to the extent the information is maintained by the
New York State Department of Motor Vehicles;
(3) The aggregate number, type and severity of accidents reported at
intersections where a traffic-control signal photo violationmonitoring
system is used, to the extent the information is
maintained by the New York State Department of Motor Vehicles;
(4) The number of violations recorded at each intersection where a
traffic-control signal photo violation-monitoring system is used and
in the aggregate on a daily, weekly and monthly basis;
(5) The total number of notices of liability issued for violations

(10) Quality of the adjudication process and its results.
U. It shall be a defense to any prosecution for a violation of Subdivision (d)
of § 1111 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law pursuant to this section that
such traffic-control indications were malfunctioning at the time of the
alleged violation.
V. This section will terminate, unless extended by the New York State
Legislature, on December 1, 2014.
W. Advance warning signs.
(1) Advance warning signs notifying motorists that traffic control
signal violation-monitoring devices are being utilized within the
City of Yonkers must be identified by appropriate advance warning

or public property or rapidly accelerating from a common starting point to
a speed in excess of such permitted speeds, shall be prima facie evidence of
"drag racing."

B. Exceptions.
(1) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, it shall constitute a
complete defense to the provisions of this article prohibiting
parking at a parking meter in excess of the time authorized by that
meter if:
§ 109-96 YONKERS CODE § 109-97
C:1940
§ 109-98. Placement of lines or marks to denote parking spaces.
The Traffic Engineer shall cause to be placed lines or marks on the curb
and/or on the street about or alongside of each parking meter and on the
surface or pavement of any parking lot or area operated by the City of
Yonkers or the City of Yonkers Parking Authority for which a charge is
imposed for the use of a parking space in such parking lot or area. It shall
be unlawful and an offense and a violation of this article to park any vehicle

same shall not be within the area so designated by such lines or marking.
§ 109-99. Loading and unloading within zones; bus stops and taxi
stands in zones.
Nothing in this article shall be construed as prohibiting the use of metered
parking zone spaces without payment by vehicles loading and unloading
merchandise, provided that such loading or unloading is done expeditiously
and during such hours as may be fixed by the Police Commissioner, nor
as prohibiting the Traffic Engineer from designating bus stops or taxicab
stands within such parking meter zones.
(a) The offending vehicle displays a special municipal parking
permit, as defined in and authorized by § 1203-a of the Vehicle
and Traffic Law of the State of New York and issued by a

State of New York, said registration being authorized to be
issued to a vehicle used for the transportation of a
handicapped person and depicting on the registration plate the
universal access symbol for handicapped persons;
(b) The offending vehicle is then currently being operated solely
by the handicapped permit holder or registrant without the
assistance of an able or nonhandicapped person; and

individual due to architectural barrier, temporary barrier, such
as ongoing construction or the accumulation of trash or
rubbish in the area of the meter, inclement weather resulting
in an insurmountable barrier of ice and/or snow or other
limitation imposed upon the handicapped parker solely due to
the handicapped status and condition of the parker.

parking for handicapped persons, and the defense authorized
herein shall not be available if a handicapped parking meter has
been installed and the handicapped parking meter could be
accessed.
§ 109-97 CHARTER § 109-100

emergency, the use of parking meters may be temporarily discontinued as
to particular parking spaces in said zones on the order of any officer of the

Any limitation made by the Traffic Engineer or Police Commissioner of the
time during which or the hours between which parking of vehicles shall
be permitted on any highway or part of a highway in the City of Yonkers
and any prohibition of the parking of vehicles on any highway or part of
highway where such limitations or prohibition is indicated by traffic signs
or stanchions placed or displayed on or adjacent to such highway or part of
a highway or posted or displayed on parking meters shall be effective and
in full force without any publication thereof.
§ 109-102. Presumption of unlawful parking.
The fact that the timing device on any parking meter installed in any
parking meter zone established by this article or hereafter established by
any other ordinance of the City of Yonkers is not in operation shall be
presumptive evidence as to a parked vehicle then found in the parking
space regulated by such parking meter that the owner, operator or driver
failed to deposit or to cause to be deposited the required coin or coins in
said meter, and the mechanical indication by such meter of a violation shall
be presumptive evidence of unlawful parking.
§ 109-103. Meter parking violations.
Failure to park a vehicle with the hood of such vehicle alongside of or next
to the parking meter alongside of such parking space and within the lines
marked on the street or curb designating such parking space or to deposit
such proper coin and to actuate the mechanism as required by directions
on the meter shall constitute an offense and violation of this article. Upon
the expiration of the legal parking time, it shall be the duty of the owner,
operator or driver of the vehicle forthwith to remove the vehicle from the
parking space, and it shall be unlawful and an offense and violation of this
article for the owner, operator or driver to allow said vehicle to remain
therein beyond the parking time limit prescribed by this article.

It shall be unlawful and an offense and a violation of this article for the
owner, operator or driver of any vehicle or for any other person to deposit in

It shall be unlawful and an offense and a violation of this article for any
unauthorized person to deface, injure, tamper with, open or willfully break,
destroy or impair the usefulness of any parking meter installed under the

§ 109-128. Residential Parking System, Tibbetts Brook Park area.
[Added 11-26-1996 by L.L. No. 15-1996]
C. The fee for any permit issued hereunder shall be $2 per vehicle to a
maximum of $2 per family, payable at the time of issuance and before

A. Authority. In accordance with § 1640-e of the Vehicle and Traffic Law of
the State of New York and this Code of the City of Yonkers, the City
Council hereby establishes a residential parking permit system in the
Tibbetts Brook Park area of the City of Yonkers, notwithstanding the
provisions of any law to the contrary.
B. Findings and purpose. The City Council has found and determined that
residents living in the vicinity of Tibbetts Brook Park in the City of
Yonkers, which is a county-owned and operated park, are suffering
interference with the tranquility and quiet enjoyment of their
neighborhood by reason of visitors and users to the county-owned park
who either cannot find or do not qualify for a parking space within the
county park facility and use the abutting residential streets for uses not
intended, including parking of vehicles during usage of the county park
and using the residential streets for changing of clothes, eating and
drinking and personal sanitation reasons. This use has resulted in
significant health and safety problems for the area residents, as well as
for the emergency vehicles requiring access to the residential area.
These factors necessitate the enactment of a residential parking system
for this area.
C. Exemption. This section shall not apply to motor vehicles registered
pursuant to § 400-a of the Vehicle and Traffic Law.
D. Restriction. No vehicle shall be parked in the area generally bounded
by Harrison Avenue, proceeding south from Tibbetts Brook Park to Alan
B. Shepard Place; Tibbetts Road, proceeding southerly from Tibbets
Brook Park to Alan B. Shepard Place; Sedgewick Avenue, proceeding
southerly from Tibbetts Brook Park to Alan B. Shepard Place; Jervis
Road, between Harrison Avenue and Sedgewick Avenue, and from the
northern intersection of Sedgewick Avenue, proceeding southerly along
Jervis Road to the Alan B. Shepard Place line; provided that said streets
do not abut properties which are zoned for commercial/retail; use for a
period of time in excess of 90 minutes, unless said vehicle has
prominently displayed a permit obtained from the Parking Violations
Bureau of Yonkers properly affixed to the automobile vehicle during the
§ 109-127 CHARTER § 109-128
C:1957
§ 109-129. Residential Parking System, Garrett Park Neighborhood.
hours from 8:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m., seven days per week, from April 1 to
and including October 31 of each and every year.
E. Permits; fees. The Parking Violations Bureau of the City of Yonkers shall
have available for issuance blank permits to be used in this area, at
least 20% of which shall be available to be purchased by nonresidents
of the Tibbetts Brook parking area. The permit fees shall be paid for any
calendar year or part thereof and be set as $5 for City residents and $10
for nonresidents of the City. The moneys received from said fees shall
be credited to the general fund of the City of Yonkers.

posted in this area advising the public of the restricted permit parking.
G. Penalties. A violation of this provision shall subject the violator to pay a
fine as set by the Parking Violations Bureau, or the City Council, from
time to time, not to exceed $65.
A. Authority. In accordance with § 1640-j of the Vehicle and Traffic Law of
the State of New York and this Code of the City of Yonkers, the City
Council of the City of Yonkers hereby establishes a residential parking
permit system in the Garrett Park neighborhood of the City of Yonkers,
notwithstanding the provisions of any law to the contrary.
B. Findings and purpose. The City Council has found and determined that
residents living in Garrett Park neighborhood are suffering interference
with the tranquility and quiet enjoyment of their neighborhood by
reason of visitors and users of the nearby Metro North Bronxville
Station, Lawrence Hospital and shoppers or employees of Bronxville
stores who cannot find parking spaces and who use the abutting
Yonkers residential streets as a free and convenient alternative while
shopping or working in Bronxville or commuting to Manhattan. This use
has resulted in a significant safety problem for area residents as well as
for emergency vehicles requiring access to the residential area. These
factors necessitate the enactment of a residential parking system for
this area.
C. Exemption. This section shall not apply to motor vehicles registered
pursuant to § 400-a of the Vehicle and Traffic Law.
D. Restriction. No vehicles shall be parked in the area generally bounded
within the Garrett Park area of the City of Yonkers which shall mean
that area encompassing Palmer Road, from Parkview Avenue to
Bronxville Road; Garrett Place; Parkview Avenue from Palmer Road to
103 Parkview Avenue, north of Pondfield Road West; Pondfield Road
West from Bronxville Road to the Bronxville Border and Gard Avenue
from Pondfield Road West to 19 Gard Avenue, north of Pondfield Road

C:1958
§ 109-130. Residential parking system in Yonkers Raceway/Empire
City neighborhood. [Added 10-27-2009 by L.L. No. 9-2009]
a permit obtained from the Parking Violations Bureau of Yonkers
properly affixed to the automobile or vehicle during the hours from 7:00
a.m. to 11:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m., Monday through Friday,
each week.
E. Permit fees. The Parking Violations Bureau of the City of Yonkers shall
have available for issuance blank permits to be used in this area, which
shall be available to be purchased by any resident whose residence is
within the Garrett Park area as defined in Subsection D above or on
Bronxville Road from Palmer Road to West Pondfield Road. The permit
fees shall be paid for any calendar year or part thereof and be set at
$25. The moneys received from said fees shall be credited to the
general fund of the City of Yonkers.
F. The City of Yonkers shall post appropriate signs to be conspicuously
posted in the area advising the public of the restricted permit parking.
G. Penalties. A violation of this provision shall subject the violator to pay a
fine as set by the Parking Violations Bureau, or the City Council, from
time to time not to exceed $65.
A. Authority. In accordance with § 1640-e of the Vehicle and Traffic Law of
the State of New York and this Code of the City of Yonkers, the City
Council of the City of Yonkers hereby establishes a residential parking
permit system in the Yonkers Raceway/Empire City neighborhood of the
City of Yonkers, notwithstanding the provisions of any law to the
contrary.
B. Findings and purpose. The City Council has found and determined that
residents living in Yonkers Raceway/Empire City neighborhood are
suffering interference with the tranquility and quiet enjoyment of their
neighborhood by reason of patrons, employees and users of the nearby
Yonkers Raceway/Racino who do not use the complimentary parking
spaces and shuttle services available at the Raceway/Racino and who
use the abutting Yonkers residential streets as a free and convenient
alternative, despite the availability of free self-parking, valet parking
and continuous shuttle service to the parking spaces. These users park
on the nearby streets for the perceived convenience and accessibility to
the Raceway/Racino. The resulting lack of parking for 260 residents on
the streets near their homes in this area has led to traffic hazards,
congestion, noise pollution and litter and debris on the streets,
sidewalks and lawns. These factors necessitate the enactment of a
residential parking system for the residents of this neighborhood.
C. Exemption. This section shall not apply to motor vehicles registered
pursuant to § 400-a of the Vehicle and Traffic Law.
§ 109-129 CHARTER § 109-130
C:1959
D. Restriction. Unless said vehicle has prominently displayed a permit,
obtained from the Parking Violations Bureau of the City of Yonkers,
properly affixed to the automobile, allowing parking in said area, for the

day of the year, no vehicles shall be parked in the area generally
bounded within the Yonkers Raceway/ Empire City area of the City of
Yonkers consisting of the following roadways:
(1) Belmont Avenue from Orient Street to Yonkers Avenue;
(2) Boone Street from Central Park Avenue to dead end;
(3) Clark Street from Central Park Avenue to Orient Street;
(4) Loring Avenue from Central Park Avenue to Orient Street; and
(5) Chamberlain Avenue from Belmont Avenue to Central Park Avenue.
E. Permit fees. The Parking Violations Bureau of the City of Yonkers shall
have available for issuance blank permits to be used in this area, at
least 20% of which shall be available to be purchased by nonresidents
of the Raceway/Empire City parking area. The permit fees shall be paid
for any calendar year or part thereof and be set as $25 for residents and
$50 for nonresidents of the City. The moneys received from said fees
shall be credited to the general fund of the City of Yonkers.
F. The City of Yonkers shall post appropriate signs to be conspicuously
posted in the area advising the public of the restricted permit parking.
G. Penalties. A violation of this provision shall subject the violator to pay a
fine not to exceed $70.

displayed at the starting point of the bus and upon a sign attached to the
front of the bus before the trip starts. A charge greater or an attempt to

be deemed a violation of this chapter. The owner or agent shall deliver to
all passengers, upon payment of the fare, a printed receipt indicating the
amount of fare paid and the time scheduled for the bus to leave the starting
point. Each bus shall have conspicuously displayed two signs showing the

taxicab shall remain in the driver's compartment or immediately adjacent to
the vehicle when such driver is in the course of or actually hired as a fare at
all times when such vehicle is upon the public street. Nothing herein shall
be held to prohibit any driver from alighting to the street or sidewalk for the
purpose of assisting passengers into or out of such vehicle.
§ 110-95. Prohibited solicitation.
No driver shall solicit patronage in a loud or annoying tone of voice, by
sign or in any manner which annoys any person or obstructs the movement
of any person, nor shall any driver follow any person for the purpose of
soliciting patronage, or hire or permit or cause another person to do any of
the foregoing.
§ 110-96. Receipt and discharge of passengers.

of the roadway in the absence of a sidewalk.
§ 110-97. Cruising prohibited.
Cruising is prohibited and shall not be practiced by any driver, operator
or owner licensed under this chapter. No Class A taxicab, while awaiting
employment by passengers, shall stand on any public street or place other
than at or upon a public Class A taxicab stand designated or established in
accordance with this chapter, nor shall any driver of such Class A taxicab
seek employment by repeatedly and persistently driving the vehicle to and
fro in a short space before or otherwise interfere with the proper and
orderly access to or egress from any theater, hall, hotel, public resort or
railway station.
§ 110-98. Solicitation of other common carrier passengers.

assembled at the termini of any other common carrier, nor at any
intermediate points along any established route of such carrier, when such

with response to any call for a Class A taxicab made by a signal from a
§ 110-94 CHARTER § 110-98

§ 110-99. Restriction on number of passengers.
No driver shall permit more persons to be carried in a Class A taxicab than
the designated seating capacity of the manufacturer for adult passengers
in the front- and rear-seat compartments. A child under the age of seven
years shall not be counted as a passenger, and no fare will be charged for
such child when accompanied by an adult. No driver shall drive any Class
A taxicab when such Class A taxicab is so loaded or when there are in the

No driver shall refuse or neglect to convey any orderly person or persons,
upon request, to any place or places within the City unless previously
engaged or unable to do so or forbidden by the provisions of this chapter to
do so. However, drivers are not required to convey passengers who, because
of overindulgence in intoxicants, are unable to take care of themselves and
are helpless as a result of intoxication, unless that person is accompanied
by another passenger in a sober condition who assumes the care and
responsibility for such passenger. This shall not be construed as permitting
the driver to evade the prompt and safe transporting and caring for the
aged, invalid, injured or sick and other persons who cannot make ready use
of other carriers.

permitting the hiring of such vehicles for expressage purposes only.

exclusive use of Class A taxicabs awaiting passengers. Such stands shall be
marked by a metal sign on a post at the head and rear of the stands, which
shall also designate the number of Class A taxicabs allowed thereon. Private
or commercial vehicles shall not be permitted to park in the spaces so
reserved. It shall be the duty of the Police Commissioner to create as many
Class A taxicab stands as are found to be needed. Public convenience and
necessity shall determine whether additional Class A taxicab stands shall be
created. The Police Commissioner may promulgate such rules, regulations

the use of Class A taxicab stands, and the Commissioner may establish
additional stands for night use only.
§ 110-106. Parking regulations.
Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as prohibiting the parking or
standing of Class A taxicabs where parking is generally permitted, other
than on authorized Class A taxicab stands, when said Class A taxicab is not
being used in the solicitation or accepting of business. No Class A taxicab
shall be permitted to park within a radius of one block of any Class A taxicab
stand except on such stand.
§ 110-107. Operation on stands.
Only Class A taxicabs in such numbers as are set forth on the metal signs,

of a Class A taxicab standing at the head of a parked line shall not be
permitted to refuse to carry any orderly person who offers to hire such Class
A taxicab and agrees to pay the proper rate fare; provided, however, that
the foregoing provisions shall not be construed to prevent any person from
selecting any Class A taxicab he or she may desire on the stand, whether it
is at the head of the line or not. As the Class A taxicab leaves the parked line
with passengers, those in the rear shall move up, and any Class A taxicab
seeking space on such stand shall not approach the same except from the
rear thereof and shall move up as closely as possible to the last car on said
parked line.

Owners, operators and drivers of Class A taxicabs licensed under the
provisions of this chapter shall operate only from or do business at Class
A taxicab stands designated by the Police Commissioner, provided that
nothing herein contained shall be construed to prohibit any noncruising
Class A taxicab from accepting employment while driving through a public
street or place as provided in § 110-97 of Article IX of this chapter.

utilized by anyone.

another premises.
D. The City of Yonkers Parking Authority and one- and two-family

motor vehicle as well as the color, make, year and model of the vehicle.
The Police Department shall provide phone numbers for such
notification. Also, the person booting and immobilizing the vehicles

window or windshield of any vehicle that has been booted or
immobilized. Said notice shall, at a minimum, contain information that
the vehicle has been booted and shall also contain the name, address
and telephone number of the person or entity to contact to release the
vehicle. Placing the notice under the windshield wiper blades will not
satisfy the requirements of this section.
H. The Police Department shall promulgate regulations regarding the use
of booting and immobilization devices. No boot or immobilization
device may be used without such device first being registered with the
Yonkers Police Department. Any registered device under this article
shall not be used anywhere in the City of Yonkers unless and until a
copy of the key, combination or releasing mechanism or tool is provided
to the Yonkers Police Department. The Police Department shall also
promulgate regulations regarding the use of any key, combination or
releasing mechanism or tool.

after payment of any fees still remains with the person who placed it on
