the relevant evidence and to provide the opportunity for evidence to be

the original term. Should the Council fail to fill the vacancy within thirty
(30) days of publication of the notice of the vacancy, the Mayor shall do so by

vacancies to fewer than four (4), the remaining members, by a majority vote,
shall appoint additional members to raise the membership to four (4), thereby
achieving a quorum. Any remaining vacancies shall be filled as set forth above.
   (e)   Vacancies Not Covered.  In any case where a vacancy cannot be filled

shall apply.

CHAPTER 209
Public Records Policy
209.01   Introduction.
209.02   Public records.
209.03   Record requests.
209.04   Costs for public records.
209.05   E-mail.
209.06   Failure to respond to a public records request.
209.07   Destruction of public records.
209.01  INTRODUCTION.
   It is the policy of the City of New Carlisle that openness leads to a better
informed citizenry, which leads to better government and better public policy.
It is the policy of the City of New Carlisle to strictly adhere to the state's
Public Records Act. All exemptions to openness are to be construed in their
narrowest sense and any denial of public records in response to a valid request
must be accompanied by an explanation, including legal authority, as outlined
in the Ohio Revised Code. If the request is in writing, the explanation must
also be in writing.
(Ord. 08-21.  Passed 5-5-08.)
209.02  PUBLIC RECORDS.
   (a)   This office, in accordance with the Ohio Revised Code, defines records
as including the following: Any document – paper, electronic (including, but
not limited to, e-mail), or other format – that is created or received by, or
comes under the jurisdiction of a public office that documents the
organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other
activities of the office. All records of (this office) are public unless they
are specifically exempt from disclosure under the Ohio Revised Code.
   (b)   It is the policy of the City of New Carlisle that, as required by Ohio
law, records will be organized and maintained so that they are readily
available for inspection and copying (See Section
209.05 for the e-mail record policy). Record retention schedules are to be
updated regularly.
(Ord. 08-21.  Passed 5-5-08.)
209.03  RECORD REQUESTS.
   Each request for public records should be evaluated for a response using the
following guidelines:
   (a)   Although no specific language is required to make a request, the
requester must at least identify the records requested with sufficient clarity
to allow the public office to identify, retrieve, and review the records. If it
is not clear what records are being sought, the person responsible for that
particular department's records must contact the requester for clarification,
and should assist the requestor in revising the request by informing the
requestor of the manner in which the office keeps its records.
   (b)   The requester does not have to put a records request in writing, and
does not have to provide his or her identity or the intended use of the
requested public record. It is the City's general policy that this information
is not to be requested.
   (c)   Public records are to be available for inspection during regular
business hours, with the exception of published holidays. Public records must
be made available for inspection promptly. Copies of public records must be
made available within a reasonable period of time. "Prompt" and "reasonable"
take into account the volume of records requested, the proximity of the
location where the records are stored, and the necessity for any legal review
of the records requested.
   (d)   (1)   Each request should be evaluated for an estimated length of time
required to gather the records. Routine requests for records should be
satisfied as soon as feasible to do so.
      (2)   All requests for public records must either be satisfied (see (d)
(1) above) or be acknowledged in writing by the City of New Carlisle within a
reasonable time following the City's receipt of the request. If a request is
deemed significantly beyond "routine," such as seeking a voluminous number of
copies or requiring extensive research, the acknowledgment must include the
following:
         A.   An estimated number of business days it will take to satisfy the
request.
         B.   An estimated cost if copies are requested.
         C.   Any items within the request that may be exempt from disclosure.
   (e)   Any denial of public records requested must include an explanation,
including legal authority. If portions of a record are public and portions are
exempt, the exempt portions are to be redacted and the rest released. If there
are redactions, each redaction must be accompanied by a, supporting
explanation, including legal authority.
(Ord. 08-21.  Passed 5-5-08.)
209.04  COSTS FOR PUBLIC RECORDS.
   Those seeking public records will be charged only the actual cost of making
copies. 
   (a)   The charge for paper copies is 10 cents per page.
   (b)   The charge for downloaded computer files to a compact disc is $1 per
disc.
   (c)   There is no charge for documents e-mailed.
   (d)   Requesters may ask that documents be mailed to them. They will be
charged the actual cost of the postage and mailing supplies.
(Ord. 08-21.  Passed 5-5-08.)
209.05  E-MAIL.
   Documents in electronic mail format are records as defined by the Ohio
Revised Code when their content relates to the business of the office. E-mail
is to be treated in the same fashion as records in other formats and should
follow the same retention schedules.
   (a)   Records in private e-mail accounts used to conduct public business are
subject to disclosure, and all employees or representatives of this office are
instructed to retain their e-mails that relate to public business (see Section
209.02 Public Records) and to copy them to their business e-mail accounts or
print a hard copy of said e-mail and retain in the same fashion as other
records.
   (b)   E-mails from private accounts are to be treated as records of the
public office, and should be filed in the appropriate way, retaining them per
established schedules and making them available for inspection and copying in
accordance with the Public Records Act.
   (c)   Both the sender and the recipient of any e-mail that relates to public
business are equally responsible for maintaining proper records retention.
(Ord. 08-21.  Passed 5-5-08; Ord. 10-45.  Passed 11-15-10.)
209.06  FAILURE TO RESPOND TO A PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST.
   The City of New Carlisle recognizes the legal and non-legal consequences of
failure to properly respond to a public records request. In addition to the
distrust in government that failure to comply may cause, the City's failure to
comply with a request may result in a court ordering the City to comply with
the law and to pay the requester attorney's fees and damages.
(Ord. 08-21.  Passed 5-5-08.)
209.07   DESTRUCTION OF PUBLIC RECORDS.
   The City adopted  a records retention schedule in February 2005.  All public
records are maintained and destroyed according to this schedule.
(Ord. 09-36.  Passed 8-3-09.)

   Motions of Council shall be used only to expedite the orderly transaction of
business of Council and shall not be substituted for resolutions or ordinances.
The form of a motion shall be, “I move that...” followed by the substance of
the motion. A second shall be required for any motion except as specifically
provided for in this chapter. Upon a demand by any member of Council, a motion
shall be reduced to writing by the Clerk of Council. Any such motion may be
withdrawn by the maker before it has been amended or voted upon. When a motion
is made, it shall be stated by the presiding officer before any debate is in
order. All motions which have been entertained by the presiding officer shall
be entered upon the minutes of the Council meeting.
(Res. 82-05.  Passed 6-7-82.)
210.13   PRECEDENCE AND PROCEDURE OF MOTIONS.
   (a)   When a question is before Council, no motion shall be entertained
except the following, and they shall have precedence in the order in which they
are set forth in this subsection:
      (1)   To adjourn.  A motion to adjourn shall be put to a vote without
debate. Such motion shall be in order at any time without a second except as
follows:
         A.   When repeated without intervening business or discussion;
         B.   When made as an interruption of a member while speaking;
         C.   When the previous questions have been ordered; or
         D.   While a vote is being taken.
      (2)   To fix the hour of adjournment.  The motion to fix the hour of
adjournment shall be debatable only as to the time of such adjournment.
      (3)   For the previous question.  A motion for the previous question to
request that discussion end and that any motion being considered be voted upon
shall require a majority vote of the Council members present. Such motion shall
be considered only once and may be renewed after intervening business. Such
motion shall take precedence over all debatable questions. When the previous
question is moved and seconded by another member, the presiding officer shall
state, “Shall the main question be now put?” There shall be no further
amendment or debate, but pending amendments shall be put in their order before
the main question. If the question, “Shall the main question be now put?” is
decided in the negative, the main question remains debatable before Council.
      (4)   To lay on the table.  A motion to lay on the table (to table) shall
dispose finally of all legislation against which it is invoked, but a motion to
lay on a pending amendment to an ordinance or resolution shall not carry the
ordinance or resolution with it. The motion to lay on the table shall require a
majority vote of the Council members present.
      (5)   To postpone to a certain date.  A motion to postpone to a certain
date shall require a majority vote of the Council members present. Such motion
shall be subject to reconsideration, may be renewed after intervening business,
shall be debatable as to the propriety of the postponement, but not upon the
merits of the legislation, and may be amended by changing the date. Upon the
arrival of the date to which action upon legislation has been postponed, the
legislation shall be considered in the regular order of business.
      (6)   To postpone indefinitely. A motion to postpone indefinitely shall
have the same effect as the motion to lay on the table and shall require a
majority vote of all the Council members present. Such motion shall not be
reconsidered, shall be debatable, shall open the legislation to debate, may be
renewed after intervening business, may not be amended or laid on the table and
shall be subject to the previous question.
      (7)   To refer to a committee. 
      (8)   To amend.  A motion to amend shall be susceptible to only one
amendment. Once rejected an amendment may not be moved again in the same form.
   (b)   All motions, unless otherwise provided for in subsection (a) hereof,
are debatable.
   (c)   Any Council member may call for a division of the question for
decision, or the presiding officer may direct the same. In either case, a
question shall be divided if it comprehends parts so distinct that, one being
taken away, the other will stand as an entire question.
   (d)   A question of privilege shall have precedence over all questions
except a motion to adjourn. Questions of privilege shall be considered in the
following order:
      (1)   Those affecting the rights of Council collectively, its safety and
dignity and the integrity of its proceedings; and
      (2)   Those affecting the rights, the reputation and the conduct of the
individual members of Council in their capacity as Council members.
(Res. 82-05.  Passed 6-7-82.)
210.14   VOTING.
   (a)   Quorum.  A majority of Council members must be present at any meeting
for official and valid business to be conducted, except as otherwise provided
by the Municipal Charter.
   (b)   Voting Procedure.  Voting on all proposed legislation and motions
shall be oral and in open Council. The Clerk of Council shall call the roll,
beginning with the member seated to the left of the member who made the motion.
A member may signify approval with a “yes” vote or disapproval with a “no” vote
or may choose to abstain. If a member chooses to abstain, he or she shall
state, “I abstain because...,” indicating the reasons for the abstention, which
reasons may include, but not be limited to, the following:
      (1)   Such member feels his or her vote would constitute a conflict of
interest.
      (2)   Such member was not present at the previous meeting (re: minutes).
      (3)   Such member is prohibited from voting on a question by Section
4.07(a) of the Municipal Charter.
   No other comments shall be in order during the voting procedure. The Clerk
shall announce the result and the vote immediately after the roll call.
(Res. 82-05.  Passed 6-7-82.)
   (c)   Absences.  (EDITOR'S NOTE: Subsection (c) was repealed by Resolution
97-09R, passed December 15, 1997.)
   (d)   Voting on Suspension of Rules.  A suspension of the Rules of Council
set forth in this chapter shall require a two-thirds vote of the Council
members present.
   (e)   Dissent from Majority Opinion.  Any member of Council may dissent or
protest a decision of the majority of Council, an ordinance, a resolution or a
motion, and may have that dissent entered into record. Such dissent may be
verbal or written and shall be presented at the next regular meeting following
the action on such ordinance, resolution or motion.
   (f)   Reconsideration.  Any member of Council who voted with the prevailing
side on a vote on a given action of Council may move a reconsideration of that
action, provided that the motion is made not later than the next regular
meeting after the action was taken.
   A motion to reconsider shall be in order at any time except when a motion on
another subject is standing.
   A motion to reconsider, being laid on the table, may be taken up and acted
upon at any time Council is engaged in the transaction of miscellaneous
business.
   No motion to reconsider shall be made more than once on any matter or
subject, and the same number of votes is required to reconsider the action of
Council as is required to pass or adopt the same.
   No motion, resolution or ordinance, having been voted upon, shall be
reintroduced within ninety days, unless a majority of Council members concurs.
(Res. 82-05.  Passed 6-7-82.)
210.15   COMMITTEES.
   Council may appoint committees or establish a Committee of the Whole for any
purpose Council deems necessary. Such committees shall exist only until their
work is completed.
(Res. 82-05.  Passed 6-7-82.)
210.16   EFFECT OF CHARTER.
   (a)   The Rules of Council set forth in this chapter acknowledge the
existence of the Municipal Charter.
   (b)   In the case of a conflict between such Rules and such Charter, the
Charter shall prevail.
(Res. 82-05.  Passed 6-7-82.)
210.17   ROBERT'S RULES OF ORDER.
   In the absence of a Council rule or Municipal Charter provision upon a
matter of business, Council shall be governed by Robert's Rules of Order.
(Res. 82-05.  Passed 6-7-82.)
210.18   AMENDMENTS TO RULES.
   Any of the Rules of Council, as set forth in this chapter, may be amended by
a two-thirds vote of the Council members present at a regular meeting where
such amendment is presented. The proposition to amend such a  Rule shall be in
the form of a resolution, introduced at one meeting and read and acted upon at
the next regular meeting.

(Res. 80-23R.  Passed 11-17-80; Ord. 05-15.  Passed 4-4-05; Ord. 07-04.  Passed

220.03   PROCEDURE FOR PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS; SALARY ADJUSTMENTS.
   (a)   The following procedure is established to enable the members of
Council to evaluate the performance of the City Manager. A salary review shall
also occur at the time of each evaluation.
      (1)   The first evaluation shall occur following the initial six months
of employment or as near thereto as practical. The next evaluation shall occur
following the initial twelve months of employment, and each evaluation
thereafter shall occur after each subsequent twelve months of employment or as
near thereto as practical.
      (2)   The relationship between the City Manager and the Council is
unique, being the point where the administration and the policy body come
together.  The relationship requires that trust, confidence and accuracy always
characterize the dealing of either with the other.  When these qualities exist,
it is necessary that both the Council and the City Manager continue to deal
with each other on such a good basis.  When these qualities do not exist, both
the Council and the City Manager need to explore frankly with the other whether
the relationship can be repaired.  If it cannot, then both need to plan for the
City to enter a transition which will result in a new City Manager being hired.
      (3)   Both Council and the City Manager shall fill out forms which shall
be jointly for this purpose.  These completed forms shall be copied and
circulated for study by all Council members and the City Manager.  If it
desires, Council may meet and prepare an integrated form for this purpose.
      (4)   The Council and the City Manager shall then meet in executive
session to discuss the forms and their relationship.  As part of this session,
new and different directions desired will be discussed, as will salary and
benefits.  Decisions shall be implemented through normal procedures.
      (5)   Copies of evaluations shall be maintained in the City Manager's
personnel file and Council files.
      (6)   At any time, any member of Council or the City Manager may submit a
supplemental evaluation if there is an item, either good or bad, which he or
she feels should be discussed about the relationship between Council and the
City Manager.

   (c)   (EDITOR'S NOTE: Subsection (c) was repealed by Ordinance 86-41, passed

   (d)   The City Manager shall be entitled to a period of paid vacation of
four weeks per calendar year. Such vacation will be awarded in full at the
beginning of each calendar year. The City Manager is encouraged to avail
himself or herself of the vacation period. Any vacation that is unused at the
end of a calendar year can be carried over to the next year or paid as
compensation. Vacation may accrue to a maximum of 8 weeks (two years of
accumulation). Vacation that is awarded during a calendar year will be pro-
rated, for compensation purposes, upon termination for that year only.

her designee may make the award of interim deposits in accordance with Ohio
R.C. 135.09.
(Res. 87-12R.  Passed 8-3-87.)
220.06   MUTUAL AID AGREEMENTS.
   The City Manager is hereby authorized to enter into, on behalf of the City,
from time to time as deemed necessary, agreements with other governmental
entities providing for mutual aid in the case of fire or other emergency
services. Such agreements are hereby ratified.
(Ord. 89-05.  Passed 3-6-89.)
220.07   PARTICIPATION IN STATE COOPERATIVE PURCHASING PROGRAM.

Administrative Services, Office of State Purchasing, prescribes. Such terms and
conditions may include a reasonable fee to cover the administrative costs which
the Department incurs as a result of the City's participation in a contract.
Further, the City Manager hereby agrees to be bound by all such terms and
conditions.
   (c)   The City Manager is hereby authorized to agree in the name of the City

240.01   PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Citizens' Participation Plan adopted under this chapter
is to provide a means and process for full and meaningful participation by the
residents of the Municipality in the process of applying for, expending and
evaluating the success of the expenditure of funds provided under the 1974
Housing and Community Development Act.
(Ord. 8-78.  Passed 2-20-78.)
240.02   POLICY.
   The general policy of the Citizens' Participation Plan adopted under this
chapter is to:
   (a)   Provide all residents of the Municipality with adequate information
concerning the amount of funds available for proposed community development and
housing activities, the range of activities which may be undertaken and other
important requirements under the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974;
   (b)   Hold public meetings and formal public hearings to obtain the views of
the residents of the Municipality on community development and housing needs;
and
   (c)   Provide residents of the Municipality with adequate opportunities to
participate in the development of the application of the Plan and the
evaluation of activities undertaken under the Plan each year.
   However, it is expressly understood that no part of such policy shall be
construed to restrict the responsibility and authority of Council for the
development of the application and the execution of plans and activities under
such Housing and Community Development Act.
(Ord. 8-78.  Passed 2-20-78.)
240.03   ORGANIZATION; COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT CITIZENS' ADVISORY COMMITTEE.
   In order to carry out the policy set forth in Section
240.02, the following guidelines for citizens' participation are hereby
adopted:
   (a)   The official citizens' group for fulfilling the citizens'
participation requirement under the 1974 Housing and Community Development Act
shall be the Community Development Citizens' Advisory Committee.
   (b)   Membership on such Committee is open to all residents and property
owners in the Municipality. Membership shall be open to all persons meeting
such qualifications, regardless of race, creed, color, sex, age, or place of
national origin.
   (c)   The exact size of the Committee shall be determined by Council.
However, the Committee shall be large enough to give adequate representation to
all significant segments and sectors of the community and to provide a true
cross- section of all segments of the Municipality's population. The Committee
shall be small enough to be a functioning working body.
   (d)   Members of the Committee shall be recommended by the Mayor and
appointed to the Committee by Council. In making appointments to the Committee,
the City Manager and Council shall attempt to secure as wide a representation
of all significant segments in the community as is feasible. The appointing
officials shall attempt to secure, at a minimum, representation from the
following groups::
      (1)   Business;
      (2)   Persons of low and moderate income;
      (3)   Manufacturing;
      (4)   Education;
      (5)   Minorities;
      (6)   Youths;
      (7)   Elderly persons;
      (8)   Service organizations;
      (9)   Government;
      (10)   Homeowners;
      (11)   Tenants; and
      (12)   Other significant subsectors or groups within the community which
may be identified from time to time.
   (e)   In making appointments to the Committee, the Manager and Council shall
not discriminate against an eligible person on the basis of race, creed, color,
sex, age, or place of national origin.
   (f)   The length of the term of all appointees to the Committee shall be
determined by Council, but the determination of length of service shall not be
discriminatory. The Manager and Council shall be responsible for filling all
vacancies which occur on the Committee.
   (g)   The Committee shall be responsible for determining its own method of
organization and operation, including meeting times, officers, parliamentary
procedure, committees, etc.
240.04   OPERATION; APPLICATIONS TO FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.
   (a)   In order to accomplish the purpose and general policy of the Citizens'
Participation Plan, as set forth in Sections
240.01 and
240.02, the Community Development Citizens' Advisory Committee, in conjunction
with the Mayor and Council, shall, at a minimum, undertake the following steps:
      (1)   Not later than two weeks after notification to the Municipality by
the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development of the filing
date for a pre-application to the Department, Municipal officials shall
schedule a meeting with the Committee to begin the process of applying for
funds. Such meeting shall take place within four weeks of such notification. At
the meeting, the Municipal officials shall present to the Committee proposed
funding levels and preliminary plans and/or suggestions for activities. The
Municipality shall also present proposed activities to inform the general
populace of the Municipality about the program, its funding levels, eligible
activities and important program requirements. The Committee shall respond to
these preliminary activity proposals and present to the Municipality any
request for additions, deletions or modifications in the proposed action plan.
If no response thereto is received by the Municipality from the Committee
within thirty days (or such shorter time as the United States Department of
Housing and Urban Development application dates may dictate) from the date of
presentation, the Municipality shall deem that all proposed actions and
programs are accepted and proceed with the pre-application process, including
public hearings and the information program. During this period of formulation
of programs and activities, the Municipality shall make available, to the
Committee, Municipal staff and consultants (if applicable) to assist the
Committee in formulating and reviewing programs.
      (2)   Prior to the submission of the pre-application to Council, the
Municipality shall submit the proposed activities to the Committee for
approval. If the Committee withholds approval, it must furnish reasons for such
action in writing to Council within one week of the submission of the
activities to the Committee.
      (3)   Prior to the submission of the pre-application to the Department,
Council shall call and hold two public hearings for the purpose of soliciting
public opinion concerning the pre-application.  Council shall give sufficient
public notice of such meeting, its purpose, funding levels and other pertinent
information in the popular media. As used in this section, “popular media”
means newspapers of general circulation in the area, radio, television,
displays in public places, etc. All these methods need not be used, but the
information must be readily noticeable and available to the public.
      (4)   Subsequent to the receipt from the Department of notice that the
pre- application has been received by it and accepted for processing, Council
shall publish a notice in the popular media to this effect and informing the
public that the pre-application is available for review by citizens. Such
notice shall state the location and times that the application is available for
review.
      (5)   Subsequent to the approval of the pre-application by the
Department, Council shall inform the Committee of such approval, the activities
approved and the timetable for submission of a full application.
   Upon completion of the draft of the full application for submission for A-95
review, Council shall submit a copy thereof to the Committee for review and
comment. The Committee shall have thirty days for such review and comment.
Comments, if any, shall be made in writing to Council and shall be considered
thereby prior to the submission of the full application to the Department.
      (6)   Three months prior to the end of a program year, Council shall
submit a report to the Committee detailing progress on activities undertaken
during the program year. Such report shall indicate program progress in
quantifiable terms and shall provide an evaluation of present and expected
results. The Committee shall receive the report and provide comments, if any,
to Council on the year's activities. Such comments shall be presented to
Council not later than thirty days after the aforementioned report to the
Committee.
   (b)   The policy of the Committee and Council shall be to:
      (1)   Inform the public, through the popular media and by other means, of
yearly funding levels, possible program activities, application procedures,
etc.;
      (2)   Open all Committee meetings to the general public and inform the
public as to the time and place of each meeting;
      (3)   Present to the general public as much information as possible
concerning the program;
      (4)   Hold two formal public hearings prior to the submission of the pre-
application for program year funding to the Department; and
      (5)   Make accessible, to the Committee, Municipal officials,
consultants, etc. at reasonable and mutually convenient times, necessary to
carry out its functions in an efficient and timely manner.
(Ord. 8-78.  Passed 2-20-78.)
240.05   AMENDMENTS TO PROGRAM.
   (a)   Council may re-allocate up to ten percent of the total Community
Development Program budget to any existing approved activity without prior
consultation with the Committee.
   (b)   In situations where the Municipality seeks to re-allocate more than
ten percent of the total approved budget or to re-allocate funds for new
(unapproved) activities, or to new (unapproved) areas, Council shall seek input
concerning the amendment of the program from the Community Development
Citizens' Advisory Committee. Prior to making any such program amendment, the
City shall notify the Committee in writing of its intentions. The Committee
shall have two weeks from the date of the notification to respond. If no
written response is received in that period, Council shall assume that the
program amendments are accepted as submitted. If a written response is

(Ord. 8-78.  Passed 2-20-78.)
240.06   EXCEPTIONS.
   The Citizens' Participation Plan adopted under this chapter and the schedule
of steps set forth in Section
240.04 are predicated on the receipt, by Council, of sufficient notice of
application filing dates for discretionary community development funds from the
United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. Should the notice of
filing dates be insufficient to permit the full exercise of the time periods
mentioned in Section
240.04, Council may shorten the time periods and/or eliminate any such step
necessary to achieve the filing of any application or pre-application within
the time frame established by the Department. If this action becomes necessary,
Council shall immediately inform the Committee of such action and the reason
therefor. Council shall carry out the spirit and intent of the Plan to the
greatest extent feasible.
(Ord. 8-78.  Passed 2-20-78.)

the Community Development Program shall be made to the City Manager. Upon
receipt of a complaint, the Manager shall attempt to adjudicate the problem
with the complainant and any other necessary party. If the Manager is unable to
adjudicate the complaint to the mutual satisfaction of all parties, he or she

the complainant may appear before Council, within two weeks of the forwarding
of the complaint, to present his or her case.
   Council shall review the complaint and conduct whatever investigations,
hearings, interviews or other activities it deems appropriate to fully inform
itself concerning the complaint. It shall also provide the complainant with
reasonable time to present his or her case to Council if the complainant
appears within such two-week period.
   (b)   Council shall, after conducting such investigations, hearings and
interviews as it deems necessary, and after hearing the complainant in
accordance with the time schedule set forth in subsection (a) hereof, render a
decision in the matter within reasonable time. The decision of Council in the
matter shall be final.
   (c)   The complainant shall be informed that, if he or she is not satisfied
with the decision rendered, he or she has the right to make a written complaint
to the area office of the United States Department of Housing and Urban

246.01  INTRODUCTION.
   (a)   This handbook outlines certain plans, procedures and policies of the
City of New Carlisle, Ohio (City). It is provided solely for general
information. It is not intended to create, and it does not create either an
express or implied contract of employment between  any employee and the City.
   (b)   Formal documents such as insurance policies and trust agreements set
forth the eligibility, participation, coverage, benefits, limitations and other
provisions that govern the topic matters they address. Employees must refer to
these formal documents to find the actual provisions that govern these matters.
Employees may not rely on this handbook or any other representations as to
these matters.
   (c)   If an employee is a member of a bargaining unit which has a collective
bargaining agreement with the City, the collective bargaining agreement governs
any conflicting provision of this handbook.
   (d)   The provisions of this handbook, as well as any other City policies,
provisions or procedures, may be changed, modified, revoked, suspended or
terminated at any time without notice.
(Ord. 07-17.  Passed 5-21-07.)
246.02  EMPLOYMENT POLICY STATEMENTS.
   (a)   Policy on Non-Discrimination.  It is the policy of the City that its
operation shall be conducted without discrimination or segregation because of
race, color, religion, creed, national origin, sex, age, disability, except
where there is a bona fide occupational qualification for the job or services
to be provided.
   (b)   Equal Employment Opportunity.
      (1)   The City is an Equal Opportunity Employer. We provide equal
opportunities in all employment positions regardless of race, color, religion,
creed, national origin, sex, age, disability or any other legally protected
classification.
      (2)   The policy applies to all areas of employment, including
recruiting, hiring, training and development, promotion, transfer, termination,
layoff, compensation, benefits, social and recreational programs, and all other
conditions and privileges of employment in accordance with applicable federal,
state, and local laws.
      (3)   Management is primarily responsible for seeing that the City's
equal employment opportunity policies are implemented, but all employees are
responsible for personal actions. These policies are effective and apply
uniformly to everyone.
      (4)   Any employee, including managers, involved in discriminatory
practices will be subject to strict disciplinary practices, including
termination.
   (c)   Workplace Harassment/Discrimination Policy.
      (1)   It is the City's policy to afford all employees a workplace that is
free from all forms of sexual, racial, religious, age, disability, or national
origin harassment or discrimination. Such misconduct should be reported
promptly, regardless of who originates it or participates in it, and regardless
of whether it is oral, written, visual, or physical conduct. If such misconduct
is found to have occurred, it will result in corrective action that the City
determines is an appropriate resolution of the matter. The corrective action
could range up to and include termination of the offender.
      (2)   Anyone who is the object of any such conduct or who observes any
such activity should immediately report the matter to either his or her
immediate supervisor or to any other member of the management staff without
fear of reprisal.
      (3)   Each reported matter will be investigated under the direct
supervision of the City Manager or his or her designee. After the investigation
has been completed, a determination will be made by the City. Appropriate
corrective action, up to and including termination of employment, will be taken
if that is deemed the proper resolution of the matter.
      (4)   The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) defines sexual
harassment as follows: Unwelcome sexual advances (verbal and/or physical),
requests for favors and other verbal and/or physical conduct of a sexual nature
constitute sexual harassment when:
         A.   Submission to such conduct is either an explicit or implicit term
or condition of employment (such as a promotion, job assignment, overtime
opportunity, wage increase, etc.); or
         B.   Submission to or rejection of the conduct is used as a basis for
making employment decisions; or
         C.   The conduct has the purpose or the effect of substantially
interfering with an individual's work performance or creating a hostile or
offensive work environment.
      (5)   Sexual harassment under this definition may range from sexual
innuendo, perhaps in the guise of humor, to coerced sexual relations. It may
include, but certainly is not limited to:
         A.   Sexual jokes or offensive sexual language
         B.   Unwelcome sexual references
         C.   Verbal harassment of a sexual nature
         D.   Subtle or direct pressure for sexual activity
         E.   Physical contact such as touching, patting, pinching, rubbing or
squeezing
         F.   Leering at or ogling or other sexual references or comments about
a person's body, appearance or clothing
         G.   Seeking sexual attention with implied or explicit threats or
rewards
         H.   Displaying pictures or objects that have women and/or men as
sexual objects
      (6)   Using and insisting upon good manners, professional behavior and
the exercise of good sense will go a long way in avoiding and preventing the
inappropriate conduct covered by this policy. Should there be any incident,
however, which runs afoul of this policy, it should be reported immediately.
   (d)   Violence Prevention Policy/Concealed Weapon Policy.
      (1)   The City prohibits any behavior that could be construed as
threatening, aggressive, confrontational, or violent. Prohibited activity
includes any threatening behavior or acts of violence, including, but not
limited to, conduct that is harassing, intimidating, presents a challenge to
fight, constitutes veiled or direct threats, assaults or attempts to assault,
or sabotage, or the use of any obscene, abusive, or threatening language or
gestures.
      (2)   It is the policy of the City of New Carlisle that no employee or
City Official, except an employee who is employed by the City as a peace
officer, is to carry, convey or possess a deadly weapon or dangerous ordnance
while on City premises or while engaged in City business. A valid license to
carry a weapon does not authorize the licensee to carry a weapon while on City
premises or City business.
      (3)   Employees and officials, except peace officers, are prohibited from
conveying or attempting to convey a weapon in a City vehicle, into a City
building, onto any City property, with the exception of those who act in
accordance with R.C. §2923.126 or R.C. § 2923.12 or while conducting City
business. Any employee violating this policy will be subject to disciplinary
procedures and may also be subject to applicable criminal procedures. The City
of New Carlisle will not defend or indemnify such actions by and City employee
or official.
      (4)   Nothing in this section restricts the rights bestowed upon
employees under R.C. § 2923.126 or R.C. § 2923.12. It is the responsibility of
each employee to ensure he or she complies with the law.
      (5)   Any employee or official who becomes aware or who suspects any
violation of these policies and procedures has a duty to report the situation
to their supervisor or department head.
      (6)   For the purposes of this handbook, “Weapon or dangerous ordnance”
means any firearm, whether loaded or unloaded; knife larger than an ordinary
pocketknife; explosive; or other item or material that which is used to
physically harm or threaten someone.
      (7)   An employee should warn their supervisor or manager immediately of
any suspicious workplace activity or situations or incidents that they observe
or that they are aware of that involve other employees, former employees,
visitors or outsiders that appear threatening. This includes all incidents of
threats of violence, harassment, intimidation, attempted assaults, assaults,
challenges to fight, presence or suspected presence of weapons, fear of
physical harm and potential violent incidents or concerns, whether involving a
co-worker, supervisor, manager, visitor, acquaintance, family member, or
outsider. Employees will not be retaliated against for making good faith
reports under this policy. Failure to comply with this policy will be grounds
for disciplinary action, up to and including discharge.
   (e)   Drugs and Alcohol.
      (1)   As stated in the City of New Carlisle codified ordinances, Appendix
A attached hereto, it is the policy of the City to maintain a work environment
that is safe for our employees, visitors and others having business with the
City, and that is conducive to high work standards. To this end, the City
prohibits the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensing, possession, sale
or use of a controlled substance in the workplace or while engaged in City
business on or off the City premises. It is also against the City policy for
any employee to report to work with drugs or alcohol in their system. Further,
such conduct is prohibited during non-working time to the extent that, in the
City's opinion, it impairs an employee's ability to perform on the job or
threatens the reputation or integrity of the City. Candidates for positions
with the City may be required to undergo a pre-employment drug screening.
      (2)   Excepted from this policy are prescription drugs being used upon
the advice of a physician. Nevertheless, the City expects all employees to
refrain from conduct that would compromise safety.
      (3)   The City requires every employee to comply with this policy.
Because of the importance of this policy, the City may take steps to ensure
that it is being followed. These steps may include, but are not limited to,
reasonable searches, drug screen tests and confiscation of prohibited items and
substances. Any employee found to be in violation of this policy will be
subject to disciplinary action, up to and including discharge. Any employee who
refuses to submit to a drug screen test, or who is found to have identifiable
traces of an illegal drug or other prohibited substance in his or her system,
or more than the legal limit of alcohol, regardless of when or where the
alcohol, drug or substance entered the employee's system, will be subject to
disciplinary action, up to and including discharge.
      (4)   For more in depth details regarding this policy, please refer to
Appendix A following this chapter.
   (f)   Confidential Information.
      (1)   Unauthorized disclosure of private, confidential information may
result in liability to the City as well as to the individual.
      (2)   Unlike a private business, the City is subject to the Public
Records Act. The Public Records Act requires us to make certain records
available to the public upon request. Any employee having doubts about whether
a request for information involves private information which should be kept
confidential, or public records which need to be disclosed, should contact the
City Manager.
(Ord. 07-17.  Passed 5-21-07; Ord. 17-33E.  Passed 9-5-17.)

(Ord. 07-17.  Passed 5-21-07.)
246.05  EMPLOYMENT STATUS.
   (a)   Full-time Employees. A full-time employee is one who has successfully
completed the probationary period and regularly works 40 hours per week.
   (b)   Part-time Employees. A part-time employee is one who has successfully
completed the probationary period and regularly works less than 40 hours per
week.
   (c)   Probationary Employees. A newly hired person occupying a duly
authorized job classification is considered a probationary employee until such
time as a six month probationary period is successfully completed. However,
anyone hired into a different job classification who is a current employee of
the City will be considered a probationary employee in that position for a
period not less than two months.
   (d)   Temporary Employees. A temporary employee is one who is employed for a

   (f)   Non-Exempt Employees. Employees who are classified as non-exempt are
subject to the minimum wage, overtime, and time card provisions of the Fair
Labor Standards Act, and are eligible for overtime pay for hours worked in
excess of 40 hours per week. All non-exempt employees are expected, but not

(Ord. 07-17.  Passed 5-21-07.)
246.06  WORK SCHEDULE AND PAY PRACTICES.
   (a)   Hours of Operation. The normal work schedule shall consist of eight
hours per day and forty hours per week. except where there is a twenty-four
hour per day or seven-day per week operation made necessary by the nature of
the work, or when it is necessary to alter the work week to accommodate shift
changes. Such exceptions to the work schedule shall not be cause for premium
pay.
   (b)   Breaks. Employees shall receive a one hour lunch period within their
established eight hour work day. Employees shall be granted two breaks per day
of fifteen minutes each; one in the first half of the shift and one in the last
half of the shift.
   (c)   Pay Periods.
      (1)   Employees are currently paid Bi-Weekly, on the Friday following the
end of the pay period. Fire personnel are paid at the same time as other City
employees. City Council and the City Clerk are paid when the last pay check of
the month is issued to other City employees. Direct deposit is mandatory for
all employees.
      (2)   Department and division heads must submit their payroll information
prior to 9:00 a.m. on the Monday following the end of the pay period.
   (d)   Overtime Pay/Compensatory Time/Call-Out Procedures. All overtime, for
non-exempt employees, must be approved, in writing, by a member of management
or a department head. Overtime permission slips should be filled out anytime
overtime or compensatory time is approved. Overtime may be approved verbally,
in the event of an emergency, but the overtime permission slip should be filled
out ASAP after the event has concluded. When it is necessary to work overtime,
employees are expected to cooperate as a condition of employment. All overtime
pay, compensatory time, and call out procedures for nonexempt employees will be
governed by procedures established in the current Union contract. The following
is an example of how all overtime is computed:
      (1)   9 minutes or less   =   No extra pay
      (2)   4:10pm - 4:15pm   =   15 minutes overtime
      (3)   4:16pm - 4:30pm   =   30 minutes overtime
      (4)   4:31 pm - 4:45pm   =   45 minutes overtime
      (5)   4:46pm – 5:00pm   =   1 hour overtime
   (e)   Deductions from Paycheck (Mandatory).
      (1)   The City is required by law to take certain deductions from an
employee's paycheck. Among these are federal, state and local income taxes and
contributions to OPERS and Medicare as required by law. These deductions will
be itemized on the pay stub. The amount of the deductions depends on earnings
and on the information furnished on the W-4 regarding the number of dependents/
exemptions claimed. Any change in name, address, telephone number, marital
status or number of exemptions must be reported to the Finance Director to
ensure proper credit for tax purposes.
      (2)   Any other mandatory deductions to be made from employee's paycheck,
such as court-ordered attachments, will be taken whenever the City is ordered
to make such deductions. The City may require other deductions, for example,
deductions for employee share of benefits costs or union dues.
   (f)   Other Deductions.
      (1)   It may be possible for an employee to authorize the City to make
additional deductions from their paycheck, such as payroll saving plans or
insurance premiums. The employee should contact the staff in charge of payroll
for details and the necessary authorization forms.
      (2)   If an employee believes an error has been made in his or her pay,
they must inform the staff in charge of payroll immediately. Necessary steps
should be taken to research the problem and to assure that any necessary
correction will be made promptly.
(Ord. 07-17.  Passed 5-21-07.)
246.07  EMPLOYEE RELATIONS.
   (a)   Open Door Policy.
      (1)   The City encourages any questions or concerns you  may have
relating to the areas covered in this handbook and other job-related or City
related issues. Our open door policy encourages you to speak to your immediate
supervisor about any matter of  concern to you. If the problem cannot be
appropriately discussed with your immediate supervisor, or if the you have not
been satisfied after discussing it with your immediate supervisor, you are
encouraged to seek someone in your next chain of command.
      (2)   Any questions about the employee’s job, wages, hours, or anything
connected with work can be frankly and fully discussed with the employee’s
manager. If not completely satisfied with the manager's answer the employee may
talk with the City Manager.
      (3)   We are continuously looking for better and more efficient ways to
run the City. If an employee has any ideas for improving service, reducing
costs, or developing better policies and practices, we encourage them to share
their ideas with us. Be assured all employee suggestions will be considered.
   (b)   Standards of Conduct and Discipline.
      (1)   It is the philosophy of the City that employees are given rules, as
guidelines, to follow regarding conduct, and that the employee will behave in a
manner expected in a working environment. However, if an employee does not work
within the guidelines, action must be taken to correct the situation and to
protect all employees involved.
      (2)   Certain situations and events occurring in the employment
relationship require the administration of discipline. All disciplinary actions
for non-exempt employees, including disciplinary hearings, will be handled by
procedures established in the current Union contract.
      (3)   Violation of any of the following rules may result in discipline,
up to and including discharge. This listing is merely illustrative and is by no
means an exhaustive list of the acts for which discipline may be imposed. Other
inappropriate actions may result in disciplinary action.

report describing the accident with the City Manager. For each accident, the
City Manager shall refer the report to a safety committee, chaired by the
Police Administrator and including the driver's department or division head,
and one other representative to be named by the City Manager. The safety
committee shall determine whether or not the accident was preventable and shall
forward that information to the City Manager, along with any relevant
recommendations. The City Manager shall then determine if there is cause for
disciplinary action.
      (3)   Only approved hearing protection is allowed when operating City
vehicles, emergency vehicles, construction equipment, lawn mowers, chippers, or

   (a)   Annual Evaluation. Once per year, the Department Head will conduct a
performance review to provide an opportunity for ongoing communication about
the employee’s job performance. The Department Head will measure the employee’s
performance since the last review against the responsibilities of the
employee’s position and the policies of the City. The Department Head may hold
informal or more frequent review sessions with the employee as he or she deems
necessary. Every effort will be made to conduct performance reviews timely,
generally around the time of the employee hire date. There may be circumstances
which prevent or delay such reviews.
   (b)   Wage increases for non-exempt employees will be based upon salary
tables established in the current Union contract. Wage increases for exempt
employees will be determined by the City Manager, after consultation with City
Council.
(Ord. 07-17.  Passed 5-21-07.)
246.09  BENEFITS.
   (a)   Insurance.
      (1)   The City offers a variety of benefit programs. Benefits are one
feature of the total compensation package. This portion of the handbook is
meant to provide an overview of benefit programs. Complete descriptions of
group health, life, dental and disability insurance plans, are contained in the
respective summary plan descriptions which are available once an employee is
eligible to participate. The plan documents themselves will govern in all cases
and constitute the only full statement of the benefits provided.
      (2)   The City, after consulting the Union, reserves the right to amend
or terminate any of the benefit programs, summary plan descriptions or to
increase employee premium contributions toward any benefit.
      (3)   The City offers health and dental plan coverage for full-time
employees. Employees may be required to contribute to the costs of the
coverage.
      (4)   The City offers a cash-out plan to employees who choose to not use
the City provided health/dental insurance. A copy of that plan is attached here
as Appendix C.
      (5)   City employees may have the choice of either enrolling in the
current traditional PPO medical insurance plan or the Health Savings Account
(RSA) plan.
      (6)   If the employee opts to enroll in the HSA plan, the City of New
Carlisle will contribute into the employee's HSA account an amount equal to the
cost savings between the monthly premium amount of the traditional PPO
insurance plan and the monthly premium amount of the HSA, up to the maximum
monthly HSA contribution amount allowed by law.
      (7)   The City's contribution into the HSA accounts will be performed
monthly from the City's regular checking account. Total annual contribution
amounts made by the City will be reflected in block 12 of the employee's W-2.
   (b)   Termination of Insurance. Employee insurance will terminate, except as
provided by law, when the insurance policy terminates, an employee fails to
make an agreed contribution to premium when due, an employee is ineligible for
coverage under the terms of group insurance program, or when employment ceases
as a full-time employee eligible for the insurance.
   (c)   Leave Policies.
      (1)   Failure of an employee to report for work at the time at which he
or she is regularly scheduled to report at the termination of a leave, or to
secure an approved extension of the leave from the City in advance, will result
in termination of employment.
      (2)   Misrepresentation of facts to obtain a leave of absence or to
secure an extension of a leave of absence will result in termination of
employment.
      (3)   Unless specifically authorized in writing by the City or with
respect to military duties performed pursuant to a military leave of absence, a
leave of absence will not be granted to engage in employment elsewhere and any
employee who engages in employment elsewhere while on a leave of absence will
be deemed to have voluntarily quit employment.
   (d)   Benefits During Leaves of Absence. The City will continue to provide
insurance benefits while an employee is on a paid leave. While on any type of
unpaid leave of absence from the City (except military leave as required by law
or an unpaid leave of less than one month), the employee will be responsible
for paying the total premiums for coverage. Failure to do so may result in loss
of coverage and possible refusal by the insurance carrier to allow coverage to
be reinstated.
   (e)   Sick Leave.
      (1)   Non-exempt employees should refer to their current union contract
for an explanation of sick leave benefits.
      (2)   For exempt employees, sick leave is provided under this division
(e). Under this section, sick leave accrues at the rate of .05770 hours per
hour worked, excluding overtime hours and may be accumulated without limit for
each employee.
      (3)   Sick leave may be used for the following reasons:
         A.   Personal injury, sickness, or physical incapacity of the
employee;
         B.   Personal injury, sickness, or physical incapacity of the
employee's immediate family requiring the employee's personal care and
attendance;
         C.   Forced quarantine;
         D.   Physician visits, dental visits, medical testing, optical
examinations, and related fittings; and
         E.   Mental health visits to any professional covered under the City's
insurance programs, and chemical dependency recovery.
      (4)   In case of absence from work, the employee will call the answering
machine at their department to notify the immediate supervisor, as early as
possible, but not later than the regular starting time of workday. It will be
the responsibility of the waste water plant supervisor, water plant supervisor,
and public works supervisor to notify the Service Director no later than 10:00
a.m. on status of absent employees.
      (5)   Finance department employees will call the Finance Director's voice
mail, prior to the start of the work day. Management employees will schedule
their absence in advance with the City Manager or his or her Executive
Assistant. If calling early about an absence the same day, a message and a
number for a return call will be left on the City Manager's voice mail, prior
to the start of the work day.
      (6)   The City may grant extraordinary sick leave above the accumulated
total of an employee's sick leave credit when warranted by an employee's
loyalty, competency, and value to the City. A physician's certificate may be
required by the City after three days.
      (7)   Sick leave may be accumulated without limit for each employee.
Twenty-five percent (25%) of accrued sick leave will be paid upon termination,
at the current rate of pay. Upon death of an employee, the designated
beneficiaries will receive fifty percent (50%) of all accrued sick leave at the
current rate of pay at the time of the employee's death.
   (f)   Injury Leave/Light Duty. Injury leave shall be granted to an employee
who receives a compensable injury or occupational illness in the course of his
or her employment by the City. Such leave, and possible return to light duty,
will be governed by the current Union contract.
   (g)   Vacations.
      (1)   Non-exempt employees should refer to their current union contract

weeks of vacation per year, but are not eligible to use it until at least six
months after their hire date.
      (2)   Part-time employees will accrue vacation on a pro-rata basis,
according to the relationship of the employee's regular schedule to forty hours
per week (i.e. 30 hour employee — 75%).
      (3)   Vacation may accrue to a maximum of two years of accumulation. No
vacation shall accrue beyond the maximum allowable time. Any unused vacation
time in addition to such two years of accumulation shall not be compensated by
pay or otherwise. Upon termination, unused vacation and compensatory time will
be paid to an employee, or their designated beneficiaries, at the current rate
of pay.
   (h)   Holidays.
      (1)   Regular full time and part-time employees are eligible for holiday

      (2)   The City Manager may, on occasion, extend any of the above listed
holidays. If a holiday falls on a day not regularly scheduled for work, it will
be observed on the preceding day or on the next regularly scheduled workday, if
the preceding day is also a day not regularly scheduled for work. The City and
the union may agree to alter the day on which a holiday is observed.
      (3)   If a given employee objects to observing any of the holidays which
have some religious significance or if a given employee would prefer to observe
other religions holidays, he or she may give two weeks notice, and the City
will develop an alternate work schedule for the employee. The number of
holidays arranged will not exceed the number given up, and the employee will be
expected to work on the holidays given up at regular pay.
      (4)   The City and Union will consult in the case of part-time employees
who do not work five consecutive days, to establish a mutually agreeable
arrangement covering equitable holiday pay. Employees on vacation, sick leave,
injury leave, or any leave of absence with pay shall be considered as working
their regular schedule for pay purposes.
      (5)   Holiday compensation for non-exempt employees will be governed by
the current Union contract.
   (i)   Personal Leave. Employees shall receive two personal days with pay at
the start of each calendar year. Personal days must be used within the calendar
year. Unused personal days cannot be carried over into the following year or be
paid out, if an employee ceases to work for the City.
   (j)   Funeral Leave.
      (1)   Upon the death of an employee's spouse, child, parent, brother,
sister, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, grandchild, daughter-in-law, son-in-law,
grandparent, or spouse's parent, legal guardian or foster parent, the employee
shall be granted three days funeral leave with pay. Upon the death of other
close persons, the employee shall be granted up to three days of vacation, sick
leave, or compensatory time for bereavement purposes.
      (2)   An employee needing additional bereavement time may take vacation
leave, compensatory time, or sick leave at the employee's option.
      (3)   Employees may voluntarily donate their vacation leave to an
employee needing additional bereavement time who has exhausted his or her own
vacation leave.
   (k)   Maternity/Paternity Leave. Any full-time or part-time employee shall
be eligible to be granted a maternity/paternity leave of absence in accordance
with the following provisions:
      (1)   The employee requesting a maternity/paternity leave of absence must
complete a request of leave of absence form and submit it to his or her
supervisor.
      (2)   Each employee placed upon an approved maternity/paternity leave
shall first use accrued sick leave. Upon exhausting accrued sick leave, the
employee may use accrued vacation leave or may remain on maternity/paternity
leave without pay.
      (3)   An employee returning from maternity/paternity leave shall be
placed on his or her former job.
      (4)   While an employee is on maternity/paternity leave, the employee's
seniority shall continue to accumulate.
      (5)   While an employee is on maternity/paternity leave, the City shall
maintain the employee's insurance benefits, as long as unpaid leave does not
exceed thirty days. In addition, sick leave, vacation leave, and other leave do
not accumulate during unpaid leave.
      (6)   All of the above will also be applicable for the adoption of any
children.
      (7)   No more than thirty days of leave may be taken according to this
provision. However, nothing herein shall limit the right of an employee/birth
mother to use sick leave while disabled or sick as certified by her physician.
   (l)   Unpaid Leave of Absence.
      (1)   Employees may request an unpaid leave of absence for a specified
period. This request must be submitted in writing to the City Manager. Granting
of such leave is at the discretion of the City Manager, except in such cases
where the granting of leave is required by law.
      (2)   Occasionally, for medical, personal, or other reasons, an employee
may need to be temporarily released from the duties of his/her position with
the City, but may not wish to submit a resignation. Under certain
circumstances, the employee may be eligible for an unpaid leave of absence.
   (m)   Jury Duty.
      (1)   The City's position is that an employee should serve when called
for jury duty, as a matter of good citizenship, unless there are pressing
business reasons that make it necessary to postpone such duty. The jury duty
leave is an approved period of time off in which the employee has been summoned
to report for a jury examination, empanelment session, or called for jury duty.
      (2)   Benefits will remain in effect while an employee is on a jury duty
leave. A request for a jury duty leave is to be submitted by the employee who
is called for jury duty service. Along with the request for a jury duty leave,
a copy of the notice to serve on jury duty must be submitted.
      (3)   The employee is expected to report to work on regular workdays,
when not assigned to jury duty. If excused or dismissed from jury duty early,
the employee is expected to report to work for the balance of the workday, as
time permits. Employees on jury duty will be paid their regular rate of pay,
less jury duty pay.
   (n)   Elections. Employees should arrange to vote before or after working
hours.
   (o)   Military Leave.
      (1)   The City supports employees who are members of the U.S. Armed
Forces. If called to duty, or if an employee volunteers for the same, they
should submit copies of the military orders to their supervisor or manager as
soon as is practicable. An employee will be granted a military leave of absence
in accordance with applicable federal and state laws.
      (2)   Reinstatement of an employee after military duty or training is
completed is determined in accordance with applicable federal and state laws.
   (p)   Clothing Allowance. Employees in the department of public service,
except clerical and administrative employees in the City Building, shall be
furnished clothing as governed by the current Union contract.
   (q)   Tuition Reimbursement.
      (1)   Any full-time employee shall be eligible to receive reimbursement
by the City for tuition, books, and course materials for job related courses.
All courses must be approved, in writing, in advance, by the City Manager.
Reimbursement for approved courses shall be at the following rate:
         A.   For a grade of "A"   - 100%
         B.   For a grade of "B"   - 90%
         C.   For a grade of "C"   - 80%
      (2)   No reimbursement shall be made for employees obtaining a grade less
than a "C".
      (3)   To receive reimbursement, the employee shall submit written proof
of course taken, costs, and final grade before the end of the year in which the
course is taken.
      (4)   A tuition reimbursement account will be established in the City
budget yearly. All employees who are eligible to receive reimbursement will be
reimbursed up to a maximum of $2,000.00 per calendar year, up to the point that
the fund is exhausted for that fiscal year. Expenses cannot be held over from
one year to the next for reimbursement.
      (5)   Any employee who receives reimbursement for water/wastewater
licenses or college classes, must remain employed by the City for a minimum of
two years following reimbursement. If that employee leaves City employment
before the two years, they must pay the City back for any said reimbursement.
      (6)   The City will pay the cost of obtaining all required state licenses
and renewals and required CDL endorsements, which are required by the City or
any applicable State of Ohio agency.
      (7)   The employee must advise the City of any other reimbursements.  The
City will not reimburse an employee for tuition where the employee is also
getting reimbursed from another source.  The exception to this would be if the
employee’s expenses for tuition, books, and course material exceed what the
other source reimburses.  In such cases, the City shall be the secondary
reimburser, responsible only for eligible expenses not fully paid by the other
source available to the employee.

current Union contract in matters of layoff, recall from layoff, and job
bidding.
   (b)   Resignation. An employee who wishes to resign should give two weeks
written notice to the immediate supervisor with the reasons stated therein.
Only that vacation, sick leave, or compensatory time that has been accrued to

compensatory time will be paid to an employee, or their designated
beneficiaries, at the current rate of pay.

(Ord. 07-17.  Passed 5-21-07.)
APPENDIX A: ALCOHOL/DRUG TESTING POLICY FOR EMPLOYEES WHO OPERATE COMMERCIAL
MOTOR VEHICLES.
   (a)   Purpose. The purpose of this policy is to comply with all applicable
Federal regulations adopted by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) that
mandate alcohol and drug testing and to establish testing standards for
covered, safety-sensitive employees who operate commercial motor vehicles. This
policy supplements, but does not replace or change, all existing policies and
agreements concerning the use of, and testing for, alcohol and drugs, unless
otherwise required by law or regulation.
      (1)   The Director of Personnel is the person designated to:
         A.   Answer questions about these materials and the implementation of
the FHWA regulations;
         B.   Receive confidential information regarding alcohol and drug
testing results; and
         C.   Receive confidential information from substance abuse
professionals.
      (2)   The public expects City services to be delivered in the safest and
most conscientious manner possible. Involvement with drugs and alcohol can
adversely affect job performance and employee safety. The presence of drugs or
alcohol on the job, and the influence of these substances on employees during
working hours, are inconsistent with the objective of maintaining a drug and
alcohol-free workplace.
      (3)   Employees who think they may have an alcohol or drug usage problem
are urged to voluntarily seek assistance from the Employee Assistance Program.
While the City will be supportive of those who seek help voluntarily, the City
Manager will be equally firm in identifying and disciplining those who are, or
continue to be, substance abusers and who do not seek help.
   (b)   Covered Employees. This policy applies to all employees who operate a
commercial motor vehicle to carry out their job duties or who are required as a
condition of employment to possess and maintain a commercial driver's license
(CDL). Participation in the Alcohol and Drug Testing Program is required for
these employees and is considered to be a condition of employment. For purposes
of this section, "commercial motor vehicle" means a vehicle that:
      (1)   Has a gross combination weight rating of 26,001 or more pounds
inclusive of a towed unit with a gross vehicle weight rating of more than
10,000 pounds;
      (2)   Has a gross vehicle weight rating of 26,001 or more pounds;
      (3)   Is designed to transport sixteen or more passengers, including the
driver; or
      (4)   Is of any size and is used in the transportation of materials that
are found to be hazardous for the purposes of the Hazardous Materials
Transportation Act and that require the motor vehicle to be placarded under the
Hazardous Materials Regulations.
   (c)   Safety-Sensitive Functions. The FHWA alcohol and drug rules apply to
employees when performing safety-sensitive functions. "Safety-sensitive
functions" under these rules include any of the following:.
      (1)   All time waiting to be dispatched;
      (2)   All time inspecting, servicing or conditioning any commercial motor
vehicle;
      (3)   All time driving a commercial motor vehicle;
      (4)   All time spent loading or unloading a vehicle, supervising or
assisting in the loading or unloading of a vehicle, attending a vehicle being
loaded or unloaded, remaining in readiness to operate the vehicle, or giving or
receiving receipts for shipments loaded or unloaded;
      (5)   All time spent dealing with a commercial motor vehicle accident;
      (6)   All time spent repairing, obtaining assistance for, or remaining in
attendance upon, a disabled commercial motor vehicle; and
      (7)   All other time spent in or on any commercial motor vehicle.
   (d)   Prohibited Conduct. The FHWA regulations include the following rules
on prohibited conduct:
      (1)   No employee shall report for duty or remain on duty requiring the
performance of safety-sensitive functions while having an alcohol concentration
of 0.04 or greater (see subsection (i) hereof for provisions relating to
alcohol concentrations between 0.02 and 0.04);
      (2)   No employee shall be on duty or operate a commercial motor vehicle
while the driver possesses alcohol, unless the alcohol is manifested and
transported as part of a shipment;
      (3)   No employee shall use alcohol while performing safety-sensitive
functions:
      (4)   No employee shall perform safety-sensitive functions within four
hours after using alcohol;
      (5)   No employee shall use alcohol for eight hours following an
accident, or until the employee undergoes a post-accident alcohol test,
whichever occurs first;
      (6)   No employee shall refuse to submit to a post-accident alcohol or
drug test, a random alcohol or drug test, a reasonable suspicion alcohol or
drug test or a follow-up alcohol or drug test; and
      (7)   No employee shall report for duty or remain on duty requiring the
performance of safety-sensitive functions when the employee uses any drug,
except when the use is pursuant to the instructions of a physician who has
advised the employee that the substance does not adversely affect the
employee's ability to safely operate a commercial motor vehicle.
   (e)   Supervisor Responsibilities. Supervisors must not permit an employee
to perform safety-sensitive functions if they have actual knowledge that the
employee:
      (1)   Has a blood alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater;
      (2)   Has alcohol in his or her possession;
      (3)   Is using alcohol on the job;
      (4)   Has used alcohol within the past four hours;
      (5)   Refused to submit to an alcohol or drug test required by this
policy;
      (6)   Has used a controlled substance; or
      (7)   Tested positive for drugs.
   (f)   Alcohol and Drug Testing.
      (1)   In addition to alcohol, the substances for which the employee will
be tested include, but are not limited to, the following: marijuana, cocaine,
opiates, amphetamines and phencyclidine (PCP).
      (2)   Testing for alcohol concentration will be through the evidential
breath testing procedure. Testing for controlled substances will be
accomplished through urine sampling The employee may be required to sign an
authorization form permitting the medical facility to conduct the test and
release the results to the Medical Review Officer and the City Manager. An
employee is subject to FHWA mandatory testing for alcohol and drugs under the
following circumstances:
         A.   Pre-employment/pre-duty testing. An applicant or newly hired
employee must be tested for alcohol and drugs before the first time the driver
performs any safety-sensitive function. In order to return to duty involving
safety-sensitive functions, the driver must test with an alcohol concentration
level of less than 0.02 and/or test negative for controlled substance use.
         B.   Post-accident testing.
            1.   An employee must be tested for alcohol and drugs as soon as
practicable following an accident involving a commercial motor vehicle, if:
               a.   The employee was performing a safety-sensitive function
with respect to the vehicle and the accident resulted in the loss of a human
life (whether or not the driver caused the accident); or
               b.   The employee receives a citation under State or local law
for a moving violation arising out of the accident.
            2.   In the case of post-accident testing for drugs, the driver
must immediately notify the Service Director of the accident and remain readily
available for testing. The American Truckers Association shall administer the
tests as soon as possible, but not more than eight hours after the accident in
the case of alcohol testing and not more than thirty-two hours after the
accident in the case of controlled substance testing. The results of a breath
or blood test for the use of alcohol, or of a urine test for the use of
controlled substances, conducted by Federal, State or local officials having
independent authority for the test, shall be deemed to meet the requirements of
this policy, and the City Manager may choose to use this type of test instead
of performing one of his or her own.
         C.   Random testing. Employees will be randomly selected for
unannounced alcohol and drug testing. The minimum annual percentage rate for
random alcohol testing will be twenty-five percent of the average number of
driver positions. The minimum annual percentage for random drug testing will be
fifty percent of the average number of driver positions. Employees will be
selected on a random basis, which assures that all drivers have an equal chance
of being tested. The dates for testing will be spread out throughout the
calendar year and will be unannounced. A driver shall only be tested during,
just prior to, or just after, the performance of safety-sensitive functions.
         D.   Reasonable suspicion testing. An employee must be tested for
alcohol or drugs if there is reasonable suspicion that a driver has violated
the rules on the use of alcohol or drugs. Reasonable suspicion will be based on
specific, current and describable observations concerning the appearance,
behavior, speech or body odors of the employee made during, just preceding, or
just after, the period of the work day when the employee is performing a
safety-sensitive function. The observation and determination that a reasonable
suspicion exists will be made by a supervisor, manager or other City official
trained in detecting the symptoms of alcohol and drug use. The person who makes
the determination that reasonable suspicion exists to conduct an alcohol test
shall not conduct the alcohol test of the driver.
         E.   Return-to-duty testing. An employee must be tested for alcohol
and drugs before returning to any safety-sensitive duties following a violation
of the FHWA alcohol or drug rules;
         F.   Follow-up testing. An employee who has been identified by a
substance abuse professional as needing assistance in resolving problems with
alcohol or drugs and who has returned to duty is subject to a minimum of six
follow-up alcohol or drug tests over the first twelve months following the
return to duty. The substance abuse professional may require the employee to
undergo additional alcohol or drug testing for up to sixty months.
      (3)   All alcohol and drug testing done under the FHWA rules will comply
with 49 CFR, Part 40, Procedures for Transportation Workplace Drug and Alcohol
Testing Programs. These procedures require separate screening and confirmation
tests and a member of other procedures which are intended to protect the driver
and the integrity of the testing processes, to safeguard the validity of the
test results and to ensure that those results are attributed to the correct
driver.
   (g)   Refusal to Submit to Alcohol or Drug Test. The FHWA rules mandate that
an employee submit to the alcohol and drug tests required by the FHWA rules. A
refusal to submit is itself a violation of the FHWA rules.
      (1)   A refusal to submit to an alcohol or drug test includes any of the
following conduct:
         A.   Failure to provide adequate breath for alcohol testing, without a
valid medical explanation, after the driver has received notice of the
requirement for alcohol testing under the FHWA rules;
         B.   Failure to provide adequate urine for drug testing, without a
valid medical explanation, after the driver has received notice of the
requirement for drug testing under the FHWA rules;
         C.   Engaging in conduct that clearly obstructs the testing process;
and
         D.   Failure to remain readily available for testing following an
accident involving a commercial motor vehicle.
      (2)   A refusal to take an alcohol or drug test required by the FHWA
rules will have the following minimum consequences:
         A.   An applicant who refuses a pre-employment/pre-duty test will not
be hired;
         B.   An employee who refuses a return-to-duty test will not be
returned to duty; and
         C.   An employee who refuses a post-accident, random, reasonable
suspicion or follow-up test will be treated as if he or she had a positive test
result, as described in subsection (h) hereof.
      (3)   An employee who refuses to comply with a request for testing, who
provides false information in connection with a test, or who attempts to
falsify test results through tampering, contamination, adulteration or
substitution, shall be removed from duty immediately and subject to discipline
up to and including dismissal. Refusal can include an inability to provide a
specimen or breath sample without a valid medical explanation, as well as a
verbal declaration, obstructive behavior or physical absence resulting in the
inability to conduct the test.
   (h)   Violations of FHWA Rules. Employees who violate the FHWA rules on
alcohol or drugs will:
      (1)   Be removed from all safety-sensitive functions and placed on an
unpaid leave of absence, unless otherwise determined by the Director of
Personnel;
      (2)   Be referred to and evaluated by a substance abuse professional, who
shall determine what assistance, if any, the employee needs in resolving
problems associated with alcohol or drugs;
      (3)   Not be returned to work unless the driver passes a return-to-duty
alcohol test (if the violation involved alcohol) or a return-to-duty drug test
(if the violation involved drugs) and has properly followed any rehabilitation
program prescribed by the substance abuse professional; and
      (4)   Be subject to FHWA-mandated unannounced follow-up drug and alcohol
testing, including a minimum, of six tests during the first twelve months
following the driver's return to work.
   These are the minimum consequences mandated by the FHWA rules. The City
Manager may take additional disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal,
for conduct which violates work rules or policies.
   (i)   Alcohol Test Results Between 0.02 and 0.04. A positive alcohol test is
defined by the FHWA rules as a test finding an alcohol concentration of 0.04 or
greater. However, if a driver's alcohol test finding is between 0.02 and 0.04,
the driver must be removed from duty until the driver's next regularly
scheduled duty period, but not less than twenty-four hours following the test.
   (j)   Employee Requested Confirmation Testing.
      (1)   An employee who questions the results of a required drug test may
request that an additional test be conducted at a different DHHS-certified
laboratory. The test will be conducted on the split sample that was provided at
the same time as the original sample. The cost of the second test will be borne
by the employee, unless the second test invalidates the first.
      (2)   The method of collecting, storing and testing the split sample is
as prescribed by the procedures in 49 CFR, Part 40. The employee's request for
a split sample test must be made to the designated medical review officer
within seventy-two hours of notice of the initial test result. Requests after
seventy-two hours will be accepted only if the delay was due to documentable
facts that were beyond the control of the employee.
   (k)   Confidentiality. Laboratory reports or test results shall not appear
in an employee's general personnel folder. Information of this nature will be
secured in a separate confidential folder in the Personnel Department. The
reports or test results may be disclosed to management on a need-to-know basis
and to the tested employee upon request. The Law Director may also disclose
confidential information pertaining to an employee to the decision-makers in a
lawsuit, grievance or other proceeding initiated by or on behalf of the
employee, and arising from the results of an alcohol and/or controlled
substance test administered under FHWA rules, or from the City Manager's
determination that the employee engaged in prohibited conduct.
   (l)   FHWA Mandated Alcohol/Drug Evaluation/Treatment.
      (1)   Employees who test positive for the presence of alcohol or illegal
drugs will be referred to, and evaluated by, a substance abuse professional
(SAP). A substance abuse professional is a licensed or certified physician,
psychologist, social worker, employee assistance professional or addiction
counselor with knowledge of, and clinical experience in, the diagnosis and
treatment of drug and alcohol-related disorders. The substance abuse
professional will evaluate each employee to determine what assistance, if any,
the employee needs to resolve problems associated with prohibited substance
abuse or misuse of alcohol.
      (2)   Under certain circumstances, including positive alcohol or drug
tests, employees may be required to undergo treatment for substance abuse. If
an employee is not discharged, but is allowed to return to duty after such
evaluation and/or treatment, he or she must properly follow the rehabilitation
program prescribed by the substance abuse professional, must pass the return to
duty alcohol and drug test(s) and must be subject to unannounced follow-up
tests for a period of one to five years, as determined by the substance abuse
professional or as required by Federal law. Any employee who refuses treatment
when required, or who fails to comply with the individualized treatment plan
prescribed by the substance abuse professional for treatment, aftercare or
return to duty, shall be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including
discharge.
   (m)   Additional Alcohol and Drug Information.
      (1)   The use of alcohol or drugs can have negative effects on an
individual's health, work and personal life.
      (2)   The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA)
reported in 1987 that two of every three adults in the United States drink, but
ten percent of those drinkers consume half of the nation's beer, wine and
liquor. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), an estimated
seventeen million U.S. adults are alcoholics. The cost to society from alcohol
misuse is enormous. The potential effects include lost lives, personal
injuries, property damage; business losses (lost productivity, absenteeism,
increased health care costs, etc.) and environmental damage.
      (3)   In 1987, the NIAAA estimated the economic costs to society of
alcohol misuse to be nearly $117 billion a year, including $18 billion from
premature deaths, $66 billion in lost productivity and $13 billion for
rehabilitation.
      (4)   Accident statistics indicate that nearly half of the fatally
injured noncommercial motor vehicle drivers had a measurable amount of alcohol
in their blood compared with about fifteen percent of fatally injured drivers
of medium and heavy trucks. For those truck drivers who had been drinking
before an accident, the highest accident rate was among those consuming the
most alcohol. Drivers of heavy and medium trucks with measurable alcohol
concentrations are involved in about 750 fatal crashes annually, along with
another 7,700 crashes resulting in personal injuries and 4,750 crashes
involving only property damage.
      (5)   In 1990, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) published
the results of a study of alcohol and other drugs used by CMV operators in
fatal-to-the-driver, heavy truck accidents. Thirteen percent of the fatally
injured drivers tested positive for alcohol. Another twenty percent of the
drivers tested positive for drugs.
      (6)   Additional information concerning the effects of alcohol and drug
use, and the signs and symptoms of an alcohol or drug problem, will be
periodically provided to covered employees and their supervisors.
      (7)   A pamphlet on the designated Employee Assistance Program will be
provided to covered employees subject to this policy and their supervisors.
      (8)   Copies of the FHWA rules on alcohol and drug use and testing, 49
CFR, Part 382, and the Department of Transportation rule on procedures for
Transportation Workplace Drug and Alcohol Testing Programs, 49 CFR, Part 40,
are available for review in the Personnel Department.
      (9)   Employees are urged to request assistance with any drug or alcohol
problem, before disciplinary action is necessary.  If an employee advises the
City Manager of a drug or alcohol problem, the employee will be urged to
receive counseling and, if appropriate and necessary, will be permitted to take
accrued paid sick leave or vacation to receive the recommended treatment. If an
employee has exhausted accrued paid sick leave and vacation, he or she may
apply for an unpaid personal leave of absence for the period of time necessary
to receive the recommended treatment.
      (10)   Alcohol and drug dependencies are treatable. Employees covered by
the City-sponsored health insurance program have limited coverage for treatment
of alcoholism and drug dependency. Any costs associated with treatment that are
not covered by insurance will be the responsibility of the employee.
      (11)   Employees who suspect that another employee is in violation of the
FHWA alcohol and drug rules should immediately report their suspicion, and the
basis for it, to their supervisor or to the Director of Personnel, so that
appropriate, action may be taken and a potentially unsafe situation avoided.

APPENDIX B: GENERAL DRIVING RULES AND REGULATIONS
POLICIES
Overview
   As a City of New Carlisle employee, you are constantly in the public eye.
Every time you drive a vehicle in the performance of your duties, you are
representing the City. You are not only responsible for your safety and
security but the safety and security of citizens and visitors to the City. As a
result, all City drivers are required to exercise the utmost care and caution

an alarm and police officers responding code 3), will be counted only if the
accident is determined by the safety committee to have been "avoidable".

driving vehicles other than equipment. Employees shall wear seat belts, if
provided, when operating equipment. All passengers are required to occupy only
those seating positions equipped with seat belts and use them.
Backing
   Backing of vehicles should be discouraged, given the rate of accidents that
take place during this operation. No vehicles should be backed up, unless the
driver cannot avoid it and he has a clear view of the entire area to be backed
into. If such a view is not present, the driver, if alone, will get out of the
vehicle and inspect the area to be backed into or, if a second person is in the
vehicle, the second person will get out and guide the driver using appropriate
hand and/or voice signals.
Vehicle Inspection

should be reported to the Service Director. Any employee using their personal
vehicle while performing work for the City should carry a proof of insurance
card.
PROCEDURES
Driving Record Acceptability
   The City of New Carlisle will obtain Motor Vehicle Records on all employees
who drive once every year or more. These, along with any Uniform Police Traffic
Accident and Ohio Uniform Accident Reports will be reviewed by the City to
determine if any employees who drive have an unacceptable driving record. Those

taxable cash compensation.
To be eligible to receive the additional taxable compensation under the City of
New Carlisle Cash Out Plan you must be eligible to participate in the City's
group health plan and you must waive coverage under the City's group health

deemed to have continued to waive coverage under the City's group health plan
for subsequent Plan Years, (January 1st through December 31st) until you
actually enroll in the City's group health plan. In other words, once you waive
coverage under the City's group health plan, you will deemed to have continue
waiving coverage under the City's group health plan until you actually enroll
in the City's group health plan in accordance with the terms of the City's
group health plan.
If you elect to waive coverage under the City's group health plan for you and
your family for the entire Plan Year (January 1st through December 31st), you

in four equal installments of $250 each (less all applicable taxes) as soon as
administratively possible after each calendar quarter.  No payment will be made
for any calendar quarter in which you or any member of your family participated
in the City's group health plan.
If you elect to participate in the City's group health benefit plan, you may
not drop coverage for you (and/or your spouse and dependents) during the Plan-
Year (January lst through December 31st)  unless there is an Election Change
Event as defined under the City of New Carlisle Cash Out Plan. This means once
you start to participate in the City's group health plan you must continue to
participate in that plan and may not receive additional cash compensation under
the City of New
Carlisle Cash Out Plan until the next January 1st unless there is an Election
Change Event as defined under the City of New Carlisle Cash Out Plan.
You must contact the Finance Director and submit this City of New Carlisle
Waiver of Health Insurance Form within thirty days of experiencing an Election
Change Event if you want to drop coverage; order the City's group health
benefit and receive additional taxable compensation.
An Election Change Event is (1) a change in your legal marital status including
marriage, death of a spouse, divorce, legal separation and annulment (2) a
change in the number of your dependents including the birth, death, adoption
and placement of adoption of a child (3) a change in your employment status
including the termination or commencement of employment, a strike, lockout, the
commencement or termination of an unpaid leave of absence and change in
worksite (4) a charge in you or your spouse's or dependent child's employment
status that effects that individual's eligibility under a cafeteria plan or any
benefit plan (including the City's health plan) (5) your dependent child or
spouse satisfied or ceases to satisfy the eligibility requirements because of
age, student status or similar circumstances (6) the commencement or
termination of adoption proceedings (7) a change in you or your spouse's or

any change resulting from a change made under a plan of your spouse's, former
spouse's or dependent child's employer that is listed on this form.
If you drop coverage under the City's group health plan during the Plan Year
(January 1st through December 31st) and you complete this City of New Carlisle
Waiver of Health Insurance Form within thirty days of the Election Change
Event, you will receive a pro-rated portion of the additional compensation
based on the number of calendar quarters you waived coverage under the City's
group health plan.
The City of New Carlisle Cash Out Plan does not impact the eligibility rules
and requirements of the City's group health plan. Therefore, you must review
the City's group health plan to determine if you are eligible to participate in
that plan. In other words, the City's group health plan has its own rules
governing when you can participate and drop coverage.
I have read and understand the information explaining my rights to participate
in the City of New Carlisle's group health plan and I have elected to waiver
coverage under the City's group health plan in exchange for additional taxable
cash compensation.

APPENDIX D: BUSINESS TRAVEL/PERSONAL USE OF GOVERNMENT EQUIPMENT POLICY
Background
The City strives to provide a workplace that fosters efficiency, creativity,
and productivity without unnecessary rules and regulations. In formulating this
policy, it is recognized that the citizens of the City of New Carlisle receive
both tangible and intangible benefits through having individuals working for
the City who enjoy their working environment. Nevertheless, as custodian of
public money and trust, policies must be established concerning certain
spending practices.
The City recognizes that employees travel both within and sometimes outside the
State of Ohio for the purpose of representing the City at meetings and
professional associations, as well as for training to enhance their skills
regarding the performance of their various positions within City Government.
The City benefits from providing the opportunity for those in municipal service
to participate in forums through which informal networking and information
exchanges may occur. The quality of life for the citizens is improved through
an informed and educated elected and administrative body, and the expense of
training, including the associated travel, is often an appropriate expense for
the City to bear.
It is inherently understood in this policy that an individual conducting
official City business is expected to exercise the same care in incurring
expenses that a prudent person would exercise if he or she were expending
personal funds. At all times, the official or employee should keep in mind the
best economic interests of the City. Excessive costs, indirect routes, delays,
or luxury accommodations and services unnecessary, unjustified, or solely for
the convenience or personal preference of the employee in the performance of
official City business are not acceptable. Under this standard, employees may
be held responsible for unauthorized costs and additional expenses incurred.
SCOPE OF POLICY
This policy shall apply to management, employees, members of the New Carlisle
City Council, and any other person traveling on approved city business and
personal use of government equipment.
TRAVEL EXPENSES
I.   Written Pre-Approval of Travel
   A.   Pre-approval of employee travel is required in the following
circumstances:
      1.   Any travel which includes an overnight stay,
      2.   Any travel which involves air transportation. Travel not meeting
these criteria must be approved by the appropriate supervisor.
   B.   Travel satisfying any of the above two criteria must be requested by an
employee, approved by the applicable Department or Division Head, and the City
Manager. Management must have prior approval from the City Manager. City
Manager and Council Members must receive approval by a consensus of Council.
Pre-approval of travel meeting the above requirements is required of all city
management, employees, Council Members, and any other person traveling on
approved City business.
II.   Reimbursement Procedures
   A.   When traveling, municipal credit cards should be used rather than
reimbursement to insure that the most accurate records are provided to the
City. If a municipal credit card is used, an expense report should be submitted
to the City Finance Director through normal City channels within 5 working days
of returning from the trip. The municipal credit card should only be used for
city expenses. Personal expenditures are not permitted.
   B.   Request for reimbursement
      1.   In order to be reimbursed for expenses incurred during official city
business, supporting documentation must be provided to the City Finance
Director through applicable management channels to substantiate reimbursement.
Acceptable supporting documentation consists of: itemized receipts, paid
invoices, hotel bills, etc.
      2.   In the case of meals, documentation should include a list of who
attended the meeting, the topic of discussion, and what was purchased.
      3.   The City will reimburse the employee within 10 business days after
receiving the expense report.
   C.   Non-approved expenses shall be paid by the "traveler" to the City
within 10 business days.
III.   Costs Eligible for Reimbursement
   A.   Tips and Gratuities
      1.   Tips and gratuities will be reimbursed in an amount not to exceed
amounts established from time to time by management.
   B.   Taxi and Ground Transportation
      1.   Normal use of public conveyances will be reimbursed for local
connections or travel when such is necessary. Unless prior approval is obtained
from the City Manager, car rental expenses will be permitted only under unusual
or emergency conditions. Such use will be explained, and receipts will be
presented before reimbursement will be allowed.
   C.   Parking.
      1.   Reimbursement of parking fees shall only be made upon presentation
of receipts except for small amounts for parking meters when travel is by City
car or by private car. If airfare has been approved as the mode of
transportation, long-term parking at the airport will be reimbursed if it is
more cost effective than the fare for taxi service to and from the airport and
receipts are presented.
   D.   Registration Fees, Books, Etc.
      1.   Fees charged for registration at any convention or meetings are
allowed for reimbursement. A receipt of the fee should be included with the
expense report. Employees attending conventions are required to file a copy of
the convention program or some other evidence showing the name, dates, and
places of the meeting. Books or pamphlets offered for sale that are not
required conference materials and purchased at conventions or conferences will
not be reimbursed in excess of an amount established by management. If such
books or pamphlets are desired, they may be purchased upon return to the City
if approved by the Department or Division Head or the City Manager.
   E.   Meals
      1.   Reimbursement for meals shall be limited to the maximum regional
rates established by the United States General Services Administration (USGSA)
(refer to web site www.gsa.gov).
         i.   If the costs of meals exceed the allowance and the traveler
requests reimbursement for the amount beyond that authorized in this policy, a
written request must be made explaining why the additional expense was
necessary and must be submitted with the return travel report along with
supporting documentation.
      2.   An employee on a one-day business trip away from his/her workstation
is eligible for one meal if the work schedule is for the convenience of the
City and extends beyond ten hours.
   F.   Mileage
      1.   Personal car mileage shall be reimbursed at a rate to be established
by the City, not to exceed rates established by the Internal Revenue Service.
Reimbursement for car expenses will be made only to the approved driver. When
using a personal automobile for a day trip which originates from home, the
mileage reported for reimbursement should be from home or from the government
center, whichever is less.
   G.   Hotel Expenses
      1.   Fifty-Mile Rule
         a)   To be eligible for lodging reimbursement, your travel destination
must be at least 50 miles from both the employee's residence and the government
center, using the most direct route.
      2.   Exceptions to the Fifty-Mile Rule
         a)   The health and safety of the traveler will be compromised.
         b)   It is more economical to the City.
      3.   Hotel rates should not exceed the regional lodging rates as
established by the USGSA. If the cost of lodging exceeds the USGA rates and the
traveler requests reimbursement for the amount beyond that authorized in this
policy, a written request must be made explaining why the additional expense
was necessary and must be submitted with the return travel report along with
supporting documentation.
      4.   Charges billed to the traveler's hotel/motel room that have no
bearing to the business nature of the travel, are the responsibility of the
traveler and will not be reimbursed by the City.
   H.   Telephone Expenses (while traveling)
      1.   Employees are not permitted to charge long distance telephone calls
to the City for calls made of a personal nature, except as stated below. All
long distance calls that are to be paid by the City are those made while the
employee is conducting official City business. An employee traveling to a
location outside the local calling area is allowed one (1) "safe arrival" call
upon arriving at the destination. An employee who is in travel status for two
(2) or more consecutive days in a week is allowed one (1) personal long
distance telephone call for each day of travel. Additionally, employees may
properly be reimbursed for emergency calls approved by the City Manager. An
example of such is a call made when an employee calls home to inform someone
that the travel period has been extended beyond original plans due to
unforeseen reasons.
   I.   Air Travel Expenses
      1.   Air travel may be required to satisfy some of the business needs of
the City. Air travel will be used whenever it is most economical to the city
and will be paid at coach/economy class. Flight arrangements should be made as
far in advance as possible to take advantage of reduced airfare rates.
      2.   Use of a private car for the convenience of the employee will be
reimbursed in an amount not to exceed the "coach" airfare rate and hotel
transportation cost. When airfare reimbursement is claimed, no allowance will
be paid for road or bridge toll charges or other car expenses. If the
destination is not served by air, fare to the nearest terminal will be allowed
and mileage will be allowed for a round trip from the air terminal to the
destination and back to the terminal. Cost of lodging, meals, and other
expenses en route that would have not been incurred if public transportation
had been used will not be reimbursed.
      3.   When more than one City Official, employee or other representative
travel in one private vehicle, and all have allowable expenses, only the driver
of the vehicle will be reimbursed at the "coach" air fare rate or the allowable
mileage charge, whichever is the lesser. Other employees or officials will be
reimbursed for actual allowable expenses to and from the authorized meeting.
      4.   Unused portions of airplane, railroad, and bus tickets are subject
to refund, and the traveler shall take all steps necessary to secure such
refunds.
   J.   Combined Business and Personal Travel
      Employees wishing to combine business and personal travel should first
seek permission from their supervisors. Personal travel should generally be
defined as planned or unplanned trips that are unrelated to City business. If
an employee combines business and personal travel, expenses should be paid
directly by the employee, not charged to the City, for all those expenses or
portion of expenses that are personal. The city will only reimburse that
portion of a trip and those expenses that are directly related to City
business. In those cases where an employee is approved to have a family member
accompany him or her on a business trip, the employee must pay all additional
expenses (e.g. incremental hotel charges, meals, travel, etc.). No adjustments
are permitted to cover the expenses of accompanying family members.
      a)   If using a rental car, a separate contract must be obtained for the
personal part of the trip.
      b)   If using a personal vehicle, only the mileage related directly to
City business shall be reimbursed.

meals, entertainment during an extended stay, emergency stops, etc.).

decision is upheld by the City Manager for a particular expenditure is upheld
by the City Manager, all employees not covered by union contract may appeal to
the Civil Service Commission. Union employees will follow the established union
grievance process.

expenditures under this section to the City Council.

      Use of the Internet, electronic mail, and online services has great
potential to enhance the productivity of the employees of the City of New
Carlisle. This policy will serve as the framework for the effective use of the
rapidly expanding electronic resources available to employees. Employees must
be held accountable for the use and misuse of government resources, of which
access to the Internet, electronic mail systems, and online services are but

uses subject to abuse.
   A)   Use of Internet, e-mail, and online services.
      1.   Employees must use the Internet and online services only for

related topics.
      2.   There is no expectation of privacy on City owned/provided computer
resources including servers, personal computers, workstations, connections,

threatening statements, including disparagement of others based on their race,
national origin, sex, sexual orientation, age, marital status, pregnancy,
disability, religious or political beliefs.

facilitate normal day-to-day operations.
      B.   Any computer system, P.C. system, portable device, or any other

changes are made to any City owned device in regard to settings, passwords,
software, hardware, or any other change.

or files to which they have no official permission or authority to enter.
      This policy applies to all employees (full or part-time) and other who
are provided access to the City's technology systems. The use of the City's
technology systems shall constitute agreement that the user is aware of this
policy and consents to the terms outlined above. Contractors, volunteers, and
other outside parties should only be provided access to the City's technology
systems when it is necessary for business purposes of the City, and only if
such access is approved by the appropriate Department or Division head, who

(Ord. 07-17.  Passed 5-21-07.)
APPENDIX F: FUNDS RECEIPTS POLICY

by the City of New Carlisle, the following procedures are set forth:
   •   In most cases, payments will be received by the cashier at the City
Building for processing through the cash register.
   •   Any payments received by a City employee during hours that the City
Building is closed, shall be placed in a properly marked envelope and deposited

(Ord. 08-56.  Passed 10-20-08.)
248.05  ADDITIONAL IDENTITY THEFT PREVENTION PROGRAM.
   (a)   Covered Accounts.  A “covered account” includes any account that
involves or is designed to permit multiple payments or transactions. Every new
and existing customer account that meets the following criteria is covered by
this program:
      (1)   Business, personal and household accounts for which there is a
reasonably foreseeable risk of identity theft; or
      (2)   Business, personal and household accounts for which there is a
reasonably foreseeable risk to the safety or soundness of the City from
identity theft, including financial, operational, compliance, reputation, or
litigation risks.
   (b)   Red Flags.
      (1)   The following red flags are potential indicators of fraud. Any time
a red flag, or a situation closely resembling a red flag, is apparent, it
should be investigated for verification.

account privileges by a financial institution or creditor.
   (c)   Suspicious Documents.
      (1)   Documents provided for identification that appear to have been
altered or forged.

consistent with the appearance of the applicant or customer presenting the
identification.
      (3)   Other information on the identification is not consistent with
information provided by the person opening a new covered account or customer
presenting the identification.
      (4)   Other information on the identification is not consistent with
readily accessible information that is on file with the City, such as a
signature card or a recent check.
      (5)   An application appears to have been altered or forged, or gives the
appearance of having been destroyed and reassembled.
   (d)   Suspicious Personal Identifying Information.

fraudulent activity as indicated by internal or third-party sources used by the
City. For example, the address on an application is the same as the address

      (6)   The customer or the person opening the covered account fails to
provide all required personal identifying information on an application or in
response to notification that the application is incomplete.
      (7)   Personal identifying information provided is not consistent with
personal identifying information that is on file with the City.
      (8)   When using security questions (mother's maiden name, pet's name,
etc.), the person opening the covered account or the customer cannot provide
authenticating information beyond that which generally would be available from
a wallet or consumer report.
   (e)   Unusual Use Of, or Suspicious Activity Related To, the Covered
Account.
      (1)   Shortly following the notice of a change of address for a covered
account, the City receives a request for new, additional, or replacement goods
or services, or for the addition of authorized users on the account.
      (2)   A new revolving credit account is used in a manner commonly
associated with known patterns of fraud patterns. For example, the customer
fails to make the first payment or makes an initial payment but no subsequent
payments.
      (3)   A covered account is used in a manner that is not consistent with
established patterns of activity on the account. There is, for example:

in connection with covered accounts held by the City.
      (9)   The City is notified by a customer, a victim of identity theft, a
law enforcement authority, or any other person that it has opened a fraudulent
account for a person engaged in identity theft.
(Ord. 08-56.  Passed 10-20-08.)
248.06  RESPONDING TO RED FLAGS.
   (a)   Once potentially fraudulent activity is detected, an employee must act
quickly as a rapid appropriate response can protect customers and the City from
damages and loss.
      (1)   Once potentially fraudulent activity is detected, gather all
related documentation and write a description of the situation. Present this
information to the designated authority for determination.
      (2)   The designated authority will complete additional authentication to
determine whether the attempted transaction was fraudulent or authentic.
   (b)   If a transaction is determined to be fraudulent, appropriate actions

GENERAL PROVISIONS
248.09   USE OF CITY OWNED VEHICLES.
   To perform job functions more efficiently and to provide a greater level of
service to  residents, in some cases, the City extends the use of City-owned
vehicles  to our employees. The use of said City vehicles shall be governed by
this policy in conjunction with the City's General Driving Rules and
Regulations, already in place.
   (a)   All vehicles are to be used for official City business only; personal
use of the City vehicle is restricted to those employees who are deemed "on-
call". Such personal use is restricted to commuting to and from residence only
and must be reported as a taxable benefit in accordance with the Internal
Revenue Code.
   (b)   Such personal use shall be reported on the attached mileage log and
reported on a monthly basis and turned in to the Finance Director by the tenth
of every month.
   (c)   There shall be no smoking in a City-owned vehicle, either by the
driver or a passenger.
   (d)   City employees who normally use their own means of transportation to
and from work shall not use a City vehicle during their personal breaks, unless
the employee is away from their work base at the time of a personal break.
   (e)   All EMS and fire personnel who are normally permitted to drive a City
vehicle may use the City vehicle during their meal breaks while on duty, so
that they will be able to respond faster to an emergency. Such trips shall be
limited to a five-mile radius of the City.
   (f)   Sheriff office personnel shall be permitted to drive City vehicles to
commute to and from their residence without reporting said mileage as personal,
since they are considered "on-duty" while in the vehicle. Such commuting shall
be limited to within ten miles of the City. This permission shall be reviewed
periodically and may be revoked if the cost of fuel becomes a burden to the
City.
   (g)   All other stipulations of the City's General Driving Rules and
Regulations shall apply, including but not limited to, the wearing of seat
belts, possession of a valid driver's license, the prohibition of talking on a
cell phone while driving, and the prohibition of non-employees in the vehicle.
(Ord. 09-57.  Passed 11-16-06.)
248.10   POLICY FOR USE OF CITY CREDIT CARDS.
   The City allows use of a City-owned credit card for City purchases when: (a)
an emergency exists; (b) payment is needed immediately, for example, a purchase
made online or through the mail; (c) for putting fuel in a city vehicle; and
(d) if the Finance Director prefers payment to be made with a credit card, due
to the dollar amount of the purchase. The use of the credit card is a privilege
and any misuse can result in disciplinary action, including termination of
employment or even a referral for criminal prosecution. All uses of the credit
card shall follow the following procedures:
   (a)   Obtain permission from your immediate supervisor to make the purchase.
   (b)   Ask the Finance Director or designee if they would prefer you use the
credit card  or a purchase order for the purchase.
   (c)   If the Finance Director or designee prefers you use a purchase order,
fill out the  appropriate requisition.
   (d)   If the Finance Director or designee prefers you use the City credit
card, sign the sign out sheet in the Finance Department and receive the credit
card.
   (e)   Fill out the appropriate requisition made out to the credit card
company and have it approved by the proper people.
   (f)   Make the required purchase, making sure that you are not charged sales
tax. The employee signing out a credit card or using the fuel card is
responsible for insuring the City's tax-exempt status is applied to the
transaction(s).
   (g)   The employee signing out a credit card or using the fuel card is
responsible for  obtaining a receipt for every purchase made while the card is
assigned to them.
   (h)   Sign the receipt, with your name and department and turn it in
immediately to  Accounts Payable with the signed requisition.
   (i)   Return the credit card to the Finance Director or designee, sign the
card back in.
   (j)   In the case of fuel purchase cards, a requisition is not required.

(Ord. 12-53.  Passed 11-19-12.)
248.12   PETTY CASH.
   (a)   Purpose. 
      (1)   The petty cash account is a sum of money set aside for minor cash
disbursements for which the issuance of a formal voucher would be impractical.
      (2)   Incidental expenses allowed through petty cash include but are not
limited to: registered mail, postage, emergency supplies, supplies not
available through a vendor, parking expenses, film development, vehicle
licensing, and any one-time purchases that have to be handled on a cash basis.
      (3)   Requests for meals, travel, and mileage related to travel should be
done on an employee expense reimbursement form. All cash reimbursements for
business expenses must meet the requirements of the City’s travel allowance
policies.
   (b)   Policy.
      (1)   There is one petty cash account authorized for the City of New
Carlisle. The amount to be included in the City’s petty cash account shall be
$200.
      (2)   The amount to be disbursed from the petty cash accounts for any
purpose shall not exceed $50 without the prior approval of both the City
Manager and the Finance Director.
      (3)   All subsequent increases or decreases in the City’s established
dollar amount for the petty cash account shall be authorized by the City
Council through resolution.
      (4)   Cash advances are not allowed. However, mitigating circumstances
may arise when the City Manager or Finance Director may choose to approve the
release of petty cash for official City business before the expense has been
incurred (e.g., coin-operated car wash).
      (5)   A custodian shall be appointed for the petty cash account by the
Finance Director.
      (6)   The Finance Director or their designee shall assure that the amount
in the petty cash account is counted and reconciled at least monthly by someone
other than the custodian.
      (7)   The petty cash will be kept in a locked safe place.
      (8)   When petty cash is disbursed, it must be replenished monthly by
check payable to the municipal petty cash. The replenishment should be subject
to the same review and approval as invoices.
      (9)   The petty cash account shall always be replenished at the end of
the fiscal year (December 31st) so that expenditures will be reflected in the
proper accounting period.
      (10)   The replenishment must be by voucher with the appropriate receipts
attached. The receipts should show the date, recipient, the purpose, and 
amount of each cash disbursement. These receipts must be signed by the person
receiving the cash and their department head or designated supervisor.
      (11)   At the time of replenishment, the custodian should ensure that the
balance remaining in petty cash, together with the amount of the replenishment
voucher, equals the total authorized for the petty cash account.
      (12)   The petty cash accounts may not be used for personal cash
advances.
      (13)   The petty cash accounts may not be used to cash checks or City
warrants.
      (14)   The Finance Director or designee will conduct periodic petty cash
audits to ensure proper management of the fund.
   (c)   Procedures for Receiving Petty Cash.
      (1)   The employee makes an approved purchase and obtains a receipt from
the vendor.
      (2)   The custodian assigns a petty cash slip to the employee. The slip
must show date, recipient, item purchased, the purpose, the amount, and the
account to be charged.
      (3)   The employee will be reimbursed with cash upon receipt of the
completed slip. The original, legible, sales invoice or receipt must accompany
the slip.
   (d)   Procedures for Processing Petty Cash.
      (1)   The petty cash custodian will log in the petty cash fund journal
each petty cash slip issued, reflecting the slip number, individual's name, and
department.
      (2)   Upon receiving a completed petty cash slip, the custodian will
verify the dollar amount of the receipt against the requested amount of cash
and record the amount in the journal. The receipt should be attached to the
completed petty cash slip and kept in the petty cash fund until time of
reimbursement.
      (3)   The petty cash account will be balanced at the end of each day that
there is activity. The custodian will sign and date the tape detailing the
petty cash slips, cash and outstanding petty cash slips, and place in the petty
cash box.
      (4)   The petty cash accounts will be replenished monthly using the
claims process. The replacement process is subject to the same review and
approval as other claims.

TITLE TEN - Judiciary
         
Chap. 280.   Mayor's Court.
CHAPTER 280
Mayor's Court
   EDITOR'S NOTE: Ohio R.C. 1905.01 provides that the Mayor of New Carlisle has
jurisdiction to hear and determine any prosecution for the violation of a New
Carlisle ordinance, and has jurisdiction in all criminal causes involving
moving traffic violations occurring on State highways located within the
corporate limits of New Carlisle, subject to the limitations of Ohio R.C.
2937.08 and 2938.04. In keeping his or her docket and file, the Mayor shall be
governed by the laws pertaining to county courts.
   Ohio R.C. 2937.08 provides that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him or her unless the accused, by writing subscribed by him or her, waives a
jury and consents to be tried by the magistrate. If the defendant, in such
event, does not waive his or her right to a jury trial, then the magistrate
shall require the accused to enter into a recognizance to appear before a court
of record in Clark County (the Springfield Municipal Court) and the magistrate
shall thereupon certify all papers filed, together with a transcript of
proceedings and accrued costs to date, and such recognizance, if given, to the
court of record. However, Rule 23(A) of the Ohio Rules of Criminal Procedure
provides that in petty offense cases, where there is a right to jury trial, the
defendant shall be tried by the court unless he or she demands a jury trial.
The jurisdiction of a Mayor's Court, in such cases, is further limited by Rule
9 of the Ohio Traffic Rules, which provides that if a jury demand is not made
pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and the defendant waives his or her right to jury
trial in writing, a mayor may try the case only if (1) his or her compensation
as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case convictions, or (2) he
or she is not the chief executive and administrative officer of the
municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition of the
municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor.
   Ohio R.C. 1901.24 and 2938.04 provide that the right to trial by jury shall
be claimed by making demand in writing therefor and filing the same with the
clerk of the court of record not less than three days prior to the date set for
trial or on or before the day following receipt of notice of the date set for
trial, whichever is later. However, Rule 23(A) of the Ohio Rules of Criminal
Procedure, which presumptively supersedes Ohio R.C. 2938.04, provides that
right to trial by jury shall be claimed by making demand in writing therefor
and filing the same with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the
date set for trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice
of the date set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to claim a jury trial as
provided herein is a complete waiver of the right thereto. Ohio R.C. 2938.04
provides, further, that a jury trial may not be had in courts not of record,
but failure to waive a jury in writing where the right to a jury trial may be
asserted shall require the magistrate to certify such case to a court of record
as provided in Ohio R.C. 2937.08.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any New
Carlisle ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00).
   The Supreme Court of Ohio, on December 4, 1967, promulgated “Rules of
Practice and Procedure in Traffic Cases For All Courts Inferior to Common
Pleas,” the adoption of which became mandatory prior to March 2, 1969. Amended
Rules, referred to as the Ohio Traffic Rules, became effective on January 1,
1975.
   Effective October 20, 1987, Mayors of Mayor's Courts were authorized to
suspend the operator's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege of any person who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.19 or Section
434.01 of the Traffic Code (OVI), in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.05.

while committing the violation and that the distracting activity was a
contributing factor to the commission of the violation, the offender may enter
a written plea of guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket,
citation, or summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total
amount of the fine established for the violation and pays the additional fine
of $100.
            2.   In lieu of payment of the additional fine of $100, the
offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety course, the

violation of any provision of this Traffic Code that is substantially
equivalent to a provision of the Revised Code, and a court is permitted or
required to suspend a person's driver's or commercial driver's license or
permit for a violation of that provision, a court, in addition to any other
penalties authorized by law, may suspend the offender's driver's or commercial
driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for the period of
time the court determines appropriate, but the period of suspension imposed for

414.02   THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through highways, provided
that stop signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals shall be erected at
all intersections with such through highways by the Department of
Transportation as to highways under its jurisdiction and by local authorities
as to highways under their jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this
section. Where two or more State routes that are through highways intersect,
and no traffic-control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall
be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local
authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
Whenever the Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his or her jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this division, he or she shall give notice, in
writing, of that proposed action to the affected local authority at least 30
days before installing or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways, or portions thereof, are hereby designated
as through highways if they are within the Municipality, if they have a
continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of the street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have stop or yield signs or traffic-
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of the street or highway, or
portion thereof, shall be the municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway, or any point on the streets or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided, that in residence districts, the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic-control devices. Where two or
more through highways designated under this division intersect and no traffic-
control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at
one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local authorities having
jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   The Department or local authorities having jurisdiction need not erect
stop signs at intersections they find to be so constructed as to permit traffic
to safely enter a through highway without coming to a stop. Signs shall be
erected at such intersections indicating that the operator of a vehicle shall
yield the right-of-way to or merge with all traffic proceeding on the through
highway.
   (d)   Local authorities, with reference to highways under their
jurisdiction, may designate additional through highways, and shall erect stop
signs, yield signs, or traffic- control signals at all streets and highways
intersecting such through highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop
or yield intersection, and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to
the intersection.
(ORC 4511.65)
414.03   TRAFFIC CONTROL SIGNAL TERMS AND LIGHTS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles and pedestrians shall have

are permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by a lane-use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, are permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in R.C. § 4511.14, pedestrians facing a circular green signal
indication are permitted to proceed across the roadway within any marked or
unmarked associated crosswalk. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection or so close as to create an immediate
hazard at the time that the green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
are thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will
be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in R.C. § 4511.14 or other traffic control device, shall not start to

to proceed is displayed except as provided in divisions (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)
(3) of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by

the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to

opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.

thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. Conduct of

   (a)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
   (b)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don't
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
   (c)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian shall
not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.

withdrawn under this division (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed in accordance with
methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual possessing a valid
permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in division (d)(1)B. of this section, “Emergency medical
technician-intermediate” and “Emergency medical technician- paramedic” have the
same meanings as in R.C. § 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, if there was at
the time the bodily substance was withdrawn a concentration of less than the
applicable concentration of alcohol specified in divisions (a)(1)B., (a)(1)C.,
(a)(1)D. and (a)(1)E. of this section or less than the applicable concentration
of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled
substance specified for a violation of division (a)(1)J. of this section, that
fact may be considered with other competent evidence in determining the guilt
or innocence of the defendant. This division does not limit or affect a
criminal prosecution for a violation of division (b) of this section.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person's attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis. If the chemical
test was obtained pursuant to division (d)(1)B. of this section, the person
tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified technician,
chemist, or phlebotomist of the person's own choosing administer a chemical
test or tests, at the person's expense, in addition to any administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was under arrest as
described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the arresting officer shall advise the
person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent
chemical test taken at the person’s own expense. If the person was under arrest
other than described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the form to be read to the
person to be tested, as required under division (g) of this section, shall
state that the person may have an independent test performed at the person's
expense. The failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical test by a
person shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the chemical
test or tests taken at the request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in division (d)(4)B. and C. of this section, “National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration” means the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration established as an administration of the United States
Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C. 105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including,
but not limited to, any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
division (d)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Division (d)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (d)(4)B. of this section.
   (e)   (1)   Subject to division (e)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of division (a)(1)B.,
(a)(1)C., (a)(1)D., (a)(1)E., (a)(1)F., (a)(1)G., (a)(1)H., (a)(1)I. or (a)
(1)J. or (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3), or (b)(4) of this section or for an equivalent
offense that is substantially equivalent to any of those divisions, a
laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a permit by the
Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this division that
contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine,
or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the information
specified in this division shall be admitted as prima facie evidence of the
information and statements that the report contains. The laboratory report
shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;
         B.   Any findings as to the identity and quantity of alcohol, a drug
of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a

analyst's or test performer's regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst's or test performer's education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control

      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any proceeding,
other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless the
prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant's attorney or, if
the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant's attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant's attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (f)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, any physician,
registered nurse, emergency medical technician-intermediate, emergency medical
technician-paramedic, or qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who
withdraws blood from a person pursuant to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19,
4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid station, or clinic at which
blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19,
4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability and civil liability
based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other claim that is not a
claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing blood from the
person. The immunity provided in this division also extends to an emergency
medical service organization that employs an emergency medical technician-
intermediate or emergency medical technician- paramedic who withdraws blood
under this section. The immunity provided in this division is not available to
a person who withdraws blood if the person engages in willful or wanton
misconduct.
      (2)   As used in division (f)(1), “Emergency medical technician-
intermediate” and “Emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same
meanings as in R.C. § 4765.01.
(ORC 4511.19(A) - (F))
   (g)   Implied Consent.
      (1)   Definitions.  As used in this section:
         A.   “Alcohol monitoring device” means any device that provides for
continuous alcohol monitoring, any ignition interlock device, any immobilizing
or disabling device other than an ignition interlock device that is constantly
available to monitor the concentration of alcohol in a person’s system, or any
other device that provides for the automatic testing and periodic reporting of
alcohol consumption by a person and that a court orders a person to use as a
sanction imposed as a result of the person’s conviction of or plea of guilty to
an offense.
         B.   “Community addiction services provider” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 5119.01.
         C.   “Physical control” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 4511.194.
      (2)   Implied consent to chemical tests. Any person who operates a
vehicle upon a highway or any public or private property used by the public for
vehicular travel or parking within this Municipality or who is in physical
control of a vehicle shall be deemed to have given consent to a chemical test
or tests of the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine
to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a
controlled substance, or combination content of the person's whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine if arrested for a violation of division (a),
(b) or (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal O.V.I.
ordinance.
      (3)   The chemical test or tests under division (g)(2) of this section
shall be administered at the request of a law enforcement officer having
reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating or in physical control
of a vehicle in violation of a division, section, or ordinance identified in
division (g)(2) of this section. The law enforcement agency by which the
officer is employed shall designate which of the tests shall be administered.
      (4)   Effect of death or unconsciousness. Any person who is dead or
unconscious, or who otherwise is in a condition rendering the person incapable
of refusal, shall be deemed to have consented as provided in division (g)(2) of
this section and the test or tests may be administered, subject to Ohio R.C.
313.12 to 313.16.
      (5)   A.   If a law enforcement officer arrests a person for a violation
of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance and if the person
if convicted would be required to be sentenced under Ohio R.C. 4511.19(G)(1)
(c), (d), or (e), the law enforcement officer shall request the person to
submit, and the person shall submit, to a chemical test or tests of the
person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine for the purpose
of determining the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of
a controlled substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood,
blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine. A law enforcement officer who makes a
request pursuant to this division that a person submit to a chemical test or
tests is not required to advise the person of the consequences of submitting
to, or refusing to submit to, the test or tests and is not required to give the
person the form described in division (g)(7) of this section, but the officer
shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that if the person refuses to
take a chemical test the officer may employ whatever reasonable means are
necessary to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person's
whole blood or blood serum or plasma. The officer shall also advise the person
at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent chemical test
taken at the person’s own expense. Divisions (g)(3) and (g)(4) of this section
apply to the administration of a chemical test or tests pursuant to this
division.
         B.   If a person refuses to submit to a chemical test upon a request
made pursuant to division (g)(5)A. of this section, the law enforcement officer
who made the request may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary to
ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole blood
or blood serum or plasma. A law enforcement officer who acts pursuant to this
division to ensure that a person submits to a chemical test of the person’s
whole blood or blood serum or plasma is immune from criminal and civil
liability based upon a claim for assault and battery or any other claim for the
acts, unless the officer so acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a
wanton or reckless manner.
(ORC 4511.191(A))
      (6)   Advice required. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of this
section, the arresting law enforcement officer shall give advice in accordance
with this division to any person under arrest for a violation of division (a),
(b) or (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal O.V.I.
ordinance. The officer shall give that advice in a written form that contains
the information described in division (g)(7) of this section and shall read the
advice to the person. The form shall contain a statement that the form was
shown to the person under arrest and read to the person by the arresting
officer. One or more persons shall witness the arresting officer's reading of
the form, and the witnesses shall certify to this fact by signing the form. 
The person must submit to the chemical test or tests, subsequent to the request
of the arresting officer, within two hours of the time of the alleged violation
and, if the person does not submit to the test or tests within that two-hour
time limit, the failure to submit automatically constitutes a refusal to submit
to the test or tests.
      (7)   Certification of arrest. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of
this section, if a person is under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of
this section, before the person may be requested to submit to a chemical test
or tests to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance,
metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination content of the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine, the arresting officer
shall read the following form to the person:
         “You now are under arrest for (specifically state the offense under
State law or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which the
person was arrested – operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, a
drug, or a combination of them; operating a vehicle while under the influence
of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled
substance; operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption; or having
physical control of a vehicle while under the influence).
         "If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio
driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a
fee to have the privileges reinstated. If you have a prior conviction of
O.V.I., O.V.U.A.C., or operating a vehicle while under the influence of a
listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance
under State or municipal law within the preceding 20 years, you are now under
arrest for State O.V.I., and, if you refuse to take a chemical test, you will
face increased penalties if you subsequently are convicted of the State O.V.I.
         (Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely having
physical control of a vehicle while under the influence.) If you take any
chemical test required by law and are found to be at or over the prohibited
amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled
substance in your whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine as set
by law, your Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you
will have to pay a fee to have the privileges reinstated.
         If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical test
taken at your own expense.”
      (8)   Actions required by arresting officer. If the arresting law
enforcement officer does not ask a person under arrest as described in division
(g)(5) or (g)(6) of this section to submit to a chemical test or tests under
Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this section, the arresting officer shall seize the Ohio
or out-of- state driver's or commercial driver's license or permit of the
person and immediately forward it to the court in which the arrested person is
to appear on the charge. If the arrested person is not in possession of the
person's license or permit or it is not in the person's vehicle, the officer
shall order the person to surrender it to the law enforcement agency that
employs the officer within 24 hours after the arrest, and, upon the surrender,
the agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the court in
which the person is to appear on the charge. Upon receipt of the license or
permit, the court shall retain it pending the arrested person's initial
appearance and any action taken under Ohio R.C. 4511.196.
      (9)   A.   If a law enforcement officer asks a person under arrest as
described in division (g)(5) of this section to submit to a chemical test or
tests under that division and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, or if a law enforcement
officer asks a person under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of this
section to submit to a chemical test or tests under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this
section, if the officer advises the person in accordance with this section of
the consequences of the person's refusal or submission, and if either the
person refuses to submit to the test or tests or, unless the arrest was for a
violation of division (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submits to the test or
tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense, the arresting officer shall do all of the following:
            1.   On behalf of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, notify the
person that, independent of any penalties or sanctions imposed upon the person,
the person's Ohio driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege is suspended immediately, that the suspension
will last at least until the person's initial appearance on the charge, which
will be held within five days after the date of the person's arrest or the
issuance of a citation to the person, and that the person may appeal the
suspension at the initial appearance or during the period of time ending 30
days after that initial appearance;
            2.   Seize the driver's or commercial driver's license or permit of
the person and immediately forward it to the Registrar. If the arrested person
is not in possession of the person's license or permit or it is not in the
person's vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the person is
given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the officer's
employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the
Registrar;
            3.   Verify the person's current residence and, if it differs from
that on the person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit, notify
the Registrar of the change;
            4.   Send to the Registrar, within 48 hours after the arrest of the
person, a sworn report that includes all of the following statements:
               a.   That the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that, at
the time of the arrest, the arrested person was operating a vehicle in
violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B) or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance or for
being in physical control of a stationary vehicle in violation of Ohio R.C.
4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
               b.   That the person was arrested and charged with a violation
of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance;
               c.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
the officer asked the person to take the designated chemical test or tests,
advised the person in accordance with this section of the consequences of
submitting to, or refusing to take, the test or tests, and gave the person the
form described in division (g)(7) of this section;
               d.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
either the person refused to submit to the chemical test or tests or, unless
the arrest was for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submitted to the chemical test or
tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense;
               e.   If the person was under arrest as described in division (g)
(5) of this section and the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance
with that division, that the person was under arrest as described in that
division, that the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance with
that division, and that test results indicated a prohibited concentration of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time
of the alleged offense.
         B.   Division (g)(9)A. of this section does not apply to a person who
is arrested for a violation of division (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.194
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, who is asked by a law enforcement officer to
submit to a chemical test or tests under this section, and who submits to the
test or tests, regardless of the amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or
a metabolite of a controlled substance that the test results indicate is
present in the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine.
      (10)   Sworn report of arresting officer.
         A.   The arresting officer shall give the officer's sworn report that
is completed under this section to the arrested person at the time of the
arrest, or the Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall send the report to the person
by regular first class mail as soon as possible after receipt of the report,
but not later than 14 days after receipt of it. An arresting officer may give
an unsworn report to the arrested person at the time of the arrest provided the
report is complete when given to the arrested person and subsequently is sworn
to by the arresting officer. As soon as possible, but not later than 48 hours
after the arrest of the person, the arresting officer shall send a copy of the
sworn report to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the
charge for which the person was arrested.
         B.   The sworn report of an arresting officer completed under this
section is prima facie proof of the information and statements that it
contains. It shall be admitted and considered as prima facie proof of the
information and statements that it contains in any appeal under Ohio R.C.
4511.197 relative to any suspension of a person's driver's or commercial
driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privilege that results from
the arrest covered by the report.
(ORC 4511.192)

driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident operating
privilege under this section for the time described in Ohio R.C. 4511.191(B) or
(C) is effective immediately from the time at which the arresting officer
serves the notice of suspension upon the arrested person. Any subsequent
finding that the person is not guilty of the charge that resulted in the
person's being requested to take the chemical test or tests under division (g)
(1) through (g)(5)  of this section does not affect the suspension.
      (12)   Initial appearance. If a person arrested for operating a vehicle
in violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or
(B), or any other municipal O.V.I. ordinance, or for being in physical control
of a vehicle in violation of division (o) of this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.194
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, regardless of whether the
person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege is or is not suspended under Ohio R.C. 4511.191(B) or (C)
or Ohio R.C. Chapter 4510, the person's initial appearance on the charge
resulting from the arrest shall be held within five days of the persons' arrest
or the issuance of the citation to him or her, subject to any continuance
granted by the court pursuant to Ohio R.C. 4511.197 regarding the issues
specified in that section.

nonresident operating privilege is suspended under this section or Ohio R.C.
4511.19 files an appeal regarding any aspect of the person's trial or sentence,
the appeal itself does not stay the operation of the suspension.

the same manner as if the offender is being prosecuted for a prohibited
concentration of alcohol.
   (n)   All terms defined in Ohio R.C. 4510.01 apply to this section. If the
meaning of a term defined in Ohio R.C. 4510.01 conflicts with the meaning of

authority and upon submission by the municipality of such engineering, traffic
and other information as the Director considers necessary, designate a school
zone on any portion of a state route lying within the municipality that
includes a crosswalk customarily used by children going to or leaving a school
during recess and opening and closing hours, whenever the distance, as measured
in a straight line, from the school property line nearest the crosswalk to the
nearest point of a crosswalk is no more than 1,320 feet. Such a school zone
shall include the distance encompassed by the crosswalk and extending 300 feet
in each appropriate direction of the state route.

vehicle involved in the offense and the impoundment of that vehicle’s license
plates. If issued, the order shall be issued and enforced under R.C. §
4503.233.
         B.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one violation of this section, R.C. § 4511.203, or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the court may order, for 60 days, the
immobilization of the vehicle involved in the offense and the impoundment of
that vehicle’s license plates. If issued, the order shall be issued and
enforced under R.C. § 4503.233.
         C.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to two or more violations of this section, R.C. § 4511.203, or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the court may order the criminal
forfeiture to the state of the vehicle involved in the offense. If issued, the
order shall be issued and enforced under R.C. § 4503.234.
      (4)   If title to a motor vehicle that is subject to an order for
criminal forfeiture under division (c)(3)C. of this section is assigned or
transferred and R.C. § 4503.234(B)(2) or (B)(3) applies, in addition to or
independent of any other penalty established by law, the court may fine the

responsibility with respect to that vehicle.
   (e)   If a court orders the criminal forfeiture of a vehicle under division
(c)(3)C. of this section, upon receipt of the order from the court, neither the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor any deputy registrar shall accept any
application for the registration or transfer of registration of any motor
vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the order. The period of denial
shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the
termination. If the court terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar,
the Registrar shall take all necessary measures to permit the person to
register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to transfer the

license, or furnish satisfactory proof that the operator has a driver's
license, upon demand of any peace officer or of any person damaged or injured
in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made, and the operator has the operator's driver's license on or about
the operator's person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person's failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person's license
on or about the person's person shall be prima facie evidence of the person's
not having obtained a driver's license.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in division (b)(2) of this section, whoever
violates this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the
offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced

500 hours. The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service
imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under R.C. §
2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of this section,
R.C. § 4507.35, or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense
is a misdemeanor of the first degree.

violation of division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima facie evidence that the license of the person was under
suspension at the time of the alleged violation of division (a)(1) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of division (a)(2) of this section. The
person charged with a violation of division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section

The court shall not release a vehicle from immobilization ordered under this
section unless the court is presented with current proof of financial
responsibility with respect to that vehicle.
      (6)   Any order of criminal forfeiture under this section shall be issued
and enforced under R.C. § 4503.234. Upon receipt of the copy of the order from
the court, neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor a deputy registrar shall
accept any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any
motor vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the declaration of
forfeiture. The period of registration denial shall be five years after the
date of the order, unless, during that period, the court having jurisdiction of
the offense that led to the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the
registrar of the termination. The registrar then shall take necessary measures
to permit the person to register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to
transfer registration of the vehicle.
      (7)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in R.C. § 4509.01. If the offender fails to provide

prima facie evidence that the license of the person was under suspension at the
time of the alleged violation of division (b)(1) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of division (b)(1) of this section may offer evidence
to rebut this prima facie evidence.
      (3)   Whoever violates division (b)(1) of this section is guilty of

2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case.
         B.   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously
was convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of division (b)(1)
of this section, or any combination of two or more violations of division (b)
(1) of this section, R.C. § 4510.11, 4510.111 or 4510.16, or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of the fourth

minimum term of three days in jail. No court shall suspend the first three days
of jail time imposed pursuant to this division.
(R.C. § 4510.037(J))
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to any prosecution brought under division
(a) of this section that the alleged offender drove under suspension, without a
valid permit or driver’s or commercial driver’s license, or in violation of a
restriction because of a substantial emergency, and because no other person was
reasonably available to drive in response to the emergency.

or commercial driver's license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the registrar of motor vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s

prima facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other

to §
698.02(e)(3) or R.C. § 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of up to
500 hours. The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service
imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under R.C. §
2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender previously
has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of this section or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of
the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this division, the offense is a minor
misdemeanor. If within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of this section
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor
of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12, this section, or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance.
   (e)   If the offender is sentenced under division (c)(2) of this section, if
within three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or
pleaded guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12, this section, or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance within the past three years, and
if the offender’s license was expired for more than six months at the time of
the offense, the court may impose a class seven suspension of the offender’s
driver license, commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit,
probationary license, or nonresident operating privilege from the range
specified in Ohio R.C. 4510.02(A)(7).

with electronic monitoring under division (b)(1) or (2) of this section unless,
within 60 days of the date of sentencing, the court issues a written finding on
the record that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the
offender is required to serve the jail term imposed, the offender will not be
able to begin serving that term within the 60-day period following the date of
sentencing.

   (a)   When any child who is in either or both of the following categories is
being transported in a motor vehicle, other than a taxicab or public safety
vehicle as defined in Ohio R.C. 4511.01, that is required by the United States
Department of Transportation to be equipped with seat belts at the time of
manufacture or assembly, the operator of the motor vehicle shall have the child
properly secured in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions in a child
restraint system that meets Federal motor vehicle safety standards:
      (1)   A child who is less than four years of age;
      (2)   A child who weighs less than 40 pounds.
   (b)   When any child who is in either or both of the following categories is
being transported in a motor vehicle, other than a taxicab, that is owned,
leased, or otherwise under the control of a nursery school, or day-care center,
the operator of the motor vehicle shall have the child properly secured in
accordance with the manufacturer's instructions in a child restraint system
that meets Federal motor vehicle safety standards:
      (1)   A child who is less than four years of age;
      (2)   A child who weighs less than 40 pounds.
   (c)   When any child who is less than eight years of age and less than four
feet nine inches in height, who is not required by division (a) or (b) of this
section to be secured in a child restraint system, is being transported in a
motor vehicle, other than a taxicab or public safety vehicle as defined in R.C.
§ 4511.01 or a vehicle that is regulated under R.C. § 5104.015, that is
required by the United States Department of Transportation to be equipped with
seat belts at the time of manufacture or assembly, the operator of the motor
vehicle shall have the child properly secured in accordance with the
manufacturer’s instructions on a booster seat that meets federal motor vehicle
safety standards.
   (d)   When any child who is at least eight years of age but not older than
15 years of age, and who is not otherwise required by division (a), (b), or (c)
of this section to be secured in a child restraint system or booster seat, is
being transported in a motor vehicle, other than a taxicab or public safety
vehicle as defined in Ohio R.C. 4511.01, that is required by the United States
Department of Transportation to be equipped with seat belts at the time of
manufacture or assembly, the operator of the motor vehicle shall have the child
properly restrained either in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions
in a child restraint system that meets federal motor vehicle safety standards
or in an occupant restraining device as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.263.
   (e)   Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause an operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of division (c) or (d) of this section has been
or is being committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket, citation or
summons for a violation of division (c) or (d) of this section or causing the
arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for a violation of division
(c) or (d) of this section, and absent another violation of law, a law
enforcement officer’s view of the interior or visual inspection of a motor
vehicle being operated on any street or highway may not be used for the purpose
of determining whether a violation of division (c) or (d) of this section has
been or is being committed.
   (f)   The Director of Public Safety shall adopt such rules as are necessary
to carry out this section.
   (g)   The failure of an operator of a motor vehicle to secure a child in a
child restraint system, a booster seat or in an occupant restraining device as
required in this section is not negligence imputable to the child, is not
admissible as evidence in any civil action involving the rights of the child
against any other person allegedly liable for injuries to the child, is not to
be used as a basis for a criminal prosecution of the operator of the motor
vehicle other than a prosecution for a violation of this section, and is not
admissible as evidence in any criminal action involving the operator of the
motor vehicle other than a prosecution for a violation of this section.
   (h)   This section does not apply when an emergency exists that threatens
the life of any person operating or occupying a motor vehicle that is being
used to transport a child who otherwise would be required to be restrained
under this section. This section does not apply to a person operating a motor
vehicle who has an affidavit signed by a physician licensed to practice in this
state under R.C. Chapter 4731 or a chiropractor licensed to practice in this
state under R.C. Chapter 4734 that states that the child who otherwise would be
required to be restrained under this section has a physical impairment that
makes use of a child restraint system, booster seat or an occupant restraining
device impossible or impractical, provided that the person operating the
vehicle has safely and appropriately restrained the child in accordance with
any recommendations of the physician or chiropractor as noted on the affidavit.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that
the child was not of an age to which this section applies is a defense against
any ticket, citation or summons issued for violating this section.
   (j)   (1)   Whoever violates division (a), (b), (c), or (d) of this section
shall be punished as follows, provided that the failure of an operator of a
motor vehicle to secure more than one child in a child restraint system,
booster seat or occupant restraining device as required by this section that
occurred at the same time, on the same day and at the same location is deemed
to be a single violation of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in division (j)(1)B. of this
section, the offender is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and shall be fined not
less than twenty-five dollars ($25.00) nor more than seventy-five dollars
($75.00).
         B.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a violation of division (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this section or of a
State law or municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent any of those
divisions, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree.
      (2)   All fines imposed pursuant to division (j)(1) of this section shall
be forwarded to the State Treasurer for deposit in the Child Highway Safety
Fund created by Ohio R.C. 4511.81(I).

   (b)   No person shall install or reinstall in any motor vehicle a
counterfeit or nonfunctional air bag or any object intended to fulfill the
function of an air bag other than an air bag that was designed in conformance
with or that is regulated by Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard Number 208
for the make, model, and model year of the vehicle, knowing that the object is
not in accordance with that standard.
   (c)   No person shall knowingly manufacture, import, sell, or offer for sale
any of the following:

felony to be prosecuted under appropriate state law.
      (2)   A violation of division (c) of this section is a felony to be
prosecuted under appropriate state law.

440.01   LOAD LIMITS.
   (a)   State Regulations.
      (1)   A.   The municipality, with respect to highways under their
jurisdiction, upon application in writing, shall issue a special regional heavy
hauling permit authorizing the applicant to operate or move a vehicle or
combination of vehicles as follows:
            1.   At a size or weight of vehicle or load exceeding the maximum
specified in R.C. §§ 5577.01 to 5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with
R.C. §§ 4513.01 to 4513.37.
            2.   Upon any highway under the jurisdiction of municipality except
those highways with a condition insufficient to bear the weight of the vehicle
or combination of vehicles as stated in the application.
            3.   Issuance of a special regional heavy hauling permit is subject
to the payment of a fee established by the municipality in accordance with this
section.
         B.   In circumstances where a person is not eligible to receive a
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section, the Municipality, with respect
to highways under its jurisdiction, upon application in writing and for good
cause shown, may issue a special permit in writing authorizing the applicant to
operate or move a vehicle or combination of vehicles of a size or weight of
vehicle or load exceeding the maximum specified in Ohio R.C. 5577.01 through
5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with Ohio R.C. 4513.01 through 4513.37,
upon any highway under its jurisdiction.
      (2)   Notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 715.22 and 723.01, the holder of a permit
issued by the Director of Transportation under Ohio R.C. 4513.34 may move the
vehicle or combination of vehicles described in the permit on any highway that
is a part of the State highway system when the movement is partly within and
partly without the corporate limits of the Municipality. No local authority
shall require any other permit or license or charge any license fee or other
charge against the holder of a permit for the movement of a vehicle or
combination of vehicles on any highway which is a part of the State highway
system. The Ohio Director of Transportation shall not require the holder of a
permit issued by the Municipality to obtain a special permit for the movement
of vehicles or combination of vehicles on highways within the jurisdiction of
the Municipality. Permits may be issued for any period of time not to exceed
one year, as the local authority in its discretion determines advisable or for
the duration of any public construction project.
      (3)   A.   The application for a permit issued under this section shall
be in the form that the Municipality prescribes. The Municipality may prescribe
a permit fee to be imposed and collected when any permit described in this
section is issued. The permit fee may be in an amount sufficient to reimburse
the Municipality for the administrative costs incurred in issuing the permit,
and also to cover the cost of normal and expected damage caused to the roadway
or a street or highway structure as the result of the operation of the
nonconforming vehicle or combination of vehicles.
         B.   For the purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the
Director under Ohio R.C. 4513.34, milk transported in bulk by vehicle is deemed
a nondivisible load.
         C.   For purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the Director
under R.C. § 4513.34, three or fewer aluminum coils, transported by a vehicle,
are deemed a nondivisible load. The Director shall adopt rules establishing
requirements for an aluminum coil permit that are substantially similar to the
requirements for a steel coil permit under O.A.C. Chapter 5501:2-1.
      (4)   The Municipality shall issue a special regional heavy hauling
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section upon application and payment of
the applicable fee. However, the Municipality may issue or withhold a special
permit specified in division (a)(1)B. of this section. If a permit is to be
issued, the Municipality may limit or prescribe conditions of operation for the
vehicle and may require the posting of a bond or other security conditioned
upon the sufficiency of the permit fee to compensate for damage caused to the
roadway or a street or highway structure. In addition, the Municipality, as a
condition of issuance of an overweight permit, may require the applicant to
develop and enter into a mutual agreement with the Municipality to compensate
for or to repair excess damage caused to the roadway by travel under the
permit.
      (5)   Every permit issued under this section shall be carried in the
vehicle or combination of vehicles to which it refers and shall be open to
inspection by any police officer or authorized agent of any authority granting
the permit. No person shall violate any of the terms of a permit.
      (6)   The Director of Transportation may debar an applicant from applying
for a special permit under this section upon a finding based on a reasonable
belief that the applicant has done any of the actions specified in R.C. §
4513.34(F).
      (7)   Notice and procedures for debarment shall be as provided in R.C. §
4513.34(G).
      (8)   A.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under
this section that relate to gross load limits.
         B.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to axle load by more than 2,000 pounds per axle or group of
axles.
         C.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to an approved route except upon order of a law enforcement
officer or authorized agent of the issuing authority.
      (9)   A permit issued by the municipality under this section for the
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles is valid for the purposes of
the vehicle operation in accordance with the conditions and limitations
specified on the permit. Such a permit is voidable by law enforcement only for
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles in violation of the weight,
dimension, or route provisions of the permit. However, a permit is not voidable
for operation in violation of a route provision of a permit if the operation is
upon the order of a law enforcement officer.
(ORC 4513.34)
   (b)   Whoever violates division (a) of this section is guilty of a minor
misdemeanor.
(ORC 4513.99)
   (c)   Local Streets. No person shall operate a vehicle exceeding a size as
specified Ohio R.C. 5577.01 through 5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity
with Ohio R.C. 4513.01 through 4513.37, or exceeding a gross weight of five
tons, upon any street in the Municipality other than State routes and County
roads, except those local streets designated as a truck route and marked as
such by appropriate traffic signs, and except when such operation is necessary
to load or unload property, to go to or from the usual place of storage of such
vehicle or to perform any other legitimate business or act other than passage
through the Municipality. Operators of vehicles so deviating from either a
State route or a designated truck route within the Municipality shall confine
such deviation to that required in order to accomplish the purpose of the
departure. On County roads, Council or other duly designated local authority
shall establish reasonable weight limits commensurate with the construction and
material specifications for such roads and the load resistance of such roads as
determined by the County Engineer. County roads shall be posted with signs
indicating such weight limits.
   (d)   Local Permit and Conditions. Upon application and for good cause, the
Police Chief may issue a local permit authorizing an applicant to move an
oversize or overweight vehicle or combination of vehicles upon local streets
and highways.
      (1)   No permittee shall be required to obtain a special permit from the
Ohio Director of Transportation for the movement of the vehicle or combination
of vehicles on streets or highways under local jurisdiction. However, the
approval of the Ohio Director of Transportation shall be required for movement
upon State routes as provided in division (a) of this section.
      (2)   The Police Chief may grant a permit for a single or round trip, or
for such period of time, not to exceed one year, as the Police Chief in his or
her discretion deems advisable, or for the duration of any construction
project. The Police Chief may limit or prescribe terms or conditions of
operation for such vehicle or combination of vehicles by designating the route,
hours, speed or such other restrictions as may be necessary for the
preservation of the public peace, property, health and safety. The Police Chief
may require the posting of bond or other security necessary to compensate for
any damage to a roadway or road structure.
      (3)   For each such permit, the Police Chief shall charge twenty-five
dollars ($25.00), and for each hour of time or any part thereof spent by the
Police Department in supervising the movement of such vehicle, the applicant
shall pay the sum of fifty dollars ($50.00).
      (4)   Except as provided in divisions (a) and (b) of this section,
streets and highways shall be posted with signs indicating “no thru trucks -
gross weight 5 tons” or words of similar import to inform drivers of the
limitations imposed by this section. No driver shall disobey the instructions
indicated on any such sign.
      (5)   Violation of any of the limitations, terms or conditions of the
permit granted by the Police Chief shall be cause for immediate revocation or
suspension of such permit and denial of request for any future permit. Such
violation shall also subject the violator to the penalties prescribed by
Sections
408.01 and
408.02.
440.02   MAXIMUM WIDTH, HEIGHT AND LENGTH.

452.05   WILLFULLY LEAVING VEHICLES ON PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PROPERTY.
   (a)   The County Sheriff or Chief of Police, within the Sheriff’s or Chief’s
respective territorial jurisdiction, or a state highway patrol trooper, upon
notification to the Sheriff or Chief of Police of such action and of the
location of the place of storage, may order into storage any motor vehicle,
including an abandoned junk motor vehicle as defined in R.C. § 4513.63, that:
      (1)   Has come into the possession of the Sheriff, Chief of Police, or
state highway patrol trooper as a result of the performance of the Sheriff’s,

However, when such a motor vehicle constitutes an obstruction to traffic it may

         A.   The vehicle was involved in an accident and is subject to R.C. §
4513.66, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;

Chief of Police, or state highway patrol trooper shall order the removal of the
vehicle.
      (3)   Subject to division (c) of this section, the Sheriff or Chief of
Police shall designate the place of storage of any motor vehicle so ordered

receipt requested, notice that informs the owner or lienholder that the motor
vehicle will be declared a nuisance and disposed of if not claimed within ten

retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage
facility fails to provide the notice required under R.C. § 4513.69(B)(3), if
applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the

search of the records of the Bureau of Motor Vehicles has been conducted and
after notice has been sent to the owner or lienholder as described in this
section, and the search was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice
was sent to the motor vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or
lienholder shall pay to the place of storage a processing fee of $25, in
addition to any expenses or charges incurred in the removal and storage of the
vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of mailing of the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at public auction as provided in R.C. § 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the Sheriff or Chief of Police,
without charge to any party, shall file with the Clerk of Courts of the county
in which the place of storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with
the requirements of this section. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the
Clerk, without charge, shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and
clear of all liens and encumbrances, to the Sheriff or Chief of Police. If the
vehicle is to be disposed of to a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other
facility as provided in R.C. § 4513.62 or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, the Sheriff or Chief of Police shall execute in triplicate
an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, describing the
motor vehicle and the manner in which it was disposed of, and that all
requirements of this section have been complied with. The Sheriff or Chief of
Police shall retain the original of the affidavit for the Sheriff’s or Chief’s
records, and shall furnish two copies to the motor vehicle salvage dealer or
other facility. Upon presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the motor
vehicle salvage dealer, the Clerk of Courts, within 30 days of the
presentation, shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all
liens and encumbrances.
   (e)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the
dealer or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title
to the motor vehicle in the dealer’s or facility’s own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
Clerk of Courts.
   (f)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with this
section.

purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway for 48 hours or longer without notification to the Police
Chief of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in that place.
         B.   For purposes of this division (b)(1), the fact that a motor
vehicle has been so left without permission or notification is prima facie
evidence of abandonment.
         C.   Nothing contained in this section and R.C. §§ 4513.60, 4513.61
and 4513.63 shall invalidate or prevent the enactment of further provisions of
municipal ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor
vehicles on streets, highways, public property or private property within the
municipality.
      (2)   Whoever violates this division (b) is guilty of a minor misdemeanor
and shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the municipality in disposing
of the abandoned junk motor vehicle, less any money accruing to the
municipality from the disposal.

keeping, or restrict a person in the method of storing or keeping, any
collector’s vehicle, as defined by Ohio R.C. 4501.01(F) on private property
with the permission of the person having the right to possession of the

building, fences, vegetation, terrain or other suitable obstruction such that
it cannot be seen by passers-by.

(R.C. § 4513.60)
   (h)   Private Tow-away Zones.
      (1)   The owner of a private property may establish a private tow-away
zone, but may do so only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
         A.   The owner of the private property posts on the property a sign,
that is at least 18 inches by 24 inches in size, that is visible from all
entrances to the property, and that includes all of the following information:
            1.   A statement that the property is a tow-away zone;

If the property is a residential property, the owner of the private property
may include on the sign a statement that only tenants and guests may park in
the private tow-away zone, subject to the terms of the property owner. If the
property is a commercial property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only customers may park in the private
tow- away zone. In all cases, if it is not apparent which persons may park in
the private tow-away zone, the owner of the private property shall include on
the sign the address of the property on which the private tow-away zone is
located or the name of the business that is located on the property designated
as a private tow-away zone.
            3.   If the private tow-away zone is not enforceable at all times,
the times during which the parking restrictions are enforced;
            4.   The telephone number and the address of the place from which a
towed vehicle may be recovered at any time during the day or night;
            5.   A statement that the failure to recover a towed vehicle may
result in the loss of title to the vehicle as provided in R.C. § 4505.101(B).

of this section, the owner of a private property may modify an existing sign by
affixing to the existing sign stickers or an addendum in lieu of replacing the
sign.
         B.   A towing service ensures that a vehicle towed under this division

zone except pursuant to a written contract for the removal of vehicles entered
into with the owner of the private property on which the private tow-away zone
is located.
      (3)   If the owner or operator of a vehicle that is being removed under
authority of division (h)(2) of this section arrives after the vehicle has been
prepared for removal, but prior to its actual removal from the property, the
towing service shall give the vehicle owner or operator oral or written
notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. §
4921.25 in order to obtain release of the vehicle. That fee may be paid by use
of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a mobile credit card
processor and mobile service is not available at the time of the transaction.
Upon payment of that fee, the towing service shall give the vehicle owner or
operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally assessed and the
actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the owner or operator.

that the vehicle is not parked on the private property established as a private
tow-away zone without the consent of the owner of the private property or in
violation of any posted parking condition or regulation.
      (4)   A.   Prior to towing a vehicle under division (h)(2) of this
section, a towing service shall make all reasonable efforts to take as many
photographs as necessary to evidence that the vehicle is clearly parked on
private property in violation of a private tow-away zone established under
division (h)(1) of this section. The towing service shall record the time and

(2) of this section to the location from which it may be recovered not more
than two hours after the time it was removed from the private tow-away zone,
unless the towing service is unable to deliver the motor vehicle within two
hours due to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or other event that is
not within the power of the towing service.
      (5)   A.   If an owner of a private property that is established as a
private tow- away zone in accordance with division (h)(1) of this section
causes the removal of a vehicle from that property by a towing service under
division (h)(2) of this section, the towing service, within two hours of

jurisdiction that is established as a private tow-away zone of which the
Sheriff or Police Chief has received notice under this division (h). The record

timely manner. Subject to division (h)(6)D. of this section, the towing service
or storage facility shall send notice to the vehicle owner and any known
lienholder as follows:
            1.   Within five business days after the Registrar of Motor
Vehicles provides the identity of the owner and any lienholder of the motor

costs of labor and material used to install and to eventually remove the
parking space is payable as follows:
      (1)   For permanently disabled applicants the installation fee is payable
over a one-year period, due in increments of fifty dollars ($50.00) at the time
of installation, and twenty-five dollars ($25.00) due before the third quarter

454.04   EXCLUSION OF SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS.
   (a)   The approval and installation of a parking space under this policy
does not in any way indicate that a location will receive any priority
consideration for street cleaning, snow removal, street repair or any other
services extended to all residents and property owners in the normal day-to-day
operation of the City.
   (b)   The approval and installation of a parking space under this policy
does not exclude the vehicle(s) registered to the holder of the permit from
enforcement of any section of the vehicular traffic codes of the City of New
Carlisle or State of Ohio, including those sections regarding abandoned
vehicles, temporary no-parking restrictions to permit construction or
maintenance operations, and those sections defining the proper positioning of
parked vehicles within the public right-of-way.

conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. When knowledge of
the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge
is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high
probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious
purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of
a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with
heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial

due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s

negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.

to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for that element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for that element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for that
element.

accused purposely avoids prosecution.  Proof that the accused departed this
Municipality or conceals the accused’s identity or whereabouts is prima facie
evidence of the accused’s purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (i)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information, or process that commenced the prosecution
is quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information, or process are
set aside or reversed on appeal.
   (j)   The period of limitation for a violation of this Part 6 or Title XXIX
of the Ohio Revised Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under 18 years of age or of a child with a developmental disability
or physical impairment under 21 years of age shall not begin to run until
either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred.
   (k)   As used in this section, “peace officer” has the same meaning as in
Ohio R.C. 2935.01.
   (l)   The amendments to divisions (a) and (d) of this section apply to a
violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.02 or 2907.03 committed on and after July 16, 2015,
and apply to a violation of either of those sections committed prior to July
16, 2015, if prosecution for that violation was not barred under this section
as it existed on July 15, 2015.
(R.C. § 2901.13)
606.07   REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY; VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, a person is not
guilty of an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one division
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that division does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose
to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other divisions
of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses defined
in R.C. Title XLV.
      (3)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution of
the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense.  Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense.  Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Culpability.”  Purpose, knowledge, recklessness, or negligence, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2901.22.
      (2)   “Intoxication.”  Includes but is not limited to intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
      (3)   “Involuntary acts.”  Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during
unconsciousness or sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product
of the actor’s volition are involuntary acts.
      (4)   “Possession.”  A voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
(ORC 2901.21)
606.08   ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent,
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer,
agent, or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the
scope of the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except
that if the section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or
employees for whose conduct the organization is accountable or the
circumstances under which it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated, or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners, or by a
high managerial officer, agent, or employee acting in behalf of the
organization and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or
employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent, or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission.  This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, “organization” means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust, or other commercial or
legal entity.  “Organization” does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.
(ORC 2901.23)
606.09   PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent, or employee of an organization, as defined in Ohio
R.C. 2901.23, may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization,
if he or she acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of
the offense, and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he or she engages
in conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such
conduct, or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he or she has
direct responsibility;
      (2)   He or she has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on
the organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
or she is subject to the same penalty as if he or she had acted in his or her
own behalf.
(ORC 2901.24)
606.10   FALSIFICATION.

following applies:

governmental agency of a license, permit, authorization, certificate,

another person empowered to administer oaths.
      (7)   The statement is in writing on or in connection with a report or
return that is required or authorized by law.
      (8)   The statement is in writing, and is made with purpose to induce
another to extend credit to or employ the offender, or to confer any degree,
diploma, certificate of attainment, award of excellence, or honor on the
offender, or to extend to or bestow upon the offender any other valuable
benefit or distinction, when the person to whom the statement is directed
relies upon it to his or her detriment.

commission of a theft offense.
      (10)   The statement is knowingly made to a probate court in connection
with any action, proceeding, or other matter within its jurisdiction, either

      (11)   The statement is made on an account, form, record, stamp, label or
other writing that is required by law.
      (12)   The statement is made in connection with the purchase of a

sheriff pursuant to R.C. § 2923.125 in order to obtain or renew a concealed
handgun license or is made in an affidavit submitted to a county sheriff to
obtain a concealed handgun license on a temporary emergency basis under R.C. §
2923.1213.
      (15)   The statement is required under Ohio R.C. 5743.71 in connection
with the person’s purchase of cigarettes or tobacco products in a delivery
sale.
   (b)   No person, in connection with the purchase of a firearm as defined in

false information about the purchaser’s identity.
   (c)   No person, in an attempt to obtain a concealed handgun license under

document that purports to be certification of the person’s competence in
handling a handgun as described in division (B)(3) of that section.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under division (a)(6) of this section
that the oath or affirmation was administered or taken in an irregular manner.
   (e)   If contradictory statements relating to the same fact are made by the

the death of a person shall fail to report the death immediately to a physician
or advanced practice registered nurse whom the person knows to be treating the
deceased for a condition from which death at such time would not be unexpected,
or to a law enforcement officer, an ambulance service, an emergency squad, or
the coroner in a political subdivision in which the body is discovered, the

report required by division (c) of this section was made, or to any law
enforcement officer who has reasonable cause to assert the authority to

      (5)   Anyone participating in the making of reports under division (e) of
this section or anyone participating in a judicial proceeding resulting from

patient’s or client’s records.
      (2)   Notwithstanding R.C. § 4731.22, the physician-patient privilege or
advanced practice registered nurse-patient privilege shall not be a ground for

immediate family.

source, privileged under R.C. §

member of the ordained clergy of an organized religious body of a confidential

actor in the course of his or her duties in connection with a bona fide program
of treatment or services for drug dependent persons or persons in danger of
drug dependence, which program is maintained or conducted by a hospital,
clinic, person, agency or community addiction services provider whose alcohol
and drug addiction services are certified pursuant to R.C. § 5119.36.
      (6)   Disclosure would amount to revealing information acquired by the
actor in the course of his or her duties in connection with a bona fide program
for providing counseling services to victims of crimes that are violations of
R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.05, or to victims of felonious sexual penetration in

services” include services provided in an informal setting by a person who, by
education or experience, is competent to provide those services.
   (h)   No disclosure of information pursuant to this section gives rise to
any liability or recrimination for a breach of privilege or confidence.
   (i)   Whoever violates division (a) or (b) of this section is guilty of
failure to report a crime. Violation of division (a)(1) of this section is a

section is a misdemeanor of the second degree.

regardless of whether the person or child aided ultimately is apprehended for,
is charged with, is convicted of, pleads guilty to, or is adjudicated a
delinquent child for committing the crime or act the person or child aided
committed.  The crime or act the person or child aided committed shall be used

whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.

an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Ohio R.C. 2923.02 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.

defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense, or an offense, the court shall charge the jury in accordance with Ohio
R.C. 2923.03(D).

prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his or her complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete
and voluntary renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.

commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he or she
were a principal offender.  A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of
this section, or in terms of the principal offense.

basis of the alleged offense has been weighed and analyzed and stating the
findings as to the content, weight, and identity of the substance and that it
contains any amount of a controlled substance and the number and description of
unit dosages, is prima facie evidence of the content, identity, and weight or
the existence and number of unit dosages of the substance. In any criminal
prosecution for a violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.041 or a violation of this
chapter, Ohio R.C. Chapter 2925 or Ohio R.C. Chapter 3719 that is based on the
possession of chemicals sufficient to produce a compound, mixture, preparation,
or substance included in Schedule I, II, III, IV, or V, a laboratory report
from the Bureau or from any laboratory that is operated or established as

analyst appointed by the court.  Such portion shall be a representative sample
of the entire substance that is, or of each of the substances that are, the
basis of the alleged violation and shall be of sufficient size, in the opinion
of the court, to permit the accused’s analyst to make a thorough scientific
analysis concerning the identity of the substance or substances.  The

portion at least 14 days prior to trial, unless the trial is to be held in a
court not of record or unless the accused person is charged with a minor
misdemeanor, in which case the prosecuting attorney shall provide the accused’s
analyst with the sample portion at least three days prior to trial.  If the
prosecuting attorney determines that such a sample portion cannot be preserved

the accused person, or the accused’s attorney.  In such a circumstance, the
accused person is entitled, upon written request made to the prosecuting
attorney, to have the accused’s privately employed or court appointed analyst
present at an analysis of the substance that is, or the substances that are,
the basis of the alleged violation, and, upon further written request, to

of the alleged violation.  Also, the accused person is entitled, upon further
written request, to receive copies of all recorded scientific data that result
from the measurement or weighing and that can be used by an analyst in arriving
at conclusions, findings, or opinions concerning the weight, volume, or number

make such investigations as he or she deems appropriate to ascertain facts and
issues. Such investigation shall be conducted within fourteen business days

occurred, he or she shall attempt to conciliate the matter by methods of
initial conference and persuasion with all interested parties and such
representatives as the parties may choose to assist them. Conciliation

the parties agree thereto in writing.
   (c)   The terms of conciliation agreed to by the parties shall be reduced to
writing and incorporated into a consent agreement to be signed by the parties,

admission by such parties that the law has been violated. Such consent

   (d)   The Board may seek the cooperation and aid of the Ohio Real Estate
Commission, the Ohio Civil Rights Commission, the United States Department of
Housing and Urban Development or any other person or group, regarding any
matter before the Board.

order such further investigation as may be necessary. However, the Board shall

   (f)   If the Secretary, with respect to a matter which involves a violation
of this chapter, fails to conciliate a complaint after the parties have in good
faith attempted such conciliation, or fails to effect an informal conciliation
agreement or an informal consent agreement or determines that a complaint is
not susceptible to conciliation, he or she shall so notify the Board and the
Board shall thereafter schedule a public hearing to determine whether or not
such a violation has been committed. The Board shall serve upon the respondent
a written statement of charges and a summons, and shall serve upon all
interested parties a notice of the time and place of the hearing. The
respondent or his or her authorized counsel may file and amend such statement
with the Board prior to the hearing date as it deems necessary in support of
its position. The hearing shall be open to the public and shall be held not
less than fifteen days nor more than thirty days after service of the statement
of charges and the summons. The summons so issued must be signed by two members
of the Board, and the issuance of such summons requires the attendance of named
persons and the production of relevant documents and records. The failure to
comply with a summons shall constitute a violation of this chapter. The
interested parties may, at their option, appear before the Board in person or
by a duly authorized representative and may have the assistance of an attorney.
The parties may present testimony in evidence and may cross-examine witnesses.
All testimony in evidence shall be given under oath or by affirmation. The
Secretary shall keep a full record of the hearing, which record shall be public
and open to inspection. Upon request by a party principal to the proceeding,
the Board shall furnish such party a copy of the hearing record, at such cost
as the Board deems appropriate.

prepare and issue an order under Board directive requiring the person

the matter to the Director of Law for enforcement. The Director shall seek
compliance by appropriate civil action brought in the name of the Human Rights
Board before a court of competent jurisdiction.

law (Ohio R.C. 4933.42 and 4933.99(A)) was repealed by the Ohio General
Assembly by Sub. S.B. No. 183, effective September 26, 1984.  See Sections
642.01 and

642.24   DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or services is involved in a theft
offense or in a violation of Ohio R.C. 1716.14(A) involving a victim who is an
elderly person or disabled adult, or any substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate
value of all property or services involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.02, or a series
of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate,
or complicity in violations of Ohio R.C. 1716.14(A), Ohio R.C. 2913.02,
2913.03, or 2913.04, Ohio R.C. 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2), or Ohio R.C. 2913.31 or
2913.43 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02, or a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or
complicity in violations of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43 involving a victim who is
an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense.  The value of the property or services involved in the series of
offenses for the purpose of determining the value as required by Ohio R.C.
2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property and services involved in all
offenses in the series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.02
that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims, all of
the offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If an offender is being tried
for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation
of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Ohio R.C. 1716.14
(A), Ohio R.C. 2913.02, 2913.03, or 2913.04, Ohio R.C. 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2),
or Ohio R.C. 2913.31 or 2913.43, whether committed against one victim or more
than one victim, involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult,
or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, 
pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried
as a single offense. If an offender is being tried for the commission of a
series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to
violate, or complicity in violations of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, whether
committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving a victim who is
an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member
pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried
as a single offense.  If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the value
of the property or services involved for the purpose of determining the value
as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property and
services involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   When a series of two or more offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.40,
2913.48, or 2921.41 is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another, all of those offenses may be
tried as a single offense.  If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the
value of the property or services involved for the purpose of determining the
value as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all
property and services involved in all of the offenses in the series of two or
more offenses.
      (4)   In prosecuting a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2) or
(b)(3) of this section, it is not necessary to separately allege and prove each
offense in the series.  Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the
offender, within a given span of time, committed one or more theft offenses or
violations of Ohio R.C. 2913.40, 2913.48, or 2921.41 in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in division (b)
(1) or (b)(3) of this section, or committed one or more theft offenses that
involve a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims or a scheme or
course of conduct as described in division (b)(2) of this section. While it is
not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series in
order to prosecute a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) of
this section, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a single offense to
prove the aggregate value of the property or services in order to meet the
requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector’s item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that either is irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort, or money, is the amount which
would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment, and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation, or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under division (c)(1) of this section, and which retains substantial utility
for its purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing
such property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under division (c)(1) or (2) of this section, and the value of services, is the
fair market value of the property or services.  As used in this section, “fair
market value” is the money consideration which a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence which may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is prima
facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest marked quotation prior to the offense, is prima facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry, or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry, or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check, or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token, or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services which may be received by the
instrument is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping, or other services for which the rate is established
by law, the duly established rate is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing, or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.

642.25   DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
642.09(a)(1) or (b)(1):
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector’s item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort, or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under division (a)(1) of this
section, and the physical harm is such that the property can be restored
substantially to its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is
the reasonable cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under division (a)(1) of this
section, and the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored
substantially to its former condition, the value of the property, in the case
of personal property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property
of like kind and quality, and in the case of real property or real property
fixtures, is the difference in the fair market value of the property
immediately before and immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, “fair market value” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2913.61.
   (c)   Prima facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Ohio
R.C. 2913.61(D), may be used to establish the value of property pursuant to
this section.

is prima facie evidence that the person who is obligated to pay for the service
rendered through the meter, conduit or attachment, and who is in possession or
control of the meter, conduit or attachment at the time the tampering occurred
has caused the tampering with intent to commit a theft offense.
   (b)   In a prosecution for a theft offense, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2913.01,
that involves the alleged reconnection of a gas, electric, steam or water
meter, conduit or attachment of a utility that has been disconnected by the
utility, proof that a meter, conduit or attachment disconnected by a utility
has been reconnected without the consent of the utility is prima facie evidence
that the person in possession or control of the meter, conduit or attachment at
the time of the reconnection has reconnected the meter, conduit or attachment
with intent to commit a theft offense.
   (c)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Utility” means any electric light company, gas company, natural

698.01   DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   “Dangerous offender” means a person who has committed an offense,
whose history, character and condition reveal a substantial risk that he or she
will be a danger to others, and whose conduct has been characterized by a
pattern of repetitive, compulsive or aggressive behavior with heedless
indifference to the consequences.
   (b)   “Repeat offender” means a person who has a history of persistent
criminal activity and whose character and condition reveal a substantial risk
that he or she will commit another offense. It is prima facie evidence that a
person is a repeat offender if any of the following applies:
      (1)   Having been convicted of one or more offenses of violence, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2901.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence
for one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent offense of
violence;
      (2)   Having been convicted of one or more sexually oriented offenses, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2950.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence
for one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent sexually
oriented offense;
      (3)   Having been convicted of one or more theft offenses, as defined in
Ohio R.C. 2913.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence for one or
more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent theft offense;
      (4)   Having been convicted of one or more felony drug abuse offenses, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2925.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence
for one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent felony drug
abuse offense;
      (5)   Having been convicted of two or more felonies, and having been
imprisoned pursuant to sentence for any such offense, the person commits a
subsequent offense;
      (6)   Having been convicted of three or more offenses of any type or
degree other than traffic offenses, alcoholic intoxication offenses, or minor
misdemeanors, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence for any such
offense, the person commits a subsequent offense.
(ORC 2935.36(E))
698.02   PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   Considerations in Misdemeanor Sentencing.
      (1)   A court that sentences an offender for a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of any provision of the Ohio Revised Code, or of any
municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent to a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, shall be guided
by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing. The overriding purposes
of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the
offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the
sentencing court shall consider the impact of the offense upon the victim and
the need for changing the offender’s behavior, rehabilitating the defender, and
making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or the victim and
the public.
      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation
of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of a municipal ordinance
that is subject to division (a)(1) of this section shall be reasonably
calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing set
forth in division (a)(1) of this section, commensurate with and not demeaning
to the seriousness of the offender’s conduct and its impact upon the victim,
and consistent with sentences imposed for similar offenses committed by similar
offenders.
      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a
violation of a municipal ordinance that is subject to division (a)(1) of this
section shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic background, gender,
or religion of the offender.
      (4)   Divisions (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section shall not apply to any
offense that is disposed of by a traffic violations bureau of any court
pursuant to Traffic Rule 13 and shall not apply to any violation of any
provision of the Ohio Revised Code that is a minor misdemeanor and that is
disposed of without a court appearance. Divisions (a)(1) to (a)(3) of this
section do not affect any penalties established by the Municipality for a
violation of its ordinances that are not substantially equivalent to a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised
Code.
(ORC 2929.21)
   (b)   Misdemeanor Jail Terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in Section
666.99 or
698.03 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 or division (b)(5) or (b)
(6) of this section and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant
to law, if the sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor elects or is required to impose a jail term on the offender
pursuant to this chapter, the court shall impose a definite jail term that
shall be one of the following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than 180 days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than 90 days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than 60 days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than 30 days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under
division (b) of this section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in
intermittent confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as
provided in division (d)(2) of this section. The court retains jurisdiction
over every offender sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at
any time, but the court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in R.C. § 2935.01, has filed a
notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under division (b)
of this section and the court assigns the offender to a County Jail that has
established a County Jail Industry Program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the
court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be
considered for participation in the program. During the offender's term in the
County Jail, the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification
regarding the offender's participation in the County Jail Industry Program.
      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to division (b) of
this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in
which the term is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56,
or 2947.19 and Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in division
(b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times specified in
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the Clerk of the Court may issue a certificate of judgment
against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in division (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
      (5)   If an offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation
of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(B), or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance,
also is convicted of or also pleads guilty to a specification of the type
described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1414 and if the court imposes a jail term on the
offender for the underlying offense, the court shall impose upon the offender
an additional definite jail term of not more than six months. The additional
jail term shall not be reduced pursuant to any provision of the Ohio Revised
Code. The offender shall serve the additional jail term consecutively to and
prior to the jail term imposed for the underlying offense and consecutively to
any other mandatory term imposed in relation to the offense.
      (6)   A.   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on
the offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the
offender an additional definite jail term as follows:
            1.   Subject to division (b)(6)A.2. of this section, an additional
definite jail term of not more than 60 days;
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of Ohio R.C. 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 regarding one or
more of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than 120
days.
         B.   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (b)(6)A. of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (b)(6)A. of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division shall commence on the date specified by the court, provided that
the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has served the jail
term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24,
2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and
any residential sanction imposed for the violation under division (d) of this
section or Ohio R.C. 2929.26. A sanction imposed under this division shall be
considered to be a community control sanction for purposes of division (c) or
this section or Ohio R.C. 2929.25, and all provisions of this Code and the Ohio
Revised Code that pertain to community control sanctions shall apply to a
sanction imposed under this division, except to the extent that they would by
their nature be clearly inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs
associated with a sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of
the use of the monitoring device.
      (7)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. § 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1423 that charges that the
victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at the
time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory jail
term that is a definite term of at least 30 days.
      (8)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(b), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s own motion, the court, in
the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one or more community control sanctions under division (d) or (e) of this
section for any jail days that are not mandatory jail days.
(ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Misdemeanor Community Control Sanctions.
      (1)   A.   Except as provided in Section
666.99 and
698.03 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.22 and 2929.23 or when a jail term is
required by law, in sentencing an offender for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, the sentencing court may do either of the following:
            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of one or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this
section. The court may impose any other conditions of release under a community
control sanction that the court considers appropriate. If the court imposes a
jail term upon the offender, the court may impose any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions in addition to the jail
term.
            2.   Impose a jail term under division (b) of this section from the
range of jail terms authorized under that division for the offense, suspend all
or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this section.
         B.   The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon an
offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not exceed five years.
         C.   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)
(1)A.1. of this section, the court shall state the duration of the community
control sanctions imposed and shall notify the offender that if any of the
conditions of the community control sanctions are violated the court may do any
of the following:
            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community control sanction
if the total time under all of the offender's community control sanctions does
not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this section;
            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control sanction under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, but the court is not required to
impose any particular sanction or sanctions;
            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (b) of this section.
      (2)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control sanction
or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)(1)A.1.
of this section, the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender
and the period of community control for the duration of the period of community
control. Upon the motion of either party or on the court’s own motion, the
court, in the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may
modify the community control sanctions or conditions of release previously
imposed, substitute a community control sanction or condition of release for
another community control sanction or condition of release previously imposed,
or impose an additional community control sanction or condition of release.
      (3)   A.   If a court sentences an offender to any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, the court shall place the offender
under the general control and supervision of the court or of a department of
probation in the jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes of reporting
to the court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. If
the offender resides in another jurisdiction and a department of probation has
been established to serve the Municipal Court or County Court in that
jurisdiction, the sentencing court may request the Municipal Court or the
County Court to receive the offender into the general control and supervision
of that department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing
court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The
sentencing court retains jurisdiction over any offender whom it sentences for
the duration of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
         B.   The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
State without the permission of the court or the offender's probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and ensuring
the offender's good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on
the offender.  The offender's compliance with the additional requirements also
shall be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the
offender.
      (4)   A.   If the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences the
offender to any community control sanction or combination of community control
sanctions authorized under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, and the
offender violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the public or private
person or entity that supervises or administers the program or activity that
comprises the sanction shall report the violation directly to the sentencing
court or to the department of probation or probation officer with general
control and supervision over the offender. If the public or private person or
entity reports the violation to the department of probation or probation
officer, the department or officer shall report the violation to the sentencing
court.
         B.   If an offender violates any condition of a community control
sanction, the sentencing court may impose upon the violator one or more of the
following penalties:
            1.   A longer time under the same community control sanction if the
total time under all of the community control sanctions imposed on the violator
does not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this
section;
            2.   A more restrictive community control sanction;
            3.   A combination of community control sanctions, including a jail
term.
         C.   If an offender was acting pursuant to R.C. § 2925.11(B)(2)(b), or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and in so doing violated the
conditions of a community control sanction based on a minor drug possession
offense, as defined in R.C. § 2925.11, the sentencing court may consider the
offender’s conduct in seeking or obtaining medical assistance for another in
good faith or for self or may consider the offender being the subject of
another person seeking or obtaining medical assistance in accordance with that
division as a mitigating factor before imposing any of the penalties described
in division (c)(4)B. of this section.
         D.   If the court imposes a jail term upon a violator pursuant to
division (c)(4)B. of this section, the total time spent in jail for the
misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community control
sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the offense for
which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may reduce the
longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under the longer
sanction or the more restrictive sanction imposed under division (c)(4)B. of
this section by all or part of the time the violator successfully spent under
the sanction that was initially imposed.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an offender, for
a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a community control
sanction imposed pursuant to division (d), (e), or (f) of this section in an
exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time under the community
control sanction or impose a less restrictive community control sanction.
Fulfilling the conditions of a community control sanction does not relieve the
offender of a duty to make restitution under division (f) of this section.
(R.C. § 2929.25)
   (d)   Community Residential Sanction.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any community residential sanction or combination of
community residential sanctions under this division (d).  Community residential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         A.   A term of up to 180 days in a halfway house or a term in a
halfway house not to exceed the longest jail term available for the offense,
whichever is shorter, if the political subdivision that would have
responsibility for paying the costs of confining the offender in a jail has
entered into a contract with the halfway house for use of the facility for
misdemeanor offenders;
         B.   If the offender is an eligible offender, as defined in R.C. §
307.932, a term in a community alternative sentencing center or district
community alternative sentencing center established and operated in accordance
with that section, in the circumstances specified in that section, with one of
the conditions of the sanction being that the offender successfully complete
the portion of the sentence to be served in the center.
      (2)   A sentence to a community residential sanction under division (d)
(1)B. of this section shall be in accordance with R.C. § 307.932. In all other
cases, the court that sentences an offender to a community residential sanction
under this division (d) may do either or both of the following:
         A.   Permit the offender to serve the offender’s sentence in
intermittent confinement, overnight, on weekends or at any other time or times
that will allow the offender to continue at the offender’s occupation or care
for the offender’s family;
         B.   Authorize the offender to be released so that the offender may
seek or maintain employment, receive education or training, receive treatment,
perform community service, or otherwise fulfill an obligation imposed by law or
by the court. A release pursuant to this division shall be only for the
duration of time that is needed to fulfill the purpose of the release and for
travel that reasonably is necessary to fulfill the purposes of release.
      (3)   The court may order that a reasonable portion of the income earned
by the offender upon a release pursuant to division (d)(2) of this section be
applied to any financial sanction imposed under division (f) of this section.
      (4)   No court shall sentence any person to a prison term for a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor or to a jail term for a minor misdemeanor.
      (5)   If a court sentences a person who has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor to a community residential sanction as described in
division (d)(1) of this section, at the time of reception and at other times
the person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction determines to be appropriate, the person in charge of the operation of
the halfway house, community alternative sentencing center, district community
alternative sentencing center, or other place may cause the convicted offender
to be examined and tested for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis,
including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C, and other contagious
diseases. The person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction may cause a convicted offender in the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place who refuses to be tested or treated for tuberculosis,
HIV infection, hepatitis, including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C,
or another contagious disease to be tested and treated involuntarily.
      (6)   The Municipality may enter into a contract with a halfway house for
use of the halfway house to house misdemeanor offenders under a sanction
imposed under division (d)(1)A. of this section.
(ORC 2929.26)
   (e)   Nonresidential Sanction Where Jail Term is not Mandatory.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any nonresidential sanction or combination of
nonresidential sanctions authorized under this division.  Nonresidential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         A.   A term of day reporting;
         B.   A term of house arrest with electronic monitoring or continuous
alcohol monitoring or both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring, a term of electronic monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring
without house arrest, or a term of house arrest without electronic monitoring
or continuous alcohol monitoring;
         C.   A term of community service of up to 500 hours for misdemeanor of
the first degree or 200 hours for a misdemeanor of the second, third, or fourth
degree;
         D.   A term in a drug treatment program with a level of security for
the offender as determined necessary by the court;
         E.   A term of intensive probation supervision;

         G.   A term of monitored time;
         H.   A term of drug and alcohol use monitoring, including random drug
testing;
         I.   A curfew term;
         J.   A requirement that the offender obtain employment;
         K.   A requirement that the offender obtain education or training;
         L.   Provided the court obtains the prior approval of the victim, a
requirement that the offender participate in victim-offender mediation;
         M.   If authorized by law, suspension of the offender’s privilege to
operate a motor vehicle, immobilization or forfeiture of the offender’s motor
vehicle, a requirement that the offender obtain a valid motor vehicle
operator’s license, or any other related sanction;
         N.   A requirement that the offender obtain counseling if the offense
is a violation of Ohio R.C. 2919.25 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance or a violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.13 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance involving a person who was a family or household member at
the time of the violation, if the offender committed the offense in the
vicinity of one or more children who are not victims of the offense, and if the
offender or the victim of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian, or
person in loco parentis of one or more of those children. This division does
not limit the court in requiring that the offender obtain counseling for any
offense or in any circumstance not specified in this division.
      (2)   If the court imposes a term of community service pursuant to
division (e)(1)C. of this section, the offender may request that the court
modify the sentence to authorize the offender to make a reasonable
contribution, as determined by the court, to the general fund of the county,
municipality, or other local entity that provides funding to the court. The
court may grant the request if the offender demonstrates a change in
circumstances from the date the court imposes the sentence or that the
modification would otherwise be in the interests of justice. If the court
grants the request, the offender shall make a reasonable contribution to the
court, and the clerk of the court shall deposit that contribution into the
general fund of the county, municipality, or other local entity that provides
funding to the court. If more than one entity provides funding to the court,
the clerk shall deposit a percentage of the reasonable contribution equal to
the percentage of funding the entity provides to the court in that entity’s
general fund.
      (3)   In addition to the sanctions authorized under division (e)(1) of
this section, the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, upon an offender who is not required to serve a mandatory
jail term may impose any other sanction that is intended to discourage the
offender or other persons from committing a similar offense if the sanction is
reasonably related to the overriding purposes and principles of misdemeanor
sentencing.
      (4)   The court imposing a sentence for a minor misdemeanor may impose a
term of community service in lieu of all or part of a fine. The term of
community service imposed for a minor misdemeanor shall not exceed 30 hours. 
After imposing a term of community service, the court may modify the sentence
to authorize a reasonable contribution, as determined by the court, to the
appropriate general fund as provided in division (e)(2) of this section.
(ORC 2929.27)
   (f)   Financial Sanctions.
      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2947.23,
the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a
minor misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or
combination of financial sanctions authorized under this division (f). If the
court in its discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial
sanctions that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not
limited to, the following:
         A.   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor or could
be disposed of by the Traffic Violations Bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or
any survivor of the victim, in an amount based upon the victim’s economic loss.
The court may not impose restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if
the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be disposed of by the Traffic
Violations Bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13. If the court
requires restitution, the court shall order that the restitution be made to the
victim in open court or to the adult probation department that serves the
jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of the victim.
            2.   If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine
the amount of restitution to be paid by the offender. If the court imposes
restitution, the court may base the amount of restitution it orders on an
amount recommended by the victim, the offender, a presentence investigation
report, estimates or receipts indicating the cost of repairing or replacing
property, and other information, provided that the amount the court orders as
restitution shall not exceed the amount of economic loss suffered by the victim
as a direct and proximate result of the commission of the offense. If the court
decides to impose restitution, the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on
restitution if the offender, victim, or survivor disputes the amount of
restitution. If the court holds an evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the
victim or survivor has the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence
the amount of restitution sought from the offender.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any
survivor of the victim against the offender.  No person may introduce evidence
of an award of restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under R.C. § 3937.18.
            4.   If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the
offender pay a surcharge, of not more than 5% of the amount of the restitution
otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and processing
restitution payments.
            5.   The victim or survivor of the victim may request that the
prosecutor in the case file a motion, or the offender may file a motion, for
modification of the payment terms of any restitution ordered. If the court
grants the motion, it may modify the payment terms as it determines
appropriate.
         B.   Fines. A fine of the type described in divisions (f)(1)B.1. and
2. of this section payable to the appropriate entity as required by law:
            1.   A fine in the following amount:
               a.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00);
               b.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
               c.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five
hundred dollars ($500.00);
               d.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two
hundred fifty dollars ($250.00);
               e.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty
dollars ($150.00).
            2.   A State fine or cost as defined in Ohio R.C. 2949.111.
         C.   Reimbursement.
            1.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
               a.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community
control sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021;
               b.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined;
               c.   All or part of the cost of purchasing and using an
immobilizing or disabling device, including a certified ignition interlock
device, or a remote alcohol monitoring device that a court orders an offender
to use under Ohio R.C. 4510.13.
            2.   The amount of reimbursement under division (f)(1)C.1. of this
section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is able
to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may
collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under that
division. If the court does not order reimbursement under that division,
confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under
Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.   
      (2)   A.   If the court determines a hearing is necessary, the court may
hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay the financial
sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f) or court costs or is likely in
the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.
         B.   If the court determines that the offender is indigent and unable
to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court shall consider imposing
and may impose a term of community service under division (e)(1) of this
section in lieu of imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If the court
does not determine that the offender is indigent, the court may impose a term
of community service under division (e)(1) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this division (f) and in
addition to imposing court costs. The court may order community service for a
minor misdemeanor pursuant to division (e)(4) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this section and in addition to
imposing court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial sanction or court
costs, the court may order community service in lieu of the financial sanction
or court costs.
      (3)   A.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a county pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e),
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to the County
Treasurer. The County Treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements in the
County’s General Fund. The County shall use the amounts deposited in the fund
to pay the costs incurred by the County pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         B.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the offender
pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs incurred by a
municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under division  (d),
(e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine
offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to
the Treasurer of the municipal corporation. The Treasurer shall deposit the
reimbursements in the municipal corporation’s General Fund. The municipal
corporation shall use the amounts deposited in the fund to pay the costs
incurred by the municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         C.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)C. of this section for the costs incurred by a private provider
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section
to the provider.
      (4)   In addition to any other fine that is or may be imposed under this
division (f), the court imposing sentence upon an offender for misdemeanor
domestic violence or menacing by stalking may impose a fine of not less than
$70 nor more than $500, which shall be transmitted to the Treasurer of Ohio to
be credited to the address confidentiality program fund created by R.C. §
111.48.
      (5)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this division (f)(5), a
financial sanction imposed under division (f)(1) of this section is a judgment
in favor of the state or the political subdivision that operates the court that
imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial
sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed
pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.a. of this section upon an offender is a
judgment in favor of the entity administering the community control sanction,
and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the judgment debtor. A
financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.b.
of this section upon an offender confined in a jail or other residential
facility is a judgment in favor of the entity operating the jail or other
residential facility, and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the
judgment debtor. A financial sanction of restitution imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)A. of this section is an order in favor of the victim of the
offender’s criminal act that can be collected through a certificate of judgment
as described in division (f)(5)B.1. of this section, through execution as
described in division (f)(5)B.2. of this section or through an order as
described in division (f)(5)B.3. of this section and the offender shall be
considered for purposes of the collection as a judgment debtor.
         B.   Once a financial sanction is imposed as a judgment or order under
this division, the victim, private provider, state, or political subdivision
may do any of the following:
            1.   Obtain from the Clerk of the court in which the judgment was
entered a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same manner and form as
a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;
            2.   Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in Ohio R.C.
2929.18(D)(1) and (D)(2) or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
            3.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under Ohio R.C. 1321.33 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
      (6)   The civil remedies authorized under division (f)(5) of this section
for the collection of the financial sanction supplement, but do not preclude,
enforcement of the criminal sentence.
      (7)   Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (f) may designate the Clerk of the Court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The Clerk, or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:
         A.   Enter into contracts with one or more public agencies or private
vendors for the collection of amounts due under the sanction. Before entering
into a contract for the collection of amounts due from an offender pursuant to
any financial sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f), a court shall
comply with Ohio R.C. 307.86 to 307.92.
         B.   Permit payment of all or any portion of the sanction in
installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a County Court or
a Municipal Court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that the court considers just, except that the
maximum time permitted for payment shall not exceed five years. If the court is
a County Court or a Municipal Court operated by a county, the acceptance of
payments by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the policy
adopted by the Board of County Commissioners of the county pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 301.28. If the court is a Municipal Court not operated by a county, the
Clerk may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic transfer out of
public money or may charge the fee to the offender.
         C.   To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to an
offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.
      (8)   No financial sanction imposed under this division (f) shall
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.
(R.C. § 2929.28)
698.03   IMPOSING SENTENCE FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   (1)   Unless a mandatory jail term is required to be imposed by Ohio
R.C. 1547.99(G), 4510.14(B), or 4511.19(G), or any other provision of the
Revised Code, or any municipal ordinance, a court that imposes a sentence under
this chapter upon an offender for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor has
discretion to determine the most effective way to achieve the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section
698.02.
      (2)   Unless a specific sanction is required to be imposed or is
precluded from being imposed by the section setting forth an offense or the
penalty for an offense or by any provision of Sections
666.99 or
698.02 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.23 to 2929.28, a court that imposes a
sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor may impose on the offender any
sanction or combination of sanctions under Section
698.02(b) to (f). The court shall not impose a sentence that imposes an
unnecessary burden on local government resources.
   (b)   (1)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, the
court shall consider all of the following factors:
         A.   The nature and circumstances of the offense or offenses;
         B.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender has a history of persistent criminal
activity and that the offender's character and condition reveal a substantial
risk that the offender will commit another offense;
         C.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender's history, character, and condition
reveal a substantial risk that the offender will be a danger to others and that
the offender's conduct has been characterized by a pattern of repetitive,
compulsive, or aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to the
consequences;
         D.   Whether the victim's youth, age, disability, or other factor made
the victim particularly vulnerable to the offense or made the impact of the
offense more serious;
         E.   Whether the offender is likely to commit future crimes in
general, in addition to the circumstances described in divisions (b)(1)B. and
C. of this section.
         F.   Whether the offender has an emotional, mental, or physical
condition that is traceable to the offender’s service in the armed forces of
the United States and that was a contributing factor in the offender’s
commission of the offense or offenses;
         G.   The offender’s military service record.
      (2)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, in
addition to complying with division (b)(1) of this section, the court may
consider any other factors that are relevant to achieving the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section
698.02(a).
   (c)   Before imposing a jail term as a sentence for a misdemeanor, a court
shall consider the appropriateness of imposing a community control sanction or
a combination of community control sanctions under Section
698.02(c), (d), (e), and (f). A court may impose the longest jail term
authorized under Section
698.02(b) only upon offenders who commit the worst forms of the offense or upon
offenders whose conduct and response to prior sanctions for prior offenses
demonstrate that the imposition of the longest jail term is necessary to deter
the offender from committing a future crime.
   (d)   (1)   A sentencing court shall consider any relevant oral or written
statement made by the victim, the defendant, the defense attorney, or the
prosecuting authority regarding sentencing for a misdemeanor. This division
does not create any rights to notice other than those rights authorized by Ohio
R.C. Chapter 2930.
      (2)   At the time of sentencing for a misdemeanor or as soon as possible
after sentencing, the court shall notify the victim of the offense of the
victim's right to file an application for an award of reparations pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2743.51 to 2743.72.
(ORC 2929.22)
698.04   ORGANIZATIONAL PENALTIES.
   (a)   Regardless of the other penalties provided in Section
698.02, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.09 shall be fined by the court as follows:
      (1)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than five thousand
dollars ($5,000.00);
      (2)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than four thousand
dollars ($4,000.00);
      (3)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than three thousand
dollars ($3,000.00);
      (4)   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two thousand
dollars ($2,000.00);
      (5)   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one thousand dollars
($1,000.00);
      (6)   For a misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than two
thousand dollars ($2,000.00);
      (7)   For a minor misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than
one thousand dollars ($1,000.00).
   (b)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty plainly indicates a
purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon organizations, then
such penalty shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty provided in this section.
   (c)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than that provided
in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be pursuant to the penalty
provided for violation of the section defining the offense.
   (d)   This section does not prevent the imposition of available civil
sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.08, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
section.
(ORC 2929.31)
698.05   MULTIPLE SENTENCES.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, Ohio R.C. 2929.14
(C), or Ohio R.C. 2971.03(D) or (E), a prison term, jail term, or  sentence of
imprisonment shall be served concurrently with any other prison term, jail
term, or sentence of imprisonment imposed by a court of this Municipality, the
State, another state, or the United States.  Except as provided in division (b)
(2) of this section, a jail term or sentence of imprisonment for misdemeanor
shall be served concurrently with a prison term or sentence of imprisonment for
felony served in a State or Federal correctional institution.
   (b)   (1)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment for a misdemeanor shall
be served consecutively to any other prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively or when it is imposed for a misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C.
2907.322, 2921.34 or 2923.131.  When consecutive sentences are imposed for
misdemeanors under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the
consecutive terms imposed, except that the aggregate term to be served shall
not exceed 18 months.
      (2)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment imposed for a misdemeanor
violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.14, 4510.16, 4510.21, or 4511.19, or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, shall be served consecutively to
a prison term that is imposed for a felony violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.06,
2903.07, 2903.08 or 4511.19 or a felony violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.04
involving the operation of a motor vehicle by the offender and that is served
in a State correctional institution when the trial court specifies that it is
to be served consecutively. When consecutive jail terms or sentences of
imprisonment and prison terms are imposed for one or more misdemeanors and one
or more felonies under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of
the consecutive terms imposed, and the offender shall serve all terms imposed
for a felony before serving any term imposed for a misdemeanor.

698.06   MODIFICATION OF SENTENCE.  (REPEALED)
   (EDITOR'S NOTE:  Section
698.06 was repealed as part of the 2006 updating and revision of these Codified
Ordinances because substantially equivalent State law (Ohio R.C. 2929.51) was
repealed by the Ohio General Assembly.)
698.07   SUSPENSION OF DRIVER’S LICENSE.
   Except as otherwise provided in Ohio R.C. 4510.07 or in any other provision
of the Revised Code, whenever an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
violation of any provision of this Code of Ordinances that is substantially
equivalent to a provision of the Revised Code, and a court is permitted or
required to suspend a person's driver's or commercial driver's license or
permit for a violation of that provision, a court, in addition to any other
penalties authorized by law, may suspend the offender's driver's or commercial
driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privileges for the period
of time the court determines appropriate, but the period of suspension imposed
for the violation of the provision of this Code of Ordinances shall not exceed
the period of suspension that is permitted or required to be imposed for the
violation of the provision of the Revised Code to which the provision of this
Code of Ordinances is substantially equivalent.

(Ord. 95-17.  Passed 9-18-95.)
812.03   PURPOSE.
   (a)   The City of New Carlisle finds that the development of cable
television and communications systems has the potential of having great benefit
and impact upon the people of New Carlisle. Because of the complex and rapidly
changing technology associated with cable television, the City further finds
that the public convenience, safety and general welfare can best be served by
establishing regulatory powers which should be vested in the City or such
persons as the City shall designate. It is the intent of this chapter and
subsequent amendments to provide for and specify the means to attain the best
possible public interest and public purpose in these matters,  and any
franchise issued pursuant to this chapter shall be deemed to include this
finding as an integral part thereof.  Further, it is recognized that cable
communications systems have the capacity to provide not only entertainment and
information services to the City's residents, but also a variety of broadband,
interactive communications services to institutions and individuals. Many of
these services involve City agencies and other public institutions, by
providing governmental, educational or health-care communications.
   (b)   For the purposes set forth in subsection (a) hereof, the following
goals underlie the regulations contained herein:
      (1)   Communications services should be provided to the maximum number of
City residents.
      (2)   The system should be capable of accommodating both the present and
the reasonably foreseeable future communications needs of the City, as
specified herein.
      (3)   The system should be improved and upgraded during the franchise
term, as specified in this chapter and the franchise, so that the new
facilities necessary for the operation of this system shall be integrated to
the maximum extent possible with existing facilities.
      (4)   The communications system authorized by this chapter shall be
responsive to the needs and interests of the local community and shall provide
the widest possible diversity of information sources and services to the
public.
(Ord. 95-17.  Passed 9-18-95.)
812.04   FRANCHISE REQUIRED.
   No person shall establish, operate or carry on the business of distributing
to any other person in the franchise area any television signals or radio
signals by means of a system unless a franchise therefor has first been
obtained and unless such franchise is in full force and effect.
(Ord. 95-17.  Passed 9-18-95.)
812.05   GRANT OF FRANCHISE; CONDITIONS.
   (a)   Authority and Responsibility of Franchisees.  In the event that the
City shall grant a nonexclusive, revocable franchise to construct, operate and
maintain a cable communications system within the City, said franchise shall
constitute both a right and an obligation to provide the services of a cable
communications system, as regulated by the provisions of this chapter and the
franchise agreement.
   (b)   Franchise Area. The franchise area shall be the entire City, or
portions thereof for which a franchise is granted.
   (c)   Use of Public Rights-of-Way. For the purpose of operating and
maintaining a cable communications system in the City, a grantee may erect,
install, construct, repair, replace, reconstruct and retain in, on, over,
under, upon, across and along the public streets and ways within the City, such
wires, cables, conductors, ducts,  conduits, vaults, manholes, amplifiers,
appliances, pedestals, attachments and other property and equipment as are
necessary for the operation of the cable communications system, provided,
however, that a grantee complies with all design, construction, safety and
performance provisions contained in this chapter, the franchise agreement and
other applicable local ordinances.
   (d)   Use of City Facilities. A grantee shall make use of existing poles and
other facilities available to it. A grantee may erect its own poles and install
its own conduit, with approval of the City, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld. All poles and conduit installed within the cable service
territory shall be made available for attachment or use by a grantee, at just
and reasonable rates applied to public utilities, under the formula established
in 47 U.S.A.  224, as the same may be amended from time to time.
   (e)   Term of Franchise. The term of any franchise granted pursuant to this
chapter shall be stated in the franchise agreement.
   (f)   Timeliness of Performance. Whenever an agreement shall set forth any
time for an act to be performed by or on behalf of a grantee, such time shall
be deemed of the essence and any failure of a grantee to perform within the
time allotted shall always be sufficient ground for the city to invoke an
appropriate penalty, including possible revocation of the franchise.
   (g)   Applicable Law. In any controversy or dispute under this chapter,
Federal law, the rules of the Federal Communications Commission, Ohio law and
City ordinances shall apply.
(Ord. 95-17.  Passed 9-18-95.)
812.06   NONEXCLUSIVITY OF FRANCHISE.
   (a)   Any franchise granted pursuant to this chapter shall be nonexclusive.
   (b)   The City reserves the right to award additional franchises, provided,
however, that the City shall not authorize or permit another person to
construct, operate or maintain a cable system, or otherwise to utilize the
streets for the delivery to subscribers of any service, on terms and conditions
which are more favorable or less burdensome than those applied to the grantee,
with respect to the following specific matters:
      (1)   The term of any such authorization shall be no more than the term
of this franchise;
      (2)   The franchise fee assessed on any such other person shall be no
less, as a percent or portion of the person's gross revenues that are
attributable to its provision of any service, than the fee the grantee pays
under this franchise for any similar service; and
      (3)   The channels and support for public, educational and governmental
access channels provided by any such other person shall be no less than the
channels and support provided by the grantee.
   (c)   If the City authorizes or permits another person to utilize the
streets to deliver any service to subscribers, the City shall do so on
condition that such cable television system indemnify and hold harmless a
grantee from and against all costs and expenses incurred in strengthening
poles, replacing poles, rearranging attachments and placing underground
facilities, and all other costs, including those of a grantee, the City and
utilities, which are incidental to inspections, preparation and construction of
an additional cable television system in the franchise area, provided that a
grantee shall be designated a third party beneficiary of such conditions as are
incorporated into the authorization(s) granted to another cable television
system.
   (d)   In the event another person is authorized to provide services on terms
and conditions that, with respect to any of the specific matters identified
above, are more favorable or less burdensome than the terms and conditions
applicable to a grantee under this agreement, the City shall adjust the terms
and conditions in such other authorization, or in this agreement, so that the
terms and conditions applicable to the other person are not more favorable or
less burdensome than those that are applicable to prior grantees.
(Ord. 95-17.  Passed 9-18-95.)
812.07   TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP OR CONTROL.
   (a)   No franchise granted hereunder shall be sold, transferred, leased,
assigned or disposed of, including, but not limited to, transfer by force or
voluntary sale, merger, consolidation, receivership or other means, nor shall
the control of a grantee be changed, without the prior consent of the City,
which consent will not be unreasonably withheld. The City may require
additional financial guarantees, security pledges and/or assurances that the
new grantees' customer service will be equivalent to that of a prior grantee.
   (b)   A grantee shall immediately provide written notification to the City
of any actual change in, transfer of, or acquisition by any other party of,
control of said grantee. The word “control,” as used herein, is not limited to
major stockholders, but includes actual working control in whatever manner
exercised. A rebuttable presumption that a transfer of control has occurred
shall arise upon the disposal by a grantee, directly or indirectly, by gift,
assignment, voluntary sale, merger, consolidation or otherwise, of fifty
percent or more, at one time, of the ownership or controlling interest in the
system, or fifty percent cumulatively, over the term of the franchise, of such
interests, to a corporation, partnership, limited partnership, trust or
association, or to a person or group of persons acting in concert.
   (c)   Every change, transfer or acquisition of control of a grantee shall
make the franchise subject to cancellation, unless and until the City shall
have consented thereto, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld. For
the purpose of determining whether it shall consent to such change, transfer or
acquisition of control, the City may inquire into the legal, financial and
technical qualifications of the prospective controlling party, and the grantee
shall assist the City in any such inquiry.
   (d)   The City agrees that any financial institution having a pledge of the
franchise or its assets for the advancement of money for the construction and/
or operation of the franchise shall have the right to notify the City that it,
or its designees satisfactory to the City, will take control and operate the
cable television system. Further, said financial institution shall also submit
a plan for such operation that will insure continued service and compliance
with all franchise obligations during the term the financial institution
exercises control over the system. The financial institution shall not exercise
control over the system for a period exceeding one year, unless extended by the
City at its discretion, and, during said period of time, it shall have the
right to petition for transfer of the franchise to another grantee. If the City
finds that such transfer, after considering the legal, financial, character,
technical and other public interest qualifications of the applicant, is
satisfactory, the City will transfer and assign the rights and obligations of
such franchise as are in the public interest. The consent of the City to such
transfer shall not be unreasonably withheld.
   (e)   The consent or approval of the City to any transfer of a grantee shall
not constitute a waiver or release of the rights of the City in and to the
streets, and any transfer shall, by its terms, be expressly subject to the
terms and conditions of this chapter and the franchise.
   (f)   Any approval by the City of transfer of ownership or control shall be
contingent upon an assignee's becoming a signatory to the franchise agreement,
or,  in the case of transfer of control, the new controlling party will certify
that it will  continue under the same terms and conditions as are set forth in
this chapter and the franchise agreement. 
(Ord. 95-17.  Passed 9-18-95.)
812.08   VARIANCES.
   To accommodate a significant change in circumstances and to prevent
unreasonable hardship to a grantee, or to permit technical variations which
will satisfy the purpose of this franchise, applications for a variance from
this franchise may be made by a grantee to the City. The City shall review such
application within fourteen calendar days or at the earliest meeting of the
City Council, whichever is later, and shall issue a report its findings and act
on such application within thirty days. If a grantee cannot reach an agreement
with the City on the variance within such time, the grantee may resort to the
procedure set forth in Section
812.11(e) for resolution of the dispute.
(Ord. 95-17.  Passed 9-18-95.)
812.09   FRANCHISE RENEWAL.
   Upon completion of the term of any franchise granted under this chapter, the
City may, in its sole discretion, grant or deny renewal of the franchise of a
grantee in accordance with the renewal provisions of the Cable Act,
incorporated herein by reference, as the same may be amended from time to time.
A grantee shall own the cable communication system, but shall have no property
right in the public rights-of-way upon the completion of the franchise term.
(Ord. 95-17.  Passed 9-18-95.)
812.10   FRANCHISE FEES.
   (a)   Findings.  The City finds that:
      (1)   The streets of the State, the County and the City to be used by a
grantee in the operation of its system within the boundaries of the franchise
area are valuable public properties acquired and maintained by the State, the
County and the City at great expense to their taxpayers;
      (2)   The grant, to a grantee of the said streets is a valuable property
right,  without which said grantee would be required to invest substantial
capital in right- of-way costs and acquisitions; and
      (3)   The administration of this chapter and the franchise agreement
imposes upon the City additional regulatory responsibility and expense.
   (b)   Payment of Franchise Fee.  A grantee of any franchise hereunder shall
pay to the City a franchise fee in an amount up to the maximum allowable by
law, to be established in the franchise agreement. The City shall be furnished
with a statement of said payment by an officer of the grantee reflecting the
total amounts of annual gross revenues and the above charges and computations
for the period covered by the payment.
   (c)   Franchise Fee to be in Addition to Other Tax or Payment. The payment
of a franchise fee shall be in addition to any other tax or payment owed to the
governments, or other taxing jurisdiction, by a grantee. Payment of the
franchise fee made by a grantee to the City shall not be considered in the
nature of a tax, but shall be in addition to any and all taxes which are now or
may be required hereafter to be paid by any Federal, State or local law.
   (d)   Acceptance by the City. No acceptance of any payment by the City shall
be construed as a release or as an accord and satisfaction of any claim the
City may have for further or additional sums payable as a franchise fee under
this chapter or for the performance of any other obligation of a grantee. The
City shall deem the payment of franchise fees as a release or as an accord and
satisfaction of any claim the City may have for further franchise fee sums
relating to said payment if, after four years from the payment of any such fee
the City has not notified a grantee of the conditions set forth in Section
812.11(f).
   (e)   Failure to Make Required Payment. In the event that any franchise
payment or recomputed amount is not made on or before the dates specified
herein, a grantee shall pay, as additional compensation, an interest charge
computed from such due date at the annual rate equal to the commercial prime
interest rate of the City's primary depository bank during the period that such
unpaid amount is owed.
   (f)   Payments to be Made Quarterly. The franchise fee and any other cost or
damage assessed against a grantee shall be payable quarterly to the City of New
Carlisle. A grantee shall file a complete and accurate verified statement of
all gross revenues within the franchise area during the period for which said
quarterly payment is made, and said payment shall be made to the City no later
than forty-five days following the end of each calendar quarter. Quarterly
computation dates are the last day in the months of March, June, September and
December.
   (g)   Inspection of Records; Audits. The City shall have the right to
inspect a grantee's income records upon reasonable notice, and the City
reserves the right to audit and to recompute any amounts determined to be
payable under this chapter. Any additional amount due the City as a result of
the audit shall be paid within thirty days following written notice to a
grantee by the City, which notice shall include a copy of the audit report.
(Ord. 95-17.  Passed 9-18-95.)
812.11   VIOLATIONS; REMEDIES.
   (a)   Notice of Violation. The City shall provide a grantee with a detailed
written notice of any franchise violation upon which it proposes to take
action, and a ninety-day period within which said grantee may demonstrate that
a violation does not exist or may cure an alleged violation, or, if the nature
of the violation prevents its correction within ninety days, may initiate a
reasonable plan of action to correct such violation and notify the City of such
plan of action.
   (b)   Default. If a grantee fails to disprove or correct the violation
within ninety days or, in the case of a violation which cannot be corrected in
ninety days, if a grantee has failed to initiate a reasonable plan of
corrective action and to correct the violation within the specified time frame,
then the City may declare the grantee in default, which declaration must be in
writing. In the event that the City declares a  grantee in default, the City
shall have the right to institute legal proceedings to collect damages from the
date of declaration of default or to exercise any other rights and remedies
afforded to the City in law or equity, provided, however, that the City may
institute revocation proceedings against a grantee only after a declaration of
default, pursuant to this subsection, and only on the grounds set forth in
subsection (f) hereof.
   (c)   Hearing Available to Grantee. Within fifteen days after receipt of a
written declaration of default from the City, a grantee may request, in
writing, a hearing before the City or its agent, in a full public proceeding
affording due process. Such hearing shall be held within thirty days of the
receipt of the request therefor, and a decision shall be rendered within ten
days after the conclusion of the hearing. Any decision shall be in writing and
shall be based upon written findings of fact.
   (d)   Appeal of Default. A grantee may appeal a declaration of default to
arbitration.
   (e)   Procedures Applicable to Arbitration. Any arbitration held pursuant to
this franchise shall be conducted as follows:

arbitration) shall each, within fifteen days of the decision to proceed to
arbitration, appoint one arbitrator experienced in the cable television
business, which arbitrators shall mutually select a third arbitrator of similar
qualifications.
      (2)   Within thirty days after appointment of all arbitrators and upon
fifteen days' written notice to the parties to the arbitration, the arbitrators
shall commence a hearing on the dispute.
      (3)   The hearing shall be recorded and may be transcribed at the request
of either the City or the grantee.
      (4)   At the close of the hearing, and within thirty days, the
arbitrators shall prepare written findings and serve such decision upon the

the parties to the arbitration.
      (6)   Either party may seek judicial relief to the arbitrators' decision
under the following circumstances:

         D.   If the designated time limits have been exceeded;
         E.   If the arbitrators have not proceeded expeditiously; or
         F.   If, based upon the record, the arbitrators' decision is
arbitrary, capricious, unsupported by substantial evidence, an abuse of
discretion or based upon a mistake of law.
      (7)   All costs of arbitration shall be borne equally by the parties to
the arbitration, unless otherwise ordered by the arbitrators.
   (f)   Revocation of Franchise. 
      (1)   The City may revoke the franchise only after a declaration of
default and only for defaults by a grantee arising from the following
circumstances:
         A.   There has been material misrepresentation by a grantee to the
City with respect to information required to be provided under the franchise.
         B.   A grantee willfully or persistently violates any material orders
or rulings of any regulatory body having jurisdiction over the franchise.
         C.   A grantee willfully fails to acquire the insurance required by
the franchise.
      (2)   The procedures governing revocation of a franchise shall be as
follows:
         A.   The City shall give written notice to a grantee of its intent to
revoke the franchise and the lawful grounds therefor. The grantee shall have
ninety days from the date of such notice to object, in writing, and to state
its reasons for such objection. In the event the City does not receive a
satisfactory response from the grantee, the City may then proceed to place its
request for termination of the franchise at a Council meeting. The City shall
cause to be served upon the grantee, at least thirty days prior to the time and
place of such meeting, a written notice of this intent to request such
termination and the time and place of the meeting, which notice shall also be
published by the City at least once, ten  days before such meeting, in a
newspaper of general circulation within the City.
         B.   In addition to a grantee's right to appeal any declaration of
default to arbitration under subsection (d) hereof, if the City orders the
termination of this franchise, a grantee shall have the right to appeal the
determination of the City within thirty days to any agency or court of
competent jurisdiction for de novo review. The City's determination to
terminate this franchise shall be effective pending final resolution of all

812.12      UNAUTHORIZED USE.
   (a)   No person shall intercept, descramble, decode or receive, or assist in
intercepting, descrambling, decoding or receiving, any signals from the system
unless specifically authorized to do so by a grantee. “Assist in intercepting,
descrambling, decoding or receiving” includes the manufacture or distribution
of equipment intended by the manufacturer or distributor (as the case may be)
for unauthorized reception of signals over a system.
   (b)   No person shall tamper with, remove or injure any cable, wires or
other devices used with the system, unless specifically authorized to do so by
a grantee.

grantee's express written consent.
   (e)   A grantee may bring an action to restrain or enjoin a violation or
threatened violation of this section, and for damages resulting from the
violation. A grantee shall be entitled to the issuance of such an injunction
upon a showing that a violation has occurred or will occur, without the need
for demonstrating irreparable injury, inadequacy of legal remedies or
probability of recovery. The court shall award the greater of five hundred
dollars ($500.00) or treble damages and reasonable attorneys' fees to a grantee
if it prevails in an action hereunder.
   (f)   If an unauthorized device designed to intercept, descramble or decode
a cable television signal is present on the premises or property occupied and
used by a person, it is presumed that the person knowingly used the device to
intercept, descramble or decode cable signals. If an unauthorized cable
connection is present on the premises or property occupied and used by a
person, it is presumed that the person knowingly used the connection to
intercept cable signals. If equipment of a grantee, which has been tampered
with, changed or modified, is present on the premises or property occupied by a
person, it is presumed that the person knowingly used the equipment to
intercept, descramble or decode cable signals.
   (g)   A grantee is expressly reserved its applicable rights and remedies
available in law or in equity.
   (h)   In addition to the provisions of Section
812.05(a), no person who owns or controls any residential multiple dwelling

interfere with the right of any tenant or lawful resident thereof to receive
service from a grantee.
   (i)      No person shall knowingly violate any of the provisions of this
section.

812.13   RECEIVERSHIP AND FORECLOSURE.
   (a)   Termination by Insolvency. The franchise granted hereunder shall, at
the option of the City, cease and terminate 120 days after the appointment of a
receiver or receivers or trustee or trustees to take over and conduct the
business of a grantee,  whether in a receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy
or other action or proceeding,  unless such receivership or trusteeship shall
have been vacated prior to the expiration of said 120 days, or unless:
      (1)   Such receivers or trustees shall have, within 120 days after their

agreement duly approved by the court having jurisdiction in the premises,
whereby such receivers or trustees assume and agree to be bound by each and
every term, provision and limitation of the franchise herein granted.
   (b)   Termination by Judicial Action. In the case of a foreclosure or other
judicial sale of the plant, property and equipment of a grantee, or any part
thereof, including or excluding the franchise, the City may serve notice of
termination upon said grantee and the successful bidder at such sale, in which
event the franchise and all rights and privileges of said grantee granted
hereunder shall cease and terminate thirty days after service of such notice,
unless:
      (1)   The City shall have approved the transfer of the franchise, in the
manner provided in this chapter; and

conditions.
(Ord. 95-17.  Passed 9-18-95.)
812.17   RIGHTS RESERVED TO THE GRANTOR.
   (a)   Upon Denial of Renewal Application.  If a renewal of the franchise
held by a grantee is denied and the franchising authority acquires ownership of
the cable system or effects a transfer of ownership of the system to another
person, any such acquisition or transfer shall be at fair market value,
determined on the basis of the cable system valued as a going concern, but with
no value allocated to the franchise itself.
   (b)   Upon Revocation of Franchise.  If the franchise held by a grantee is
revoked for cause and the franchising authority acquires ownership of the cable
system or effects a transfer of ownership of the system to another person, any
such acquisition or transfer shall be at fair market value.
   (c)   Inspection of Records. The City shall have the right, upon  reasonable
notice, to inspect all books, records, reports, maps, plans, financial 
statements and other like materials of a grantee, at any time during normal

subject to the provisions of the franchise, and to make such tests as it shall
find necessary to ensure compliance with the terms of this chapter and other
pertinent provisions of the law.
   (e)   Inspection of Property. Upon reasonable notice, a grantee shall permit
examination, by any duly authorized representative of the City, of system

regulation of said grantee.
   (f)   Removal of Property. Upon denial of a renewal of a franchise, or upon
its revocation or expiration as provided for herein, the City shall have the
right to require a grantee to remove, at its own expense, all portions of the
cable communications system required by public necessity from all streets and
public ways within the City.
(Ord. 95-17.  Passed 9-18-95.)
812.18   NONLIABILITY OF CITY.
   A grantee shall have no recourse whatsoever against the City or its
officials, boards, commissions, agents or employees for any loss, cost, expense
or damage arising out of any lawful conduct relating to any provision or
requirement of the franchise or because of the enforcement of this chapter or
the franchise.
(Ord. 95-17.  Passed 9-18-95.)
812.19   REGULATORY AUTHORITY.
   (a)   The City shall exercise appropriate regulatory authority under the
provisions of this chapter and applicable law. This authority shall be vested
in the City Council and administered through the Municipal Manager or his or
her designee in  order to provide day-to-day administration and enforcement of
the provisions of this chapter and any franchise granted hereunder, and to
carry out the City's responsibilities with regard to cable communications.
   (b)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter to the contrary, a
grantee shall, at all times, comply with all laws and regulations of the local,
State and Federal Government. In the event that any actions of the State or
Federal Government, or any agency thereof, or any court of competent
jurisdiction upon final adjudication, substantially reduce in any way the power
or authority of the City under this chapter or the franchise, or if, in
compliance with any local, State, or Federal law or regulation, a grantee finds
conflict with the terms of this chapter, the franchise or any law or regulation
of the City, then as soon as possible following knowledge thereof, said grantee
shall notify the City of the point of conflict believed to exist between such
law or regulation and the laws or regulations of the City, this chapter and the
franchise. The City, at its option, may notify said grantee that it wishes to
negotiate those provisions which are affected in any way by such modification
in regulations or statutory authority. Thereafter, said grantee shall negotiate
in good faith with the City in the development of alternative provisions which
shall fairly restore the City to the maximum level of authority and power
permitted by law.
   (c)   The City reserves the right to exercise the maximum plenary authority,
as may at any time be lawfully permissible, to regulate the cable
communications system, the franchise and a grantee. Should applicable
legislative, judicial or regulatory authorities at any time permit regulation
not presently permitted to the City, the City may, without the approval of a
grantee, engage in any such additional regulation as may then be permissible,
whether or not contemplated by this chapter or the franchise, on matters
limited to taxes, programming and consumer protection, provided that the City's
regulation is based on demonstrable community needs, and taking into account
the costs of meeting such needs.

services provided by a grantee, the City shall have the right to exercise rate
regulation to the full extent authorized by law, or to refrain from exercising
such regulation for any period of time, at the sole discretion of the City.

(Ord. 95-17.  Passed 9-18-95.)
812.23   DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION.
   (a)   Authority to Construct. Upon the grant of the franchise, and in order
to construct, operate and maintain a cable system in the City, a grantee may
enter into contracts with any public utility companies or any other owner or
lessee of any poles or underground areas located within or without the City;
obtain right-of-way permits from appropriate City, State, County and Federal
officials, necessary to cross or otherwise use highways or roads under their
respective jurisdiction; obtain permission from the Federal Aviation
Administration to erect and maintain antennas; and obtain whatever other
permits a City. County, State or Federal agency may require.
   (b)   Construction and Technical Standards.
      (1)   System design. A grantee's system will at all times during the term
of any franchise granted hereunder, include a residential network with a
capacity for the transmission of a minimum of 550 MHZ of bandwidth.
      (2)   Technical requirements. A grantee shall maintain a system that
meets FCC technical standards. Procedures for testing the technical capacity of
the system shall conform to the technical and testing standards applied to
cable systems by the FCC. The results of any tests required by the FCC shall be
available to the City upon request.
      (3)   Public, educational and governmental access channels. A grantee
shall provide three channels, one each for public, governmental and educational
access. A grantee shall be permitted to use the access channels during periods
when they are not otherwise being used for public, educational or governmental
access programming.
      (4)   Safety.

(Ord. 95-17.  Passed 9-18-95.)
812.24   EXTENSIONS OF SERVICE; CONSTRUCTION COSTS.
   (a)   A grantee shall provide service to all dwelling units and/or
commercial subscribers within thirty days of request and, in any additional
areas annexed to the City, within six months, in accordance with the line
extension standards provided for in subsections (b) through (d) hereof.
   (b)   A grantee shall provide service to any new residential dwelling units
and any additional areas annexed to the City where there are at least twenty-
five residential dwelling and commercial subscriber units per proposed cable
plant mile.
   (c)   In other areas with less than twenty-five residential dwelling units
and/or commercial subscribers per proposed cable plant mile, a grantee shall
offer a cost sharing arrangement with the residents. The cost-sharing
arrangement shall consist of the following:
      (1)   On the request of a potential subscriber desiring service, a
grantee shall prepare, at its cost, an engineering survey and cost analysis to
determine the cost of plan extension required to provide service to the
subscriber from the closest point where available quality signals exist.
      (2)   The cost of construction shall be allocated based on the following
formula: If a request for extension of service into a residential area requires
the construction of cable plant which does not pass at least twenty-five
potential subscribers per strand or trench mile, a grantee and subscribers will
each bear their proportionate share of construction costs. For example, if
there are twelve homes per strand mile or trench mile, a grantee and the
subscriber will share equally (one-half of the construction cost). The
remaining cost will be shared equally by each subscriber. This  line extension
formula shall also be applied to a portion of a mile meeting proportionate
density requirements. After completion of such extension project, should
additional subscribers request cable television service, the pro-rata shares
shall be recalculated. Each new subscriber shall pay the new pro-rata share and
all prior subscribers shall receive pro-rata refunds. At such time as there are
twenty-five potential subscribers per mile, the subscribers shall receive their
pro-rata share of construction costs. In any event, at the end of three years
from the completion of a project, the subscribers are no longer available for
refunds, and the amounts paid in construction costs will be credited to the
plant account of a grantee.
      (3)   The average cost of a line extension shall be recalculated annually
and shall be based upon then-current costs for labor and materials.
   (d)   Any person requesting cable service for any dwelling or business other
than residential property, or those properties specifically referenced herein,
is subject to the current applicable construction costs per outlet, reduced by
the time and materials cost typically allocated for a residential installation.
(Ord. 95-17.  Passed 9-18-95.)
812.25   USE OF STREETS.
   (a)   Underground Installation.  All installations shall be underground in
those areas of the City where public utilities providing both telephone and
electric service are underground at the time of installation. In areas where
either telephone or electric utility facilities are above ground at the time of
installation, a grantee may install its service above ground, provided that, at
such time as those facilities are required to be placed underground by the City
or are placed underground, a grantee shall likewise place its services
underground, with additional cost to the City or to the individual subscriber
so served within the City. Where not otherwise required to be placed
underground by this chapter or the franchise, a grantee's system shall be
located underground at the request of the adjacent property owner, provided
that the excess costs, which are the actual construction and maintenance costs
which are above normal costs for aerial location, are borne by the property
owner making the request. All cable passing under the roadway shall be
installed in conduit.
   (b)   New Construction or Development.  In the case of new construction or
property development, where utilities are to be placed underground, the
developer or property owner shall give a grantee reasonable notice of not less
than thirty days prior to such construction or development, and of the
particular date on which open trenching will be available for a grantee's
installation of conduit, pedestals and/or vaults and laterals to be provided at
the grantee's expense.  The grantee shall also provide specifications as needed
for trenching.
   (c)   Construction Codes and Permits. A grantee shall obtain any required
permits from the City before commencing construction involving the opening or
disturbance of any street or public property. The City shall cooperate with the
grantee and use its best efforts in granting any permits required. A grantee
shall arrange its lines, cables and other appurtenances, on any street or
public property, in such a manner as to cause no unreasonable interference with
the usual and customary use of said street or public property by any person.
   (d)   Interference With Persons, Improvements, Public and Private Property
and Utilities. A grantee's system and facilities, including poles, lines,
equipment and all appurtenances, shall be located, erected and maintained so
that such facilities shall not:
      (1)   Endanger or interfere with the health, safety or lives of persons;
      (2)   Interfere with any improvements the City, County or State may deem
proper to make;
      (3)   Interfere with the free and proper use of public streets, alleys,
bridges, easements or other public ways, places or property, except to the
minimum extent possible during actual construction or repair;
      (4)   Interfere with the rights and reasonable convenience of private
property owners, except to the minimum extent possible during actual
construction or repair; and
      (5)   Obstruct, hinder or interfere with any gas, electric, water or
telephone facilities or other utilities located within the City.
   (e)   Repair of Streets and Public Property. Any and all streets or public
property which is disturbed or damaged during the construction, operation or
maintenance of the system shall be promptly repaired by a grantee, at its
expense and to the condition that existed prior to the disturbance or damage.
   (f)   Trimming of Trees. A grantee may cut or trim trees and vegetation
interfering with National Electrical Safety Code Standards and other clearance
requirements.
   (g)   Movement of Facilities. In the event that it is necessary to
temporarily move or remove any of a grantee's wires, cables, poles or other
facilities placed pursuant to this franchise, in order, lawfully, to move a
large object, vehicle, building or other structure over the streets of the
City, the grantee, upon thirty days prior notice by the City to said grantee,
shall move, at the expense of the person requesting the temporary removal, such
of its facilities as may be required to facilitate such movement.
   (h)   Relocation of Facilities for City. In the event the City requests that
a grantee relocate its facilities, said grantee shall be reimbursed for such
relocation to the extent that other utilities are reimbursed.
   (i)   Easements. All necessary easements over and under private property
shall be arranged for by a grantee or obtained by operation of law.
(Ord. 95-17.  Passed 9-18-95.)
812.26   CABLE TAPPING AND MONITORING WITHOUT PERMISSION OF SUBSCRIBER.
   In order to protect the privacy of subscribers to a grantee's system, said
grantee shall comply with the requirements of 47 U.S.C. 551 and other
applicable State and Federal requirements. A grantee shall not tap and/or
monitor, or arrange for the tapping and/or monitoring of, or permit, either
expressly or impliedly, or allow, any other person to tap and/or monitor, any
cable, line, signal input device or subscriber outlet or receiver, for any
purpose whatsoever, without the express permission of the subscriber.

records shall not include records of individual complaints.
   (d)   Subscriber Services.
      (1)   If any subscriber fails to pay a properly due monthly subscriber
fee, or any other properly due fee or charge, a grantee may disconnect the
subscriber’s service outlet, provided, however, that such disconnection shall
not be done until ten days after the due date of said delinquent fee or charge
or upon delivery to the subscriber of written notice of the intent to
disconnect. After the first disconnection, the grantee, upon payment in full of
the delinquent fee or charge and the payment of a reconnection charge, shall
reinstate the subscriber’s cable service. Reconnection after subsequent
disconnections for nonpayment shall be at the said grantee’s discretion.
      (2)   A grantee shall not deny service, deny access or otherwise
discriminate against subscribers on the basis of race, color, religion,
national origin,  sex or age. A grantee shall adhere to the equal employment
opportunity requirements of the FCC.
      (3)   The City reserves the right to regulate a grantee’s rates as
permitted by Federal law.

(Ord. 95-17.  Passed 9-18-95.)
812.30   SEPARABILITY.
   If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or portion of this
chapter or a franchise is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional by

   (a)   Not sooner than 45 nor later than 60 days after the end of each
calendar quarter, a video service provider shall pay a video service provider
fee to the City. The fee shall be calculated quarterly by determining the
provider's gross revenue for the preceding calendar quarter as described in

specified in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section.
   (b)   Gross revenue shall be computed in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles.

calendar quarter that is collected by the provider for video service from all
its subscribers having service addresses within the City:

means the net revenue received by the video service provider for advertising on
its subscription-based video service within the City. If such revenue is

by multiplying the total net revenue received by the video service provider
under the contract or arrangement by the percentage resulting from dividing the
number of subscribers in the City by the total number of regional or national
subscribers that potentially receive the advertising under the contract or
arrangement.
      (2)   “Gross revenue” shall not include any of the following:
         A.   Any taxes, fees, or assessments that are collected by the video

part of which are written off as bad debt but subsequently collected, less the
expenses of their collection, shall be included in gross revenue in the quarter
collected;
         C.   Late payment charges;
         D.   Maintenance charges;
         E.   Charges for services other than video service, reasonably
identifiable on books or records the video service provider keeps in the
regular course of business or by other reasonable means, that are aggregated or
bundled with amounts billed to video service subscribers, including, but not
limited to, any revenue received by a video service provider or its affiliates
for telecommunications service, information service, or the provision of
directory or internet advertising, including yellow pages, white pages, banner
advertising, and electronic publishing;
         F.   Reimbursement by programmers of marketing costs actually incurred
by the video service provider;

section.
   (c)   (1)   If in a calendar quarter a franchise fee is payable by a
provider under a franchise in effect in the City, the percentage of gross
revenue payable in that calendar quarter by the video service provider to the
City shall be the same percentage of gross revenue payable in that calendar
quarter pursuant to that franchise, not to exceed 5%.
      (2)   Otherwise, the percentage shall be 5% of a video service provider's
gross revenues, as calculated in accordance with this chapter.
   (d)   A video service provider that pays a video service provider fee
pursuant to this section may identify and collect the amount of that fee as a
separate line item on the regular bill of each of its video service subscribers
that has a service address within any portion of the City.
   (e)   (l)   At its sole expense and not more often than once per calendar
year, the City or its designee may conduct an audit for the purpose of
verifying the accuracy of a video service provider's calculation of the video
service provider fees it paid to the City in the audit period. For the purpose
of the audit, the video service provider shall make available for inspections,
at the location where such records are kept in the normal course of business,
those records pertaining to its gross revenue as defined in division (b) of
this section.
      (2)   A video service provider shall pay any amounts found to have been
underpaid in the audit within 30 days after notice and shall include interest
on the underpayments. However, payment need not be made in that 30-day period
if the video service provider brings an action under division (e)(3).
      (3)   An action by the City or by the video service provider to dispute
the amount of video service provider fee due based on the audit results may be
brought in a court of competent jurisdiction not later than two years following

870.01   PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (a)   It is the purpose and intent of this chapter to regulate sexually
oriented businesses, to promote the health, safety, morals and general welfare
of the citizens of the City, and to establish reasonable and uniform

reducing or eliminating the adverse secondary effects from such sexually
oriented businesses.
   (b)   The provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of
imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative
materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the
intent nor effect of this chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to
sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access
by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their
intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this chapter to condone
or legitimize the distribution of obscene or otherwise illegal materials, goods
or activities.
(Ord. 04-45.  Passed 9-7-04.)
870.02   DEFINITIONS.
   The definitions enumerated below may contain references to “nudity” or a
“state of nudity”. Such references should not be construed or interpreted to
permit nudity or a state of nudity in any sexually oriented business in the
City. In fact, this chapter expressly prohibits such. The definitions are
provided for illustrative purpose only. The words defined here shall have these
meanings regardless of whether they are capitalized, in quotation marks, or
otherwise noted as defined terms.  For the purposes of this chapter, certain
terms and words are defined as follows:
   (a)   “Adult arcade” means an establishment where, for any form of
consideration, one or more still or motion picture projectors, slide
projectors, or similar machines, or other image producing machines, or other

specified criminal acts may qualify for a sexually oriented business permit
only when the time period required above has elapsed.
         G.   The location of the proposed sexually oriented business fails to

870.03(b).
      (2)   If the City Manager denies the application, he or she shall
promptly notify the applicant of the denial in writing and state the reasons(s)
for the denial.
      (3)   If a person applies for a permit for a particular location within a
period of 12 months from the date of denial of a previous application for a
permit at the same location, and there has not been an intervening change in
the circumstances which could reasonably be expected to lead to a different
decision regarding the former reasons for denial, the application shall be
denied.

   (b)   (1)   A taxpayer shall make the initial election on or before the

of its termination of the election.
         B.   A notification of termination shall be made, on a form prescribed

      (2)   Adopt such rules as the Tax Commissioner finds necessary to carry
out those sections;
      (3)   Appoint and employ such personnel as are necessary to carry out the
duties imposed upon the Tax Commissioner by those sections.
   (d)   The Tax Commissioner shall not be considered a tax administrator, as
that term is defined in R.C. § 718.01 and Article III of the City of New
Carlisle Income Tax Rules and Regulations issued under the authority of Chapter
881 of the New Carlisle Codified Ordinances approved by City Council effective
for tax years beginning January 1, 2016.
(Ord. 18-09.  Passed 5-21-18.)
881.17.2   DEFINITIONS.
   If a term used in Sections 881.17.1 to 881.17.16 of the Codified Ordinances
that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a comparable context
in both the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax and in
R.C. Title LVII and the use is not consistent, then the use of the term in the
laws of the United States relating to federal income tax shall have control
over the use of the term in R.C. Title LVII, unless the term is defined in R.C.
Chapter 5703, in which case the definition in that chapter shall control. Any
reference in this chapter to the Internal Revenue Code includes other laws of
the United States related to federal income taxes. If a term is defined in both
this section and Article III of the City of New Carlisle Income Tax Rules and
Regulations issued under the authority of Chapter 881 of the New Carlisle
Codified Ordinances approved by City Council effective for tax years beginning
January 1, 2016, the definition in this section shall control for all uses of
that term in Sections 881.17.1 to 881.17.16 of the Codified Ordinances. As used
in Sections 881.17.1 to 881.17.16 of the Codified Ordinances only:
   (a)   “Municipal taxable income” means income apportioned or sitused to the
municipal corporation as applicable, reduced by any pre-2017 net operating loss
carryforward available to the person for the municipal corporation.
   (b)   “Adjusted federal taxable income,” for a person required to file as a
C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation
as described in division R.C. § 718.01(D)(5), means a C corporation’s federal
taxable income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined
under the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
      (1)   Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal taxable
income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the intangible
income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
      (2)   Add an amount equal to 5% of intangible income deducted under
division (b)(1) of this section, but excluding that portion of intangible
income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property
described in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal
taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other
disposition of an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code.
      (4)   A.   Except as provided in division (b)(4)B. of this section,
deduct income and gain included in federal taxable income to the extent the
income and gain directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of
an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code.
         B.   Division (b)(4)A. of this section does not apply to the extent
the income or gain is income or gain described in section 1245 or 1250 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (5)   Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction in
the computation of federal taxable income.
      (6)   In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated
investment company, add all amounts with respect to dividends to, distributions
to, or amounts set aside for or credited to the benefit of investors and
allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal taxable income.
      (7)   Deduct, to the extent not otherwise deducted or excluded in
computing federal taxable income, any income derived from a transfer agreement
or from the enterprise transferred under that agreement under R.C. § 4313.02.
      (8)   Deduct exempt income to the extent not otherwise deducted or
excluded in computing adjusted federal taxable income.
      (9)   Deduct any net profit of a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer’s federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that net profit in
the group’s federal taxable income in accordance with Section 881.17.7(e)(3)B.
of the Codified Ordinances.
      (10)   Add any loss incurred by a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer’s federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that loss in the
group’s federal taxable income in accordance with Section 881.17.7(e)(3)B. of
the Codified Ordinances.
      If the taxpayer is not a C corporation, is not a disregarded entity, and
is not a publicly traded partnership, the taxpayer shall compute adjusted
federal taxable income under this section as if the taxpayer were a C
corporation, except guaranteed payments and other similar amounts paid or
accrued to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member,
or former member shall not be allowed as a deductible expense unless such
payments are in consideration for the use of capital and treated as payment of
interest under section 469 of the Internal Revenue Code or United States
treasury regulations. Amounts paid or accrued to a qualified self-employed
retirement plan with respect to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former
shareholder, member, or former member of the taxpayer, amounts paid or accrued
to or for health insurance for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former
shareholder, member, or former member, and amounts paid or accrued to or for
life insurance for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder,
member, or former member shall not be allowed as a deduction.
      Nothing in division (b) of this section shall be construed as allowing
the taxpayer to add or deduct any amount more than once or shall be construed
as allowing any taxpayer to deduct any amount paid to or accrued for purposes
of federal self-employment tax.
   (c)   “Taxpayer” has the same meaning as in Article III of the City of New
Carlisle Income Tax Rules and Regulations issued under the authority of Chapter
881 of the New Carlisle Codified Ordinances approved by City Council effective
for tax years beginning January 1, 2016, except that “taxpayer” does not
include natural persons or entities subject to the tax imposed under R.C.
Chapter 5745. “Taxpayer” may include receivers, assignees, or trustees in
bankruptcy when such persons are required to assume the role of a taxpayer.
   (d)   “Tax return” or “return” means the notifications and reports required
to be filed pursuant to Sections 881.17.1 to 881.17.16 of the Codified
Ordinances for the purpose of reporting municipal income taxes, and includes
declarations of estimated tax.
   (e)   “Taxable year” means the calendar year or the taxpayer’s fiscal year
ending during the calendar year, or fractional part thereof, upon which the
calculation of the taxpayer’s adjusted federal taxable income is based pursuant
to this chapter. If a taxpayer’s taxable year is changed for federal income tax
purposes, the taxable year for purposes of Sections 881.17.1 to 881.17.16 of
the Codified Ordinances is changed accordingly but may consist of an
aggregation of more than one taxable year for federal income tax purposes. The
Tax Commissioner may prescribe by rule an appropriate period as the taxable
year for a taxpayer that has had a change of its taxable year for federal
income tax purposes, for a taxpayer that has two or more short taxable years
for federal income tax purposes as the result of a change of ownership, or for
a new taxpayer that would otherwise have no taxable year.
   (f)   “Assessment” means a notice of underpayment or nonpayment of a tax
issued pursuant to Section 881.17.11 of the Codified Ordinances.
(Ord. 18-09.  Passed 5-21-18.)
881.17.3   APPLICABILITY; TAXABLE SITUS; APPORTIONMENT.
   This section applies to any taxpayer that is engaged in a business or
profession in the City of New Carlisle and that has made the election under
Section 881.17.1 of the Codified Ordinances.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in division (b) of this section, net
profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of the City of New Carlisle shall be considered as having a taxable
situs in the City of New Carlisle for purposes of municipal income taxation in
the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the City of New Carlisle during the taxable period to the average original
cost of all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the
taxpayer in the business or profession during the same period, wherever
situated.
      As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property
shall include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the City of New Carlisle to wages, salaries, and other
compensation paid during the same period to individuals employed in the
business or profession, wherever the individual’s services are performed,
excluding compensation from which taxes are not required to be withheld under
Sections 718.011 and 718.01 of the Ohio Revised Code;
      (3)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the City of
New Carlisle to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (b)   (1)   If the apportionment factors described in division (a) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer’s business activity in
the City of New Carlisle, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Commissioner may
require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion of the
income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving one or
more of the following:
         A.   Separate accounting;
         B.   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         C.   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
         D.   A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Commissioner denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of section
881.17.11 of the Codified Ordinances.
      (3)   The Tax Commissioner may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (b)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by Section
881.17.11(a) of the Codified Ordinances.
   (c)   As used in division (a)(2) of this section, “wages, salaries, and
other compensation” includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)   A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         A.   The employer;
         B.   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         C.   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (c)(1)B. of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee’s presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Commissioner determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (c)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer’s municipal income tax liability. If
the Tax Commissioner makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Commissioner’s determination was unreasonable.
   (d)   For the purposes of division (a)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to the City of
New Carlisle as follows:
      (1)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be
sitused to the City of New Carlisle only if, regardless of where title passes,
the property meets either of the following criteria:
         A.   The property is shipped to or delivered within the City of New
Carlisle from a stock of goods located within the City of New Carlisle.
         B.   The property is delivered within the City of New Carlisle from a
location outside the City of New Carlisle, provided the taxpayer is regularly
engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales
within the City of New Carlisle and the sales result from such solicitation or
promotion.
      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
City of New Carlisle to the extent that such services are performed in the City
of New Carlisle.
      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the City of New Carlisle shall be sitused to the City
of New Carlisle.
      (4)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the City of New Carlisle shall be
sitused to the City of New Carlisle.
      (5)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the City of New Carlisle based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the City of New Carlisle.
   (e)   Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the
sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the City of New
Carlisle in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real
estate agent or broker shall be allocated to the City of New Carlisle based
upon the ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate located in the City of New Carlisle to the
commissions received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate
everywhere in the taxable year.
   (f)   If, in computing a taxpayer’s adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee’s
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under R.C. § 718.01, the taxpayer shall add the amount that is exempt
from taxation to the taxpayer’s net profit that was apportioned to the City of
New Carlisle. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to its net profit
that was apportioned to the City of New Carlisle any amount other than the
amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were the amount
related to the stock option not exempted from taxation.
   This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer’s net profit that was apportioned to the City of New
Carlisle under this section.
   (g)   When calculating the ratios described in division (a) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (b) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner’s ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.
(Ord. 18-09.  Passed 5-21-18.)
881.17.4   INFORMATION PROVIDED TO TAX ADMINISTRATORS; CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (a)   Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by Sections 881.17.1 to

disclose such information, except for official purposes, in accordance with a
proper judicial order, or as provided in R.C. § 4123.271 or R.C. § 5703.21. The

every taxpayer that filed tax returns with the commissioner under Sections

City of New Carlisle a report stating the name and federal identification
number of every taxpayer that made estimated payments that are attributable to
the City of New Carlisle and the amount of each such taxpayer’s estimated
payment.
   (d)   The information described under divisions (b) and (c) of this section
shall be provided to the individual or individuals designated by the City of
New Carlisle Tax Administrator under R.C. § 718.83(D).
   (e)   (1)   The City of New Carlisle expects that the Tax Commissioner will,
pursuant to R.C. § 718.84(E), provide tax returns and other information it
receives in the performance of its administration of the municipal net profits
tax for taxpayers making the election provided in Section 881.17.1 of the
Codified Ordinances. The Tax Administrator shall review these returns and
information, as well as the information received pursuant to divisions (b) and
(c) of this section, and has discretion to refer any taxpayer for audit by the
Tax Commissioner. Such referral shall be made on a form prescribed by the
Commissioner and shall include any information that forms the basis for the
referral.
      (2)   If the Tax Commissioner declines to audit a taxpayer referred by
the Tax Administrator under this section, the City of New Carlisle reserves its
right to pursue any and all remedies, whether at law or in equity, to ensure
that the correct tax liability has been calculated and paid by the taxpayer.
(Ord. 18-09.  Passed 5-21-18.)
881.17.5   FILING OF ANNUAL RETURN; REMITTANCE; DISPOSITION OF FUNDS.
   (a)   (1)   For each taxable year, every taxpayer shall file an annual
return. Such return, along with the amount of tax shown to be due on the return
less the amount paid for the taxable year under Section 881.17.9 of the
Codified Ordinances, shall be submitted to the Tax Commissioner, on a form and
in the manner prescribed by the Commissioner, on or before the fifteenth day of
the fourth month following the end of the taxpayer’s taxable year.
      (2)   If a taxpayer has multiple taxable years ending within one calendar
year, the taxpayer shall aggregate the facts and figures necessary to compute
the tax due under this chapter, in accordance with Sections 881.17.2, 881.17.3,
and, if applicable, 881.17.7 of the Codified Ordinances onto its annual return.
      (3)   The remittance shall be made payable to the Treasurer of State and

      (2)   A.   The Tax Commissioner may require a taxpayer to include, with
each annual tax return, amended return, or request for refund filed with the
Commissioner under Sections 881.17.1 to 881.17.16 of the Codified Ordinances,
copies of any relevant documents or other information.
         B.   A taxpayer that files an annual tax return electronically through
the Ohio business gateway or in another manner as prescribed by the Tax
Commissioner shall either submit the documents required under this division
electronically as prescribed at the time of filing or, if electronic submission
is not available, mail the documents to the Tax Commissioner. The Department of
Taxation shall publish a method of electronically submitting the documents
required under this division on or before January 1, 2019.
      (3)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Commissioner may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required to determine and verify the taxpayer’s municipal income tax.
   (c)   (1)   A.   Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic extension
for filing the taxpayer’s federal income tax return shall automatically receive
an extension for the filing of a tax return with the Commissioner under this
section. The extended due date of the return shall be the fifteenth day of the
tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates.
         B.   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer’s federal income tax return may request that
the Commissioner grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for
filing the taxpayer’s municipal income tax return. If the Commissioner receives
the request on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due, the
Commissioner shall grant the taxpayer’s extension request.
         C.   An extension of time to file under division (c)(1) of this
section is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax
Commissioner grants an extension of that date.
      (2)   If the Commissioner considers it necessary in order to ensure
payment of a tax imposed in accordance with Sections 881.01 and 881.02 of the
Codified Ordinances, the Commissioner may require taxpayers to file returns and
make payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers
not otherwise required to file annual returns.
   (d)   Each return required to be filed in accordance with this section shall
include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize another person,
including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to communicate with
the Tax Commissioner about matters pertaining to the return. The return or
instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by checking the box
the taxpayer authorizes the Commissioner to contact the preparer or other
person concerning questions that arise during the examination or other review
of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only to provide the
Commissioner with information that is missing from the return, to contact the
Commissioner for information about the examination or other review of the
return or the status of the taxpayer’s refund or payments, and to respond to
notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or return preparation that the
taxpayer has received from the Commissioner and has shown to the preparer or
other person.
   (e)   When income tax returns or other documents require the signature of a
tax return preparer, the Tax Commissioner shall accept a facsimile or
electronic version of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
(Ord. 18-09.  Passed 5-21-18.)
881.17.6   ELECTRONIC FILING.
   (a)   All taxpayers that have made the election allowed under Section
881.17.1 of the Codified Ordinances shall file any tax return or extension for
filing a tax return, and shall make payment of amounts shown to be due on such
returns, electronically, either through the Ohio business gateway or in another
manner as prescribed by the Tax Commissioner.
   (b)   A taxpayer may apply to the Commissioner, on a form prescribed by the
Commissioner, to be excused from the requirement to file returns and make
payments electronically. For good cause shown, the Commissioner may excuse the
applicant from the requirement and permit the applicant to file the returns or
make the payments by nonelectronic means.
   (c)   The Tax Commissioner may adopt rules establishing the following:
      (1)   The format of documents to be used by taxpayers to file returns and
make payments by electronic means;
      (2)   The information taxpayers must submit when filing tax returns by
electronic means.
         (Ord. 18-09.  Passed 5-21-18.)
881.17.7   CONSOLIDATED RETURNS.
   (a)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Affiliated group of corporations” means an affiliated group as
defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)   “Consolidated federal income tax return” means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   “Consolidated federal taxable income” means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. “Consolidated
federal taxable income” does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (a)
(1) of this section.
      (4)   “Incumbent local exchange carrier” has the same meaning as in R.C.
§ 4927.01.
      (5)   “Local exchange telephone service” has the same meaning as in R.C.
§ 5727.01.
   (b)   (1)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of
corporations may elect to file a consolidated tax return for a taxable year if
at least one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to
municipal income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of
corporations filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to
that taxable year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning
with the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the
reporting method is required under federal law. The election continues to be
binding for each subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to
discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under division (b)(2) of this
section or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Commissioner. The Tax
Commissioner shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under
this section must be made on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of
the year following the last year of a five-year consolidated tax return
election period in effect under division (b)(1) of this section. The election
to discontinue filing a consolidated tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)   When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under Section 881.17.1
of the Codified Ordinances, a valid election made by the taxpayer under R.C. §
718.06(B)(1) or (B)(2) is binding upon the Tax Commissioner for the remainder
of the five-year period.
      (5)   When an election made under Section 881.17.1 of the Codified
Ordinances is terminated, a valid election made under this section is binding
upon the Tax Administrator for the remainder of the five-year period.
   (c)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated tax return for that taxable year if the Tax Commissioner
determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany transactions
have not been conducted at arm’s length and that there has been a distortive
shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net profits to a
municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated tax
return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated tax return for all
subsequent taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written
permission from the Commissioner to file a separate return or a taxpayer has
experienced a change in circumstances.
   (d)   A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated tax return in the same manner
as is required under the United States department of treasury regulations that
prescribe procedures for the preparation of the consolidated federal income tax
return required to be filed by the common parent of the affiliated group of
which the taxpayer is a member.
   (e)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (e)(2), (e)(3), and
(e)(4) of this section, corporations that file a consolidated tax return shall
compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section 881.17.2 of the
Codified Ordinances, by substituting “consolidated federal taxable income” for
“federal taxable income” wherever “federal taxable income” appears in that
division and by substituting “an affiliated group of corporation’s” for “a C
corporation’s” wherever “a C corporation’s” appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall make any
adjustment otherwise required under Section 881.17.2(b) of the Codified
Ordinances to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise subject
to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the computation of
consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly or
indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group’s consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year, the
corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall do one of the following with
respect to that pass-through entity’s net profit or loss for that taxable year:
         A.   Exclude the pass-through entity’s net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section 881.17.3 of the Codified
Ordinances, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-
through entity in the computation of the affiliated group’s net profit sitused
to a municipal corporation. If the entity’s net profit or loss is so excluded,
the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of
the entity’s net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         B.   Include the pass-through entity’s net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section 881.17.3 of the Codified
Ordinances, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-
through entity in the computation of the affiliated group’s net profit sitused
to a municipal corporation. If the entity’s net profit or loss is so included,
the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis
of the entity’s net profits that are included in the consolidated federal
taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly or
indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group’s consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year, all
of the following shall apply:
         A.   The corporation filing the consolidated tax return shall exclude
the pass-through entity’s net profit or loss from the consolidated federal
taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the purposes of making the
computations required in Section 881.17.3 of the Codified Ordinances, exclude
the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through entity in the
computation of the affiliated group’s net profit sitused to a municipal
corporation;
         B.   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with Sections 881.17.1 to
881.17.16 of the Codified Ordinances on the basis of the entity’s net profits
that would otherwise be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of
the affiliated group.
   (f)   Corporations filing a consolidated tax return shall make the
computations required under Section 881.17.3 of the Codified Ordinances by
substituting “consolidated federal taxable income attributable to” for “net
profit from” wherever “net profit from” appears in that section and by
substituting “affiliated group of corporations” for “taxpayer” wherever
“taxpayer” appears in that section.
   (g)   Each corporation filing a consolidated tax return is jointly and
severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges, or other
amounts applicable under Sections 881.17.1 to 881.17.16 of the Codified
Ordinances or R.C. Chapter 5703 to the corporation, an affiliated group of
which the corporation is a member for any portion of the taxable year, or any
one or more members of such an affiliated group.
(Ord. 18-09.  Passed 5-21-18.)
881.17.8   FAILURE TO PAY TAX.
   If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under Section 881.17.1 of
the Codified Ordinances fails to pay any tax as required under Sections
881.17.1 to 881.17.16 of the Codified Ordinances, or any portion of that tax,
on or before the date prescribed for its payment, interest shall be assessed,
collected, and paid, in the same manner as the tax, upon such unpaid amount at
the rate per annum prescribed by R.C. § 5703.47 from the date prescribed for
its payment until it is paid or until the date an assessment is issued under
Section 881.17.11 of the Codified Ordinances, whichever occurs first.
(Ord. 18-09.  Passed 5-21-18.)
881.17.9   DECLARATION OF ESTIMATED TAXES.
   (a)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Combined tax liability” means the total amount of a taxpayer’s
income tax liabilities to all municipal corporations in this state for a
taxable year.
      (2)   “Estimated taxes” means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer’s combined tax liability for the current taxable
year.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in division (b)(4) of this section, every
taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for the current taxable
year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Commissioner, if the amount payable as
estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars ($200.00).
      (2)   Except as provided in division (b)(4) of this section, a taxpayer
having a taxable year of less than twelve months shall make a declaration under
rules prescribed by the Commissioner.
      (3)   The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of the taxable year or on
or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the taxpayer becomes
subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)   The Tax Commissioner may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.
   (c)   Each taxpayer shall file the declaration of estimated taxes with, and
remit estimated taxes to, the Tax Commissioner at the times and in the amounts
prescribed in division (c)(1) of this section. Remitted taxes shall be made
payable to the Treasurer of State.
      (1)   The required portion of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year that shall be paid through estimated taxes shall be as follows:
         A.   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, 22.5% of the combined tax liability for the
taxable year;
         B.   On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, 45% of the combined tax liability for the
taxable year;
         C.   On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, 67.5% of the combined tax liability for the
taxable year;
         D.   On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the
taxable year, 90% of the combined tax liability for the taxable year.
      (2)   If the taxpayer determines that its declaration of estimated taxes
will not accurately reflect the taxpayer’s tax liability for the taxable year,
the taxpayer shall increase or decrease, as appropriate, its subsequent
payments in equal installments to result in a more accurate payment of
estimated taxes.
      (3)   A.   Each taxpayer shall report on the declaration of estimated
taxes the portion of the remittance that the taxpayer estimates that it owes to
each municipal corporation for the taxable year.
         B.   Upon receiving a payment of estimated taxes under this section,
the Commissioner shall immediately forward the payment to the Treasurer of
State. The Treasurer shall credit the payment in the same manner as in R.C. §
718.85(B).
   (d)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of estimated taxes, there shall
be added to the taxes an amount determined at the rate per annum prescribed by 
R.C. § 5703.47 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment,
unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (e)
of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         A.   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, 22.5% of the
combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment;
         B.   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, 45% of the
combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment;
         C.   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, 67.5% of the
combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment;
         D.   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, 90% of the
combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently due.
      (3)   All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as
taxes collected under Sections 881.17.1 to 881.17.16 of the Codified Ordinances
and shall be credited and distributed to municipal corporations in accordance
with R.C. § 718.83.
   (e)   An underpayment of any portion of a combined tax liability shall be
due to reasonable cause and the penalty imposed by this section shall not be
added to the taxes for the taxable year if any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 90% of
the combined tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by
annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 100%
of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for the preceding
taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable year reflected a
period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a municipal income tax return
for that year.
(Ord. 18-09.  Passed 5-21-18.)
881.17.10   ADDITIONAL PENALTIES.
   (a)   In addition to any other penalty imposed by Sections 881.17.1 to
881.17.16 of the Codified Ordinances or R.C. Chapter 5703, the following
penalties shall apply:
      (1)   If a taxpayer required to file a tax return under Sections 881.17.1
to 881.17.16 of the Codified Ordinances fails to make and file the return
within the time prescribed, including any extensions of time granted by the Tax
Commissioner, the Commissioner may impose a penalty not exceeding twenty-five
dollars ($25.00) per month or fraction of a month, for each month or fraction
of a month elapsing between the due date, including extensions of the due date,
and the date on which the return is filed. The aggregate penalty, per instance,
under this division shall not exceed one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00).
      (2)   If a person required to file a tax return electronically under
Sections 881.17.1 to 881.17.16 of the Codified Ordinances fails to do so, the
Commissioner may impose a penalty not to exceed the following:
         A.   For each of the first two failures, 5% of the amount required to
be reported on the return;
         B.   For the third and any subsequent failure, 10% of the amount
required to be reported on the return.
      (3)   If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under Section
881.17.1 of the Codified Ordinances fails to timely pay an amount of tax
required to be paid under this chapter, the Commissioner may impose a penalty
equal to 15% of the amount not timely paid.
      (4)   If a taxpayer files what purports to be a tax return required by
Sections 881.17.1 to 881.17.16 of the Codified Ordinances that does not contain
information upon which the substantial correctness of the return may be judged
or contains information that on its face indicates that the return is
substantially incorrect, and the filing of the return in that manner is due to
a position that is frivolous or a desire that is apparent from the return to
delay or impede the administration of Sections 881.17.1 to 881.17.16 of the
Codified Ordinances, a penalty of up to five hundred dollars ($500.00) may be
imposed.
      (5)   If a taxpayer makes a fraudulent attempt to evade the reporting or
payment of the tax required to be shown on any return required under Sections
881.17.1 to 881.17.16 of the Codified Ordinances a penalty may be imposed not
exceeding the greater of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or 100% of the tax
required to be shown on the return.
      (6)   If any person makes a false or fraudulent claim for a refund under
Section 881.17.12 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty may be imposed not
exceeding the greater of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or 100% of the claim.
Any penalty imposed under this division, any refund issued on the claim, and
interest on any refund from the date of the refund, may be assessed under
Section 881.17.11 of the Codified Ordinances without regard to any time
limitation for the assessment imposed by division (a) of that section.
   (b)   For purposes of this section, the tax required to be shown on a tax
return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax paid on or before
the date, including any extensions of the date, prescribed for filing the
return.
   (c)   Each penalty imposed under this section shall be in addition to any
other penalty imposed under this section. All or part of any penalty imposed
under this section may be abated by the Tax Commissioner. The Commissioner may
adopt rules governing the imposition and abatement of such penalties.
   (d)   All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as taxes
collected under Sections 881.17.1 to 881.17.16 of the Codified Ordinances and
shall be credited and distributed to municipal corporations in the same
proportion as the underlying tax liability is required to be distributed to
such municipal corporations under R.C. § 718.83.
(Ord. 18-09.  Passed 5-21-18.)
881.17.11   ASSESSMENTS AGAINST TAXPAYER.
   (a)   If any taxpayer required to file a return under Sections 881.17.1 to
881.17.16 of the Codified Ordinances fails to file the return within the time
prescribed, files an incorrect return, or fails to remit the full amount of the
tax due for the period covered by the return, the Tax Commissioner may make an
assessment against the taxpayer for any deficiency for the period for which the
return or tax is due, based upon any information in the Commissioner’s
possession.
The Tax Commissioner shall not make or issue an assessment against a taxpayer
more than three years after the later of the date the return subject to
assessment was required to be filed or the date the return was filed. Such time
limit may be extended if both the taxpayer and the commissioner consent in
writing to the extension. Any such extension shall extend the three-year time
limit in Section 881.17.12 of the Codified Ordinances for the same period of
time. There shall be no bar or limit to an assessment against a taxpayer that
fails to file a return subject to assessment as required by Sections 881.17.1
to 881.17.16 of the Codified Ordinances, or that files a fraudulent return. The
Commissioner shall give the taxpayer assessed written notice of the assessment
as provided in R.C. § 5703.37. With the notice, the Commissioner shall provide
instructions on how to petition for reassessment and request a hearing on the
petition.
   (b)   Unless the taxpayer assessed files with the Tax Commissioner within
sixty days after service of the notice of assessment, either personally or by
certified mail, a written petition for reassessment signed by the authorized
agent of the taxpayer assessed having knowledge of the facts, the assessment
becomes final, and the amount of the assessment is due and payable from the
taxpayer to the Treasurer of State. The petition shall indicate the taxpayer’s
objections, but additional objections may be raised in writing if received by
the Commissioner prior to the date shown on the final determination. If the
petition has been properly filed, the Commissioner shall proceed under R.C. §
5703.60.
   (c)   After an assessment becomes final, if any portion of the assessment
remains unpaid, including accrued interest, a certified copy of the Tax
Commissioner’s entry making the assessment final may be filed in the office of
the Clerk of the Court of Common Pleas in the county in which the taxpayer has
an office or place of business in this state, the county in which the
taxpayer’s statutory agent is located, or Franklin County.
Immediately upon the filing of the entry, the Clerk shall enter a judgment
against the taxpayer assessed in the amount shown on the entry. The judgment
may be filed by the Clerk in a loose-leaf book entitled “special judgments for
municipal income taxes,” and shall have the same effect as other judgments.
Execution shall issue upon the judgment upon the request of the Tax
Commissioner, and all laws applicable to sales on execution shall apply to
sales made under the judgment.
If the assessment is not paid in its entirety within sixty days after the day
the assessment was issued, the portion of the assessment consisting of tax due
shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by R.C. § 5703.47 from the
day the commissioner issues the assessment until the assessment is paid or
until it is certified to the Attorney General for collection under R.C. §
131.02, whichever comes first. If the unpaid portion of the assessment is
certified to the Attorney General for collection, the entire unpaid portion of
the assessment shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by R.C. §
5703.47 from the date of certification until the date it is paid in its
entirety. Interest shall be paid in the same manner as the tax and may be
collected by issuing an assessment under this section.
   (d)   All money collected under this section shall be credited to the
municipal income tax fund and distributed to the municipal corporation to which
the money is owed based on the assessment issued under this section.
   (e)   If the Tax Commissioner believes that collection of the tax will be
jeopardized unless proceedings to collect or secure collection of the tax are
instituted without delay, the Commissioner may issue a jeopardy assessment
against the taxpayer liable for the tax. Immediately upon the issuance of the
jeopardy assessment, the Commissioner shall file an entry with the Clerk of the
Court of Common Pleas in the manner prescribed by division (c) of this section.
Notice of the jeopardy assessment shall be served on the taxpayer assessed or
the taxpayer’s legal representative in the manner provided in R.C. § 5703.37
within five days of the filing of the entry with the Clerk. The total amount
assessed is immediately due and payable, unless the taxpayer assessed files a
petition for reassessment in accordance with division (b) of this section and
provides security in a form satisfactory to the Commissioner and in an amount
sufficient to satisfy the unpaid balance of the assessment. Full or partial
payment of the assessment does not prejudice the Commissioner’s consideration
of the petition for reassessment.
   (f)   Notwithstanding the fact that a petition for reassessment is pending,
the taxpayer may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the petition. The acceptance of a payment by the Treasurer of State does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the petition.
If upon final determination of the petition an error in the assessment is
corrected by the Tax Commissioner, upon petition so filed or pursuant to a
decision of the Board of Tax Appeals or any court to which the determination or
decision has been appealed, so that the amount due from the taxpayer under the
corrected assessment is less than the portion paid, there shall be issued to
the taxpayer, its assigns, or legal representative a refund in the amount of
the overpayment as provided by Section 881.17.12 of the Codified Ordinances,
with interest on that amount as provided by that section.
(Ord. 18-09.  Passed 5-21-18.)
881.17.12   REFUND APPLICATIONS.
   (a)   An application to refund to a taxpayer the amount of taxes paid on any
illegal, erroneous, or excessive payment of tax under Sections 881.17.1 to
881.17.16 of the Codified Ordinances, including assessments, shall be filed
with the Tax Commissioner within three years after the date of the illegal,
erroneous, or excessive payment of the tax, or within any additional period
allowed by Section 881.17.11(a) of the Codified Ordinances. The application
shall be filed in the form prescribed by the Tax Commissioner.
   (b)   (1)   On the filing of a refund application, the tax commissioner
shall determine the amount of refund to which the applicant is entitled. The
amount determined shall be based on the amount overpaid per return or
assessment. If the amount is greater than ten dollars ($10.00) and not less
than that claimed, the Commissioner shall certify that amount to the Director
of Budget and Management and the Treasurer of State for payment from the tax
refund fund created in R.C. § 5703.052. If the amount is greater than ten
dollars ($10.00) but less than that claimed, the Commissioner shall proceed in
accordance with R.C. § 5703.70.
      (2)   Upon issuance of a refund under this section, the Commissioner
shall notify each municipal corporation of the amount refunded to the taxpayer
attributable to that municipal corporation, which shall be deducted from the
municipal corporation’s next distribution under R.C. § 718.83.
   (c)   Any portion of a refund determined under division (b) of this section
that is not issued within ninety days after such determination shall bear
interest at the rate per annum prescribed by R.C. § 5703.47 from the ninety-
first day after such determination until the day the refund is paid or
credited. On an illegal or erroneous assessment, interest shall be paid at that
rate from the date of payment on the illegal or erroneous assessment until the
day the refund is paid or credited.
(Ord. 18-09.  Passed 5-21-18.)
881.17.13   AMENDED RETURNS.
   (a)   If any of the facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in
an annual return filed by a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under
Section 881.17.1 of the Codified Ordinances and used to determine the tax due
under Sections 881.17.1 to 881.17.16 of the Codified Ordinances must be altered
as the result of an adjustment to the taxpayer’s federal income tax return,
whether initiated by the taxpayer or the Internal Revenue Service, and such
alteration affects the taxpayer’s tax liability under those sections, the
taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax Commissioner in such form as
the Commissioner requires. The amended return shall be filed not later than
sixty days after the adjustment is agreed upon or finally determined for
federal income tax purposes or after any federal income tax deficiency or
refund, or the abatement or credit resulting therefrom, has been assessed or
paid, whichever occurs first. If a taxpayer intends to file an amended
consolidated municipal income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a
separate return to a consolidated return, based on the taxpayer’s consolidated
federal income tax return, the taxpayer shall notify the Commissioner before
filing the amended return.
   (b)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. An amended return required by this section is a
return subject to assessment under Section 881.17.11 of the Codified Ordinances
for the purpose of assessing any additional tax due under this section,
together with any applicable penalty and interest. The amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return no longer subject to assessment that are not affected, either
directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer’s federal tax return.
   (c)   In the case of an overpayment, an application for refund may be filed
under this division within the sixty-day period prescribed for filing the
amended return, even if that period extends beyond the period prescribed in
Section 881.17.12 of the Codified Ordinances, if the application otherwise
conforms to the requirements of that section. An application filed under this
division shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only
those facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer’s
annual return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer’s federal income tax return unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in Section 881.17.12 of the Codified Ordinances. The
application shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments
that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer’s federal income tax return.

ARTICLE V
DIRECT ACCOUNTS - THOSE FILING UNDER A SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER
A.   Direct accounts for individuals and small businesses (if filing under a
Social Security Number)
   1.   Identification and filing of individual returns and small businesses
(if filing under a Social Security Number):
      (a)   Resident individuals:  All resident individuals shall, as they
establish residency within the City of New Carlisle, complete an Individual
Income Tax Registration form in its entirety, for the purpose of determining
their tax liability, and the tax liability of persons residing within the
household. An Individual Income Tax Registration form can be obtained from the
New Carlisle Income Tax Division or from our website and shall be completed and
returned to that office within fifteen (15) days of occupancy within the City. 
All resident individuals, regardless of the length of their residency within
the City, shall complete registrations upon the request of the Income Tax
Division and return form within fifteen (15) days.  Should the resident fail to
return the completed registration within the specified time, a second notice
will be sent.  If no response is received to the second notice, an account will
be activated and all residents known to reside at that address will be required
to file a City Income Tax Return, whether or not a direct liability to the City
exists.
      (b)   Business entities:  It is the duty of each business entity doing
business within or for the City to identify their business with the Income Tax
Division within fifteen (15) days of establishing their business, through the
completion of a Business Income Tax Registration form. It is also the duty of
each business to identify subcontractors working for their businesses and to
submit Form 1099-MISC to the Income Tax Division for said contractors on or
before the last day of February of each year. 
      (c)   Having rental property within the City is considered doing business
within the City.
      (d)   It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to inform the Income
Tax Division, in writing, of any change of the taxpayer's address within
fifteen (15) days of such change. The taxpayer may request that an account be
inactivated by completing the Request to Close an Individual Account Affidavit
form available on the Income Tax Division webpage or at the Income Tax Office.
   2.   Date and Requirement for Filing Direct Returns:
      (a)   On or before the date prescribed by ORC 718, every person and
business entity subject to the City's income tax shall, except as provided in
the exceptions below, make and file with the Income Tax Division an annual
return on the form provided by the City or a generic City income tax form
whether or not tax is due. This process is also known as mandatory filing.
      (b)   If the tax return is made for a fiscal year or any period less than
a year, the return shall be made by the 15th day of the fourth month following
the end of such fiscal year or other period.
      (c)   Spouses shall not be denied the ability to file a joint return.
      (d)   The fact that any taxpayer is not required to file a Federal tax
return does not relieve them of the responsibility for filing a City tax
return.
      (e)   Residents who are retired with no City taxable earned income, no
businesses or any type of self-employment (including rental properties) and no
gambling winnings are not required to file an annual City Income Tax Return.
The resident must notify the Income Tax Division in writing of their change in
status.  On a joint tax return, both spouses must be retired to be eligible for
both individuals to stop filing an annual return.  The requirement to file is
waived until the next tax year that the resident has City taxable earned
income, a business (including rental properties) and/or gambling winnings.
      (f)   A service member or their spouse does not lose or acquire a
residence or domicile for purposes of taxation by reason of being absent or
present in any tax jurisdiction of the United States solely for military
service or to be with their spouse service member in compliance with the
service member's military orders if the residence or domicile is the same for
the service member and their spouse. Active duty service members and their
spouses residing together within the City only to comply with active duty
military orders and who have continued to maintain a residence or domicile
outside the City, are not required to file a City Income Tax Return if the
appropriate State of Ohio form proving non-residence is submitted to the Income
Tax Division annually on or before tax return due date for calendar filers. An
exception to this rule is if the active duty service member or their spouse has
a business located in or doing business within the City since all business
income generated within the City is taxable or if the active duty service
member has any type of income for services other than their active duty
military pay.
      (g)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the failure
of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the tax as
required or by the employer's, agent's, or other payer's exemption from the
requirement to withhold the tax.
   3.   Other information required to reconcile with Federal returns:
      (a)   Resident individual taxpayers who file Form 1040 or Form 1040A with
the Internal Revenue Service, must include with their City return, copies of

         •   Any amount included in wages if the amount constitutes
compensation attributable to a plan or program described in section 125 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
         •   Any amount included in wages if the amount constitutes payment due
to a disability related to sickness or an accident paid by a party unrelated to
the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer.
         •   Any amount included in wages that is exempt income.
         •   Add the following amounts:
         •   Any amount not included in the wages solely because the employee
was employed by the employer before April 1, 1986.
         •   Any amount not included in wages because the amount arises from
the sale, exchange, or other disposition of a stock option, exercise of a stock
option, or the sale, exchange of other disposition of stock purchased under a
stock option. This applies only to amounts constituting ordinary income.
         •   Any amount not included in the wages if the amount is an amount
described in Section 401(k), 403(b), or 457 of the Internal Revenue Code. This
applies only to employee contributions and employee deferrals.
         •   Any amount that is supplemental unemployment compensation benefits
and not included in wages.
         •   Any amount received that is treated as self-employment income for

            .1   For the taxable year the amount is employee compensation that
is earned outside of the United States and that either is included in the

included in the taxpayer's gross income for such purposes if the taxpayer did
not elect to exclude the income under Section 911 of the Internal Revenue Code;
            .2   For no preceding taxable year did the amount constitute as
wages as defined in Section 3121(a) of the Internal Revenue Code;
            .3   For no succeeding taxable year will the amount constitute
wages; and
            .4   For any taxable year the amount has not otherwise been added
to wages pursuant to Section 718.03 of the Ohio Revised Code, as that section
existed before the effective date of House Bill 5 of the 130th general
assembly, March 23, 2015.
      (c)   Individuals sixteen (16) or seventeen (17) years of age who earn
twenty-five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) or more are subject to tax and are
required to file a City income tax return. Individuals eighteen (18) years of
age and older are subject to tax on all earned income and are required to file
a City income tax return.
      (d)   Lottery, sweepstakes, gambling and sports winnings, winnings from

profit for an individual means the individual's net profit required to be

self-employment earnings, the Federal 1099 forms related to this income must be
provided with the City return.  If the individual received partnership income
on a K-1, this income is taxable and must be reported on the City return but
the individual will receive credit for any City income tax already paid on this
income by the partnership.
      (h)   Current year net-profit losses (or net operating loss carryforwards
from previous tax years*) cannot be used to reduce taxes due on city taxable

following types: income yield, interest, capital gains, dividends, or other
income arising from the ownership, sale, exchange, or other disposition of
intangible property including, but not limited to, investments, deposits,
money, or credits as those terms are defined in Chapter 5701 of the Ohio
Revised Code, and patents, copyrights, trademarks, tradenames, investments in

   6.   2106 (Employee Business Expense) deductions
      (a)   Individual employee business expenses reported on the individual's
federal form 2106 that the individual deducted for federal income tax purposes
for the taxable year may be deducted from the resident's City taxable income
before the City tax is calculated.  If the taxpayer is not a resident, the
taxpayer may deduct such expenses only to the extent the expenses are related
to the taxpayer's performance of personal services in the City.
      (b)   To allow this deduction, the taxpayer must provide the following
with their City return:
         •   1040 showing that Schedule A deductions were taken on the Federal
return.
         •   Schedule A showing that the 2106 expenses were included on the
schedule.
         •   2106 form showing the 2106 expenses
      Failure to provide this information will result in the 2106 expense
deduction being disallowed until this information has been provided.
      (c)   Per IRS Section 67, the allowable 2106 deduction is reduced by 2%
of the total City taxable income.
      (d)   If a taxpayer files for a credit based on 2106 expenses, the City
reserves the right to contact other taxing agencies to determine if the
resident taxpayer may have requested a refund of their 2106 expense from the
taxing agency where they were employed or to determine if the non-resident
taxpayer used their full New Carlisle credit on their resident tax return even
though they received a refund from New Carlisle based on their 2106 expense. 
B.   Payment plans for individuals
   (1)   Payment plans are available for individual taxpayers (those filing
under a social security number) if they show both the financial need for the
payment plan and the ability to make reasonable payments. Payment plans are not
available for business accounts (those filing under a Federal ID number) or
withholding accounts.
   (2)   No payment plan will be granted for a tax year until after the due
date for that tax year. For example, if a return is filed on February 15, no
payment plan may be requested until after the due date (normally April 15). The
taxpayer must have a copy of their New Carlisle Income Tax return available to
request a payment plan since there are time periods when the return may not yet
have been reviewed and/or posted by the Tax Division.
   (3)   A payment plan cannot be considered until the Tax Division receives a
completed Hardship Payment Plan Request form. Payment plans must be signed by
the taxpayer and a sign copy return to the Tax Division to be valid. Payment
plans on joint accounts (even if signed by only one party) are considered in
force against both parties.  No third (3rd) party may sign a payment plan.
   (4)   The interest rate in effect for the tax year will apply to the payment
plan even if the payments on the plan go beyond the tax year. For example, if
the 2016 payment plan starts in November 2017, the interest rate on the entire
plan will be the interest rate for tax year 2016 even if the plans payments
continue into a future tax year (or years). Interest for the entire plan is
applied when the plan is created. If a payment plan is paid off early in its
entirety, the taxpayer may request a written review of the plan to determine if
there was interest overpaid that should be credited to the account.
   (5)   All payment plans have payments due on or before the first (1st) of
each month. Payment due dates are not negotiable. No monthly reminder notices
will be sent. The taxpayer is solely responsible for making the required
payments monthly payments on or before the first (1st) of each month. Failure
to adhere to the terms of the payment plan will result in the account being
immediately subject to legal action.
C.   Extensions to File/Pay for service in or for the armed forces:
   (1)   ORC 718.052 contains special extension to file and pay rules for
taxpayers who are members of the National Guard and Reserve and are called to
active duty and taxpayers who are civilians serving as support personnel in a
combat zone.  If the affected taxpayer is unable to contact the Tax Division,
it is requested that a family member or the person acting as the legal
representative for the service member or civilian serving as support contact
the Income Tax Division and notify us of the taxpayer's status to avoid non-
filing legal action.

Division within fifteen (15) days of establishing their business, through the
completion of a Business Income Tax Registration form. It is also the duty of
each business to identify subcontractors working for their businesses and to
submit Form 1099-MISC to the City Income Tax Division for said contractors on
or before the last day of February of each year.
      (b)   It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to inform the Income
Tax Division, in writing, of any change of the taxpayer's address within
fifteen (15) days of such change.
      (c)   A person may notify the Tax Administrator that he/she does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the City for a taxable year if both the
following conditions apply:
         .1   The person was required to file a tax return with the City for
the immediate preceding year because the person performed services at a
worksite location within the municipality; and
         .2   The person no longer provides services in the City and does not
expect to be subject to City income tax for the taxable year.
         If both of the above conditions are met, the person may request an
account to be inactivated by completing and signing the Request to Close a
Business Account Affidavit form available on the Income Tax Division webpage or
at the Income Tax Office.  As required by ORC 718.05 (N), the person shall
provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly explains the
circumstances, including the location of the previous worksite location and the
last date on which the person performed services or made any sales within the
municipal corporation.  The affidavit also shall include the following
statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any services within the
municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal corporation, or
otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation during
the taxable year.  If the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by the
municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered
a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with the municipal
corporation if such registration is required by the municipal corporation's
resolutions, ordinances or rules."  The affiant shall sign the Affidavit under
penalty of perjury.  Per these Rules and Regulations, the completion and
submission of a Business Income Tax Registration and/or Withholding Tax
Registration is required.
      (d)   If a person submits a Request to Close a Business Account Affidavit
the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file any tax return for
the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses information that
conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described in the affidavit
change.  Nothing in ORC 718.05 (N) prohibits the Tax Administrator from
performing an Audit of the person.
   2.   Date and requirement for filing direct returns:
      (a)   On or before the date prescribed by ORC 718, every person and
business entity subject to City income tax shall, except as provided in the
exceptions below, make and file with the Income Tax Division an annual return
on the form provided by the City or a generic city income tax form whether or
not tax is due. This process is also known as mandatory filing.
      (b)   If a return is made for a fiscal year or any period less than a
year, the return shall be made by the 15th day of the fourth month following
the end of such fiscal year or period.
      (c)   Partnerships:
         .1   All resident partnerships will file a return.  A complete Federal
Form 1065 (U.S. Partnership Return of Income) must be included with the City
return.  Payment of any tax due will be paid by the partnership as an entity.
         .2   Non resident partnerships having net profits attributable to the
City, will file a return as stated above and adjusted to the requirements of
the Ordinance and ORC 718, but shall pay the tax due as an entity.
         .3   In the case of a resident individual partner or part owner of a
non resident business, the partner's distributive share of net profits is
reported with the individual return via Schedule K-1.
      (d)   Corporations will include with the City return, a copy of Federal
Form 1120 (U.S. Corporate Income Tax Return) or 1120S (U.S. Small Business
Corporation Income Tax Return), including Form 4797 (Supplemental Schedule of
Gains and Losses), when applicable.  In addition, when deducting that portion
of the Ohio Corporation Franchise Tax based on net worth, a copy of the Ohio
Corporation Franchise Tax Report (Form FT 1120) must be included to
substantiate the deduction. In the case of a tax option corporation, a resident
owner or part owner of a non-resident S Corporation, the owner's distributive
share of net profits is reported with the individual's City return to the
extent it is taxable to the Municipality.
      (e)   A City Income Tax Return shall not be considered as filed until it
is received complete with all the above listed applicable Federal Schedules by
the Income Tax Division.  All incomplete returns shall be returned to the
taxpayer.  It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to file the completed
return by the due date. Any payment submitted with the incomplete return will
be applied to the taxpayer's account as an estimated payment.
      (f)   A business may file the required City Income Tax Return via the
Ohio Business Gateway but the required supporting documentation for the return
must either be mailed or faxed to the Income Tax Division or submitted via the
Secure Email link on the City's website if available.  The tax return will be
not considered complete until the required supporting documentation is received
by the Income Tax Division. 
   3.   Election to file net profit taxes with the State of Ohio for tax years
beginning on and after January 1, 2018:
      (a)   Businesses may elect to file municipal net profit tax with the
State of Ohio.
         .1   Any tax payer that is engaged in a business or profession in the
City of New Carlisle may elect to be subject to the Ordinance sections of
Chapter 881 that adopt ORC sections 718.80 through 718.95, in lieu of the
remaining provisions set forth in Ordinance
Chapter 881.
         .2   The taxpayer shall make the initial election on or before the
first day of the third month after the beginning of the taxpayer's taxable year
by notifying the tax commissioner and the City of New Carlisle on a form
prescribed by the Ohio Tax Commissioner.
         .3   The Ohio Tax Commissioner shall serve as the sole administrator
of the municipal net profit tax.
         .4   The election applies to the taxable year in which the election is
made and to each subsequent taxable year until the taxpayer notifies the Ohio
Tax Commissioner and the City of New Carlisle of its termination of the
election.
         .5   Taxpayers who made such election may terminate the election, on a
form prescribed by the Ohio Tax Commissioner on or before the first day of the
third month of any taxable year.
         .6   Upon timely and valid termination, the taxpayer is no longer
subject to Ordinance sections of
Chapter 881 that adopt ORC sections 718.80 through 718.95, and is instead
subject to the remaining provisions set forth in Ordinance
Chapter 881.
      (b)   Municipal filing of net profit taxes, instead of electing to file
with the State of Ohio, is a condition precedent for any taxpayer that is
engaged in business or profession in the City of New Carlisle to receive
benefits from the City of New Carlisle's economic development incentive
program.
         .1   Upon election pursuant to Section
881.17.1 of the Codified Ordinances, a taxpayer who is engaged in business or
profession in the City of New Carlisle immediately becomes ineligible to
receive any benefit from the City of New Carlisle's economic development
incentive program.
   Note: Article VI was amended by adding Section 3 to comply with HB 49,
passed June 29, 2017, pertaining to the authorization of State officials to
collect and administer municipal net profits taxes should a tax payer that is
engaged in a business or profession in the City of New Carlisle elect to be
subject to the provisions of Section
881.17 of the Codified Ordinances that adopt ORC sections 718.80 through
718.95, in lieu of the remaining provisions set forth in Ordinance
Chapter 881.
ARTICLE VII
GENERAL PROVISIONS FOR DIRECT ACCOUNTS
A.   Extensions to File:
   (1)   An extension to file is not an extension to pay and estimated taxes
are due by the tax return filing deadline to avoid non-payment penalties and/or
interest.
   (2)   If the taxpayer attaches a copy of a timely filed Federal extension to
file to their complete City tax return, no late-filing penalty shall be charged
in those cases in which a complete City tax return is filed within the period
as extended.
   (3)   Taxpayers not filing a Federal extension to file who wish to file only
an extension to file with the City may do so using the Application for
Extension of Time to File Tax Return form available at the Income Tax Division
office or on the City's website.  To be considered, such requests must be
postmarked or in our offices on or before the tax return filing deadline. The
request for extension of time to file with the City may be denied if the
individual taxpayer:
      (a)   Fails to timely file the request.
   (4)   If a Federal extension or a City extension to file has been approved,
the City tax return shall be due on the fifteenth (15th) day of the tenth
(10th) month following the previous taxable year and no late-filing penalty
shall be charged if a complete New Carlisle income tax return (including all
required informational returns, schedules and statements needed to support the
tax return along with a copy of the timely filed Federal or City extension to
file) are filed within the extension period.
   (5)   Businesses may also submit extension to file requests via the Ohio
Business Gateway.
B.   Net Operating Loss Carryforwards
   (1)   Tax preparers should review ORC 718 for more information on net
operating loss carryforwards as they relate to business filings.
   (2)   Net operating losses cannot be used to offset qualifying city taxable
wages.
   (3)   For taxable years beginning 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022, a
taxpayer may deduct no more than fifty per cent (50%) of the amount of the net
operating losses carried forward for tax year beginning 2017 or thereafter.
   (4)   For taxable years beginning 2023 or thereafter, a taxpayer may deduct
the full amount of any net operating losses available.
   (5)   The amount of net operating loss shall be deducted from net profit
that is reduced by exempt income to the extent necessary to reduce City taxable
income to zero with any remaining unused portion of the net operating loss
carried forward to not more than five (5) consecutive taxable years following
the taxable year in which the loss was incurred, but in no case for more years
than necessary for the deduction to be fully utilized.
C.   Income apportionment:
Taxpayers engaged in a business or profession in the City should review ORC
718.02 for apportionment factors.  If the apportionment factors described in
ORC 718.02 do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity
in a municipal corporation, the taxpayer may request, or the tax administrator
of the municipal corporation may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect
to all or any portion of the income of the taxpayer, one of the alternate
apportionment methods described in ORC 718.02.
D.   Rounding of amounts
A person may round to the nearest whole dollar all amounts the person is
required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document required
under this chapter. Any fractional part of a dollar that equals or exceeds
fifty cents ($0.50) shall be rounded to the next whole dollar, and any
fractional part of a dollar that is less than fifty cents ($0.50) shall be
dropped. If a person chooses to round amounts entered on a document, the person
shall round all amounts entered on the document.
E.   Interest and penalties for late filing and payment of direct tax
liability, in accordance with Ordinance Section
881.08:
   (1)   This section does not apply to returns required to be filed or
payments to be made through tax year 2015, regardless of the filing or payment
date.  Returns required to be filed or payments to be made through tax year
2015 but filed or paid after that date shall be subject to the ordinances and/
or rules, as adopted prior to January 1, 2016.
   (2)   Interest: Except as provided in paragraphs (4) and (5) below all taxes
imposed under the provisions of the Ordinance and the New Carlisle Income Tax
Rules and Regulations that remain unpaid after they have become due shall bear
interest, in addition to the amount of the unpaid taxes and penalties. Interest
shall be imposed at the rate of the Federal short-term rate (rounded to the
nearest whole number percent) for July of the current year plus five percent
(5%) for each month (or part thereof) there is a tax balance due.  This rate
shall apply for the calendar year next following the July of the year in which
the federal short-term rate is determined. Interest is imposed on only the
unpaid tax portion of any balances due and is imposed at the time of filing and
each month after filing at the beginning of the month. 
   (3)   Penalties: In addition to interest as provided in paragraph (2) of
this Article, penalties based on the unfiled returns and/or unpaid taxes are

together with all appropriate supporting Federal schedules, when due: twenty-
five dollars ($25.00) per month (or part thereof), not to exceed one hundred
fifty dollars ($150.00) for each tax year.
      (b)   Non-Payment Penalty: For failure to remit the taxes due at the time
of filing the City tax return: fifteen percent (15%) of the tax not timely
paid.
   (4)   Exceptions:
      (a)   No penalty shall be charged on additional taxes found on review to
be due when a return was timely filed in good faith and the tax paid thereon
within fifteen (15) days from the date the taxpayer was notified of such
findings.
      (b)   In the absence of fraud neither interest nor penalty shall be
charged on any additional taxes resulting from a Federal Audit for income tax
purposes provided an amended return is filed and the additional tax paid within
three (3) months after final determination of the Federal tax liability.
   (5)   Minimum Charges: Interest and penalty charges shall not be levied when
the total of such charges amounts to less than ten dollars ($10.00). Additional
interest calculated monthly on the tax balance due will not be levied when the
total of such additional charges amounts to less than ten dollars ($10.00).
   (6)   Effect on Extensions:
      (a)   No non-filing penalty will be charged if a tax return is filed and
a balance due is paid within the extended period for filing that return when
such extension was authorized by the Administrator as provided in these Rules
and Regulations or if a timely filed Federal extension is provided with the tax
filing.
      (b)   Non-filing penalty will be charged from the date the return was due
when the return is not filed within the approved extended period.
      (c)   Non-payment penalty will be charged on tax not paid by the return
filing deadline even though the time for filing the return has been extended.
F.   Declaration -- Requirement of filing:
   (1)   Every taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for the
current taxable year, on either their New Carlisle income tax return for the
prior tax year or on the declaration form available on the website
(www.newcarlisle.net) or at the Tax Division, if the amount payable as
estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars ($200). The declaration of
estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the date prescribed for filing a
City tax return or on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth (4th)
month after the taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the first time.  Amended
declarations may be filed at any time using the declaration form available on
the website or at the Tax Division.  The unpaid balance due on the amended
declaration shall be paid in equal installments on or before the remaining
payment dates.
   (2)   The filing of a declaration does not relieve the taxpayer of the
necessity of filing a final return even though there is no change in the
declared tax liability.  A final return must be filed to obtain a refund of any
overpayment of at least ten dollars ($10.00) or more.
   (3)   On joint accounts, joint declarations are required.
G.   Required dates for estimated payments and penalties for underpayment of
estimated taxes:
   (1)   The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year that
shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the City, including the
application of credit carryforwards and withholding credits on or before the
applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
      •   On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth (4th) month after
the beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half percent (22.5%) of
the tax liability for the taxable year.
      •   On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the sixth (6th) month after
the beginning of the taxable year, forty-five percent (45%) of the tax
liability for the taxable year.

the beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half percent (67.5%) of
the tax liability for the taxable year.
      •   For an individual: On or before the fifteenth day (15th) day of the
first (1st) month of the following taxable year, ninety percent (90%) of the
tax liability for the taxable year.
      •   For a person other than an individual: On or before the fifteenth
(15th) day of the twelfth month of the taxable year, ninety percent (90%) of
the tax liability for the taxable year.
   Note: Section G was amended to comply with modified ORC 718.08 (HB 49)
pertaining to a change in the due date for the fourth quarter estimated tax
payment for individuals from the 15th day of the twelfth month to the 15th day
of the first month of the following taxable year effective beginning tax year
2018.   
   (2)   When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid balance shown
due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal installments on or before
the remaining payment dates.
   (3)   On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth (4th) month of the
year following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed,
an annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
in accordance with ORC 718.05.
   (4)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of the tax liability,
penalty for underpayment of estimated taxes will be imposed.  The amount of the
underpayment shall be determined as follows:
      •   For the first (1st) payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent (22.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment.
      •   For the second (2nd) payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
percent (45%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      •   For the third (3rd) payment of the estimated taxes each year, sixty-
seven and one-half percent (67.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of
taxes paid by the date prescribed for that payment.
      •   For the fourth (4th) payment of the estimated taxes per year, ninety
percent (90%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
   (5)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made.  For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of the previous underpayment only to the
extent that payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of payment presently
required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (6)   The penalty for underpayment of estimated taxes is fifteen percent
(15%) of the amount not timely paid for each required estimated payment date.
   (7)   An underpayment of estimated tax penalty will not be applied if:
      •   For an individual: The amount of estimated taxes paid by the
fifteenth (15th) day of the first (1st) month of the following taxable year
equals at least ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the current
taxable year.
      •   For a person other than an individual: The amount of estimated taxes
paid by the fifteenth (15th) day of the first (1st) month of the following
taxable year equals at least one hundred percent (100%) of the tax liability
shown on the New Carlisle tax return for the preceding taxable year (provided
that the immediately preceding taxable year reflected a period of twelve (12)
months and a New Carlisle tax return was filed for the preceding year).
      •   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the City but was not
domiciled here on the first (1st) day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.
H.   Delinquent Process for Direct Accounts
   (1)   Non-Filing:
      (a)   If a complete tax return has not been filed by the due date of an
extended return for that year, Non-Filing Notices will be mailed to the
taxpayer's address on file at the Income Tax Division.
      (b)   If the taxpayer fails to provide acceptable documentation stating
why a tax return is not required for that tax year or does not file a tax
return after repeated mailings of the Non-Filing Notice, a Final Non-Filing
Notice will be mailed to the taxpayer's address on file at the Income Tax
Division.
      (c)   If the taxpayer fails to provide acceptable documentation stating
why a tax return is not required for the tax year or does not file a tax return
within 30 days after the Final Non-Filing Notice was mailed, a summons to the
Clark County Municipal Court for a criminal misdemeanor may be issued.  Once a
court summons has been issued, the summons will not be dismissed unless the
taxpayer can provide proof of non-residency in compliance with Ohio Revised
Code Chapter 718 or written proof that no business was conducted within the
City.
   (2)   Non-Payment:
      (a)   If a tax return is reviewed and changed by the Income Tax Division,
the taxpayer will receive a Tax Return Change Notice from the Income Tax
Division.  The taxpayer may contact the Income Tax Division to discuss the
return and may provide additional written documentation relating to the return
for the review by the Tax Administrator for possible modification of the filed
tax return. A change or correction of a tax return or a request for missing
information is not an Assessment.
      (b)   If the taxpayer has an unpaid tax or interest/penalty balance, the
taxpayer will receive Monthly Statements from the Income Tax Division at the
beginning of the month following the return filing (Note: This may be later
during the months of April and May). The taxpayer may contact the Income Tax
Division to discuss the balance due and may provide additional written
documentation related to the return for the review by the Tax Administrator for
possible modification of the filed tax return and/or the taxpayer may request
in writing an appealable Assessment of any balance due. The appealable
Assessment will be sent to the taxpayer via certified mail or secure email if
the taxpayer has given permission to receive correspondence from the Tax
Division electronically, and/or an individual taxpayer may submit to the Tax
Division a completed Hardship Payment Plan Request to request a payment plan on
the unpaid balance.
      (c)   If there remains an unpaid balance after repeated mailings of the
Monthly Statement, the taxpayer will receive a Monthly Statement-Final Notice.
The taxpayer may request in writing within 30 days of the date of Monthly
Statement-Final Notice an appealable Assessment of any balances due. The
appealable Assessment will be sent to the taxpayer via certified mail or secure
email if the taxpayer has given permission to receive correspondence from the
Tax Division electronically and/or an individual taxpayer may submit to the
Income Tax Division a completed Hardship Payment Plan request to request a
payment plan on the unpaid balance. If the taxpayer does not request an
appealable Assessment in writing within the 30-day period, the Tax Division
will consider any balances final and the account will be subject to collection
via a Clark County Municipal Court summons for a criminal misdemeanor,
submission to a collection agency and/or a civil judgement. 
      (d)   If the taxpayer requests an appealable Assessment within 30 days of
the date of the Monthly Statement-Final Notice, the Tax Administrator will
generate an Assessment and attempt delivery via the means described previously
under Service of Assessment. Within 60 days of the Service of Assessment, the
taxpayer may contact the Tax Administrator in writing to request a compromise
on this Assessment or the taxpayer may submit an appeal to the Local Board of
Tax Review. On the 61st day after the Assessment has been served, the
Assessment is final and subject to collection.
      (e)   When any taxpayer subject to the provisions of the Ordinance has
filed a return indicating the amount of tax due and has failed to pay said tax
to the Income Tax Division as required by the Ordinance, the Administrator need
not issue an Assessment but may proceed under the authority of Sections
881.09 and
881.10 of the Ordinance which are outlined in
Article XIII of these Rules and Regulations.
      (f)   If a balance remains unpaid and the Assessment has become final and
collectible the taxpayer is subject to additional legal actions to attempt
collection including submission to a collection agency and/or civil actions
and/or a summons to Clark County Municipal Court for a criminal misdemeanor.
I.   Credits
   (1)   The City of New Carlisle does not allow credits for taxes paid to any
other municipality to be used to offset taxes due to New Carlisle under the
authority of Section
881.12 of the Ordinance. 
   (2)   Qualifying losses on non-qualified deferred compensation plan are
covered in ORC 718.021.
ARTICLE VIII
WITHHOLDING ACCOUNTS
A.   General Requirements
   An annual tax of one and one-half percent (1.5%) is imposed on all
qualifying wages, commissions and other compensation, whether based upon
hourly, daily, weekly, semi monthly, annual unit of production or piece work
rates, received on or after July 1, 2015 and during the effective period of the
Ordinance.
   See ORC 718.031 for withholding requirements for casinos and lottery sales
agents.
   (1)   Residents: For the purpose of determining the tax on the earnings of
resident taxpayers taxed under Ordinance Section
881.03, the source of the earnings and the place or places in or at which the
services were rendered, are immaterial.  All such earnings wherever earned or
paid are taxable.
   (2)   Non residents: Any compensation earned in or from the City is taxable
as specified in Ordinance Section
881.04.
B.   Duty of Withholding
   (1)   Except as otherwise provided herein, it is the duty of each employer
within or doing business within or for the City, who employs one or more
persons whether as an employee, officer, director or otherwise, to deduct each
time any qualifying wages are paid on or after July 1, 2015 the tax of one and
one-half percent (1.5%) in accordance with Ordinance Section
881.03. Every employer required to deduct and withhold the tax at the source is
liable directly to this City for payment of such tax whether or not actually
collected from such employee.
   (2)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the City until such time as the withheld
amount is remitted to the City.
   (3)   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required shall be personally liable for a failure to file a report
or pay the tax due.  The dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer does not discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns
or pay any tax due.
   (4)   Employers and payroll services should review ORC 718.011 and ORC
718.03 for more detailed information on withholding rules including the 20-day
rule, definition of principal place of work and small employer withholding
provisions.  To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for
a taxable year, the employer must provide the Tax Administrator with their
federal income tax return for the preceding tax year.  Employers must be
certified as small employers annually.
   (5)   Any business having employees who work within the City but does not
withhold the full one and one-half percent (1.5%) from their employee's city
taxable income must maintain detailed payroll records that include all work
locations since the City maintains the right to review or Audit any withholding
account.
   (6)   See ORC 718.031 for withholding requirements for casinos and lottery
sales agents.
C.   Identification of withholding businesses
   (1)   Except as otherwise provided herein, it is the duty of each employer
doing business within or doing business with the City, who employs one (1) or
more persons whether as an employee, officer, director or otherwise, to
identify their business with the City's Income Tax Division within fifteen (15)
days of establishing their business within or for the City, through completion
of a Withholding Tax Registration.
   (2)   Upon receipt of a Withholding Tax Registration from the City, the form
must be completed and returned within fifteen (15) days, to the City's Income
Tax Division.
D.   Filing and payment requirements/deadlines for withholding businesses
   (1)   The deductions from qualifying wages required to be made by employers
are to begin with the compensation earned on and after the effective date of
the Ordinance.
   (2)   Quarterly filing/payments are required unless the employer meets the
criteria for monthly payments. Monthly payments are required if either one of
the following are applicable:
      •   The total City taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted
and withheld in the preceding calendar year exceeds two thousand three hundred
ninety-nine dollars ($2,399.00).
      •   The total City taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted
and withheld exceeds two hundred dollars ($200.00) in any month of the
preceding calendar quarter.
   (3)   If the employer is required to make monthly payments under the
criteria in this section, the employer (in addition to any return required to
be filed with respect to his/her own earnings or net profits) shall, on or
before the fifteenth (15th) day of the month following the end of each
withholding period, make a return and pay to the New Carlisle Income Tax
Division, the full amount of tax so deducted or withheld with respect to
qualifying wages paid to all of his/her employees subject to the tax under the
Ordinance.
   (4)   If the employer is permitted to make quarterly payments under the

before the last day of the month following the end of each withholding period,
make a return and pay to the New Carlisle Income Tax Division, the full amount
of tax so deducted or withheld with respect to qualifying wages paid to all of
his/her employees subject to the tax under the Ordinance.
   (5)   The withholding return required to be filed shall be made on the Form

due and is imposed at the time of filing and each month after filing at the
beginning of the month. 
   (3)   Penalties: In addition to interest as provided in paragraph (2) of
this section, penalties based on the unfiled returns and/or unpaid withholding
taxes are hereby imposed as follows:
      (a)   Non-Filing Penalty: For failure to file a complete City withholding

F.   Annual reconciliation required:
   (1)   On or before the last day of February, following any calendar year in
which such deductions have been made by any employer, such employer shall file
with the Income Tax Division, an informational return (a W-2 or facsimile or
electronic file meeting City specifications) for each employee from whom this
City's income tax has been withheld, showing the name, address and social
security number of the employee, the total amount of compensation paid during
the year and the amount of this City's income tax withheld from such employee.
   (2)   The gross compensation to be reported for each employee shall be for
the full twelve (12) calendar months of the year or such portion thereof as the
employee reported on was employed.
   (3)   In addition to these annual information returns, and at the time the
same are filed, such employer shall file with the Income Tax Division, an
annual reconciliation of returns (Form W 3) to enable the Income Tax Division
to reconcile the sum total of compensation paid and the taxes withheld as
disclosed by information return W 2, or list of employees, and prior returns
and remittances made pursuant to the Ordinance and these Regulations.
G.   Refunds and adjustments for withholding accounts: 
   (1)   If more than the amount of tax required to be deducted by the
Ordinance is withheld from an employee's pay, such excess may be refunded by
the employer or the Income Tax Division, depending upon the circumstances and
the time when the over-withholding is determined as follows:
      (a)   Resident current employees:
         .1   If the over-withholding is discovered in the same period, the
employer shall make the necessary adjustment directly with the employee and the
amount to be reported on the withholding return as withheld shall be the
correct amount.
         .2   If the over-withholding is discovered in a subsequent period of
the calendar year, the employer may make proper adjustment with the employee. 
In such case, the W-1 return for the period in which the adjustment is made
shall indicate the total amount actually withheld and the amount of the
adjustment along with an explanation.
         .3   If the over-withholding is discovered in the following year, the
employee shall complete the Refund Request form that is available on the City's
website or at the Income Tax Division.  This form must be completed by the
employee and their employer and a W-2 showing the total New Carlisle tax
withheld must be attached. The completed Refund Request form must be attached
to a signed New Carlisle tax return for the refund to be processed.
      (b)   Resident former employees:
         .1   If the over-withholding is discovered in the current year and
employee who is no longer employed by the employer, the employer shall notify
the Income Tax Division of the amount and circumstances of such over-
withholding in writing, and the Administrator shall then refund to the employer
the amount of such excess withholding and it is the responsibility of the
employer to refund these funds to their prior employee. The completed Refund
Request form must be attached to a signed New Carlisle tax return for the
refund to be processed.
         .2   If the over-withholding is discovered in the following year, the
employee shall complete the Refund Request form that is available on the City's
website or at the Income Tax Division.  This form must be completed by the
employee and their employer and a W-2 showing the total New Carlisle tax
withheld must be attached.
      (c)   Non residents employed outside the City: Where an employer has
withheld the New Carlisle tax from the qualified wages of a non resident of
this City, and such non resident has not worked within the City for all or part
of the time, the non-resident shall complete the Refund Request form that is
available at the City's website or at the Income Tax Division.  This form must
be completed by the employee and their employer and a W-2 showing the total New
Carlisle tax withheld must be attached. The completed Refund Request form must
be attached to a signed City of New Carlisle tax return for the refund to be
processed.
   (2)   Limitations: Where the total amount due or refund claimed for a tax
year is less than ten dollars ($10.00), such amount shall not be collected or
refunded.
   (3)   Insufficient Withholding: If less than the amount of tax required to
be deducted is withheld from an employee, such deficiency shall be withheld
from subsequent qualifying wages. 
   (4)   Exceptions:
      (a)   An employer whose records show that an employee is a non resident
of the City and has no knowledge to the contrary, shall be relieved of the
responsibility of withholding the tax on personal service compensation paid to
such employee for services rendered or work done outside the City by such
employee; provided, however, that such employer must withhold the tax on all
personal service compensation paid such employee after the Administrator, or
any duly authorized employee notifies said employer in writing that such
employee is a resident of the City. All employees are required to notify the
employer of any change of residence and the date thereof.
      (b)   No person shall be required to withhold the tax on the qualifying
wages or other compensation paid domestic servants employed exclusively in or
about such person's residence, but such employees shall be subject to all the
requirements of the Ordinance.
H.   Delinquent Process for Withholding Accounts
   (1)   Non-Filing:
      (a)   If a withholding return has not been filed by the due date,
Withholding Non-Filing Notices will be mailed to the taxpayer's address on file
at the Income Tax Division.
      (b)   If the taxpayer does not provide acceptable documentation stating
why a withholding return is not required for that period or does not file a
withholding return after repeated attempts, a Withholding Final Non-Filing
Notice will be mailed to the taxpayer's address on file at the Income Tax
Division.
      (c)   Failure to respond to the Withholding Final Non-Filing Notice
within 30 days of the date of this notice may result in a summons to Clark
County Municipal Court for a criminal misdemeanor.  This summons can be issued
to the officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the responsibility
for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making payments as required
since this person is personally liable for a failure to file a report or pay
the tax due.
   (2)   Non-Payment:
      (a)   If a withholding account has an unpaid tax or penalty/interest
balance, the taxpayer will be mailed Withholding Monthly Statements from the
Income Tax Division. The taxpayer may contact the Income Tax Division to
discuss the balance due and/or request in writing within 30 days of the date of
the Withholding Monthly Statement an appealable Assessment of any balances due.
The appealable Assessment will be sent to the taxpayer (or their authorized
agent) via certified mail or secure email if the taxpayer has given permission
to receive correspondence from the Tax Division electronically.
      (b)   If there remains an unpaid balance after repeated mailings of the
Withholding Monthly Statements, the taxpayer will be mailed a Withholding
Monthly Statement-Final Notice. The taxpayer may request in writing within 30
days of the date of the Withholding Monthly Statement-Final Notice an
appealable Assessment of any balances due. The appealable Assessment will be
sent to the taxpayer via certified mail or secure email if the taxpayer has
given permission to receive correspondence from the Tax Division
electronically. If the taxpayer does not request an appealable Assessment in
writing within the 30-day period, the Tax Division will consider any balances
final and the account will be subject to collection via a Clark County
Municipal Court Summons for a criminal misdemeanor, submission to a collection
agency and/or a civil judgement.
      (c)   If the taxpayer requests an appealable Assessment within 30 days of
the date of the Withholding Monthly Statement-Final Notice, the Tax
Administrator will generate an Assessment and attempt delivery via the means
described previously under Service of Assessment.  Within 60 days of the
service of the Assessment, the taxpayer may contact the Tax Administrator in
writing to request a compromise on this Assessment or the taxpayer may submit
an appeal to the Local Board of Tax Review. On the 61st day after the
Assessment has been served, the Assessment is final and subject to collection. 
      (d)   When any taxpayer subject to the provisions of the Ordinance has
filed a withholding return indicating the amount of withholding tax due and has
failed to pay said tax to the Income Tax Division as required by the Ordinance,
the Administrator need not issue an Assessment but may proceed under the
provisions of Sections 881.09 and 881.10 of the Ordinance.
      (e)   If a balance remains unpaid and the Assessment has become final and
collectible the taxpayer is subject to additional legal actions to attempt
collection including civil actions, submission to a collection agency and/or a
summons to New Carlisle Municipal Court for a criminal misdemeanor. This
summons can be issued to the officer or the employee of the employer, agent of
an employer, or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged
with the responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and
making payments as required since this person is personally liable for a
failure to file a report or pay the tax due.
ARTICLE IX
POSTMARKS AND EFFECTIVE DATES
A.   If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to be filed,
or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or before
a prescribed date is delivered after that period or that date by United States
mail to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
B.   For a document filed or sent electronically or a payment made
electronically, the date on the timestamp assigned by the first electronic
system receiving that payment or document.
ARTICLE X
SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT
A.   A copy of each Assessment shall be served upon the person affected thereby
either by personal service, by certified mail or by a delivery service
authorized under ORC 5703.056.
B.   With the permission of the person affected by the Assessment, the
Assessment may be delivered through alternate means as provided in this
section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic mail. 
Delivery by such means satisfies the requirements for delivery under this
section.  Once a taxpayer gives permission for delivery via secure electronic
mail, this delivery method will remain in effect until the taxpayer notifies
the Tax Administrator in writing that they wish to change the way they receive
Assessment and other information from the Administrator.
C.   If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable address, the
Administrator will use reasonable means to ascertain a new last known address,
including the use of a change address service offered by the postal service or
authorized delivery service under ORC 5703.056.  If, after using reasonable
means, the Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known address, the
Assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served.  If the
ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable address, the
Assessment remains appealable within sixty (60) days after the Assessment's
postmark.
D.   Once an Assessment has been served on the person to whom the Assessment is
directed, the person may protest the ruling of that Assessment by filing an
appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty (60) days after the
receipt of service.  The delivery of an Assessment as described in this section
is prima facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the Assessment is
served.
E.   If an Assessment sent by certified mail is returned for some cause other
than an undeliverable address, the Tax Administrator shall resend the
Assessment by ordinary mail.  The Assessment shall show the date the Tax
Administrator sends the Assessment and shall include the following statement:
"This Assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable law
ten (10) days from the date this Assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator
as shown on the Assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the mailing
of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the Assessment was
completed ten (10) days after the Tax Administrator sent the Assessment by
ordinary mail and that the Assessment was served. If the ordinary mail is
subsequently returned because of an undeliverable address, the Assessment
remains appealable within sixty (60) days after the Assessment's postmark.
F.   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service. A person
disputing the presumption of delivery and service bears the burden of proving
by a preponderance of the evidence that the address to which the Assessment was
sent was not an address with which the person was associated at the time the
Tax Administrator originally mailed the Assessment by certified mail.  For the
purposes of this section, a person is associated with an address at the time
the Tax Administrator originally mailed the Assessment if, at that time, the
person was residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the
address; or if, before that time, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address.  For purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the Assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent (20%), as determined by
voting rights, of the addressee's business. If a person elects to appeal an
Assessment on the basis of delivery and service  and if the Assessment is
subject to collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so
within sixty (60) days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or
other municipal official, or the designee of either, with the person.
G.   As used in this section:
      "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator has at the
time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address that Tax
Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the user of a change
of address service offered by the post office or other authorized delivery
service under ORC 5703.056.
      "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal service or
an authorized delivery service under ORC 5703.056 is not able to deliver an
Assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the reason for non-delivery is
because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept the Assessment.
ARTICLE XI
CONFIDENTIALITY
A.   Per ORC 718.13:
   (1)   Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this chapter or by a
charter or ordinance of a municipal corporation levying an income tax pursuant
to this chapter is confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such
information except in accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection
with the performance of that person's official duties or the official business
of the municipal corporation as authorized by this chapter or the charter or
ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax Administrator of the municipal
corporation or a designee thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or
otherwise received under this chapter and other related tax information to the
Internal Revenue Service, the Tax Commissioner, and Tax Administrators of other
municipal corporations.
   (2)   This section does not prohibit a municipal corporation from publishing
or disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with
respect to particular taxpayers.
B.   Taxpayer information is confidential and cannot be disclosed to a third
party [unless the third party has power of attorney] without written permission
of the taxpayer(s).  Documents granting permission for a third party to discuss
taxpayer status with the New Carlisle Income Tax Division must include Social
Security Number(s) or Federal ID Number; the tax years to be made available to
the third party; taxpayer signature and the date signed.  If an individual is
unavailable to sign their tax return, a third party may file a tax return only
if the third party has a power of attorney or the previously described
permission document attached (or has previously filed one of these documents
with the New Carlisle Income Tax Division).
C.   To grant permission for the New Carlisle Income Tax Division to contact a
tax preparer or accountant with questions on a tax return, the box on the tax
return allowing this permission must be checked.  If this box is not checked,
all questions on a tax return will be directed to the taxpayer.
D.   On joint tax returns, either spouse has access to the tax information for
that tax year.  If a married couple files separately, they are considered
individuals for tax purposes and the requirements in paragraph A apply for
disclosure of information.
E.   Copies of tax returns may be provided upon written request and proof of
identity.  A minimum of ten (10) working days should be allowed for the
fulfillment of requests.
G.   If the taxpayer has previously granted permission for contact about their
tax account to be made via Secure Email, the emailing of information to the
email address on file at the Tax Division shall not be deemed as a breach of
confidentiality as long as the email was sent using the Secure Email process.
ARTICLE XII

D.   Authority of the Tax Administrator under ORC 718.24:

A.   Unpaid sums---Civil suits:
   (1)   In addition to any criminal penalties which may be imposed, all taxes
imposed shall be collectible, together with any interest and penalties thereon,
by civil suit.  Employers who are required under Section
881.03 of the Ordinance to withhold and remit taxes required to be withheld at
the source, and who fail to withhold and/or remit become liable to the City in
a civil suit to enforce the payment of the deficiency created by such failure.
   (2)   No additional charges shall be made by the Administrator after three
(3) years from the time the return was due or filed, whichever is later. 
Provided, however, there shall be no period of limitation on such additional
charges in the case of a return that omits a substantial portion of income or
tax due, or filing a false or fraudulent return to evade payment of the tax, or
failure to file a return.  Failure to report twenty five percent (25%) or more
of gross income or tax due shall be considered a substantial omission.
   (3)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (a)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties.
      (b)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that

Administrator within three (3) years after the tax was due or paid, whichever
is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file with the
request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for a
refund.
   (2)   Overpayments will be either refunded or credited to the taxpayer's
current year's liability at his/her option. Where no election has been made by
the taxpayer, overpayments of any year's taxes shall be applied as follows:
      (a)   To taxes owed for any previous years in the order in which such
taxes become due.
      (b)   To the taxpayer's current estimated tax liability.
   (3)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, that if any overpayment is refunded
within ninety (90) days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety (90) days after the completed return if filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund.  For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return for
which the tax is reported due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return.  Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
ORC 718.27.
C.   Limitations:

ARTICLE XV
LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW
A.   The legislative authority of each municipal corporation that imposes a tax
on income in accordance with ORC 718.11 shall maintain a Local Board of Tax
Review to hear appeals as provided in this section.
B.   The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members.  Two members
shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the municipal corporation,
but such appointees may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors
with the municipal corporation at any time during their term or in the five (5)
years immediately preceding the date of appointment.  One member shall be
appointed by the top administrative official of the municipal corporation. 
This member may be an employee of the municipal corporation but may not be the
Director of Finance or equivalent officer, or the Tax Administrator or other
similar official, or an employee directly involved in the municipal tax matters
or any direct subordinate thereof.
   (1)   The term for members of the Board appointed by the legislative
authority shall be two (2) years.  There is no limit on the number of terms
that a member may serve if the member is reappointed by the legislative
authority.  The Board member appointed by the top administrative official shall
serve at the discretion of the administrative official.
   (2)   Members of the Board appointed by the legislative authority may be
removed by the legislative authority by majority vote for malfeasance,
misfeasance, or nonfeasance in office.  To remove such a member, the
legislative authority must give the member a copy of the charges against the
member and afford the member an opportunity to be publicly heard in person or
by counsel in the member's own defense upon not less than ten (10) days'
notice.  The decision by the legislative authority on the charges is final and
not appealable.
   (3)   A member of the Board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
   (4)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner as
the original appointment within sixty (60) days of when the vacancy was
created.  Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the
expiration of the term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall
hold office for the remainder of the term.  No vacancy on the Board shall
impair the power and authority of the remaining members to exercise all the
powers of the Board.
   (5)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the Board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the Board in the member's
place.  The appointment of such an individual shall be subject to the same
requirements and limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member
temporarily unable to serve.
C.   Review process:
   (1)   Any person who has been issued an Assessment may appeal the Assessment
to the Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section by filing a
request with the Board. The request shall be in writing, shall specify the
reason or reasons why the Assessment should be deemed incorrect or unlawful,
and shall be filed within sixty (60) days after the taxpayer receives the
Assessment.
   (2)   The Board shall schedule a hearing to be held within sixty (60) days
after receiving an appeal of an Assessment unless the taxpayer requests
additional time to prepare or waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive
the hearing, the taxpayer may appear before the Board and may be represented by
an attorney at law, certified public accountant, or other representative. The
Board may allow a hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties.
In such a case, the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty (120)
days after the first day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (3)   The Local Board of Tax Review may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax
Administrator's Assessment or any part of that Assessment. The Board shall
issue a final determination on the appeal within ninety (90) days after the
Board's final hearing on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination
by ordinary mail to all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen (15) days
after issuing the final determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator
may appeal the Board's final determination as provided in ORC 5717.011.
   (4)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures and shall keep a record of its
transactions. Such records are not public records available for inspection
under Ohio Revised Code Chapter 149.43. Hearings requested by a taxpayer before
the Board created pursuant to this section are not meetings of a public body
subject to ORC 121.22.
ARTICLE XVI
SAVINGS CLAUSE
A.   These Rules and Regulations shall not apply to any person, firm,
corporation or income, as to whom, or as to which it is beyond the power of the
City Council to impose the tax provided for in the Ordinance.
B.   If any sentence, clause, section or part of the Ordinance, or any article
or part of these Rules and Regulations, or any tax against any individual, or
any of the several groups specified in the Ordinance or Rules and Regulations,
is found to be unconstitutional, illegal, or invalid, such unconstitutionality,
illegality, or invalidity shall affect only such sentence, clause, section or
part of the Ordinance, or article, or part of these Rules and Regulations and
shall not affect or impart any of the remaining provisions, sentences, clauses,
sections or part of the Ordinance or these Rules and Regulations.  It is hereby
declared to be the intention of the City Council that these Rules and
Regulations would have been adopted had such unconstitutional, illegal or
invalid sentence, clause, section, article or part thereof not been included
therein or herein. The stated purpose of the Rules and Regulations is
compliance with ORC 718 and any deviations from this compliance are
unintentional. 
ARTICLE XVII
COLLECTION OF TAX AFTER TERMINATION OF CHAPTER
A.   This chapter shall continue effective insofar as  the levy of  taxes and
the collection of  taxes levied hereunder and actions or proceedings for
collecting any tax so levied or enforcing any provisions of this chapter are
concerned, until all of such taxes levied hereunder are fully paid and any and
all suits and prosecutions for the collection of such taxes or for the
punishment of violations of this chapter shall have been fully terminated,
subject to the limitations contained in Sections
881.09 and
881.10.
B.   Annual returns due for all or any part of the last effective year of this
chapter shall be due on the date provided in Section
881.06 as though the same were continuing.
ARTICLE XVIII
AUDITS
A.   A review of a filing for accuracy or completeness, a correction of a
return or a request for additional information from a taxpayer is not an Audit.
B.   Per ORC 718.36:
   (1)   At or before the commencement of an Audit, the Tax Administrator shall
provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during an Audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
tax. At or before the commencement of an Audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the Audit is considered to have commenced.
   (2)   Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an Audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an Audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the Audit.
   (3)   At all stages of an Audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as he/she considers appropriate, that
a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer. A taxpayer may refuse
to answer any questions asked by the person conducting an Audit until the
taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner. This Division does not
authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.
   (4)   A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the Audit
examination.
   (5)   The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (6)   If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest arising from
the Audit.
ARTICLE XIX
ROSTER OF TENANTS
Every owner of one or more rental units and every owner or operator of a mobile
home park shall furnish to the Income Tax Division, a semi annual roster of the
names and addresses of all persons residing in such rental unit or mobile home
park and shall also file a statement of any changes in the roster at the end of
each month.  The semi annual statement shall be filed with the Income Tax
Division on or before January 31 and July 31 of each year.
ARTICLE XX
OHIO BUSINESS GATEWAY
A.   A business taxpayer subject to the City's tax on the net profit from a
business may file any City income tax return or estimated City income return
and may make payment of amounts due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business
Gateway.
B.   Any employer may report the amount of City income tax withheld from
qualifying wages and may make remittance amounts, by using the Ohio Business
Gateway.
C.   Any business taxpayer that is subject to the City's tax on the net profit
from a business and has received an extension to file the federal income tax
return shall not be required to notify the municipal corporation of the federal
extension and shall not be required to file any municipal income tax return
until the fifteenth (15th) day of the tenth (10th) month following the year
that the extension is granted for, provided that, on or before the date for
filing the municipal income tax return, the person notifies the Tax
Commissioner of the federal extension through the Ohio Business Gateway. An
extension of time to file is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due.
D.   A business may file the required City income tax return via the Ohio
Business Gateway but the required supporting documentation for the return must
either be mailed or faxed to the Income Tax Division, or submitted via the
Secure Email link if available on the City's website.  The tax return will not
be considered complete until the required supporting documentation is received
by the Income Tax Division.
ARTICLE XXI
ADDITIONAL FEES RELATED TO LEGAL ACTIONS
As permitted under ORC 718.27, the City of New Carlisle shall impose on the

New Carlisle's civil Post-Judgement collection costs and fees including
attorney's fees.
For taxpayers appearing before Clark County Municipal Court on a criminal
misdemeanor under
Chapter 881 of the City of New Carlisle Income Tax Ordinance, the cost and
fines charged are strictly at the discretion of the Clark County Municipal
Court.

1020.02   CURB STANDARD PLAN.
   (a)   The City of New Carlisle currently has in place a street repair
priority list. This is a list of every street in the City, its condition
(excellent, fair, poor, or critical), type of repair needed (reconstruct,
resurface, or surface treat), the type of street it is (local access, State
highway, primary or secondary thoroughfare) and possible funding sources. The
City Administration reviews this list annually and makes recommendations to
Council for updates to the list.
   (b)   It is the policy of the City to upgrade all sidewalks, curbs, gutters,
and handicap accessible ramps, when feasible, during any street construction/
reconstruction projects. Working with the street priority list, the City
Administration, with the help of the City Street Department, tracks the
condition of sidewalks and curbs within the City.
   (c)   Further, it is the policy of the City to establish a standard curb and
gutter design. In the case of new construction, the curb and gutter design
below will be the standard. In the case of reconstruction or partial
reconstruction, it will be at the discretion of the Public Service Director
whether the standard curb design should be used or whether an alternative
design will be used to allow consistency with any existing curb and gutter.

obtaining a permit therefor from the City Manager or his or her authorized
representative for each separate undertaking. However, a person maintaining
pipes, lines or other underground facilities in or under the surface of any

obtained beforehand. The person shall thereafter apply for a permit on the

is open for business, and the permit shall be retroactive to the date the work
was begun. In all cases where emergency openings are necessary, the Division of
Police shall be notified prior to such opening. 
   (b)   Work in Pavement Less Than Five Years Old.  No permit shall be issued
by the Manager which would allow an excavation or opening in a paved and
improved street surface less than five years old, unless the applicant can
clearly demonstrate that public health or safety requires that the proposed
work be permitted or unless an emergency condition exists.

prior to joining pipes, the surfaces of joint rings shall be wiped clean and
the joint rings and rubber gaskets shall be liberally lubricated with an
approved type of vegetable oil soap. The spigot end shall be entered into the
bell of the pipe already laid, making sure that both pipes are properly
aligned. Before the joint is fully home, the position of the gasket in the
joint shall be determined by means of a suitable feeler gauge supplied by the
pipe manufacturer. The pipe shall then be forced home firmly and fully. In its
final position, the pipe shall not be deflected more than recommended by the
pipe manufacturer.
   (i)   At each line valve, bend, plug, tee, etc., where hydrostatic pressures
exert a disjointing pressure, the pipe joints shall be tied together. For pipes
twelve inches or smaller, a ductile iron mechanical joint retainer ring shall
be used except as directed by the Director. Where directed for small size and
for all large pipes, approved blocking shall be used.
(Ord. 21-78.  Passed 6-27-78.)

stones, rocks, pieces of masonry, pavement, etc. greater than twelve inches in
diameter, frozen earth, debris or earth with an exceptionally high void
content.
   (c)   All trenches and excavations shall be backfilled immediately after 
pipes are laid therein. Under no circumstances shall water be permitted to rise
in unbackfilled trenches after pipes have been placed.
   (d)   Immediately after placement of backfill in existing streets, temporary
pavement shall be installed and the street opened. Temporary pavement shall
consist of nine inches of compacted Ohio Department of Transportation
Specification 304 base and a surface course of Ohio Department of
Transportation Specification  405 or 409. The surface shall be kept flush with
the existing street.
   (e)   Any settlement of a trench causing depressions shall be refilled as
required by the Director of Public Service.  This provision applies for a one-

1040.16   RATES GENERALLY; BILLING; CONSUMER RESPONSIBILITY FOR LEAKS.
   (a)   Rates Established by Ordinance.  Water rates shall be established by
Municipal ordinance.
   (b)   Reading Meters.  Meters shall be read monthly. When a meter reading
cannot be obtained, the Department of Public Service reserves the right to
estimate and bill for the water consumed on the basis of the preceding
comparable quarter.
   (c)   Due Dates for Bills.  Water bills are due on receipt. Bills not paid
on or before the fifteenth of the billing month are subject to a ten percent
penalty charge. Water bills not paid in full by the last day of the billing
month may cause the service to be shut off without further notice, unless
provisions for payment have been made with the Department. Such provisions will
be limited to three times during a calendar year per customer.  Payment
agreements for a severe water leak will be determined on a case-by-case basis. 
However, when the last day of the billing month falls on a Saturday, Sunday or
legal holiday, the last billing day shall be the next regular working day.
Users may elect to pay charges in advance at any time; any remaining credit
will be reflected on monthly bills. The amount paid in advance shall not exceed
three hundred dollars ($300.00) and any refund request must be approved by the
City Manager.
   (d)   Charges for Water as Liens.  All charges for water are assessed
against the property to which the service is rendered and are a lien against
the property, collectable in the same manner as other taxes and assessments. A
person who purchases property shall ascertain if any water bill assessed to
such property is unpaid.
   (e)   Occupancy by Tenant. 
      (1)   Effective September 18, 2003, all residential properties where one
outside shut-off controls more than one dwelling must be in the property
owner's name.  Any residential rental property with an individual outside shut-
off per unit may be placed in the tenant's name at the property owner's
request.
      (2)   All commercial properties where one outside shut-off controls more
than one rental unit may be in the property owner's name. Any commercial rental
property with an individual outside shut-off per unit may be placed in the
tenant's name at the property owner's request.
      (3)   If the owner of any premises elects to have his or her tenant or
lessee pay the water bill, such tenant or lessee does so as the agent of the
owner and such owner is not relieved from the payment of any bill, penalty or
other such charge that may occur.
      (4)   All accounts must be paid in full prior to the transfer of
accounts.
   (f)   Delivery of Bills.  The Authority will undertake to deliver bills for
water by depositing the same in the post office only as a matter of convenience
to the owner or consumer. The failure of a person to receive a bill shall not
relieve him or her from his or her obligations to pay the bill.  In utilizing
the U.S. Postal Service for delivery of their payment of a water service
charge, users assume the responsibility for any failure of the U.S. Postal
Service to deliver the payment to the Authority. Accordingly, the Authority
shall not waive payment penalties for any person claiming the U.S. Postal
Service failed to deliver a bill or payment. If the user elects for paperless
billing, the user shall receive no paper bill but is still responsible for the
payment of services rendered on the appropriate due date.
   (g)   Unpaid Bills for Customers Connected to Municipal Water and Sewer
Supply. When the water and sewer is turned off because of an unpaid bill, it
will not be turned on again until the bill, plus penalty, has been paid,
together with an off and on charge of fifty dollars ($50.00); forty dollars
($40.00) deposited into the Water Enterprise Fund account and ten dollars
($10.00) deposited into the Wastewater Enterprise Fund account.  Water only
accounts will be charged forty dollars ($40.00) deposited into the Water
Enterprise Fund account.
      (1)   Service disconnection for unpaid bills. Service may be disconnected
for non-payment of a monthly bill when more than thirty days past due or for
non-payment of a payment agreement extension wherein the customer fails to pay
under the terms and conditions of the agreement
      (2)   Service disconnection fee. A fifty dollar ($50.00) fee will be
assessed to all unpaid accounts on the day service is disconnected
      (3)   Reconnection of service.  If payment is received in our offices by
3:00 p.m. on the day of disconnection, we will attempt to reconnect service on
the same day, however reconnection of services on the same day of payment is
not guaranteed.
      (4)   Utility billing rules and regulations. The City Manager or his or
her designee will establish an office policy to direct personnel and enforce
codified ordinances concerning utility billing and regulations and update as
needed.
   (h)   Unrepaired Leaks.  When a consumer has been notified of a leak and
such leak is not repaired within ten days of such notice, the service may be
shut off without further notice.
   (i)   Service Fee for Outside Normal Business Hours. Any turn-ons and turn-
offs requested outside normal business hours will be charged an additional one
hundred dollars ($100.00) per turn-on and/or turn-off. The Director of Public
Service or the City Manager will be the only people permitted to determine if a
fee will be waived for an emergency shut-off.
   (j)   Insufficient Funds. If a bank should return a check from a user for
insufficient funds, that user's account will be subject to an insufficient
funds charge established by the Authority. Upon the claim of a person that the
return of a check for insufficient funds was a bank error, the Authority may
waive an insufficient funds charge if the bank supplies adequate documentation
of its error. If a person has two checks returned for insufficient funds, the
Authority may require all future payments to be made in cash or by money order.
Water will be disconnected immediately when a check is returned and not turned
on until the amount of the check, check fee and disconnection fee is paid in
full. If the users elect to pay their water bill on line and the credit card
used is declined, the user is still responsible for making the payment to avoid
disconnection for non-payment. In the instance where the user’s credit card was
utilized without their permission to make the online water payment, the user is
still responsible for payment on the water bill to avoid disconnection.
   (k)   Final Bills.  The landlord of the property is responsible for all
final bills. All final bills must be paid within 30 days or a late fee of 10%
will be added for each month the bill is past due.
   (l)   Fees for Online Utility Payments. There will be a fee to use a credit
card online to make utility payments. The fee shall be one dollar and ninety-
five cents ($1.95) per one hundred dollar ($100.00) increments.

1040.17    CONNECTION PERMITS.
   No person shall place any water connection in service until he or she
obtains the proper water connection and inspection permit from the Department
of Public Service. An application for such permit shall be signed by the owner
or lessee of the property and the person employed to do the work, and shall be
accompanied by payment of a fee of:
   (a)   Twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for a new service connection;
   (b)   Forty dollars ($40.00) for reconnection of service that was
disconnected for reason of nonpayment of service charges; or
   (c)   Five dollars ($5.00) for a transfer of ownership or tenant where the
previous owner or tenant notified the Municipality that such owner or tenant no
longer required service and obtained a final meter reading before vacating the
premises of the service location.
   However, a developer who installs, at his or her own expense within a given
plat, a complete water distribution system consisting of water mains in the
street or in an appropriate right of way, and service connections to the curb,
shall obtain a permit but is exempt from payment of a fee for the same.
(Ord. 08-51.  Passed 10-6-08.)
1040.18   CONNECTION CHARGES.

   (b)   Charge for New Connections.  Where, at the time of construction, the
owner of land abutting on an existing water line has not paid his or her pro
rata share of the construction cost thereof, an additional water connection
charge per front foot shall be made for each direct connection to the water
line from each structure located on such land. The amount of such charge shall
be determined by Council.
   (c)   Charge for Change in Meter Size.  There is hereby established an
additional charge for increasing the size of a water meter serving a structure,
based on the current price of the new water meter.
   (d)   Charge for Installation of Additional Meters.  There is hereby
established an additional charge for the installation of an additional water
meter to serve a structure, based on the current price of a new water meter.
   (e)   Additional Service.  There is hereby established an additional charge
for the installation of an additional water service from the property line curb

1040.195   OVERSIZING WATER AND SEWER LINES FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT.
   (a)   Whenever water or sanitary sewer lines are laid at the expense of the
city without the cost thereof being paid for by or assessed against all the
property owners abutting such lines and benefitted thereby, the owner of the
abutting property to be served by such lines and for which property the cost
thereof has not been paid or assessed shall pay his pro rata share as
determined herein before tapping therein.
   (b)   Whenever such lines are laid by the owner or another person with the
authority of and under the direction of the Director of Public Service, except
in cases where the owners of new subdivisions are required to make such
installation at their expense by the order of the Planning Board pursuant to
the Subdivision Regulations, such owner or other person shall certify to the
Director in such detail as he may require the cost of the oversizing
immediately upon completion.  The costs shall be subject to the approval of the
Director and may be reduced if the Director, with the advice of the City
Engineer, in his discretion is of the opinion that such costs are excessive.
   (c)   Whenever such lines are laid by the owner or another person with the
authority of and under the direction of the Director of Public Service in cases
where the owners of new subdivisions are required to make such installations at
their expense by the order of the Planning Board pursuant to the Subdivision
Regulations, and the Director also requires that said installations be made
with lines larger than that needed for the new subdivision alone in order to
allow for future growth and development adjacent to said new subdivision, such
owner or other person shall certify to the Director in such detail as he may
require the cost of the improvements immediately upon completion.  The costs
shall be subject to the approval of the Director and may be reduced if the
Director, with the advice of the City Engineer, in his discretion is of the
opinion that said costs are excessive.
   (d)   The owner of any abutting property thereby serviced by such lines in
situations described in divisions (a), (b) or (c) herein , shall pay his pro
rata share of the costs thereof as determined herein before tapping therein. 
The funds so received shall be paid to the person who paid the cost of such
lines and certified the costs thereof to the Director, or such person's heirs,
executors, administrators or assigns; however, no such payment shall be made
after the elapse of more than fifteen years after the completion of the job. 
All funds received after said fifteen-year period shall be deposited into the
Capital Improvement Fund of the Department of Public Service.
   (e)   The Director of Public Service shall determine a property owner's pro
rata share by dividing the cost of the improvement by the total number of
lineal front footage of the project and multiplying that quotient times the
number of  lineal front footage of said property owner.

1040.25   EXTENSIONS.
   (a)   Required in New Developments.  A newly developed area in the
Municipality must be served by Municipal water. A water extension to serve such
area shall be installed at the developer's expense and in accordance with the
specifications of the Municipality. The line shall become the property of the
Municipality upon its acceptance by the Municipality.
   (b)   Payment of Cost by Property Owner.  When, in the interest of public
health and welfare and community growth, it becomes necessary for an existing
water line to be extended to serve additional areas and when private
individuals have no interest in financing the improvement, Council may
authorize the extension of a water main with the understanding that adjoining
property owners may connect to the water main by paying to the Municipality a
special privilege charge and the standard tap-in fee. The amount of the special
privilege charge shall be determined by the Municipality and shall approximate
a front foot pro rata share of the equivalent cost of the installation of the
six-inch water line.
   (c)   Extensions Outside Municipality.  An extension of a water line outside
the Municipality must be approved by Council. Areas served by Municipal
utilities must normally be annexed to the Municipality. If approved, the cost
of extending the water main must be borne by the developer. The Municipality
may request that the water line be oversized to serve future developments and
negotiate with the developer as to payment for such oversizing since the
initial development may have the effect of stimulating additional development
in the area.
   (d)   Construction and Materials.  All construction and materials shall meet
the specifications of the Municipality.  Such specifications shall be available
from the Director of Public Service.
   (e)   Deviations.  A deviation from this section is permitted only by a two-

1040.26   BACKFLOW PREVENTION DEVICES.
   (a)   If, in the judgment of the Director of Public Service, an approved
backflow prevention device is necessary for the safety of the public water
system, the Service Director shall give notice to the water consumer to install
such an approved device immediately.  The water consumer shall, at his or her
own expense, install such an approved device at a location and in a manner
approved by the Service Director, and shall have inspections and tests made of
such approved devices as required by the Service Director. 
   (b)   No person shall establish or permit to be established or maintain or
permit to be maintained any connection whereby a private, auxiliary or
emergency water supply, other than the regular public water supply, may enter
the supply or distributing system of the Service Director, unless such private,
auxiliary or emergency water supply, and the method of connection and use of
such supply, shall have been approved by the Service Director and by the Ohio
Environmental Protection Agency.
   (c)   The Service Director shall cause surveys and investigations to be made
of industrial and other properties served by the public water supply where
actual or potential hazards to the public water supply may exist.  Such surveys
and investigations shall be made a matter of public record and shall be
repeated as often as the Service Director deems necessary.
   (d)   The Service Director or his or her duly authorized representative
shall have the right to enter, at any reasonable time, any property served by a
connection to the public water supply or distribution system of the
Municipality, for the purpose of inspecting the piping system or systems
thereof.  Upon demand, the owners, lessees or occupants of any property so
served shall furnish to the Service Director any information which he or she
may request regarding the piping system or systems or water use on such
property.  The refusal of such information, when demanded, shall, within the
discretion of the Service Director, be deemed evidence of the presence of
improper connections as provided in this section.
   (e)   The Service Director is hereby authorized and directed to discontinue,
after reasonable notice to the occupant thereof, the water service to any
property wherein any connection in violation of the provisions of this section
is known to exist, and to take such other precautionary measures as he or she
may deem necessary to eliminate any danger of contamination of the public water
supply distribution mains.  Water service to such property shall not be
restored until such conditions have been eliminated or corrected in compliance
with the provisions of this section.

1040.27   CROSS-CONNECTION CONTROL.
   In order to effectuate the goals and purposes of Section
1040.26, the following regulations on cross-connection control are hereby
adopted:
   REGULATIONS ON CROSS-CONNECTION CONTROL
      Section 1.   General Policy.
         A.   Purpose.  The purpose of these regulations is:
            1.   To protect the public potable water supply from contamination
or pollution by isolating, within the consumer's water system, contaminants or
pollutants which could backflow through the service connection into the public
potable water system;
            2.   To promote the elimination or control of existing cross-
connections, actual or potential, between the public or the consumer's potable
water system and nonpotable water systems, plumbing fixtures and sources or
systems containing process fluids; and
            3.   To provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of
cross-connection control, which will systematically and effectively prevent the
contamination or pollution of the public and the consumer's potable water
systems.
         B.   Application.  These regulations shall apply to all premises
served by the public potable water system of the City of New Carlisle.
         C.   Policy.  The Director of Public Service shall be responsible for
the protection of the public potable water system from contamination due to
backflow of contaminants through the water service connection.  If, in the
judgment of the Director of Public Service, an approved backflow prevention
device is necessary at the water service connection to a consumer's premises
for the safety of the water system, the Director of Public Service or his or
her authorized representative shall give notice to the consumer to install such
approved backflow prevention device at each service connection to his or her
premises.  The consumer shall immediately install such approved device or
devices at his or her own expense, and failure, refusal or inability on the
part of the consumer to install such device or devices immediately shall
constitute grounds for discontinuing water service to the premises until such
device or devices have been installed.
      Section 2.  Definitions.  The following definitions shall apply in the
interpretation and enforcement of these regulations:
         A.   "Air gap separation" means the unobstructed vertical distance
through the free atmosphere between the lowest opening from any pipe or faucet
supplying water to a tank, plumbing fixture or other device, and the flood
level rim of the receptacle.
         B.   "Approved" means that a backflow prevention device or method has
been accepted by the supplier of water and the Director as suitable for the
proposed use.
         C.   "Auxiliary water system" means any water system on or available
to the premises, other than the public water system, and includes the water
supplied by the system.  These auxiliary waters may include water from another
supplier's public water system; water from a source, such as wells, lakes or
streams; process fluids; or used water.  They may be polluted, contaminated or
objectionable, or may constitute a water source or system over which the
supplier of water does not have control.
         D.   "Backflow" means the flow of water or other liquids, mixtures or
substances into the distributing pipes of a potable water supply from any
source other than the intended source of the potable water supply.
         E.   "Backflow prevention device" means any device, method or type of
construction intended to prevent backflow into a potable water system.
         F.   "Consumer" means the owner or person in control of any premises
supplied by, or in any manner connected to, the public water system.
         G.   "Consumer's water system" means any water system located on the
consumer's premises that is supplied by, or in any manner connected to, a
public water system.  A household plumbing system is considered to be a
consumer's water system.
         H.   "Contamination" means an impairment of the quality of the water
by sewage, process fluid or waste, to a degree which could create an actual
hazard to the public health through poisoning or through the spread of disease
by exposure.
         I.   "Cross-connection" means any arrangement whereby backflow can
occur.
         J.   "Degree of hazard" means the potential risk to health and the
adverse effect upon the potable water system, derived from an evaluation of
that potential.
         K.   "Director" means the Director of the Ohio Environmental
Protection Agency or his or her duly authorized representative.
         L.   "Double-check valve assembly" means an assembly composed of two
single, independently-acting check valves, including tightly-closing shutoff

include best management practices for controlling erosion and general measures
for protecting surface waters.
      (3)   Submittal of a riparian area and/or wellfield protection plan.
Riparian vegetation (the trees, shrubs and other plants along a stream) plays a
critical role in establishing and protecting the water quality and biological
integrity of a stream. Since loss of such vegetation can lead to stream
degradation and violation of State water quality standards, the applicant must
demonstrate how existing riparian vegetation will be protected/preserved to the
greatest extent possible and how streams will be kept free of sediment runoff
from construction activity before any development plans or connections to the
interceptor sewers can be approved.
   In addition, any development that could adversely affect area ground water
supplies should be coordinated with the local inter-jurisdictional Ground Water
Advisory Committee for wellfield protection. Any guidance or restrictions

 1042.05   CAPACITY CHARGE.
   (a)   Except as hereinafter provided, no person shall connect any building
or other structure either directly or indirectly to the sewerage system without
first paying to the Authority a capacity charge determined in accordance with
the schedule (Appendix A) currently adopted by the City at the time of the
permit application.
   (b)   The Authority shall not issue a permit to connect to the sewerage
system until the applicant for such a permit shall have deposited in cash, or
by certified check payable to the Authority, a capacity charge to be determined
in accordance with the current schedule.
   (c)   The capacity charge shall be as indicated in Appendix A.
   (d)   In the event the Authority ascertains that any property has been
connected to the sewerage system without a proper permit, the Authority may
disconnect such property until such violation ceases. In the event a property
is disconnected and subsequently reconnected under this section, the owner
shall be subject to the disconnection/reconnection charges provided herein.
Such charges shall be added to the customer's sewer service bill.
(Ord. 95-16.  Passed 9-18-95.)
1042.06   SEWER CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE.
   (a)   All building sewers shall be inspected and approved by the Authority
after installation but before covering with backfill. The person to whom the
permit has been issued shall call the Authority, requesting the inspection, at
least twenty-four hours before the inspection is desired.
   (b)   The construction shall include all facilities needed to connect to the
sewerage system. The materials and/or equipment used during the construction
shall conform to the applicable ASTM specifications, as directed by the
Authority.
   (c)   The building sewer shall be constructed of a size not less than four
inches, internal diameter, and shall be of first-grade quality vitrified clay
pipe, ABS pipe, PVC or cast iron pipe, using proper bends or curves for all
changes in alignment or grade. All joints and connections shall be made
gastight and watertight. The Authority may require the sewer tapper to
demonstrate the tightness of the joints by such tests as are deemed necessary
and may require additional jointing material or concrete collars at any or all
joints.
   (d)   The building sewer shall have a minimum fall of one-fourth of an inch
per linear foot of sewer from the building to the public sewer. The Authority
may, by special permission in each case, authorize the building sewer to be
constructed with a fall of as little as one-eighth of an inch per linear foot
if it is determined that such procedure is necessary. The junction between the
building sewer and the house plumbing shall be made watertight.
   (e)   The interior of each length of pipe shall be made perfectly clean and
free from offsets, fins and projections before the next length is connected
thereto. All building sewers shall be graded by line and pole, the line being
first leveled from the building to the public sewer and then lowered at the
downstream end to obtain the required fall.
   (f)   A separate and independent building sewer shall be provided for each
residence or building, except where one building stands at the rear of another
on an interior lot and separate building sewers cannot be made available to
each building. In such a case, one building sewer may be extended to serve both
buildings. A permit shall be obtained for each building connected to the
building sewer.
   (g)   Foundation drains shall not be connected, either directly or
indirectly, to the building sewer or public sewer. If any drains are installed,
carrying surface or subsurface water, they shall be constructed to carry said
water to the street or other natural watercourses.
   (h)   Surface water which collects in basement or foundation excavations
shall not be discharged at any time into the building sewer. If the building
sewer is completed before the house plumbing can be connected thereto, the
builder or sewer tapper shall keep the end of the building sewer tightly closed
at all times with a plumber's plug or other watertight plug in order to prevent
said surface or ground water from entering the building sewer.
   (i)   Old or existing building sewers may be used in connection with new
buildings or alterations only when it can be demonstrated that they conform in
all respects to the requirements contained herein for new building sewers.
   (j)   Building sewers shall not be constructed closer than three feet to any
exterior wall, cellar, basement or cistern, nor shall they have less than two
feet of earth or stone cover.
   (k)   Where the building sewer will cross unstable soil or be close to a
tree where roots may enter the joints, extra heavy cast iron pipe may be
required. Cast iron pipe shall be required when the building sewer is within
ten feet of a water service line, well, spring, cistern or other source of
water supply.
   (l)   All excavation for sewers shall be by open cut from the surface. The
sides of the trench shall be substantially vertical, using such sheeting and
bracing as may be necessary to accomplish this result. The bottom of the
excavation shall be shaped to fit the lower half of the sewer so that the pipe
will have uniform bearing from end to end. In the event the trench is excavated
below the required grade of the pipe, the excess space shall be filled with pea
gravel or stone not over three-quarters of an inch in diameter. The width of
the trench at the top of the pipe shall not exceed two feet plus the outside
diameter of the pipe, nor shall the width at that point be less than one foot
plus the outside diameter of the pipe.
   (m)   Water, gas, electric, cable television, telephone and other utility
services  shall not be laid in the same trench as the building sewer.
   (n)   The person to whom a permit is issued shall be responsible for
obtaining any required permits to open cut any street, road or alley from the
appropriate political body, official or person having authority or jurisdiction
over such work.
   (o)   The building sewer shall be backfilled to an elevation at least six
inches over the top of the pipe by tamping in six layers. Soil containing
stones larger than three inches, in the greatest dimension, shall not be used
for backfill. The balance of the backfill may be deposited in any manner which
will not damage the pipe or disturb the alignment or grade of the sewer, except
that the balance of the backfilling shall be done in such a manner and with
such material as may be required by the permit.
   (p)   For new connections into the sanitary sewers, the connection methods
must be approved by the Authority prior to initiating construction of the
building sewer. In addition, a shut-off valve will be installed by the
applicant, where feasible.
   (q)   The permit holder will be required to repair or restore any drains or
service lines damaged or disturbed during the construction of the building
sewer.
   (r)   Following construction of a building sewer, the property owner shall
own, maintain, repair or replace the building sewer from the building
foundation to the publicly owned sewer, as necessary.
   (s)   If the Authority receives a service call to investigate a sewage
backup on a property and performs services to clean a building sewer for which
the owner of such property is responsible, the Authority may charge the owner
for labor, material and equipment costs incurred. Such charges may be placed on
the owner's sewer service bill.
   (t)   Any applicant whose property does not abut an existing sanitary sewer
shall, at his or her own expense, construct trunk or lateral sewers as required
to connect to the Authority's sewerage system. Upon completion of the sewer
facility to the satisfaction of the Authority, the facilities within dedicated
rights of way shall become the property of the Authority and be subject to all
rules and regulations hereunder.
   (u)   In any area where no sanitary sewer facilities of any kind exist, an
applicant or person may contract with the Authority for the construction of
such facilities.
   (v)   The applicant shall be responsible for construction of all extended
sewer lines and appurtenances necessary to connect to the Authority's sewerage
system, whether those lines and appurtenances are within the jurisdiction of
the Authority or another governing body. The applicant shall bear all costs of
such construction, including meters, easements, engineering, shut-off valve,
and other associated costs. The materials and/or equipment used during
construction shall conform to the applicable ASTM specifications as directed by
the Authority. All sewers and equipment shall be inspected and approved by the
Authority after installation, but before covering with backfill.

frequency of discharge shall be available to the public or other governmental
agencies,  unless the discharger specifically requests and demonstrates, to the
satisfaction of the Authority, that the release of such information would
divulge information, processes or production information. When requested by the
discharger, the portions of a report which may disclose trade secrets or secret
processes shall not be made available to the public but shall be made
available, upon written request, to governmental agencies for uses relating to
these regulations, the NPDES permit, a State disposal system permit and/or
pretreatment programs, provided, however, that such portions of a report shall
be available for use by the State or any State agency in judicial review or
enforcement proceedings involving the discharger furnishing the report. Waste
constituents and characteristics will not be recognized as confidential
information. Information accepted by the Authority as confidential shall not be
transmitted to any governmental agency by the Authority until and unless a ten-
day notification is given to the discharger.

install pretreatment facilities must obtain a permit to install from the Ohio
EPA. Where preliminary treatment or flow equalization facilities are provided,
they shall be maintained in proper operation by the owner.
   (b)   All food establishments which maintain a kitchen or other facilities
for the preparation of food shall be required by the Authority to have a grease
interceptor of sufficient capacity, except that such interceptor shall not be
required for private residential dwellings.
   (c)   Other nonresidential users may be required by the Authority to install
grease, oil, sand and grit interceptors of sufficient capacity if, in the
opinion of the Authority, they are necessary to protect the sewerage system or
for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing such harmful substances.
   (d)   All interceptors shall be constructed of impervious materials capable
of withstanding abrupt and extreme changes in temperature. They shall be of
substantial construction, watertight and equipped with easily removable covers
which, when bolted in place, shall be gastight and watertight as approved by
the Authority. All interceptors shall be located so as to be readily accessible
for cleaning and inspection.
(Ord. 95-16. Passed 9-18-95.)
1042.17   PRETREATMENT COSTS.
   Any pretreatment facility or flow-equalizing facilities required by the
Authority shall be constructed, owned, maintained, repaired and replaced at the
cost of the owner. Prior to construction of such facilities, the owner shall
submit and receive the Authority's approval of detail design plans for the
facilities. Thereafter, such facilities shall be maintained continuously in
satisfactory operation at the cost of the owner.
(Ord. 95-16.  Passed 9-18-95.)
1042.18   PRETREATMENT REPORTING.
   (a)   Industrial dischargers regulated by the National Categorical
Pretreatment Standards shall submit a compliance report to the Authority during
the months of June and December, unless required more frequently in the
Standards or by the Authority. This report shall include the nature and
concentration of prohibited or regulated substances in the effluent. This
report shall also include a record of all measured or estimated average and
maximum daily flows. All analyses shall be performed by or for the discharger
in accordance with 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments. Where 40 CFR Part 136 does
not include an analytical technique for the pollutant in question, sampling and
analysis shall be performed in accordance with the EPA publication Sampling and
Analysis Procedures for Screening of Industrial Effluents for Priority
Pollutants and amendments thereto, or by any other procedures approved by the
U.S. EPA at the discretion of the Authority. In consideration of such factors
as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc., the Authority
may alter the months during which the reports are to be submitted.
   (b)   Any industrial discharger shall, if required by the Authority, submit
to the Authority a quarterly report indicating the nature and concentration of
all substances prohibited or regulated by this chapter, or by the National
Categorical Pretreatment Standards, that are contained in its discharge and the
average and maximum daily flows.
   (c)   All industrial users who discharge or propose to discharge wastewaters
to the wastewater treatment system shall maintain such records of production
and related factors, effluent flows and pollutants as are necessary to
demonstrate compliance with the requirements of any applicable State or Federal
pretreatment standards or requirements.
   (d)   Such records shall be made available upon request by the Authority.
All such records relating to compliance with pretreatment standards shall be
made available to officials of the U.S. EPA.
   (e)   All dischargers subject to this chapter shall retain, for no less than
three years, any records, documents, reports and correspondence, and any
summaries thereof, relating to monitoring, sampling and analysis made by or for
the discharger in connection with its discharge. All records which pertain to
matters subject to administrative adjustment or other enforcement or litigation
activities brought by the Authority pursuant hereto shall be retained by the
discharger until all enforcement activities have concluded and all periods of
limitation with respect to any appeals have expired.
   (f)   In the event that any substance or waste, the discharge of which is
prohibited by Section
1042.07(f), is discharged to the sewerage system, the person responsible for
the discharge shall notify the Authority immediately so that remedial action
can be taken. All costs to correct any damage resulting from the discharge
shall be charged to the person responsible for the discharge. Each such
discharge shall be considered separately and costs shall be levied accordingly.
Failure to report such discharge or to take corrective measures necessary to
prevent a subsequent noncomplying discharge, after being notified by the
Authority to do so and being given a reasonable time in which to take such
measures, shall result in the sewer through which the discharge enters the
public sewer being disconnected. Said sewer will not be reconnected until, in
the opinion of the Authority, proper corrective measures have been implemented.
(Ord. 95-16.  Passed 9-18-95.)
1042.19   PRETREATMENT MONITORING.
   (a)   Each nonresidential user may be required to construct and maintain one
or more control manholes, access points or measuring devices to facilitate
observation, measurement and sampling of the wastes, including domestic sewage.
   (b)   When required by the Authority, control manholes, access facilities or
any necessary meters shall be located and built in a manner acceptable to the
Authority. If measuring devices are to be permanently installed, they shall be
of a type acceptable to the Authority. Plans for the installation of the
control manholes or access facilities and related equipment shall be approved
by the Authority prior to the beginning of construction. The structures and
facilities shall be installed by the owner at his or her expense and maintained
by him or her so as to be safe and accessible at all times.
   (c)   All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters
and wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods and in accordance with
40 CFR Part 136, entitled Guidelines Establishing Test Procedures for Analysis
of Pollutants, and shall be determined at the control manhole provided or upon
suitable samples taken at such control manhole.
   (d)   Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewerage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb and property. The particular analysis
involved will determine whether a twenty-four hour composite of all outfalls of
a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids (SS) analyses are obtained
from twenty-four hour composites of all outfalls, whereas pHs are determined
from periodic grab samples.
   (e)   If necessary, the Authority shall have the right to enter and set up
on a nonresidential user's property such devices as are necessary to conduct a
gauging and sampling operation and the right to begin such operation without
advance notice to the owner. While performing such work, the Authority's
personnel will observe all safety rules applicable to the premises, as
established by the property owner.
(Ord. 95-16.  Passed 9-18-95.)
1042.20   ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGES.
   No statement contained in this section shall be construed as preventing any
special agreement or arrangement between the Authority and any industrial
concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be
accepted by the Authority for treatment, subject to payment therefor by the
industrial concern in proportion to cost and consistent with the user charge
system.
   (a)   Each user may be required to provide protection from accidental
discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes regulated herein. Facilities
to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and
maintained at the cost of the owner. Detailed plans showing the facilities and
operating procedures to provide such protection shall be submitted for review
by the Authority and shall be approved by the Authority before construction of
the facility. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall
not relieve the nonresidential user from the responsibility to modify the
facility as necessary to meet the requirements contained in this chapter.
   (b)   If, for any reason, a user does not comply with or will be unable to
comply with any prohibition or limitation contained herein, the user shall
immediately notify the Authority that corrective action may need to be taken to
protect the treatment plant. In addition, a written report addressed to the
Authority detailing the date, time and cause of the accidental discharge, the
quantity and characteristics of the discharge, and the corrective action taken
to prevent future discharges, shall to filed by the user within five days of
the occurrence of the noncomplying discharge.
(Ord. 95-16.  Passed 9-18-95.)
1042.21   REVOCATION OF PERMITS; SUSPENSION OF SERVICE.
   (a)   Whenever the Authority finds that any discharger has engaged in
conduct which justifies revocation of a discharge permit or suspension of
service, the Authority shall serve upon such discharger a written notice,
either personally or by certified mail, stating the nature of the violation.
Within ten days of receipt of the notice, the discharger shall respond
personally or in writing advising the Authority of its position with respect to
the allegations. The parties shall then meet to ascertain the veracity of the
allegations and, if necessary, establish a plan for correction thereof.
   (b)   Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) hereof, the Authority
may, for good cause, immediately suspend the treatment services of a discharger
when it appears that an actual or threatened discharge presents an imminent
danger to the public health and welfare, substantial danger to the environment,
or interference with operation of the wastewater treatment plant, or violates
any pretreatment limits proposed by this chapter or any discharge permit issued
pursuant to this chapter. Any discharger notified of the suspension of service
shall, within a reasonable period of time, as determined by the Authority,
cease all discharges. If the discharger fails to comply voluntarily with the
suspension order, the Authority shall disconnect service lines from the sewer
system and commence judicial proceedings to compel the discharger's compliance.
The Authority shall reinstate the discharger's service and terminate judicial
proceedings upon proof of the elimination of the noncomplying discharge
creating the threat of imminent or substantial danger, as set forth herein. The
discharger shall be responsible for all fees associated with disconnecting and
reconnecting service.
   (c)   The Authority may revoke the permit and/or disconnect the service of
any discharger who:
      (1)   Fails to factually report the constituents and characteristics of
its discharge in any required report;
      (2)   Fails to report significant changes in discharge constituents or
characteristics;
      (3)   Refuses reasonable access to its premises by representatives of the
Authority for inspection or monitoring; or
      (4)   Violates the conditions of its permit application or contract or
any provision of this chapter.
(Ord. 95-16.  Passed 9-18-95.)
USER CHARGE REGULATIONS
1042.22   DEFICIT PROHIBITED.
   As part of the annual review provided for in Section
1042.28, the Authority or other representative shall make an estimate of the
revenues and expenses for the next year. After deducting the estimated
operation and maintenance costs, the estimated debt service costs and the
repair and replacement reserve payment from the total estimated revenues and
net carryover from the previous year, the system shall maintain a positive
working capital.
(Ord. 95-16.  Passed 9-18-95.)
1042.23   USE OF REVENUE; FUNDS.
   The funds received from the collection of the rates and charges provided in
this chapter shall be deposited as received by the Authority into a separate
fund designated the New Carlisle General Sewerage System Fund. Disbursements
from the Fund may be made for operation and maintenance costs, debt service
costs and payments to the Sewer Repair and Replacement Fund, as well as for
enlargement of the collection, treatment and disposal capacity of the system.
The Finance Director of the Authority shall separately invest the funds of the
system and pay investment earnings to the New Carlisle General Sewerage System
Fund, the Sewer Repair and Replacement Fund or the Sewer Capacity Charge Fund.
(Ord. 95-16.  Passed 9-18-95.)
1042.24   FREE SERVICE PROHIBITED.
   Service will be provided to the users of the system in accordance with the
terms of this chapter. No user shall be provided service without payment of
sewer service charges in proportion to the service available to such user. No
person, including the Authority, shall subsidize the cost of operating,
maintaining or replacing any part of the sewerage system.
(Ord. 95-16.  Passed 9-18-95.)
1042.25   BASE USER CHARGES.
   (a)   Charges for wastewater services shall be determined in accordance with
the terms of this chapter and shall not be provided without charge to any
users. User charge rates will be proportionate to the sewerage system
operation, maintenance and replacement costs incurred, plus a charge to recover
the proportionate share of capital costs for sewage treatment plant and
collection system improvements. The sewer service charge shall consist of the
sum of the general administrative charges, the operation, maintenance and
replacement charges, the debt service charges and surcharges (if applicable).
   (b)   User charges shall first be determined on the basis of the equivalent
dwelling unit (EDU) method and then converted to the volume method for metered
areas. The EDU method is used for areas where water usage is not metered. In
this method, the monthly rate per EDU is multiplied by the number of EDU's
applicable for a particular establishment to arrive at the monthly sewer
service charge. New Carlisle has determined that 175 gallons per day is
representative of the average dwelling unit's water usage
   (c)   The volume method is used when metering is available for a particular
area. In this method, the monthly water usage, based on meter readings for the
past month and current month, is used to arrive at the monthly sewer service
charge. A specific rate is multiplied by each increment of 1,000 gallons of
water usage per month. Minimum charges have been established to ensure recovery
of administrative and debt service expenses.
   (d)   The base user charges for the New Carlisle sewerage system are
calculated as follows:
      (1)   Operation, maintenance and replacement charge (OM&R).
         A.   A proportionate rate for the operation, maintenance and
replacement of the sewerage system shall be charged to all users based on the
following formula:
            OM&R   =   A/EDU
            Where OM&R   =   Total operation, maintenance and replacement
charge for each EDU for a one-year period.
            A   =   Total annual operation, maintenance and replacement costs
for the sewerage system.
            EDU   =   Total number of equivalent dwelling units (EDU) of the
system.
         B.   The monthly operation, maintenance and replacement charge for
each EDU is then determined for areas without metered service as shown below:
            OM&R month    =    OM&R/12
            Where OM&R month    =   Total operation, maintenance and
replacement charge for each EDU for a one-month period.
         C.   For areas with metered service, the OM&Rmonth determined above is
then converted to a metered OM&R rate for water usage, as shown by the
following formula:
                        OM&Rmonth x 1,000
            OM&R rate   =   [175 gpd x 30.4 days/month average]
            Where OM&R rate   =    Operation, maintenance and replacement
charge rate for each 1,000 gallons of water usage.
      (2)   Debt service charge.
         A.   The proportionate rate for replacement of all capital costs
associated with the construction of sewerage system improvements shall be
charged to all users based upon the following formula:
            DSC   =   B/EDU
            Where DSC   =   Total amortized annual debt service charge to pay
for construction of sewerage system improvements for each EDU for a one-year
period.
            B   =   Total amortized annual debt service payments for
construction of the sewerage system improvements.
            EDU   =   Total number of equivalent dwelling units (EDU) of the
system.
         B.   The monthly debt service charge for each EDU is then determined
for areas without metered service, as shown below:
            DSC month    =   DSC/12
            Where DSC month   =    Total amortized debt service charge to pay
for construction of sewerage system improvements for each EDU for a one-month
period.
         C.   For areas with metered service, the DSCmonth determined above is
then converted to a metered DSC rate for water usage, as shown by the following
formula:
            DSC rate   =            DSCmonth x 1,000
                     [175 gpd x 30.4 days/month average]
            Where DSC rate = Amortized debt service charge rate for each 1,000
gallons of water usage.
(Ord. 95-16.  Passed 9-18-95.)
1042.26   SEWAGE SURCHARGES.
   (a)   Sewage or industrial wastes above normal domestic strength, but
acceptable for discharge into the sanitary sewerage system, shall be subject to
a surcharge. The surcharge shall be determined on the basis of any or all of
the listed constituents of water or wastes, as follows:
      (1)   Total suspended solids; and/or
      (2)   Five-day BOD at twenty degrees Centigrade and as herein provided.
   (b)   When any or all of the above listed constituents of a water or waste
accepted for admission to the system exceed the values of their constituents
for normal domestic sewage, the excess concentration in any or all, as the case
may be, shall be subject to a surcharge based on the cost per pound to remove
the excess quantity of each constituent, as indicated in Appendix A and
summarized below:
         SSR BOD SSR ss or SSR p = C x D
         Where SSR = Sewage surcharge rate
         C = Pounds of BOD or SS in excess of that of normal domestic sewage.
         D = Current cost per pound to treat normal BOD or SS loads.
   (c)   In addition to the surcharge, the user will pay the user charges as
defined in other sections of this chapter.
   (d)   The pounds of BOD per day and/or pounds of suspended solids per day,
above the concentrations previously described for normal strength sewage, that
are discharged to the sewerage system, shall be determined by the Authority or
an authorized representative thereof.
   (e)   In addition to a surcharge on BOD and suspended solids, the Authority
shall have the right to surcharge any user for the discharge of any pollutant
into the sewerage system or for any other reason deemed necessary and
appropriate, such as excessively high rates of discharge.
   (f)   An annual industrial wastewater surveillance charge shall be paid by
the discharger for each connection discharging industrial wastewaters to the
sanitary sewer system. Where it has been reported that no industrial
wastewaters are being discharged, this fee may be reduced to cover the cost of
verifying said report. The monies collected from this charge shall be used to
cover the cost of making surveys, record keeping and occasional analytical work
necessary for verification of owner-reported results.
(Ord. 95-16. Passed 9-18-95.)
1042.27   DETERMINATION OF CHARGES.
   (a)   The monthly sewer service charge for each user shall be calculated by
the EDU method or the volume method. For areas where water usage is not
metered, the EDU method is used to determine the applicable charges. The
monthly sewer service charge for each unmetered user shall be calculated by
multiplying the sum of the currently adopted operation, maintenance and
replacement charge (0M&R and month) the debt service charge (DSCmonth),
determined under Section
1042.25, by the number of EDU's assigned to the user in accordance with the
user categories and EDU criteria. (See Appendix B.)
      For unmetered service areas, the monthly sewer service charge is
determined by the following formula:
      Monthly sewer service charge = SUM x EDU
      Where SUM = Sum of all operation, maintenance and replacement charges and
debt service charges on a monthly basis.
      EDU = Total number of equivalent dwelling units assigned to the user.
   (b)   If water usage in a particular area is metered, the monthly sewer
service charge shall be determined by multiplying the sum of the currently
adopted operation, maintenance and replacement charge rate (0M&Rrate) and the
debt service charge rate (DSCrate), determined under Section
1042.25, by the monthly water usage, based on meter readings for the past month
and current month. A specific rate is multiplied by each increment of 1,000
gallons of water usage in a month. Minimum charges based on meter size are also
determined when metering is available.
      For metered service areas, the monthly sewer service charge is determined
by the following formula:
         Monthly sewer service charge = SUM rates    x    Total water usage in
gallons
                                 1,000 gal.
         Where SUM   Sum of operation, maintenance and replacement charges and
debt rates = service charge rates, per 1,000 gallons.
   (c)   The annual industrial wastewater surveillance charge shall be two
hundred dollars ($200.00). As stated in Section
1042.26(f) hereof, this charge may be reduced if satisfactory proof that
industrial wastewater is not being discharged is obtained.
(Ord. 95-16. Passed 9-18-95.)
1042.28   ANNUAL REVIEW OF USER CHARGES.
   (a)   Pursuant to U.S. EPA regulations, the user charges shall be reviewed
annually to accomplish the following purposes:
      (1)   To maintain the proportionate distribution of operation,
maintenance and replacement costs among users and user classes; and
      (2)   To generate sufficient revenue to pay the total operation,
maintenance,  replacement, capital and working capital costs of the sewerage
system.
   (b)   The annual review of the user charges shall be conducted by the
Authority or by a consulting engineer. A written report shall be prepared and
submitted to Council on or before July 1 of each year. The report shall
summarize actual operations for the calendar year just ended and, based upon at
least a two-year projection (the current year and the next year), shall
recommend a rate increase or decrease effective January 1 of the next year. At
the time recommended in the report, the Authority shall, by appropriate
legislation, set the schedule of rates and charges for the users of the system.
   (c)   In addition to the authority of the City Council to increase or
decrease rates on January 1 of each year, the Authority may, at any time,
increase or decrease rates if the Authority determines that a modification of
the rates is required in order to comply with this chapter or any revenue bond
resolution, or to adjust rates to reflect final costs.
   (d)   Following the annual review, the Authority shall promptly notify each
user, in conjunction with a regular bill, of the rate adjustments, if any, and
of that portion of the sewer service charge over the past year which is
attributable to operation, maintenance and replacement costs of the system and
that portion which is related to debt service.

1042.29   BILLING PROCEDURES.
   (a)   The sewer service charges established by this chapter shall be billed
after the service is rendered.
   (b)   The debt service charge shall be included with the sewer service
charge bill. The billing frequency shall be on a monthly basis.
   (c)   Effective September 18, 2003, all dwellings connected to the City
sanitary sewer system only must maintain the sewer account in the property
owner's name.
   (d)   Any property connected to the sewerage system after the beginning of a
month shall be charged a per diem pro-rated amount based upon the applicable
monthly charge.
(Ord. 95-16.  Passed 9-18-95; Ord. 03-23.  Passed 9-2-03; Ord. 13-07.  Passed
2-19-13.)
1042.30   CHANGES OF ADDRESS OR OWNERSHIP.
   (a)   Upon change of his or her mailing address, the owner of a property
served by the sewerage system shall inform the Authority of the change. Failure
to inform the Authority of a change of address shall not excuse an owner from
any payment penalties incurred because of the failure to report an address
change.
   (b)   Prior to the sale of a property, the present owner shall contact the
Authority to arrange for proration of the final bill. The final bill shall be
sent to the mailing address specified by the present owner. Failure of a
previous owner to comply with this provision shall not excuse the new owner
from responsibility for any and all delinquencies certified pursuant to the
Ohio Revised Code, or for any current charges or for penalties remaining unpaid
by the previous owner.
   (c)   Prior to the sale of a property, the purchaser shall contact the
Authority to arrange for a proration of the first bill and to inform the
Authority of the mailing address of the new owner. Failure to comply with this
provision shall not excuse the new owner from responsibility for any and all
delinquencies certified pursuant to the Ohio Revised Code or for any current
charges or for penalties remaining unpaid by the previous owner.
(Ord. 95-16.  Passed 9-18-95; Ord. 13-07.  Passed 2-19-13.)
1042.31   PAYMENT OF BILLS.
   (a)   Due Dates for Bills. Sewer bills are due upon receipt. Bills not paid
on or before the fifteenth of the billing month are subject to a 10% penalty
charge. Sewer bills not paid in full by the last day of the billing month may
cause the service to be shut off without further notice, unless provisions for
payment have been made with the Department. Such provision will be limited to
three times during a calendar year per customer. If there is a default on the
payment arrangement, future arrangements may be revoked. However, when the last
day of the billing month falls on a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, the last
billing day shall be the next regular working day.
   (b)   Delivery of Bills. The Authority will undertake to deliver bills for
sewer by depositing the same in the Post Office only as a matter of convenience
to the owner or consumer. The failure of a person to receive a bill shall not
relieve him or her from his or her obligations to pay the bill. In utilizing
the U.S. Postal Service for delivery of their payment of a sewer service
charge, users assume responsibility for any failure of the U.S. Postal Service
to deliver the payment to the Authority. Accordingly, the authority shall not
waive payment penalties for any person claiming the U.S. Postal Service failed
to deliver a bill or payment. If the user elects for paperless billing, the
user shall receive no paper bill but is still responsible for the payment of
services rendered on the appropriate due date.
   (c)   Unpaid Bills.  When the payment for sewer has not been made, the City
may enter on said premises and cause the sewer service to be disconnected and
discontinued. The owner will be responsible for fees associated with
disconnecting and reconnecting sanitary sewer service. In the event that the
City has to disconnect service and a shut-off valve is not in place, the City
will be installing a shut-off valve, where feasible. If the property has a
shut-off valve, the reconnect fee will be fifty dollars ($50.00). The sewer
will not be turned on until the fees, sewer bill, plus penalty have been paid.
   (d)   Service Fee for Outside Normal Business Hours. Any requests for turn-
on and turn-offs outside normal business hours will be charged an additional
one hundred dollars ($100.00) per turn-on and/or turn-off. The Director of
Public Service or the City Manager will be the only people permitted to
determine if a fee will be waived for an emergency shut-off.
   (e)   Insufficient Funds. If a bank should return a check from a user for
insufficient funds, that user's account will be subject to an insufficient
funds charge, established by the Authority. Upon the claim of a person that the
return of a check for insufficient funds was a bank error, the Authority may
waive an insufficient funds charge if the bank supplies adequate documentation
of its error. If a person has two checks returned for insufficient funds, the
Authority may require all future payments to be made in cash or by money order.
If the users elect to pay their water bill on line and the credit card used is
declined, the user is still responsible for making the payment to avoid
disconnection for non-payment. In the instance where the user’s credit card was
utilized without their permission to make the online water payment, the user is
still responsible for payment on the water bill to avoid disconnection.
   (f)   Advance Payments.  Users may elect to pay charges in advance at any
time; any remaining credit will be reflected on monthly bills. The amount paid
in advance shall not exceed three hundred dollars ($300.00). Any refund
requests must be approved by the City Manager.
   (g)   Fees for Online Utility Payments. There will be a fee to use a credit
card online to make utility payments. The fee shall be one dollar and ninety-
five cents ($1.95) per one hundred dollar ($100.00) increments.

1042.32   DELINQUENCIES.
   Any unpaid billings, together with accrued penalties, shall be certified to
the County Auditor, pursuant to the Ohio Revised Code, who shall place such
delinquencies upon the real property tax duplicate for the property receiving
the sewage service. Such delinquencies shall be a lien upon the property from
the date the delinquency is placed upon the real property tax duplicate, and
shall be collected in the same manner as other real estate taxes, including a
foreclosure action on said lien.
(Ord. 95-16.  Passed 9-18-95.)
1042.33   ADDITIONAL CHARGES FOR TREATING UNUSUAL WASTES.
   The Authority may, in special cases, establish additional charges for wastes
of unusual strength or composition which are accepted for treatment.
(Ord. 95-16.  Passed 9-18-95.)
1042.34   NON-HABITABLE BUILDINGS; DISCONNECTION; RECONNECTION.
   (a)   A user who certifies that his or her building is not habitable may
request the Authority to disconnect a building from the sewerage system. Upon
such request, the Authority shall remove or close the sewer connections and/or
remove any publicly owned equipment.
   (b)   Thereafter, the owner of the premises shall not allow the building to
be utilized for human occupancy as a residence or place of employment and the
Authority shall not bill for sewer service.
   (c)   A violation of subsection (b) hereof will subject the owner to the
mandatory connection provisions of this chapter and Ohio law.
   (d)   A person or subsequent owner of a property disconnected who
disconnects from the sewerage system may later request to be reconnected. Upon
approval by the Authority, the Authority shall re-open sewer connections and/or
replace publicly owned equipment.
   (e)   The charge for disconnection or reconnection shall be paid to the

1048.01  BACKFLOW PROTECTION.
   If in the judgment of the Director of Public Service, or his/her designee,
the integrity of the public water system is, or can be, endangered by backflow
from an actual or a potential cross-connection within the plumbing system of a
water consumer, the Director may order the installation of an approved backflow
prevention method or device consisting of either an air-gap, vacuum breaker,
reduced pressure principle backflow preventer or any combination thereof at the
water service connection to the premise. The water consumer shall install the
designated device or method at his or her own expense, and failure, refusal or
inability to install such device or method immediately shall constitute a
ground for discontinuing water service to the premises until such device or
method has been installed and approved by the Director. The use of the approved
backflow preventer at the water service connection does not in any way affect
or eliminate the need for individual fixture devices or air-gaps as required by
the laws of the State of Ohio. Any and all decisions made by the Director of
Public Service regarding backflow protection will be based entirely on rules
from the Ohio EPA, the Clark County Combined Health District and all applicable
laws.

   This Title Four of Part Twelve of these Codified Ordinances shall be known
and may be cited as “The Subdivision Regulations of the City of New Carlisle,
Ohio” or just the “Subdivision Regulations.”
(Ord. 83-32. Passed 8-15-83.)
1220.02   PURPOSE.
   These Subdivision Regulations are adopted to provide an efficient urban
development pattern by allocating sufficient and convenient open areas for
traffic, utilities, recreation, light, air and the avoidance of population
congestion. (Ord. 83-32. Passed 8-15-83.)
1220.03   AUTHORITY OF PLANNING BOARD.
   The Planning Board may adopt rules and regulations governing plats and
subdivisions of land within its jurisdiction by virtue of Ohio R.C. 711.09 and

the original parcel is not reduced below the requirements of the Zoning Code or
these Subdivision Regulations and a new building site is not created as defined
by such requirements.
(Ord. 83-32. Passed 8-15-83.)
1220.05   SCOPE.

(Ord. 83-32. Passed 8-15-83.)
1220.06   INTERPRETATION; CONFLICTS OF LAW.

other lawfully adopted regulations, the more restrictive rule or higher
standard shall prevail.
(Ord. 83-32. Passed 8-15-83.)
1220.07   VARIANCES.
   A variance may be granted from these Subdivision Regulations by the Planning
Board if a subdivider can show that a provision of these Subdivision
Regulations would cause unnecessary hardship if strictly adhered to and when,
in the opinion of the Board of Appeals, because of unusual topographic or other
conditions peculiar to the site, a variation may be allowed without conflicting
with the general purpose and intent of such provision. To secure a variance,
the subdivider shall apply in writing to the Board of Appeals, stating the
reason for which the departure from the Regulations is justified, and submit
the same with the preliminary plan or as soon as possible after preliminary
submission. Action by the Board on such a request shall be taken as part of
general action on the preliminary plan. The Board of Appeals, in granting
variances, may require such conditions as shall be required to adhere to the
intent of these Regulations. Variances involving street or utility improvements
must be approved by the Department of Public Service and Council. The County
Engineer and the County Commissioners shall also approve improvement variances
when the proposed subdivision is located outside the City.

1220.08   NOTICE, HEARING, APPROVAL AND CERTIFICATION REQUIRED.
   These Subdivision Regulations are effective after the necessary notice and
public hearing as required by the Municipal Charter, adoption by the Planning
Board and Council and certification to the Recorders of Clark and Miami
Counties. (Ord. 83-32. Passed 8-15-83.)

(Ord. 83-32. Passed 8-15-83.)

   The invalidation of any part of these Subdivision Regulations by a court of
competent jurisdiction shall not affect the validity of the remainder of these
Subdivision Regulations, either in whole or in part.
(Ord. 83-32. Passed 8-15-83.)
1220.11   CONFORMITY WITH ZONING CODE.

   Results of percolation tests located in the three-mile jurisdictional area
shall be submitted directly to the County Board of Health. A minimum of two
holes per acre are required along with any other such test as may be required
by the Board of Health.
   Examples of the application and percolation test required in this section
are set forth in Appendix C. Covenants required under this subsection shall be
as set forth in Section
1224.06.
   Unless determined otherwise by the County Engineer and Municipal Engineer,
the Municipal Engineer shall review preliminary drainage plans within the
three-mile jurisdictional area after consulting with the County Engineer.
   Drainage plans shall include watershed areas and computations of run-off
volume.
   (b)   Action Prior to Approval.
      (1)   Submission of materials.
   The subdivider shall submit the required number of copies of the preliminary
plat, together with the other necessary items set forth in subsection (a)
hereof, to the planning staff not later than twenty working days prior to the
Planning Board meeting. The subdivider should prepare sketch plans first and
discuss them with the staff before the preliminary plat and improvement plans
are prepared for official review and approval. In this way, the submission of
inadequate plats can be avoided.
      (2)   Notice of public hearing. Not less than seven days prior to the
Planning Board meeting, a notice of public hearing shall be sent to the
newspapers of general circulation in the Municipality. A notice to the
surrounding property owners shall also be sent at this time. The hearing shall
occur at the same time and place as the Planning Board meeting.
      (3)   Referring plat copies to officials. Within one working day after
receiving the preliminary plat and accompanying items, the planning staff shall
refer one copy of the plat to the following officials:
         A.   The Department of Public Service for review of improvement plans;
and
         B.   The local school district, where involved, for report on school
site requirements.
      (4)   Conclusions of officials.  Within seven working days after
receiving the plat, each official listed in paragraph (b)(3) hereof shall
prepare and present information concerning his or her conclusions on the plat.
The plat will be considered acceptable by the officials involved if their
replies are not received by the planning staff in the prescribed time.
      (5)   Preparation of report. The staff shall prepare the report on the
plat, which will be mailed to the members of the Planning Board on the Friday
preceding the scheduled hearing.
      (6)   Policy. In case a plat is submitted without favorable reports as
set forth in paragraph (b)(4) hereof, the policy of the Planning Board shall be
to deny the plat or table it until such favorable reports are received, or to
give the plat “approval in principle” where it is clear that the problems
involved can be resolved. Such “approval in principle” shall not be given
unless the subdivider clearly expresses his or her willingness to solve such
problems in the following manner, as may be necessary:
         1.   By major changes in the proposed layout of streets and lots, to
serve the needs of traffic, drainage and sewage disposal;
         2.   By setting aside adequate site appropriation for public school or
recreational use as contemplated and at locations to be determined; or
         3.   By installing the types of drainage, sanitary sewer and water
supply facilities the Planning Board deems necessary.
   Such “approval in principle” will give the subdivider reasonable assurance
that, after the specified problems have been resolved, the plat will be
considered favorably. It shall not be construed as approval of the general
layout, as submitted, or of the proposed improvements.
   (c)   Additional Copies Required. After the preliminary map is approved, the
owner or developer shall submit seventeen prints of the corrected preliminary
plan.
   (d)   Time Limit for Map Approval. A preliminary map shall be submitted for
examination or reapproval if the time limit between the approval of the
preliminary map and the final map of the entire tract exceeds five years.

require, as a condition of extending water and sanitary sewer lines, that the
owner submit to the County Commissioners a request for annexation. (Ord. 83-32.
Passed 8-15-83.)
1224.03   REQUIREMENTS AFTER RECORDING PLAT.
   Within twenty days after the plat is recorded, the developer shall furnish

1224.06   SUGGESTED RESTRICTIONS.
   (a)   Intent. The provisions of this section are suggested to assist the

benefit of both the developer and lot owners.
   (b)   Regular Covenants.
      (1)   All lots in the subdivision shall be for residential purposes only.
No building shall be erected, altered, placed or permitted to remain on any
such lot other than one detached single-family dwelling, not exceeding two
stories in height, and a private garage or carport.
      (2)   The ground floor area of a single-story structure shall be not less

which is four feet or less below normal ground level) shall have a minimum of
1, 000 square feet of living area on the upper level. The living areas referred
to in this paragraph do not include attached or detached garages, basements,
open or enclosed porches, steps, patios or other appurtenances.
      (3)   No building shall be located on a lot nearer to the front lot line
or the side street line than the minimum building set-back line shown on the

in which the subdivision is located. Side and rear yards shall also conform to
the applicable zoning districts.
      (4)   No structure of a temporary character, trailer, basement, tent,
shack or garage or other outbuilding shall be used on any lot at any time as a
residence, either temporarily or permanently.
      (5)   No noxious or offensive trade shall be carried on upon a lot, nor
shall anything be done thereon which may be or become an annoyance or a
nuisance to the neighborhood.
      (6)   No animal, livestock or poultry of any kind shall be raised, bred
or kept on a lot, except that dogs, cats or other household pets may be kept,
provided that they are not kept, bred or maintained for a commercial purpose.
      (7)   No sign of any kind shall be displayed to the public view on a lot,

seventy-five feet from the intersection of the street centerlines extended.
Such sight line limitations shall apply to a lot within ten feet of the
intersection of a street property line with the edge of a driveway or alley
pavement. No tree shall be permitted to remain within such distance or
intersection unless the foliage is maintained at sufficient height to prevent
obstruction of such sight lines. No tree or live planting more than six inches
in height shall be planted between the curb and the sidewalk.
      (11)   The covenants and restrictions set forth in this subsection are
for the benefit of all lot owners, are to run with the land and shall be
binding on all parties and persons under them until January 1, 1981, at which

shall remain in full force and effect.
   (c)   Restrictions for Special Conditions.
      (1)   Private sewage disposal systems. Until such time as a sanitary
sewer has been constructed to serve the subdivision, a sewage disposal system
constructed in accordance with the requirements of the County Health Department
shall be installed to serve each dwelling. The effluent from septic tanks shall
not be permitted to discharge into a stream, storm sewer, open ditch or drain.
      (2)   Private water supply systems. Until such time as a public water
supply is available, water shall come from individual wells drilled for each
dwelling erected in the area in accordance with the requirements of the County
Health Department.
      (3)   Percolation test forms for unsewered areas. The form for
percolation tests contained in Appendix C, in duplicate, together with
accompanying topographic maps and preliminary plats showing test hole
locations, shall be submitted to the County Health Department. One complete set
shall then be forwarded with comments from the Health Department, to the
planning staff ten working days in advance of a regularly scheduled meeting of
the Planning Board.
      (4)   Subdivider's agreement. Upon the receipt of approval of the final
plat, but prior to the approval's taking effect, the subdivider shall have
prepared, on a form approved by the Law Director, a contract to agree to the
construction of all required improvements in the subdivision, in accordance
with these Subdivision Regulations. The sub-divider's agreement shall be in
accordance with all of the legal requirements of the Municipality and shall
contain the guarantee of the subdivider to the posting of both performance and
maintenance bonds to cover the costs of all required improvements included in
the subdivision development. The subdivider shall execute the sub-divider's
agreement with Council. Upon such execution, the approval of the final plat
shall become effective.
      (5)   Performance bond or letter of credit. Upon the formal approval of
the final plat and the execution of the subdivider's agreement, the subdivider
shall post a performance bond or letter of credit in the amount of 100 percent
of the total estimated cost of the construction of the required improvements,
as specified in these Subdivision Regulations, in order to guarantee their
proper installation. The Director of Public Service shall determine that the
estimated costs adequately reflect the costs of the required improvements as
well as the time period that is likely to be required to construct all
improvements, and shall approve and certify in writing to the Commission the
arrangements of the subdivider prior to the posting of the bond or letter of
credit. The Municipality reserves the right to reject any such bond or letter
of credit which the Director has determined to be unacceptable to construct the
required improvements in the event of the default of the subdivider. The bond
or letter of credit shall not extend for more than two years unless mutually
extended by the subdivider and the Municipality.
   The bond or letter of credit shall be made payable to and enforceable by the
Municipality and shall provide that the subdivider, his or her heirs,
successors and assigns and agents or servants thereof will comply with all
applicable provisions of these Subdivision Regulations.
   Upon the execution of the bond or letter of credit, the approval of the
final plat shall become effective.
      (6)   Maintenance bond. Upon the completion of the required improvements,
and the approval and certification in writing of the Director of Public Service
that such improvements have been constructed and completed in a satisfactory
manner, the subdivider shall post a maintenance bond in the amount of ten
percent of the actual construction costs of the improvements. The dollar amount
of the maintenance bond shall be reviewed and approved in writing by the
Director prior to the actual posting of the bond, in order to ensure that it is
an accurate reflection of the improvement costs.
   No improvement shall be accepted by Council until the subdivider has posted
an approved maintenance bond which shall extend for one year from the date of
acceptance by the Municipality in the case of an improvement within a public
right-of-way or the public water or sanitary sewer system.
(Ord. 83-32. Passed 8-15-83.)
1224.07   COMPLETION OF SUBDIVISIONS.
   (a)   Completion of Improvements; Approval and Certification. Upon
satisfactory completion of the improvements and the approval and certification
in writing of the Director of Public Service that the improvements have been
properly installed, along with the presentation of letters of certification of
payment in full of all contractors, subcontractors, suppliers of materials,
consulting engineers, surveyors and all related inspection fees or other
similar fees incurred by the subdivider, the performance bond provided for in
Section
1224.06(c)(5) may be released. Authorization of the release shall be obtained
in writing from the Clerk of Council.
   (b)   Partial Completion of Improvements. Upon satisfactory completion of
specific individual improvements which comprise a part of the total
improvements to be constructed in the subdivision, and the approval and
certification in writing of the Director that such improvements have been
properly installed, along with the presentation of related letters of
certification of payment, in full, of the involved contractors, subcontractors,
suppliers of materials, consulting engineers, surveyors and all related
inspection fees or other similar fees incurred by the subdivider, a reduction
in the performance bond may be authorized. However, such reduction shall not
reduce the balance of the bond below the re-estimated construction costs
necessary to complete the remaining required improvements. Authorization of the
reduction shall be obtained in writing from the Clerk.
   (c)   Progressive Installation. The subdivider may apply for approval and
acceptance by the Municipality and the recording of a completed portion of a
subdivision. Under a progressive unit development procedure, a sale or lease of
lots within the completed portion of the subdivision may proceed only on that
portion which has been approved, accepted by the Municipality and recorded in
the office of the County Recorder.
   (d)   Failure to Satisfactorily Complete Required Improvements. The
subdivider shall be in default of his or her subdivision agreement with the
Municipality when one of the following conditions exists:
      (1)   The subdivider has failed to satisfactorily complete the
installation of the required improvements as specified in the final plat and
these Subdivision Regulations, in accordance with the terms and conditions of
the subdivider's agreement with the Municipality and has failed to establish
with the Planning Board reasonable cause for such failure and thereby qualify
for and receive an extension of the subdivider's agreement.
      (2)   The subdivider has failed to construct and/or install the required
improvements in accordance with the minimum standards specified in these
Subdivision Regulations and is unwilling to modify, upgrade and reconstruct
such improvements to conform with the requirements within six months.
      (3)   The improvements constructed and installed in the subdivision have
not held up, have deteriorated or are not functioning properly during the year
immediately following their acceptance by the Municipality due to the manner in
which they were constructed and installed, or the required improvements are not
in accordance with the “as-built” plans submitted to the Municipality by the
subdivider, and the subdivider has failed to correct the deficiencies upon the
request and instruction of the Municipality.

   (a)   The Secretary of the Planning Board and the Commission shall notify
the subdivider, by mail, of the final action of the Board and Commission, when
involved, within ten working days of the action. The subdivider shall record
the plat in the office of the County Recorder within 180 days after the date of
the last approval unless the Board agrees to an extension. Within the three-
mile jurisdictional limit, both the Board and the Commission must agree to an
extension. If the plat is not recorded within the time limit, the plan shall be
considered void. Within twenty days after the plat is recorded, the subdivider
shall furnish prints and either a sepia, a photolith or the original
reproducible linen of the plat to the planning staff. The number of prints
needed shall be as set forth by Council.
   (b)   No lot or parcel of land shall be sold, bartered or in any other way
transferred from the subdivision prior to the recording of the plat as required
in subsection (a) hereof. In the event that any lot or parcel may unlawfully be
transferred, the Municipality may bring suit against the subdivider in a court
of competent jurisdiction for a sum of between one hundred dollars ($100.00)
and five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each lot transferred. Any funds
recovered pursuant to such civil action shall be transferred only for purposes
permitted under State law.
(Ord. 83-32. Passed 8-15-83.)
1228.10   DEDICATION OF PARK LAND; FEE IN LIEU OF DEDICATION.
   (a)   Amount of Land to be Dedicated. The amount of park land required to be
dedicated by a subdivider or developer pursuant to this chapter shall be based
upon the projected population density for the area in question and the minimum
park standard factor of eight acres per 1,000 persons. The actual amount of
land to be dedicated shall be determined by the following formula:
 
Amount of   Total Number  of dwelling   Number of       .008 gross  acres per
dedicated = units                      x Persons per   x person
park land                                dwelling unit
 
   For purposes of computation, an average of 3.25 persons per dwelling shall
be utilized for single-family dwellings and an average of 2.25 persons per
dwelling unit shall be utilized for two-family and multifamily dwellings.
   If the types of dwelling units are interspersed throughout a given
development (e.g. a planned unit development), the formula will have to be
utilized for each different type of dwelling unit, and the amount of land to be
dedicated will be the sum of all the calculations.
   (b)   Amount of Fee in Lieu of Dedication. Where a fee is required to be
paid in lieu of the land dedication, the amount of such fee to be paid by a
subdivider or developer pursuant to this chapter shall be based upon the fair
market value of the amount of land which would be required to be dedicated,
pursuant to and calculated in accordance with the following formula:
 
Fee in lieu of land = Amount of dedicated land x Fair market value of land per
dedication                                       acre
 
   (c)   Determination of Land Value for Fee. For the purpose of computing the
fee-in- lieu payment, it is necessary to determine the value of the land
involved in the subdivision, development or lot split. In all such cases, the
value of the land shall represent the full and fair market value, determined as
follows, but in no event shall the fair market value of land exceed ten
thousand dollars ($10,000) per acre.
      (1)   Time. Fair market value shall be determined as of the filing of the
final plat map.
      (2)   Basis. The representative cash value of the land to be dedicated
shall be determined on the basis of the full and fair market value of the raw
land. As used in this subsection, “raw land” means land which has not been
developed or improved by the installation or construction of streets, roads,
curbs, gutters, sidewalks, storm sewers, sanitary sewers, water lines or
similar improvements. The value of raw land shall be determined by averaging
the value of all the acreage in the subdivision, development or lot split, and
deducting therefrom the current fair market value of existing improvements
thereon.
      (3)   Method. Fair market value shall be determined by negotiation. If
the fair market value of the land in question cannot be negotiated
satisfactorily by the Municipality and the subdivider or developer, then an
appraisal board shall be appointed to determine the fair market value. Such
board shall consist of three qualified real estate appraisers: one selected by
the Municipality at its own expense; one selected by the property owner at his
or her own expense; and one selected through mutual agreement by the other two
appraisers and paid jointly and equally by the Municipality and the property
owner. The decision of such board shall be final.
   (d)   Choice of Dedication or Fee.
      (1)   Generally. The responsibility for determining whether a subdivider
or developer is to dedicate park land, pay a fee in lieu of such dedication or
provide a combination of such dedication and payment rests with Council.
      Although the basic objective of this section is to require the dedication
of park land, situations may often arise where such a dedication would be
neither compatible with the Parks and Recreation Plan nor in the best interest
of the neighborhood involved. This is especially the case in small subdivisions
or developments where the dedicated parcels of land might be too small to
effectively use and too expensive to maintain.
      (2)   Procedure. The procedure for determining whether the subdivider or
developer is to dedicate land, pay a fee or both, is as follows:
         A.   Responsibility of subdivider. At the time of filing a preliminary
plat map for approval, the owner of the property shall, as a part of such
filing, indicate whether he or she wishes to dedicate property for park and
recreational purposes, to pay a fee in lieu thereof or to meet the requirements
through a combination of the two. If he or she wishes or is required to
dedicate land for this purpose, he or she shall designate the area thereon on
the preliminary plat map as submitted.
         B.   Responsibility of developer. At the time of applying for a
building permit, and in the event the land dedication would be two acres or
more, the owner of the property shall, as a part of such application, indicate
whether he or she wishes to dedicate property for park and recreational
purposes, to pay a fee in lieu thereof or to meet the requirements through a
combination of the two. If he or she wishes to dedicate land for this purpose,
or if the required land dedication would be two acres or more, then he or she
shall prepare a map of the proposed development and designate the area therein.
      Where the development is of such a size that the land dedication would be
less than two acres, then only the payment of a fee in lieu shall be required
and no review by the Planning Board or approval by Council, as provided for in
this section, is required. However, this shall not preclude the developer and
the Municipality from agreeing to the dedication of land or a combination of
land dedication and fee payment.
         C.   Action by Planning Board. All preliminary and final plat maps,
except those of a totally nonresidential nature, shall be submitted to the
Planning Board and Council. The Planning Board shall encourage every subdivider
to submit one preliminary plat map of his or her entire proposed subdivision,
rather than several preliminary plat maps or smaller tract areas, so that
recommendations for the proposed park sites may be properly considered and
developed. Furthermore, the Board shall encourage subdividers to work together
in cooperative effort, since situations may develop where it would be more
advisable to have a single park serving several contiguous subdivisions than
several smaller separate parks. If a developer wishes to dedicate land and/or
if the required land dedication would be two acres or more, then a map of the
proposed development shall be submitted to the Board for its recommendations.
         D.   Action by Council. Council, after it has received the comments
and recommendations of the Board, and at the time of the preliminary plat map
approval, shall determine as a part of such approval whether to require a
dedication of land within the subdivision, the payment of a fee in lieu thereof
or a combination of the two. Council, at the time of final plat map approval,
shall again review the comments and recommendations of the Board, shall
determine whether the final plat map has been prepared in accordance with the
agreements reached and guidelines established at the time of the preliminary
plat map approval and shall confirm that the provisions of this section are
satisfied prior to the approval and recording of the final plat map.
         Council, in a case involving a development where the potential land
dedication would be two acres or more, or in a case involving a development
where the developer is proposing a land dedication of less than two acres,
shall determine, after it has received a copy of the proposed development map
and the recommendations of the Board, whether to require a dedication of land
within the development, the payment of a fee in lieu thereof or a combination
of the two. These conditions shall be made prior to the approval and issuance
of any building permit for the development.
         Council may also take such action as it deems appropriate which is at
variance with a recommendation of the Planning Board, provided such action is
approved by at least five votes of the members of Council.
      (3)   Determination. Whether Council accepts the land dedication or
elects to require payment of a fee in lieu thereof or a combination of the two
shall be determined after consideration of the following:
         A.   Compatibility with the principles and standards of the Land Use
Plan;
         B.   Topography, geology, access and location of land in the
subdivision or development available for dedication; and
         C.   Size and shape of the subdivision or development and land
available for dedication.
      The determination by Council, as to a dedication, a fee or a combination
of both, shall be final and conclusive.
   (e)   Suitability of Land. Any land to be dedicated under this section shall
be reasonably adaptable for use for active park and recreation purposes and
shall be at a location convenient to the people to be served. Factors used in
evaluating the adequacy of proposed park and recreation areas shall include,
but not be limited to, the following:
      (1)   Unity. The dedicated land shall form a single parcel of land,
except where Council determines that two parcels or more would be in the best
public interest.
      (2)   Shape. The shape of the dedicated parcel of land shall be
sufficiently geometric to be usable for softball, tennis, football and other
recreational pursuits.
      (3)   Location. The dedicated land shall be located so as to serve the
recreation and open space needs of the subdivision for which the dedication was
made. The recreation land in a subdivision must be located so as to be
reasonably accessible from all lots in the subdivision.
      (4)   Access. Public access to the dedicated land shall be provided
preferably by adjoining street frontage, but also possibly by a public easement
to the dedicated parcel. Such easement shall be sufficiently wide so that
maintenance equipment has reasonably convenient access to the land.
      (5)   Usability. The dedicated land shall be usable for recreational
activities. As a general rule, steep slopes, streams, lakes, watercourses and
flood plains may be considered for only up to forty percent of the recreational
land requirement, and a minimum of sixty percent of the recreational land
requirement shall be suitable for dry ground recreational use. In this latter
regard, fifty percent of the dry ground recreation area shall not exceed three
percent grade, and the remaining dry ground recreation area shall not exceed
five percent grade. However, where Council determines that the recreational
needs are already being adequately met, either by other dedicated parcels of
land or existing recreational facilities, then land that is not usable for
recreation activities may be dedicated as open space.
      (6)   Plans. The Land Use Plan, the Official Thoroughfare Plan and the
Housing Element shall be taken into consideration when evaluating land
proposals for dedication.
   (f)   Preservation of Land.
      (1)   Natural features of scenic beauty, such as trees, plant life,
brooks and other watercourses, topography, historic spots, views and similar
conditions which, if preserved, will add attractiveness and value, shall be
considered and preserved whenever possible and practical in the dedication of
open space and park and recreation areas.
      (2)   Where the land proposed to be dedicated has been adversely affected
by the subdivider's or developer's operation, or his or her lack of control
over the use of the land, or where it is necessary to alter or change, to make
it a suitable site, by clearing, grading, drainage or a combination thereof, a
construction plan must be approved by the Director of Public Service. Such
changes or improvements as are to be required in the construction plan shall
conform to the standards as established by the parties concerned.
   (g)   Credit for Private Open Space.
      (1)   Where private open space for park and recreation purposes is
provided in a proposed subdivision not developed under the planned unit
development regulations and such space is to be privately owned and maintained,
such areas shall be credited against the requirement of dedication of land for
park and recreation purposes or the payment of the fees in lieu thereof, as set
forth in this section.
      (2)   Such credit, however, shall be allowed only up to a maximum of
three- fourths of the total required land dedication or fee in lieu payment, as
required under this section. This determination is to be made by Council, and
only in cases where it finds that the park area being provided will be in the
public interest and adequately fulfill the neighborhood park needs of the
subdivision, taking into consideration such factors as:
         A.   Location, size, configuration and accessibility of the park space
in relation to the neighborhood and community park needs of the subdivision and
the surrounding area;
         B.   The location of schools, other parks and open spaces and
facilities in the area; and
         C.   The desirable location of parks as reflected in the Parks and
Recreation Plan.
      (3)   Notwithstanding paragraph (g)(2) hereof, credit for such private
open space against the dedication of park area required by this section shall
be allowed only if the following standards are met:
         A.   Yards, court areas, setbacks and other open areas required to be
maintained by the Zoning Code shall not be included in the computation of such
private open space.
         B.   The private ownership and maintenance of the open space is
adequately provided for by written agreement.
         C.   The use of the private open space is restricted for park and
recreation purposes by recorded covenants which run with the land in favor of
the future owners of property within the tract and which cannot be defeated or
eliminated without the consent of Council.
         D.   The proposed private open space is reasonably adaptable for use
for park and recreational purposes, taking into consideration such factors as
size, shape, topography, geology, access and location of the private open space
land; and
         E.   Facilities proposed for the open space are in substantial
accordance with the provisions of the parks and recreation section of the
Comprehensive Plan, and are approved by Council.
   (h)   Limitation on Use of Land and Fees. The land and fees received by the
Municipality under this section shall be used only for the purpose of providing
park and recreational facilities to serve the area in which the subdivision is
located. Fees paid pursuant to this section shall be deposited in a Parks and
Recreation Capital Improvement Fund, to be used for the acquisition,
development and improvement of park and recreational facilities. No part of
such fees shall be used for the purpose of paying salaries, wages or other
general operating expenditures. Moneys spent may be expended on neighborhood or
community parks, open space areas and facilities in reasonable proximity to the
subdivision or development. Such parks and open space areas shall be maintained
so long as the subdivision or development remains in use. However, should any
such park or open space area be required at some future date for other public
purposes, then a replacement park or open space area of an equal size, and
equally equipped with recreational equipment and facilities, must be provided,
such equipment and facilities to also be in reasonable proximity to the
subdivision or development.

1230.01   PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS.
   A planned unit development shall be permitted when it is in keeping with
existing natural features and when it is designed to preserve such features or
to make more efficient use of land and thereby better serve the general health
and welfare of the community. The purpose of allowing a subdivider to develop
an area as a planned unit development is to provide a variety of housing types
with varying yard setbacks, building placement and the provision of open space.
   It is the intent of these Subdivision Regulations that subdivision review be
carried out as an integral part of the review of a planned unit development
under the Zoning Code. The preliminary planned unit development plan required
by the Zoning Code will, for the purposes of these Subdivision Regulations, be
reviewed by the Planning Board for its conformity to the Zoning Code and these
Subdivision Regulations. The preliminary planned unit development plan shall,
therefore, constitute the preliminary plat for the entire area to be developed.
   Such development may require modification, subject to Planning Board
approval, to conform to Chapters 1236 and 1238.
   Within twelve months after approval of the preliminary planned unit
development plan, the subdivider shall have submitted a final plat for the
first phase to be developed. Thereafter, a final plat shall be submitted for
each additional phase of the planned unit development to be developed. Final
plats shall be in accordance with the procedural requirements of Chapters 1226
and 1228.
   Upon completion of all the required public improvements, the subdivider or
developer shall request, in writing, a final inspection by the Director of
Public Service, as required under Ohio R.C. 711.091.
(Ord. 83-32. Passed 8-15-83.)
1230.02   CLUSTER DEVELOPMENTS.
   A cluster development may be utilized within a zoning district to provide a
permitted housing type while preserving and maintaining open space. The
Planning Board may grant a subdivider the right to vary the yard setbacks and
building placement within the area to be developed. The right to vary yard
setbacks and building placement shall, however, be subject to the following
conditions:
   (a)   An overall plan of the entire tract to be subdivided, showing roads,
lot lines, lot areas, open space areas, easements, encumbrances and other
relevant data, shall be submitted in accordance with Chapters 1226, 1228, 1236
and 1238.
   (b)   Maximum gross density shall not exceed that of the zoning district in
which the proposed subdivision is located. The houses in the proposed
subdivision shall be grouped in clusters. The minimum lot area shall be not
less than two-thirds of that minimum lot area normally required in the zoning
district in which the subdivision is located.
   (c)   The balance of the land in a proposed subdivision that is not
contained in lots or within road rights-of-way shall be contiguous and of such
condition, size and shape as to be usable for recreation. Such land shall be
held in corporate ownership by the owners of lots within the development, and
the subdivider shall incorporate, into the deeds of all property in the
development, a clause giving the owner an interest in such open land which
shall be used for recreational purposes only. No structure, save those
incidental to the recreational use, shall be permitted on such land.
   (d)   Open land shall be a minimum of one acre and shall be subject to
taxation. In the case of a tract of three or more acres, the developer may
petition the Municipality to accept dedication of the land to be used in
perpetuity as public open space.
   (e)   Upon completion of all the required public improvements, the
subdivider or developer shall request, in writing, a final inspection by the
Director of Public Service, as required under Ohio R.C. 711.091.

   (a)   Commercial and industrial plats must be zoned for business or
industry, whichever is applicable, before this section is applicable.
   (b)   A commercial and industrial development requiring new streets shall be
platted. However, individual lot lines within the plat may be established by
resubdividing after the plat has been approved as recorded.
   (c)   Improvements shall be constructed according to the provisions of
Chapter 6.1 of the Subdivision Regulations of Clark County or Chapter 1238 of
these Codified Ordinances, except that:
      (1)   All commercial and industrial plats must have approved sewer and
water facilities.
      (2)   Sidewalks are not required unless deemed necessary by the proper
authorities.
      (3)   Curbs and gutters shall be installed in all cases.
(Ord. 83-32. Passed 8-15-83.)
1232.03   INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS.
   In order to provide suitable sites for industrial development, the Planning
Board may grant a subdivider the right to vary the yard setbacks and building
placements subject to the following conditions:
   (a)   An overall plan of the entire tract, showing streets, lot lines, lot
areas, easements, encumbrances and other relevant data, shall be submitted in
accordance with Chapters 1226 and 1228.
   (b)   Industrial access streets for industrial subdivisions shall be planned
to serve industrial areas exclusively and shall connect with primary or
secondary thoroughfares so that no industrial traffic will be directed into any
residential local access street.
   (c)   The intersection of service streets from parking areas with
thoroughfares or collector streets shall be not less than 100 feet from the
intersection of the thoroughfares or collector streets with any other street.
   (d)   The cost of all oversize improvements, where necessary to facilitate
the operation of the industrial subdivision, shall be the responsibility of the
subdivider. Such oversize improvements shall be subject to the review and
approval of the Director of Public Service.
   (e)   Upon completion of all of the required public improvements, the
subdivider or developer shall request, in writing, a final inspection by the
Director of Public Service, as required under Ohio R.C. 711.091.
(Ord. 83-32. Passed 8-15-83.)
1232.04   COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS.
   In addition to the requirements specified in the Zoning Code, the following
conditions shall apply to the development of commercial subdivisions:
   (a)   Curb cuts along primary thoroughfares are prohibited, except in cases
where no other means of automobile access is available. In cases where such
curb cuts are essential, their number, size and location shall be controlled so
as to minimize traffic conflict upon the primary thoroughfare.
   (b)   Supplementary service roads are required where access to abutting
businesses is necessary.
   (c)   The cost of all oversize improvements, where necessary, shall be the
responsibility of the subdivider. Such oversize improvements shall be subject
to the review and approval of the Director of Public Service.

1234.01   PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to provide a way to develop land needed for
and adapted to residential use at a population density requiring both public
water supply and sanitary sewer systems, which land does not contain one or
both of these utilities at the time of development. It is necessary that
utility transition areas be confined to undeveloped areas adjacent to existing,
urban areas containing the needed utility service so that in due time the
service will be available. Provision shall be made to allow a resubdivision of
the original plat at a later date when utility lines are available so as to
induce development in an economical manner and orderly arrangement rather than
unsound scattered types of development.
(Ord. 83-32. Passed 8-15-83.)
1234.02   DEVELOPMENT.
   Lots in transition areas may be platted in such a manner that, in the
future, each lot may be split in two or more parts, each of which contains the
necessary area and width requirements as set forth in Columns A and B of the
table in Section
1236.05(b)(2)C. as they pertain to single-family developments. Such lots shall
be designated on the plat as having two or more parts by the use of a thin
broken line. Each of the parts shall be identified by “A, B,” etc. Each lot
shall be sold as a unit and recorded on one deed. Such a lot shall be
restricted in use to one single-family residence. It shall be noted in the
restrictions that, at the time water and sanitary sewer facilities are made
available to a lot, such lot may be so split in two or more subsections. These
restrictions of sale and use of land shall be specified in the deed and plat.
   At such time as public water and sanitary sewer facilities are available,
the restrictions shall be terminated, if desired, by the Planning Board and the
Commission, when involved, by authorizing the splitting of such lots, under the
provisions of Chapters 1226 and 1228.

1236.01   SCOPE.
   This chapter shall apply to all divisions of land. (Ord. 83-32. Passed 8-15-
83.)
1236.02   CONFORMITY OF RESIDENTIAL SUBDIVISIONS.
   All proposed residential subdivisions shall conform to a neighborhood-type
urban pattern. The specific area plan, together with the Comprehensive Plans
for the Municipality and Clark County, shall be adhered to.
(Ord. 83-32. Passed 8-15-83.)
1236.03   DRAINAGE.
   (a)   Installation. The subdivider shall install required storm drainage
improvements in accordance with the plans and profiles prepared by his or her
registered professional engineer, to be reviewed and approved by the Director
of Public Service as meeting the minimum engineering design standards and
material specifications and as in accordance with the storm drainage plan.
Storm drainage improvements shall be carried out under Municipal supervision
within the time fixed or agreed upon by the Director, and all inspection and
review shall be paid for by the subdivider.
   All necessary facilities, including underground pipe, inlets and catch or
open drainage ditches, shall be installed to provide adequate disposal of
subsurface and surface water and maintenance of natural drainage courses. All
storm drainage facilities in the subdivision shall connect to an adequate
drainage course.
   (b)   Drainage Easements or Rights-of-Way. An easement shall be provided on
both sides of a storm drainage course for the purpose of widening, deepening or
general maintenance. The minimum width of an easement carrying storm water
shall be twenty feet. In the case of large drainage ways or ditches, the
Director of Public Service or the Planning Board may require a drainage right-
of-way if an easement is deemed inadequate and/or too much of the lot would be
utilized for drainage purposes. In the three-mile jurisdictional area, the
approving authority and Council may also require a drainage right-of-way, if
considered necessary.
   (c)   Storm Sewers and Storm Water Drainage. A drainage system adequate to
serve the needs of the proposed new streets and the entire subdivision is
required in a new subdivision. Where an adequate public storm sewer main is
available at the plat boundary, the subdivider shall construct a storm sewer
system and connect with such storm sewer main. If such storm sewer system is
not accessible, adequate storm water drainage shall be provided by natural
drainage channels with easements of adequate width.
   (d)   Culverts and Bridges. Culverts and/or bridges are required where
natural drainage channels intersect a street right-of-way. Culverts shall
extend across the entire right-of- way width of the existing or proposed
street. The minimum diameter of a culvert pipe is eighteen inches. Driveway
culverts shall have a minimum length of twenty feet and a minimum diameter of
twelve inches.
(Ord. 83-32. Passed 8-15-83.)
1236.04   STREETS.
   (a)   Pattern. The pattern of streets shall conform to the Official
Thoroughfare Plan of the Municipality and with the provisions of these
Subdivision Regulations. Within the boundaries of the plat, the following
provisions pertaining to streets shall be adhered to:
      (1)   The necessary right-of-way for the widening or extension of a
thoroughfare, as delineated by the Official Thoroughfare Plan, shall be
dedicated, provided that the width to be dedicated need not exceed fifty feet
measured from the centerline of the right-of-way on any one side of the street.
      (2)   When a subdivision involves land fronting on an existing public
street not designated on the Official Thoroughfare Plan as of equal or greater
importance than a secondary street, a reasonable provision shall be made for
the necessary right-of-way for traffic, utilities and drainage.
      (3)   When, in the opinion of the Planning Board and the Commission, when
involved, the principal land use of an area is for multifamily residences, the
street serving such an area shall conform to the standards as designated in
Table 3.
      (4)   When, in the opinion of the Board and the Commission, when
involved, the proposed urban pattern is such that one or more streets act as
traffic collectors, the rights-of-way in question shall be designated as
collector streets and shall conform to the standards as designated in Section
1238.08(a)(1).
   (b)   Continuity. The street pattern shall make provisions for the
continuance of streets into adjacent vacant properties, and for connecting to
the proper existing right-of-way in adjacent developed areas. The use of
existing stub street widths as frontage, therefore, is prohibited.
   (c)   Cul-de-Sacs. The maximum length of a cul-de-sac is 450 feet, measured
from the middle of the turn-around or, more particularly, the point of radius
to the near edge of the intersecting right-of-way.
   (d)   Grading. The shoulders shall be graded to the full width of the right-
of-way, and provisions shall be made for slopes beyond the right-of-way.
However, grading behind the curbs may be modified, provided that the minimum
sight distances are maintained along the vertical and horizontal curvatures of
streets, that no obstructions exist at intersections within the minimum sight
triangle, as provided for in paragraph (g)(3) hereof, and that no sidewalks are
required. Plans shall indicate any variation from the standard cross section.
   (e)   Termination of Streets; Turning Area.
      (1)   In the case of the temporary termination of a street exceeding 400
feet in length, a temporary turn-around shall be constructed so that the paving
has an outer radius of twenty-five feet and extends to within five feet of the
property line.
      (2)   No cul-de-sac, permanently terminated, will be approved when a
through street is practical. The subdivider shall have the burden of showing
the impracticality of the through street in order to justify a cul-de-sac.
      (3)   A cul-de-sac, permanently terminated, which exceeds 400 feet in
length may only be approved if the paved width thereof is thirty-six feet.
      (4)   In a residential development, a cul-de-sac, permanently terminated,
shall have a circular turn-around with a minimum right-of-way radius of fifty
feet and an outer paving radius of forty feet. However, if the cul-de-sac
exceeds 350 feet in length, the minimum outer paving radius of the turn-around
shall be forty-five feet. In an industrial development, a cul-de-sac,
permanently terminated, shall have a circular turn-around with a minimum right-
of-way radius of sixty feet and a minimum outer paving radius of fifty feet.
   (f)   Half Streets and Alleys. The dedication of half streets shall be
discouraged. Where a half street or half alley exists adjacent to the tract to
be subdivided, the other half street shall be platted, if deemed necessary by
the Planning Board and Council when involved. Improvements on half streets
shall be as set forth in Section
1238.02(d).
   (g)   Intersections.
      (1)   Generally. Streets shall intersect one another at ninety degree
angles or as near thereto as possible. Curb radius requirements are set forth
in Section
1238.08(a)(2)B. Property lines shall be rounded with a radius of fifteen
degrees or greater if the Planning Board and the Commission, when involved,
deem it necessary.
      (2)   Jogs. Street intersection jogs of less than 125 feet, measured from
street centerline to street centerline, shall be discouraged.
      (3)   Approaches. The approach to an intersection shall be perpendicular
to the intersection for a distance of at least 100 feet, measured from the
centerline of the intersecting street.
      (4)   Sight distance or line of daylighting. Proper sight lines shall be
maintained at intersections of streets. There shall be measured, along the
centerline, a minimum clear sight triangle of seventy-five feet from the point
of intersection, for collector and minor streets, and a minimum sight triangle
of 115 feet from the point of intersection for thoroughfares. No building or
other obstruction is permitted in these areas. Any obstruction to sight shall
be removed at the time a building or structure is erected on the adjacent lot,
whichever occurs first.
   (h)   Alignment.
      (1)   Sight distance. A minimum sight distance of 250 feet, for
thoroughfares, and 100 feet, for collector and local access streets, measured
at the centerline and at the driver's eye height of three and one-half feet,
shall be provided.
      (2)   Horizontal curves. Horizontal curves shall be used at all changes
in alignment in excess of two degrees. Long radius curves shall be used rather
than a series of curves connected by short tangents. Minimum radius curves at
the end of long tangents shall not be approved.
   Minimum radii of centerlines on horizontal curves shall be 200 feet on
thoroughfare streets and 100 feet on collector and local access streets.
   Reverse curves shall be separated by tangents of fifty feet or more, in
accordance with standards of the American Association of State Highway
Officials.
   Super elevation and additional width shall be used for curves of less than
600 feet radii, on thoroughfares, and of less than 300 feet radii on collector
and local access streets.
   (i)   Grades.
      (1)   Generally.
         A.   The minimum grade shall be one percent.
         B.   Grades in excess of five percent shall be avoided on all streets.
         C.   In an exceptional case, the maximum grade may be ten percent for
local access streets (a maximum grade of twelve percent for local access
streets may be permitted for short distances where extreme topographical
conditions exist) and seven percent for secondary thoroughfares and collector
streets. Excessive lengths of steep grades shall not be approved.
         D.   A combination of minimum radius horizontal curves should be
avoided on vertical curves.
      (2)   At intersections. The grade within fifty feet of any side of an
intersection of the outer perimeter of a turn-around shall not exceed three
percent. The grade shall be measured along the curb or flow lines of the
street.
   (j)   Obstructions. No fence, hedge, shrub, wall, planting or other
obstruction shall be located within the right-of-way. Sight at intersections
shall not be obscured by such obstructions.
   (k)   Names. New street names shall not duplicate existing street names,
except where a street is extended or when the new right-of-way is in alignment
with an existing one. All new streets shall be named in accordance with the
following:
 
General Direction Name
North and south                     Street
East and west                       Avenue
Diagonal                            Road
Curving                             Drive
Dead-end street-north and south     Lane
Dead-end street-east and west       Court
Circular street or any part thereof Circle
 
   Signposts and nameplates approved by the Municipality shall be placed at
intersections, at the expense of the subdivider.
   (l)   Width. The width of a street shall be as specified in Section
1238.08(a).
(Ord. 83-32. Passed 8-15-83.)
1236.05   LOTS.
   (a)   Frontage. All lot frontage shall be measured at the minimum required
set-back line in zoned areas. In unzoned areas, lot frontage shall be measured
fifty feet from and parallel to the front right-of-way or easement line. In the
case of a curved street, frontage shall be measured on the chord of the
curvature. All lots must have frontage on other than a controlled or limited
access road. Frontages in unzoned areas shall be as specified in subsection (b)
hereof.
   (b)   Size.
      (1)   Generally. Minimum lot sizes in zoned areas, where public and/or
community sewer and water is to be utilized, shall be as specified in the
Zoning Code. Minimum lot sizes in areas where sewers, either public and/or
community, are not available or in areas that are not zoned shall be as
specified in paragraph (b)(2)C. hereof.
      (2)   Utility transition areas.
         A.   If the subdivider chooses to provide water and sewer service in
the manner set forth in Section
1238.06(c)(2)B.1., minimum lot size and width shall be as noted in Column B of
the table in paragraph (b)(2)C. hereof.
         B.   If the subdivider chooses to provide temporary water supply and
sewage disposal on each individual lot, such a lot may be platted in such a
manner that, in the future, the lot may be split into two or more parts, each
of which contains the necessary area and width as specified in Column B of the
table in paragraph (b)(2)C. hereof. The original lot shall have a minimum
frontage and lot area as specified in Column C of such table. The procedure for
platting lots in the manner referred to in this paragraph is set forth in
Chapter 1234.
         C.   Lot frontage and lot area requirements are as follows:

   Notes:
      1. Greater lot widths and areas may be required by the Clark County
Health Department in cases of adverse percolation tests.
      2. Calculation of lot areas shall exclude that portion of any lot
occupied by a public thoroughfare, either by dedication or by easement.
   (c)   Corner Lots. In areas where sewer and water are available, the minimum
widtiTZTF1 corner lot at the building line shall be eighty-five feet.
   (d)   Double Frontage Lots. Double frontage lots, other than corner lots and
lots backing onto major traffic arteries, are discouraged. When the Planning
Board and the Commission, when involved, require that lots back onto a major
traffic artery, the minimum depth shall be 150 feet.
   A ten-foot easement is required along the back line of a double-frontage
lot, across which there shall not be any right-of-way vehicular access. This
stipulation shall be indicated in the dedication and acknowledgment section of
the final map.
   (e)   Setbacks. Minimum building set-back requirements for residential and
commercial lots shall be as required in the Zoning Code. In unzoned areas,
minimum set-back requirements shall be as specified in paragraphs (e)(1) and
(e)(2) hereof. Any required minimum building set-back line for a front yard
shall be measured from the edge of the legally dedicated street or road right-
of-way.
      (1)   Residential lots.
         A.   The minimum building set-back line for fifty percent of the
dwellings shall be thirty feet. The remaining dwellings may have a reduced
setback which shall be not less than twenty-five feet in any case.
         B.   The minimum building setback on the side street of a corner lot
shall be thirty feet.
      (2)   Business or industrial lots.
         A.   The minimum front set-back line on a business or industrial lot
shall be twenty-five feet.
         B.   A minimum set-back requirement of twenty feet shall be provided
on the side street side of a corner lot.
      (3)   Exceptions. When the minimum required set-back line is greater than
that established by existing buildings on contiguous lots on the same street,
corner lots excepted, there may be a gradual transition at the rate of two and
one-half feet or more per lot from the existing to the new. However, on
residential lots, the minimum setback shall be not less than fifteen feet.
(Ord. 83-32. Passed 8-15-83.)
1236.06   BLOCKS.
   (a)   Determining Factors. The length, width and shape of a block shall be
determined with due regard to the following:
      (1)   The provision of an adequate number of building sites which contain
the necessary area for the particular need and use intended as specified by
these Subdivision Regulations and any involved zoning regulation;
      (2)   The need for convenient access, circulation control and safety of
street traffic; and
      (3)   The limitations of topography.
   (b)   Length. Blocks shall not exceed 1,600 feet in length. A crosswalk, the
right-of-way of which shall be not less than ten feet, is required if, in the
opinion of the Planning Board and the Commission, when involved, this facility
is necessary.
(Ord. 83-32. Passed 8-15-83.)
1236.07   ALLEYS.
   (a)   Prohibited in Residential Areas. Alleys are not permitted in
Residential Districts unless there are unusual circumstances which make alleys
necessary.
   (b)   Required in Certain Districts. Alleys shall be provided in
multifamily, business and industrial districts, except that the Planning Board
and the Commission, when involved, may waive this requirement when other
definite and assured provisions are made for access to off-street parking,
loading and service.
   (c)   Width. The minimum width of an alley shall be twenty feet, and the
paved area shall be at least sixteen and one-half feet.
   (d)   Intersection and Alignment. Alley intersections and sharp changes in
alignment shall be avoided, but where necessary, the corners of intersecting
alleys shall be cut off by a line connecting two points which are located along
the alley ten feet back from the intersection for each foot of alignment.
   (e)   Dead-End Alleys. Dead-end alleys are not permitted unless considered
necessary by the Planning Board and the Commission, when involved.
(Ord. 83-32. Passed 8-15-83.)
1236.08   PUBLIC SITES AND OPEN AREAS.
   Areas which are suitably located and are of adequate size for parks,
playgrounds or schools, as determined by the Comprehensive Plan, or by the
proper governmental agency if an appropriate plan has not been adopted, shall
be made available to such agency. The area in question shall be reserved for
acquisition. The agency involved shall declare its intentions pertaining to the
acquisition of the reserved area within six months of the date of the
preliminary plat approval, or the reservation shall be varied and the site
released back to the subdivider. The reserved area shall be acquired within one
year of the date of the preliminary approval, or any length of time agreeable
to both parties, or such reservation shall be voided and the site released back
to the subdivider.
(Ord. 83-32. Passed 8-15-83.)
1236.09   TREES.
   (a)   Where necessary, all existing trees shall be removed from a street
right-of-way. Trees, when planted, shall be located outside any easement and
planted in such a manner as not to impair visibility at any corner. It is
recommended that all subdividers or developers salvage as many acceptable
existing trees as possible and, in areas where needed, trees shall be planted
on each lot.
   (b)   Species of trees deemed desirable include, but are not necessarily
limited to, Red Maple, Norway Maple, Sugar Maple, Sycamore Maple, Red Oak,
Thornless Honey Locust, London Plane Tree, Amur Cork Tree, Sweet Gum, Buckeye,
Ruby Red Horsechestnut, European Hornbeam, Hornbeam, American Hop Hornbeam,
Chinese Hackberry, Hackberry, Maidenhair Tree and European Linden.
   (c)   Trees which have undesirable characteristics such as fruit, low
branches, unpleasant odors, excessively thick foliage, susceptibility to
disease or attack by insects or large root systems (such as Poplar, Willow,
Cottonwood, American Elm, Ailanthus, Mountain Ash, Silver Maple, Ash-Leaved
Maple and Oregon Maple) are prohibited within twenty-five feet of a public
right-of-way or easement. Poplar, Willow or Cottonwood trees, if planted on
private property, must be located not less than 100 feet from a public sewer.

1238.01   GENERALLY.
   Within the three-mile jurisdictional area, Municipal specifications as to
improvements shall prevail, if jurisdiction is assumed by the Municipality,
unless there is an agreement between the Municipality and the County whereby
the specifications set forth in the agreement shall prevail.
(Ord. 83-32. Passed 8-15-83.)
1238.02   STREETS.
   (a)   New. All new streets shall be constructed to a minimum width as
specified in Section
1238.08, provided that in the case of a street shown as a primary or secondary
thoroughfare on the Official Thoroughfare Plan, the following shall apply:
      (1)   Where a thoroughfare is located wholly within a subdivision, the
subdivider is not required to construct any such thoroughfare to a width
greater than twenty feet from the centerline, or its equivalent in the case of
a divided pavement.
      (2)   Where a thoroughfare is located partially within a subdivision, the
subdivider shall be required to construct at least one-half of the total paving
required or one side of the road as required by the Official Thoroughfare Plan.
      (3)   The subdivider may enter into a contract with the Municipality to
pay into the treasury an amount equal to the cost of pavement, as specified in
paragraph (a)(1) hereof, which amount shall then be used by the Municipality in
construction of the entire pavement.
   In utility transition areas, where lots are platted in pairs as specified in
Section
1236.05(b)(2), the required improvements, with the exception of sanitary sewer
and water lines, shall be as required of lots which are comparable in size to
half of a utility transition area lot, unless sidewalks are waived by Council.
      (4)   If Council has approved a street and lot arrangement in which all
lots back onto a primary or secondary thoroughfare or front on a parallel
service street, the subdivider is not required to provide street improvements
on the thoroughfare unless considered necessary for adequate access to the
plat.
   (b)   Existing. When land is being subdivided in the Municipality and along
an existing street, Council may require the pavement to be widened. However,
the maximum required width of a pavement need not exceed twenty feet, measured
from the centerline to the edge of pavement or back curb, whichever is
applicable.
   (c)   Dead-Ends. Where a street is extended to the boundary of the plat to
provide accessibility to future development in adjacent land, the developer
must provide a temporary turn-around, as specified in Section
1236.04(e).
   (d)   Half Streets. Where permitted, the initial improvement for a half
street shall be such that the pavement will be installed to a point at least
two feet beyond the crown or as necessary to provide a minimum of thirty-six
feet of paved surface. Curbs, gutters and sidewalks, when required, shall be
required on only one side of the right-of-way. Existing street surfaces shall
be removed on the improved side of the street and reworked as necessary to
provide a consistent surface and contour across the total paved area.
(Ord. 83-32. Passed 8-15-83.)
1238.03   SIDEWALKS, CURBS AND GUTTERS.
   (a)   In the Municipality.
      (1)   High-density areas. In any Residential District except an SER
Suburban Estate Residential District, sidewalks, curbs and gutters are required
on both sides of a right-of- way. In subdivisions to be occupied by multifamily
dwellings, sidewalks are required on both sides of the street, unless the
Planning Board determines that this requirement is unnecessary because of
exceptionally large lots. The lot size and type of improvements in the
surrounding area, as well as the size of the proposed subdivision, shall be
taken into consideration as they pertain to sidewalk requirements.
      (2)   Low-density areas. In an SER Residential District, where the lot
frontages for single- family houses average substantially more than the width
set forth in paragraph (a)(1) hereof, curbs and gutters may be required on both
sides of a right-of-way.
      (3)   Generally. Council may require sidewalks to be constructed where
they are essential to better circulation or as access to schools, playgrounds,
shopping centers, transportation depots or other facilities. The lot size and
topography of the surrounding area may be taken into consideration as it
pertains to the sidewalk requirement.
   (b)   In the Three-Mile Jurisdictional Area.
      (1)   Sidewalks. Sidewalks are required in all single-family areas where
the lot frontage averages less than 100 feet per lot. In subdivisions to be
occupied by multifamily dwellings, sidewalks are required on both sides of a
street unless the appropriately designated authority determines that such a
requirement is unnecessary because of low-density development. The type of
improvements in the surrounding area, as well as the size of the proposed
subdivision, shall be taken into consideration as they pertain to sidewalk
requirements. Where curbs and gutters are required, but sidewalks are not, a
right-of-way shall be graded to allow construction of sidewalks at a later
date.
      (2)   Curbs and gutters. Curbs and gutters are required in all new
subdivisions. However, where existing public roads are utilized, curb and
gutter requirements may be waived if, in the opinion of the Commission, curbs
and gutters are not necessary. The lot size and type of improvements in the
surrounding area, as well as the size of the proposed subdivision, shall be
taken into consideration as they pertain to curb and gutter requirements.
(Ord. 83-32. Passed 8-15-83.)
1238.04   DRAINAGE.
   (a)   Generally. The subdivider shall construct or install the necessary
ditches or closed sewers to drain the property in question completely and to
dispose of the storm water to the satisfaction of the Director of Public
Service and the Municipal Engineer. Open ditches are not permitted in finished
subdivisions.
   In utility transition areas where lots are platted as specified in Chapter
1234, the required improvements, with the exception of water and sanitary sewer
lines, shall be as required of lots comparable in size to half of a utility
transition area lot, unless sidewalks are waived by Council.
   (b)   Use of Existing Public System Required. When a public storm sewer is
accessible, as determined by the Director of Public Service, the developer
shall connect with the public system. Storm drainage is not permitted in
sanitary sewers.
(Ord. 83-32. Passed 8-15-83.)
1238.05   FENCING ALONG DRAINAGE RIGHTS-OF-WAY.
   When a development is planned adjacent to a large drainage ditch or
waterway, a fence is required along the drainage right-of-way.
(Ord. 83-32. Passed 8-15-83.)
1238.06   WATER AND SANITARY SEWERAGE SYSTEMS.
   (a)   In the Municipality. All divisions of land in the Municipality shall
be served by water and sanitary sewer lines. Exceptions to this requirement may
include the following:
      (1)   If a subdivision is located, as determined by the Planning Board
and Council, so as to be held in a utility transition area where water and
sanitary sewer lines are not available. In such a case, the water and sanitary
requirements shall be as set forth in paragraph (c)(2) hereof.
      (2)   If a subdivision is located in an area where the topography is such
that future sanitary sewer and/or water lines in the area would be improbable.
   (b)   In the Three-Mile Jurisdictional Area.
      (1)   With utilities available. If the subdivision can be served by the
economical extension of public water and/or sanitary sewer lines as determined
by the County Board of Commissioners, the subdivider shall be required to do
so.
      (2)   Either utility not available. If public water and/or sanitary sewer
service is not economically available and the proposed subdivision is not
located in a potential urban area as described in paragraph (c) hereof, the
subdivider, developer or owner shall provide an individual well and septic tank
for each dwelling.
   (c)   In Potential Urban Areas.
      (1)   Description. A proposed subdivision shall be considered to be in a
potential urban area if one or both of the following conditions exist:
         A.   If the proposed subdivision is located in an area which contains
five lots or more, either proposed or existing and proposed, all of which lie
within the bounds of a circle, the center of which is located near the center
of the proposed subdivision and has a radius of 310 feet or less, or as in the
case of a one-street linear development where the five lots will face upon a
street within a linear distance of 500 feet. Measurement of a one-street linear
development shall begin in the center of the proposed development and extend
for a distance of 250 feet from the center on each side.
         B.   If the subdivision is located in an area designated by the
Planning Board and Council as a utility transition area.
   Proposed or existing lots that utilize sewer and water service shall not be
counted as part of the potential urban area. Any such lot having at least 250
feet of continuous frontage on a public road and one and one-half acres or more
of land area shall not be counted as part of the utilization of utilities.
      (2)   Requirements.
         A.   Where a subdivision is proposed in a potential urban area as
described in paragraph (c)(1)A. hereof the developer shall provide or ensure
sanitary sewer and water facilities by one of the following methods:
            1.   By installing the necessary lines and connecting them with a
public sewer and water system; or
            2.   By installing such lines along with a district community water
supply and sewer system. The water supply and sewage disposal system must meet
the requirements of the County Sanitary Engineer, the State Board of Health and
the Director of Public Service.
         B.   In a utility transition area where sanitary sewer and water lines
are not available, the developer of a proposed subdivision shall provide or
ensure such utility facilities by one of the following methods:
            1.   By installing necessary lines and creating a temporary water
supply and sewer district. The facilities of a temporary water supply and sewer
district must meet the requirements of the Department of Public Service and the
County Health Department. The County Sanitary Engineer and the County Health
Department shall also approve plans pertaining to water supply and sewage
disposal within the three-mile jurisdictional area unless the utility system is
connected to the Municipal system, in which case the requirements of the
Municipality shall prevail.
            2.   By first requiring the home builders to install temporary
wells and septic tanks, and then by platting and selling lots in the manner set
forth in Chapter 1234 and complying with the other requirements of the utility
transition area or by platting lots of the size or manner as indicated in
Column D of the table in Section
1236.05(b)(2)C.
         C.   Percolation tests are required on all new subdivisions, platted
or unplatted, not served by a public or community sewer. Such tests shall be
performed by either a qualified sanitarian, a registered surveyor or a civil or
sanitary engineer and shall be done in accordance with the requirements and
specifications of the County Health Department. Approval by such Department is
required before the subdivision is approved by the Planning Board. However, a
conditional approval, subject to approval by the Department, may be granted if
Department approval has not been received by meeting time. Before further
subdividing land in a potential urban area is permitted, the developer shall
submit a scale drawing showing his or her intentions concerning the remainder
of land under his or her control. The planning staff shall review the drawing
and submit it to the Planning Board to determine if the land in question should
be platted.
         D.   Exceptions to the requirement of such percolation tests include
the following:
            1.   A situation where an existing house and its septic tank have
been used successfully on a large tract of land now being requested to be split
off and used as a separate lot; and
            2.   The creation of a nonbuildable lot that is to be used in
conjunction with an existing lot of record to provide additional yard area.
      (3)   Exceptions. In a potential urban area as described in paragraph (c)
(1)A. hereof, if the developer can justify one or all of the following items to
the satisfaction of both the Planning Board and the County, the sewer and water
requirements as stated in paragraph (c)(2)A. hereof may be waived, in which
case, however, the size of all lots shall be as specified in subsection (b)
hereof and Column D of the table in Section
1236.05(b)(2)C.:
         A.   That the topography is such that the extension of water and
sanitary sewer lines in the area is economically not feasible or the cost of
providing community facilities is such as to prohibit the subdivision of the
area;
         B.   That the plat is not in the path of urban growth and is distantly
located from any developed area; and
         C.   That the plat is located in the proximity of utility facilities
and that such facilities are not available because of government action.
   (d)   (EDITOR'S NOTE: Division (d) of this section was repealed by Ordinance
03-01.  Passed January 21, 2003.)
(Ord. 83-32. Passed 8-15-83; Ord. 03-01.  Passed 1-21-03.)
1238.07   PERMANENT MONUMENTS.
   Permanent monuments shall be located as required by the Director of Public
Service and/or the Planning Board. As set forth in Ohio R.C. 711.03, an area of
ten lots or less requires four monuments and an area of more than ten lots
requires sufficient monuments to provide a line of sight from monument to
monument.

   Notes:
      1.   This dimension is determined by measuring back to back of curb.
      2.   The minimum street grade is one percent.
      3.   The degree of curvature shall be determined by a minimum curb radius
of thirty-five feet.
      4.   All dimensions in Column E are street centerline measurements.
      5.   All dimensions in Column F shall be measured from four and one-half
feet above the street surface to an object four inches above the street
surface.
      6.   All changes in grade shall be made by vertical curves of minimum
length equal to 100 times the algebraic difference in rate of grade for
thoroughfares and one-half such minimum length for collector and local streets
using the nearest twenty-five foot length of curve.
      7.   All subdivisions (platted or unplatted) shall be required to
dedicate necessary rights-of- way when streets involved in such subdivisions
are part of the Official Thoroughfare Plan. However, in the case of a lot
split, if the grantor wishes to dedicate additional rights-of-way along his or
her entire road frontage, the County Prosecutor's Office or the Department of
Law, whichever is applicable, will handle the necessary paperwork.
      (2)   Intersection; curb radius.
         A.   Grade. Street grades shall not exceed three percent within a
distance of 100 feet from an intersection.
         B.   Curb radius. All street pavements shall intersect each other as
near to right angles as possible. At right angle intersections, the curb radius

(Ord. 82-38.  Passed 9-20-82.)

1244.03   JURISDICTION OF BOARD OF APPEALS.
   As specified in this chapter, the Board of Appeals has appellate
jurisdiction relative to appeals and variances. 
(Ord. 82-38.  Passed 9-20-82.)
1244.04   APPEALS.
   Appeals to the Board of Appeals concerning the interpretation or
administration of this Zoning Code may be taken by any person aggrieved or by
any officer or bureau of Council affected by any decision of the Zoning

(Ord. 82-38.  Passed 9-20-82.)
1244.05   PROCEEDINGS STAYED BY APPEALS.
   An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from,

cause shown.
(Ord. 82-38.  Passed 9-20-82.)
1244.06   VARIANCES.
   (a)   Upon appeal, the Board of Appeals may authorize a variance where,
because of physical circumstances such as exceptional narrowness, shallowness,
shape, topographic condition or other extraordinary lot conditions, there is no
possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with this
Zoning Code and adjustment is therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use
of the property, provided that such minimum relief can be granted without
substantial detriment to the public good and does not substantially impair the
intent of this Zoning Code.
   (b)   No variance shall be granted unless the Board finds that all of the
following conditions exist:
      (1)   The proposed variance will not constitute a change, including an
adjustment in use, on the Official Zoning Map. In no case shall the Board
approve a variance for a use not permitted in the zoning district in which the
land, structures or buildings are located.
      (2)   The special circumstances or conditions applying to the building or
land in question are peculiar to such lot or property and do not result from
the actions of the applicant or apply generally to other buildings or land in
the vicinity.
      (3)   The literal interpretation of this Zoning Code would deprive the
applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same zoning
district under this Zoning Code.
      (4)   The granting of the variance is necessary for the preservation and
enjoyment of the substantial property right and will not merely serve as a
convenience to the applicant.
      (5)   The granting of the variance requested will provide the minimum
necessary relief to alleviate the hardship and will not confer on the applicant
any special privilege which is denied by this Zoning Code to other land,
structures or buildings in the same zoning district.
      (6)   The granting of the variance will be in harmony with the general
purposes and intent of this Zoning Code and will not be injurious to the
neighborhood or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare.
   Should the Board disapprove an application or request for a variance from
the literal interpretation of this Zoning Code, no subsequent application
requesting the same variance shall be filed by an applicant, whether or not by
the same person, until the expiration of twelve months after the original or
subsequent disapproval.

1244.07   CONTENTS OF APPLICATION FOR VARIANCE.

submitted to the Zoning Inspector and the Board containing:
   (a)   The name, address and phone number of the applicant;
   (b)   A legal description of the property;
   (c)   A description of the nature of the variance requested; and
   (d)   A narrative statement demonstrating that the requested variance

      (1)   That special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar
to the land, structure or building involved and which are not applicable to
other lands, structures or buildings in the same district;
      (2)   That a literal interpretation of this Zoning Code would deprive the
applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same district
under this Zoning Code;
      (3)   That the special conditions and circumstances do not result from
the actions of the applicant; and
      (4)   That the granting of the variance requested will not confer on the
applicant any special privilege that is denied by this Zoning Code to other
lands, structures or buildings in the same district.
(Ord. 82-38.  Passed 9-20-82.)
1244.08   CONDITIONS AND SAFEGUARDS RE APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   In granting an appeal or variance, the Board of Appeals may prescribe
appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this Zoning Code. A
violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms
under which the appeal or variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of
this  Zoning Code and punishable under Section
1244.99. Under no circumstances shall the Board grant an appeal or variance to
allow a use not permissible under this Zoning Code in the district involved or
a use expressly or by implication prohibited by this Zoning Code in such
district.
(Ord. 82-38.  Passed 9-20-82.)
1244.09   PUBLIC HEARINGS RE APPEALS AND VARIANCES.

newspapers of general circulation in the Municipality at least seven days
before the date of such hearing. The notice shall set forth the time and place
of the hearing and the nature of the proposed appeal or variance.

required in subsection (a) hereof, written notice of such hearing shall be
mailed by the Chairman of the Board of Appeals, or delivered in a method
approved by the Board, at least seven days before the day of the hearing, to
all owners of properties within 500 feet of the property requesting the
variance. The notice shall contain the same information as required of the
notice required in subsection (b) hereof.
   (d)   Action by Board.  Within 30 days after the date of the public hearing
required in subsection (a) hereof, the Board shall either approve, approve with
supplementary conditions, as specified in Section
1244.08, or disapprove, the request for the appeal or variance. The Board shall
further make a finding that the reasons set forth in the application justify
the granting of the variance that will make possible a reasonable use of the

   (e)   Appeals to City Council. Any person, firm or corporation, or any

does not have sufficient interest in the decision, remand the appeal to the
Board for reconsideration if Council determines there is new evidence, or
reverse, modify or affirm the decision of the Board. Such actions shall require
five affirmative votes of the members of Council. If no action is taken by the
Council within the 45 days, said inaction shall be deemed to be an affirmation
of the Board's decision. All decisions of the City Council may be appealed to
the Clark County Common Pleas Court as provided in Ohio R.C. Chapters 2505 and
2506.

1246.01   ESTABLISHMENT.
   There is hereby established a Board of Appeals consisting of five members
appointed by Council and dedicated to the duties outlined in Section
1246.03. The composition and structure of the Board shall be as set forth in
Section
8.05 of the Municipal Charter.
(Ord. 82-38.  Passed 9-20-82.)
1246.02   RULES; MEETINGS; RECORDS.
   The Board of Appeals shall adopt rules necessary to the conduct of its
affairs in keeping with the provisions of this Zoning Code. Meetings shall be
held at the call of the Chairman of the Board and at such other times as the
Board may determine. The Chairman or, in his or her absence, the Acting
Chairman, may administer oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses. All
meetings shall be open to the public. The Board shall keep minutes of its
proceedings, showing the vote of each member upon each question or, if a member
is absent or fails to vote, indicating such fact, and shall keep records of its
examinations and other official actions, all of which shall be a public record
and be immediately filed in the office of the Board.
(Ord. 82-38.  Passed 9-20-82.)
1246.03   DUTIES.
   In exercising its duties, the Board of Appeals may, as long as such action
is in conformity with this Zoning Code, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or
modify, an order, requirement, decision or determination appealed from; may
make such order, requirement, decision or determination as ought to be made;
and to that end shall have the powers of the Zoning Inspector from whom the
appeal is taken. The concurring vote of three members of the Board is necessary
to reverse any order, requirement, decision or determination of the Inspector;
to decide in favor of the applicant on any matter upon which it is required to
pass under this Zoning Code; or to effect any variation in the application of
this Zoning Code. For the purposes of this Zoning Code, the Board shall:
   (a)   Hear and decide an appeal where it is alleged that there is an error
in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by the Zoning
Inspector; and
   (b)   Authorize a variance from the provisions of this Zoning Code, with
special conditions where necessary which are not contrary to the public
interest, where, owing to the special conditions, a literal enforcement of this
Zoning Code will result in unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of this
Zoning Code is observed and substantial justice done.
(Ord. 82-38.  Passed 9-20-82.)
   (c)   (EDITOR'S NOTE: Subsection (c) hereof was repealed by Ordinance 85-11,
passed March 4, 1985.)

   No variance granted by the Board of Appeals shall be used as precedent or as
grounds for future appeals. Each appeal shall be judged on its own merit.
(Ord. 82-38.  Passed 9-20-82.)
1246.05   AUTHORITY OF ZONING INSPECTOR, BOARD, COUNCIL AND COURTS RE APPEALS.
   It is the intent of this Zoning Code that all questions of interpretation
and enforcement first be presented to the Zoning Inspector; that such questions
shall be presented to the Board of Appeals only on appeal from the decision of
the Inspector; and that recourse from the decision of the Board shall be to the
courts as provided by law. It is further the intent of this Zoning Code that
the duties of Council in connection with this Zoning Code shall not include
hearing and deciding questions of interpretation and enforcement that may
arise. The procedure for deciding such questions shall be as stated in this
Zoning Code. Under this Zoning Code, Council shall have only the duties of
considering and adopting or rejecting proposed amendments or the repeal of this
Zoning Code as provided by law, and of establishing a schedule of fees and
charges as stated in Section
1244.16.

centerlines of streets or highways, street lines or highway right-of-way lines,
such centerlines, street lines or highway right-of-way lines shall be construed
to be such boundaries.
   (b)   Where district boundaries are so indicated that they approximately
follow the lot lines, such lot lines shall be construed to be such boundaries.
   (c)   Where district boundaries are so indicated that they are approximately
parallel to the centerlines or street lines of streets, or the centerlines or
right-of-way lines of highways, such district boundaries shall be construed as
being parallel thereto and at such distance therefrom as indicated on the
Official Zoning Map. If no distance is given, such dimensions shall be
determined by the use of the scale shown on the Map.
   (d)   Where the boundary of a district follows a railroad line, such
boundary shall be deemed to be located in the middle of the main tracks of such
railroad line.
   (e)   Where the boundary of a district follows a stream, lake or other body
of water, such boundary line shall be deemed to be located at the limit of the
jurisdiction of the Municipality, unless otherwise indicated.
(Ord. 82-38.  Passed 9-20-82.)

(Ord. 82-38.  Passed 9-20-82; Ord. 88-12.  Passed 6-20-88.)
1248.05   MINIMUM STANDARDS; GENERAL PROHIBITIONS; ANNEXATIONS.
   The regulations for each district set forth by this Zoning Code shall be
minimum regulations and shall apply uniformly to each class or kind of
structure or land, except that:
   (a)   No building, structure or land shall be used or occupied, and no
building or structure or part thereof shall be erected, constructed,
reconstructed, moved or structurally altered, except in conformity with all of
the regulations specified in this Zoning Code for the district in which the
building, structure or land is located.
   (b)   No building or other structure shall be erected or altered to provide
for greater height or bulk, to accommodate or house a greater number of

other manner be contrary thereto.
   (c)   No yard or lot existing at the time of passage of this Zoning Code
shall be reduced in dimension or area below the minimum requirements set forth

the minimum requirements set forth herein.
   (d)   Whenever any area is annexed to the City, the following conditions
will apply:
      (1)   Land that is zoned prior to annexation shall be classified as being
in whichever district that most closely conforms with the zoning that existed
prior to annexation. Such classification shall be recommended for an interim
period by the Planning Board to the City Council, and the Council shall take
action upon the recommendation of the Planning Board after a public hearing.
      (2)   Land not zoned prior to annexation shall be classified in the same
manner into whichever district of this Code most closely conforms with the
existing use of the annexed area, or in accordance with the Comprehensive Plan
in the case of vacant land.
      (3)   In all cases, within three months after the effective date of
annexation, the Planning Board shall recommend the appropriate permanent zoning
districts for such area to the City Council, and the map shall be amended
according to the prescribed procedure set forth in Chapter 1242 of this Zoning
Ordinance.
   The intent of this provision is for the City to promote the rezoning of
newly annexed land from its existing township zoning classification to a new
New Carlisle zone at the earliest date possible. The City Council may initiate
a rezoning of land annexed to the City or encourage the property owner to apply
to rezone the land.

establishing permitted uses under Chapters
1268 through
1278, where a use is not specifically listed, the Zoning Inspector shall
determine the appropriateness of a use in a particular zoning district
according to the purposes stated for the district. Nothing in this section
shall, however, prevent an appeal to the Board of Appeals from a decision of
the Zoning Inspector.

1278.01   INTENT.
   It is the policy of the Municipality to promote progressive development of
land and construction thereon by encouraging planned unit developments. R-PUD
Planned Unit Development Districts shall be approved in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this chapter.
(Ord. 82-38 . Passed 9-20-82 . )
1278.02   OBJECTIVES.
   The objectives for an R-PUD Planned Unit Development District are as follows
   (a)   A mixed choice of living and working environments by allowing a
variety of housing and building types and by permitting an increased density
per acre and a reduction in lot dimensions, building setbacks and area
requirements;
   (b)   A more useful pattern of open space and recreation areas;
   (c)   A development pattern which preserves and utilizes natural topography
and geographic features, scenic vistas and trees and other vegetation, and
which prevents the disruption of natural drainage patterns;
   (d)   A more efficient use of land than is generally achieved through
conventional development, resulting in substantial saving through shorter
utilities and streets; and
   (e)   A development pattern in harmony with the land use, transportation
facilities and community facilities objectives of the Comprehensive Plan.
   The Municipality is also prepared to accept a greater population density in
undeveloped areas than that reflected by present zoning, provided that the
developer can demonstrate that any increment of public cost clearly
attributable to increased densities will be compensated by the private
amenities and public benefits to be achieved by the plan of development.
(Ord. 82-38. Passed 9-20-82.)
1278.03   DESIGN STANDARDS; CONFLICTS OF LAW.
   Because of the special characteristics of planned unit developments, special
standards governing the development of land for this purpose are required.
Whenever there is a conflict or difference between the provisions of this
chapter and those of any other chapter in this Zoning Code, the provisions of
this chapter shall prevail. Subjects not covered by this chapter shall be
governed by the respective provisions found elsewhere in this Zoning Code. The
following design standards shall apply to all planned unit developments
   (a)   Underground utilities, including telephone and electrical systems, are
required in all planned unit developments. Appurtenances to these systems which
cannot be located underground may be exempted from this requirement, provided
that the Planning Board finds that such exemption will not violate the intent
or character of the proposed planned unit development.
   (b)   There shall be reserved within the tract to be developed on a planned
unit basis a land area of not less than fifteen percent of the entire tract for
use as common open space. Such open space shall not consist of isolated or
fragmented pieces of land which would serve no useful purpose. Included in such
open space may be such uses as pedestrian walkways, bikeways, park land, open
areas, drainageways, clubhouses, recreation facilities or other uses of an
essentially open character. Any off-street parking areas required in
conjunction with such open space uses shall not be counted as a portion of the
required open space. Ownership and disposition of such open space shall be as
specified in Section
1278.13.
   (c)   The minimum gross area of the tract to be developed as a planned unit
development shall conform to the following schedule
 
Type of PUD                         Area of Tract (in acres)
Residential                         20
Commercial                          5
Industrial                          30
Residential/ Commercial             30
Commercial/ Industrial              40
Residential/ Commercial/ Industrial 40
 
   When the planned unit development is a mixture of uses, the amount of land
devoted to commercial and/or industrial uses shall be determined by the
Planning Board.
(Ord. 82-38 . Passed 9-20-82. )
1278.04   RESIDENTIAL PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS.
   The following standards apply to all residential planned unit developments
   (a)   The lot area for each dwelling unit may be reduced by not more than
fifty percent from the minimum lot area required by the Residential District
which formerly governed the use of the site. If a Residential Planned Unit
Development District is proposed on a site not in a Residential District at the
time of the initial planned unit development application, the fifty percent
reduction shall be taken from the minimum lot area requirements of R-4 One and
Two-Family Residential Districts.
   (b)   Front yard setbacks, side yard widths and rear yard depths may be
adjusted in accordance with subsection (a) hereof at the discretion of the
Planning Board.
   (c)   Residential dwelling types may be intermixed so long as the maximum
gross density established pursuant to subsection (a) hereof is not exceeded. In
areas where townhouses are used, there shall be no more than eight townhouse
units in any contiguous group.
   (d)   Every lot created in the planned unit development should be designed
to abut upon common open space or similar areas. Clustering of dwellings is
encouraged.
   (e)   For those lots which abut other zoning districts, the distance between
the dwelling and the side or rear lot line, whichever is applicable, shall be
increased by one foot for each foot the height of the dwelling exceeds the
maximum height for that type of dwelling in the Residential District which
previously governed the use of the site.
   (f)   Any residential use permitted by this Zoning Code shall be permitted

wall or other suitable barrier against unchanneled motor vehicle entrance or
exit, except for necessary accessways. Such a lot shall be designed so as not
to require vehicles to back out onto the street, and the capacity of the lot
shall be sufficient to provide adequate storage area and distribution
facilities to prevent back-up of vehicles on the street while awaiting entry to
the lot.

to a public street shall be in accordance with the regulations of the
Department of Public Service and the Department of Public Safety and shall be
subject to review by such Departments.

professional or apartment development abuts a State highway, a traffic survey
therefor shall be previously approved by the Director of the Ohio Department of
Transportation. All streets in the vicinity of the development shall be
adequate to serve probable increases in traffic volume, and adequate
deceleration lanes and similar facilities shall be provided where desirable.
   (f)   All driveways, aisles, maneuvering spaces, vehicular service areas or
spaces between or about buildings, other than those relating to a dwelling,
shall be adequately illuminated.
   (g)   All outside lighting, including sign lighting, shall be directed in

1282.01   INTENT.
   Within the districts established by this Zoning Code, there exist lots,
structures, uses of land and structures and characteristics of use which were
lawful before this Zoning Code was passed or amended, but which are prohibited,
regulated or restricted hereunder. It is the intent of this Zoning Code to
permit these nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not to
encourage their survival. It is further the intent of this Zoning Code that
nonconformities are not enlarged upon, expanded or extended, or used as grounds
for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district.
(Ord. 82-38. Passed 9-20-82.)
1282.02   INCOMPATIBILITY OF NONCONFORMING USES; EXCEPTIONS.
   (a)   Nonconforming uses are incompatible with permitted uses in the
districts in which such nonconforming uses are located. A nonconforming use of
a structure, a nonconforming use of land or a nonconforming use of a structure
and land in combination shall not be extended or enlarged after passage or
amendment of this Zoning Code by attachment on a building or premises of
additional signs intended to be seen from off the premises, or by the addition
of other uses of a nature which would generally be prohibited in the district
in which such use is located.
   (b)   To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this Zoning Code shall be deemed
to require a change in the plans, construction or designated use of a building
on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this Zoning Code (Ordinance 82-38, passed September
20, 1982) and upon which actual building construction has been carried on
diligently.
(Ord. 82-38. Passed 9-20-82.)
1282.03   SINGLE NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.
   In a district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, a single-
family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on a single
lot of record at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Zoning
Code (Ordinance 82-38, passed September 20, 1982), notwithstanding limitations
imposed by other provisions of this Zoning Code. Such lot must be in separate
ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots of the same ownership.
This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements
for area or width, or both, that are generally applicable in the district,
provided that yard dimensions and requirements other than those applying to the
area or width, or both, of the lot shall conform to the regulations for the
district in which such lot is located. Variance of yard requirements shall be
obtained through action of the Board of Appeals.
(Ord. 82-38. Passed 9-20-82.)
1282.04   NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD IN COMBINATION.
   If two or more lots or a combination of lots and portions of lots with
continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at the time of passage or
amendment of this Zoning Code (Ordinance 82-38, passed September 20, 1982), and
if all or part of the lots with no buildings do not meet the requirements
established for lot width and area for the district in which they are located,
the lands involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the
purposes of this Zoning Code and no portion of such parcel shall be used or
sold in a manner which diminishes compliance with lot width and area
requirements established by this Zoning Code, nor shall any division of a
parcel be made which creates a lot with a width or area less than the
requirements stated in this Zoning Code.
(Ord. 82-38. Passed 9-20-82.)
1282.05   NONCONFORMING USES OF LAND.
   Where, at the time of adoption or amendment of this Zoning Code (Ordinance
82-38, passed September 20, 1982), lawful uses of land exist which would not be
permitted by the regulations imposed by this Zoning Code, the uses may be
continued so long as they remain otherwise lawful, subject to the following
provisions:
   (a)   No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged, increased or extended to
occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this Zoning Code.
   (b)   No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any
portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such use at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this Zoning Code.
   (c)   If any such nonconforming use of land is voluntarily discontinued for
a period of more than six months, any subsequent use of such land shall conform
to the regulations specified by this Zoning Code for the district in which such
land is located.
   (d)   No additional structure not conforming to this Zoning Code shall be
erected in connection with such nonconforming use of land.
(Ord. 82-38. Passed 9-20-82.)
1282.06   NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this Zoning Code (Ordinance 82-38, passed September 20, 1982) that
could not be built under this Zoning Code by reason of restrictions on area,
lot coverage, height, yards, location on the lot, bulk, minimum parking area or
other requirements concerning the structure, such structure may be continued so
long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
   (a)   No such nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way
which increases its nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be
altered to decrease its nonconformity.

   If a lawful use involving individual structures, or of a structure and
premises in combination, exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment
of this Zoning Code (Ordinance 82-38, passed September 20, 1982) that would not
be allowed in the district in which it is located under this Zoning Code, the
lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to
the following provisions:
   (a)   No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this Zoning
Code in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended,
constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered, except in changing
the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is
located.
   (b)   A nonconforming use may be extended throughout any part of a building
which was manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption
or amendment of this Zoning Code (Ordinance 82-38, passed September 20, 1982),
but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building.
   (c)   If no structural alterations are made, a nonconforming use of a
structure, or a structure and premises in combination, may be changed to
another less nonconforming use, provided that the Board of Appeals finds that
the proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate, to the district in
which the use is located than the existing nonconforming use. In permitting
such change, the Board shall require appropriate conditions and safeguards in
accordance with other provisions of this Zoning Code.
   (d)   A structure, or a structure and premises in combination, in or on
which a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter
conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located, and the
nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed.
   (e)   When a nonconforming use of a structure, or a structure and premises
in combination, is voluntarily discontinued or abandoned for more than six
months, except when government action impedes access to the premises, the
structure, or structure and premises in combination, shall not thereafter be
used except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is
located.
   (f)   Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and premises in
combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the
nonconforming status of the premises.
(Ord. 82-38. Passed 9-20-82.)
1282.08   REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE.
   In the case of a nonconforming structure, or a portion of a structure
containing a nonconforming use, work may be done on ordinary repairs, or on
repair or replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing,
provided that the cubic content of the structure when it became nonconforming
is not increased. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent the
strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of a building or part thereof
declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public
safety, upon order of such official.
(Ord. 82-38. Passed 9-20-82.)
1282.09   CONDITIONAL USES.
   Except in the case of a use permitted under Section
1282.07, any use which is permitted as a conditional use in a district under
this Zoning Code shall not be deemed a nonconforming use in such district, but
shall without further action be considered a conforming use.
(Ord. 82-38. Passed 9-20-82.)
1282.10   MASTER LIST OF NONCONFORMITIES.
   The Zoning Inspector shall compile and maintain a master list of all the
nonconforming lots of record, structures and uses of land or structures in the
Municipality. Such master list shall be updated on an annual basis through a
review of rezoning cases and their disposition, resurveys and resubdivision of
land. The Inspector shall use field inspection to compile the initial master
list. In January of each year the Inspector shall notify those property owners
in the Municipality with nonconformities of their status as nonconforming lots
of record, structures or uses of land or structures.

1290.01   INTENT.
   It is the intent of this chapter to establish reasonable regulations
governing the size, character and location of signs within the City of New
Carlisle, in the interest of the safety and general welfare of its citizens,
business concerns, and other affected sectors of the community. It is intended
to protect property values, create a more attractive economic and business
climate, enhance and protect the physical appearance of the community, and
preserve the scenic and natural beauty of designated areas. It is further
intended to reduce sign distractions and sight obstructions that may contribute
to traffic accidents, reduce hazards that may be caused by signs overhanging or
projecting over public rights-of-way, to provide more open space, and to
curtail the deterioration of the natural environment and to enhance community
development.

illumination of more than two foot-candles on contiguous properties.
      (2)   Flashing illumination or illumination that involves movement or
causes the illusion of movement resulting from the arrangement of lighting, is
prohibited. This provision shall not be interpreted to preclude signs providing
such public information as time, temperature, stock market indexes, etc.

graphics normally associated with that business, the surface area of the
structural supports and/or architectural embellishments that resemble such a
graphic shall be included in the calculation of the sign area.
   (b)   If a sign face is not enclosed by a frame or an outline, the sum of
the areas around and enclosing each graphic along the sign face (as determined
by calculating the area of the smallest single parallelogram, triangle, circle,
or trapezoid which would completely enclose the area in question) shall be the
area of the sign.
   (c)   If the sign is composed of more than one sign face, the area enclosing
the sum of the sign faces shall be the area of the sign.
   (d)   Where matter is displayed in a random or unconnected manner, without

or window) shall be measured by calculating the area of the smallest single
rectangle which would completely enclose all elements of the sign.
   (f)   In computing allowable area for signs on corner lots, either frontage
may be used in determining the total permitted sign area.

1294.01   STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution grants municipalities the
legal authority to adopt land use and control measures for promoting the
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens.
(Ord. 09-59.  Passed 11-16-09.)
1294.02   FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The City of New Carlisle has special flood hazard areas that are subject to
periodic  inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or
otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. In
order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes
hereinafter set forth, these regulations are adopted.
(Ord. 09-59.  Passed 11-16-09.)
1294.03   STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety
and general welfare, and to:
   (a)   Protect human life and health;
   (b)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (c)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (d)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (e)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (f)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
   (g)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions;
   (h)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near flood-prone areas;
   (i)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
   (j)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values
of the floodplain;
   (k)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible; and
   (l)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(Ord. 09-59.  Passed 11-16-09.)
1294.04   METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods and
provisions for:
   (a)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (b)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (c)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (d)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and
   (e)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
(Ord. 09-59.  Passed 11-16-09.)
1294.05   LANDS TO WHICH THESE REGULATIONS APPLY.
   These regulations shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within
the jurisdiction of the City as identified in Section
1294.06, including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by
City.
(Ord. 09-59.  Passed 11-16-09.)
1294.06   BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.
   (a)   For the purposes of these regulations, the following studies and / or
maps are adopted:

1294.07   ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   These regulations are not intended to repeal any existing ordinances
including subdivision regulations, zoning or building codes. In the event of a
conflict between these regulations and any other ordinance, the more
restrictive shall be followed. These regulations shall not impair any deed
restriction covenant or easement but the land subject to such interests shall
also be governed by the regulations.
(Ord. 09-59.  Passed 11-16-09.)
1294.08   INTERPRETATION.
   In the interpretation and application of these regulations, all provisions
shall be:
   (a)   Considered as minimum requirements;
   (b)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
   (c)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a State or Federal law, such State or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
(Ord. 09-59.  Passed 11-16-09.)
1294.09   WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. These regulations do
not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. These regulations
shall not create liability on the part of the City, any officer or employee
thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that
results from reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision
lawfully made thereunder.
(Ord. 09-59.  Passed 11-16-09.)
1294.10   SEVERABILITY.
   Should any section or provision of these regulations be declared by the
courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the
validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof other than the part
so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 09-59.  Passed 11-16-09.)
1294.11   DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (1)   “Accessory structure.” A structure on the same lot with, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (2)   “Appeal.”  A request for review of the Floodplain Administrator's
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a

the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, and
usually expressed in feet mean sea level (MSL). In Zone AO areas, the base
flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number (from one
to three feet).

   (8)   “Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management).”  Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no Federally-assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (9)   “Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).”  The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (10)   “Fill.”  A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (11)   “Flood” or “flooding.”  A general and temporary condition of partial
or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      A.   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      B.   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (12)   “Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM).”  Usually the initial map,
produced by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special
flood hazard areas.
   (13)   “Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM).”  An official map on which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (14)   “Flood Insurance Risk Zones.”  Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs
that indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a
community. Following are the zone definitions:
      A.   Zone A:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
base flood elevations are not determined.
      B.   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the
100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.

levees from the base flood.
      G.   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded): Areas determined to be outside the
500-year floodplain.
   (15)   “Flood Insurance Study (FIS).” The official report in which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (16)   “Flood Protection Elevation.”  The Flood Protection Elevation, or
FPE, is the base flood elevation. In areas where no base flood elevations exist
from any authoritative source, the flood protection elevation can be historical
flood elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the
Floodplain Administrator.
   (17)   “Floodway.” 
      A.   A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
      B.   The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually
characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters,
high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion
forces.
   (18)   “Freeboard.”  A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a
flood level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway
conditions, such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice
jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (19)   “Historic structure.”  Any structure that is:
      A.   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      B.   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      C.   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      D.   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by City of New Carlisle's historic preservation program, which program is
certified by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (20)   “Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis.”  An analysis
performed by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in
accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to
determine flood elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (21)   “Letter of Map Change (LOMC).”  A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
      A.   “Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA).”  A revision based on technical
data showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special
flood hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map
and establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood
hazard area.
      B.   “Letter of Map Revision (LOMR).”  A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      C.   “Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR).”  A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (22)   “Lowest floor.”  The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an “enclosure
below the lowest floor” which is an unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area
other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance
with the applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for
enclosures below the lowest floor.
   (23)   “Manufactured home.”  A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term “manufactured home” does not include a recreational vehicle. For the
purposes of these regulations, a “manufactured home” includes manufactured
homes and mobile homes as defined in Ohio R.C. Chapter 3733.
   (24)   “Manufactured home park.”  As specified in the Ohio Administrative
Code 3701-27-01, a “manufactured home park” means any tract of land upon which
three or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free
of charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building,
structure, vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the
facilities of the park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual
lots are not for rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of
installation of manufactured homes on the lots, is not a “manufactured home
park,” even though three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the
roadways are dedicated to the local government authority.
   (25)   “National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).”  The NFIP is a Federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a fmancial protection against
flood loss.
   (26)   “New construction.”  Structures for which the start of construction
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of New Carlisle
Flood Insurance Rate Map, September 1, 1986, and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
   (27)   “Person.”  Includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including State and
local governments and agencies. An “agency” is further defined in Ohio R.C.
111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not limited
to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council,
institution, State college or university, community college district, technical
college district, or State community college. “Agency” does not include the
general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general's department, or
any court.
   (28)   “Recreational vehicle.”  A vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be se1f-propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but
as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal
use.
   (29)   “Registered professional architect.”  A person registered to engage
in the practice of architecture under the provisions of Ohio R.C. 4703.01 to
4703.19.
   (30)   “Registered professional engineer.”  A person registered as a
professional engineer under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4733.
   (31)   “Registered professional surveyor.”  A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4733.
   (32)   “Special flood hazard area.”  Also known as “area of special flood
hazard”, it is the land in the floodplain subject to a 1% or greater chance of
flooding in any given year. “Special flood hazard areas” are designated by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. “Special flood hazard areas” may
also refer to areas that are flood-prone and designated from other Federal,
State or local sources of data, including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood-prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (33)   “Start of construction.”  The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual “start of construction” means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (34)   “Structure.”  A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas
or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (35)   “Substantial damage.”  Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred.
   (36)   “Substantial improvement.”  Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure before the start of
construction of the improvement. This term includes structures which have
incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      A.   Any improvement to a structure that is considered new construction;
      B.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of State or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local Code Enforcement Official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      C.   Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration
would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic
structure.
   (37)   “Variance.”  A grant of relief from the standards of these
regulations consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (38)   “Violation.”  The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations.

1294.21   MAP MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES.
   To meet National Flood Insurance Program minimum requirements to have flood
data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to ensure that City flood maps, studies
and other data identified in Section
1294.06 accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
   (a)   Requirement to Submit New Technical Data.
      (1)   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations or
base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
         A.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
         B.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
         C.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
         D.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section
1294.27.
      (2)   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with Section

more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations but
no floodway.
      (4)   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to Section
1294.21(a)(1).
   (b)   Right to Submit New Technical Data.  The Floodplain Administrator may
request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that does
not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations, such
as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include appropriate
supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor, and may be submitted at
any time.
   (c)   Annexation/Detachment.  Upon occurrence, the Floodplain Administrator
shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the City have been
modified by annexation or the community has assumed authority over an area, or
no longer has authority to adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations
for a particular area. In order that the City Flood Insurance Rate Map
accurately represent the City boundaries, include within such notification a
copy of a map of the City of New Carlisle suitable for reproduction, clearly
showing the new corporate limits or the new area for which the City has assumed
or relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
(Ord. 09-59.  Passed 11-16-09.)

floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
Federal, State, or other source.
   (b)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA flood
maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and floodway
boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width and/or
lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased base
flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood maps
and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (c)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
      (1)   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
      (2)   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
   (d)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where needed,
as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special flood
hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the boundary
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as
provided in Sections
1294.34 through
1294.39, Appeals and Variances.
   (e)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and field
elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection elevations
(as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established high water
marks, etc.) shall prevail.
(Ord. 09-59.  Passed 11-16-09.)
1294.23   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE DETERMINATIONS.
   (a)   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including

Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   (b)   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
Federal, State, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
increased cost of compliance insurance claims.

1294.33   ASSURANCE OF FLOOD-CARRYING CAPACITY.
   Pursuant to the purpose and methods of reducing flood damage stated in these
regulations, the following additional standards are adopted to assure that the
reduction of the flood-carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
   (a)   Development in Floodways.
      (1)   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
      (2)   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
         A.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1294.21(a);
         B.   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
         C.   Certification that no structures are located in areas that would
be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
         D.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
          E.   Concurrence of the Mayor and the Chief Executive Officer of any
other communities impacted by the proposed actions.
   (b)   Development in Riverine Areas with Base Flood Elevations but No
Floodways.
      (1)   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than one foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a floodplain
development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer, demonstrating that
this standard has been met; or
      (2)   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted, provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
         A.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an increase
of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why these
alternatives are not feasible;
         B.   Section
1294.33(a)(2)A. and C. through E.
   (c)   Alterations of a Watercourse.  For the purpose of these regulations, a
watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the “bankfull
stage.” The field determination of “bankfull stage” shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
      (1)   The bankfull flood-carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood-carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
      (2)   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      (3)   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood- carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the
City specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is required,
it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
      (4)   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical data
in Section
1294.21(a)(1)C. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.
(Ord. 09-59.  Passed 11-16-09.)
1294.34   APPEALS BOARD ESTABLISHED.

of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be granted a hearing on
the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such person shall file,
within 20 days of the date of such notice and order, or other official action,
a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for the mitigation of any
item appearing on any order of the Floodplain Administrator's decision. Such
appeal shall be in writing, signed by the applicant, and be filed with the
Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the appeal, the Floodplain
Administrator shall transmit said notice and all pertinent information on which
the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made to the Appeals Board.
   (b)   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
(Ord. 09-59.  Passed 11-16-09.)
1294.37   VARIANCES.
   Any person believing that the use and development standards of these
regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an application for a
variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to authorize, in specific
cases, such variances from the standards of these regulations, not inconsistent
with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary to the public interest where,
owning to special conditions of the lot or parcel, a literal enforcement of the
provisions of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship.
   (a)   Application for a Variance.
      (1)   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
      (2)   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
      (3)   All applications for a variance shall be accompanied by a variance
application fee set in the schedule of fees adopted the City.
   (b)   Public Hearing.  At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
      (1)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
      (2)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage.
      (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
      (4)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community.
      (5)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use that
are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
      (6)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
      (7)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development.
      (8)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area.
      (9)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles.
      (10)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
      (11)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
   (c)   Variances Shall Only Be Issued Upon:
      (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
      (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
      (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
      (4)   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
      (5)   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
   (d)   Other Conditions for Variances.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section
1294.37(b)(1) through (11) have been fully considered. As the lot size
increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for
issuing the variance increases.
      (3)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance will
be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.
(Ord. 09-59.  Passed 11-16-09.)
1294.38   PROCEDURE AT HEARINGS.
   (a)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
   (b)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.

1422.01   1995 EDITION ADOPTED.
   Pursuant to Ohio R.C. 731.231, there is hereby adopted by and for the
Municipality the Ohio Basic Building Code (OBBC), being particularly the 1995
edition thereof, as adopted by the Ohio Board of Building Standards, Department
of Industrial Relations, and as published in Division 4101:2 of the Ohio
Administrative Code (OAC), save and except such portions thereof as may be
hereinafter amended or deleted.
1422.02   PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the OBBC, as adopted in Section
1422.01, is to:
   (a)   Provide uniform minimum standards and requirements for the erection,
construction, repair, alteration and maintenance of buildings, including
construction of industrialized units, such standards relating to the
conservation of energy, safety and sanitation of buildings for their intended
use and occupancy;
   (b)   Formulate such standards and requirements, so far as is practical, in
terms of performance objectives, so as to make adequate performance for the use
intended the test of acceptability;
   (c)   Permit, to the fullest extent feasible, the use of materials and
technical methods, devices and improvements, including the use of
industrialized units, which tend to reduce the cost of construction and
erection without affecting minimum requirements for the health, safety and
security of the occupants or users of buildings or industrialized units and
without preferential treatment of types or classes of materials or products or
methods of construction; and
   (d)   Encourage, so far as may be practical, the standardization of
construction practices, methods, equipment, material and techniques, including
methods employed to produce industrialized units.

approved prior to the effective date of the OBBC;
   (e)   Buildings or structures which are incident to the use for agricultural
purposes of the land on which said buildings or structures are located,

crop year on farms owned or operated by the seller (see Ohio R.C. 3781.06 and
3781.061);
   (f)   Agricultural labor camps as defined in Ohio R.C. 3733.41;

the people shall prevail.

property in the City, the Director or Officer or his or her designee, in the
name of Council, shall cause written notice to be served upon the owner or any
other person having charge of such land, including lienholders, directing that
such public nuisance be abated within ten days after service of such notice. No

such notice within those ten days. Should the public nuisance not be abated at
the expiration of the time stated in the notice or order of the Director of
Public Service or his or her designee or Planning Director or his or her

granted or such additional time as the Board of Zoning Appeals may grant, the

this Exterior Property Maintenance Code. The Director or his or her designated
representative, is authorized to salvage any items, materials or property
seized or derived from abatement of a nuisance and sell such at private or
public sale at the best price obtainable and apply the proceeds to any costs
incurred from abating the nuisance at the subject property. In abating such
public nuisance, the Director of Public Service or his or her designee or
Planning Director or his or her designee or Enforcement Officer or his or her
designee may call on any department, division, or contractor of the City for
whatever assistance may be necessary to abate the aforesaid public nuisance or
may, by private contract, abate such public nuisance and the cost of the
contract will be paid for from City funds. All costs for abating such public
nuisance shall be recovered from the owner of the property in the manner
specified in subsection (b) below.
   (a)   Cost of noncompliance.  The charge for the necessary labor to abate
said public nuisance shall be as follows:
      (1)   Seventy-five dollars ($75.00) per hour per City employee or the
total cost the City is charged if a private contractor abates said public
nuisance.

additional fifty dollars ($50.00) if a contractor is used for the abatement.
      (3)   Two hundred dollars ($200.00) disposal fee or ten dollars ($10.00)
per day storage fee, up to a maximum of 30 days and three hundred dollars
($300.00). Items not reclaimed after 30 days will be disposed of by the City
and the ten dollar ($10.00) per day disposal fee shall apply.
   (b)   Collection of costs.
      (1)   The owner(s) shall be billed directly by certified mail deposited

certificate of mailing which shall be filed by the Director of Public Service
or his or her designee or Planning Director or his or her designee or
Enforcement Officer or his or her designee.
      (2)   The amount of the assessment shall be delivered to the City within
ten days after notice of the assessment was so served. If the City has not
received payment of the assessment within those ten days, the City shall make a
written return or certification to the County Auditor of the amount of the
unpaid assessment, plus an additional administrative charge of ten percent
(10%), including with that certification a proper description of the premises.
The assessed amount shall be entered upon the tax duplicate and shall be a lien
upon such land from and after the date of the entry and shall be collected as
other taxes and returned to the City with the General Fund.
      (3)   Nothing in this subsection (b) shall be construed to limit the
right of the City of pursue collection of aforesaid costs by legal action in a
court of competent jurisdiction.
   (c)   Repeat Violators. 
      (1)   For the second violation of the same general character occurring
not sooner than fourteen days and not later than 12 months after the previous
violation, the written notice contained in the first paragraph hereof may be
omitted and a violation notice, specifying that the violation shall be
corrected within 72 hours of receipt of said violation notice, shall be
personally served upon the owner or other person or entity as specified in the
first paragraph hereof, or posted on the premises if the owner or other person
or entity as specified in the first paragraph hereof cannot be located. If the
violation is not corrected by the specified compliance date by the owner or
other person or entity under the first paragraph hereof, the Director of Public
Service or his or her designee or Planning Director or his or her designee or
Enforcement Officer or his or her designee shall cause such public nuisance to
be removed at the expense of the owner of that land, and may employ the
necessary labor at the rate specified under subsection (a) hereof, along with
an administrative fee specified under subsection (a) hereof. Such fees shall be
assessed against the land as specified under subsection (b)(1) and (2) hereof.

designee shall cause such public nuisance to be removed at the expense of the
