The Director of the Department of Water and Wastewater, with the assent

paid annually for the supply of water or for benefits resulting therefrom to
be called "water rents," which shall be apportioned to the different classes
of buildings and vacant lots in said City with reference to their dimensions,
values, exposure to fires, ordinary uses for dwellings, stores, shops, stables
and other purposes, number of families or occupants or consumption of
water, as near as may be practicable and according to the judgment and
discretion of such Director; and may from time to time, with the approval of
the City Council, alter, amend, modify and increase or diminish such rents
in said scale and extend it to other descriptions of buildings, establishments
or uses; but the rents shall be so fixed and kept that the aggregate annual
amount collected therefrom, together with the special rates hereinafter
provided, shall be at all times equal to at least 4% on the then-existing
water debt of said City over and above all expenses or repairs, maintenance,
management and salaries; but before any such annual rents shall be fixed,
established or increased by said Director, he shall give three days' public
notice in the official newspaper that he has prepared a proposed scale of
water rents and that the same is subject to the inspection of any resident
of said City for the period of at least three days at a place to be named
by said Director and that he will be present at the time and place, which
shall be named in such notice, for the consideration of such proposed scale
and for the hearing and consideration of any complaint that may be then
or there made thereto by any resident of said City. At the time and place
so appointed, he shall hear the complaints and allegations of all parties
interested and may take proof in relation thereto and may confirm and
adopt said proposed scale without alteration or with such alteration as
he may deem proper, except that he shall not increase any rate or rates.

situated within 1,000 feet of some distributing pipe or main and also from
the owners of all vacant lots situated in like manner for benefits resulting
from the introduction of water in said City, and said regular water rents
shall be, like state and county taxes, a lien and charge upon such houses,
buildings and lots as is herein provided. (12-27-1988 by L.L. No. 6-1988, § 1)
§ C2-10. Special rents; permit; rules and regulations.

any permit to use said water shall be given. No permit shall be longer
than one year at a time. All water rents and special rates shall be paid to
§ C2-8 CHARTER AND RELATED LEGISLATION § C2-10
C:7
the Supervisor of Receipts. The rules and regulations for the use of water
shall be printed on each permit and distributed to each house and building
supplied with water, which shall be notice to the owners or occupants. Any
penalty established by said Director and approved by the City Council for
any violation of such rules may be recovered in an action at law instituted by
said Director in the name of the City of Schenectady. The observance of said
rules may also be enforced by cutting off the supply of water. (12-27-1988
by L.L. No. 6-1988, § 1)
§ C2-11. Collection of delinquent water rents.
All water rents may be paid to the Supervisor of Receipts of said City
without any charge for collecting the same for 30 days after said Supervisor
shall have given public notice of receiving the assessment rolls in all the
daily newspapers published in said City, which notice it shall be his duty to
give immediately after receiving said assessment rolls. After the expiration
of said 30 days, the Supervisor of Receipts may issue his warrant under
his hand and the Seal of said City to an elector of said City who, when
appointed, shall be a collector of taxes of said City or to as many of them
as he shall deem necessary, not exceeding four, commanding said officer or
officers to collect said unpaid water rents in such manner as is provided
by law for the collection of taxes by distress and sale and to pay the
same to the City Supervisor of Receipts and return such warrant within 30
days after the receipt thereof, unless the time for the return thereof shall
have been extended by the endorsement thereon by said Supervisor. Such
collector or collectors shall, prior to the delivery of said warrants, make
and execute a bond to the City of Schenectady, approved by the Mayor and
Supervisor of Receipts as to form and efficiency, conditioned for the faithful
performance of all his duties as required by law for collection of taxes. Such
collector shall proceed in the same manner and shall have the same power
and authority for the collection of water rents as is prescribed by law for
collectors of taxes. (12-27-1988 by L.L. No. 6-1988, § 1)
§ C2-12. Enforcement of collection.
All water rents which shall remain unpaid at the expiration of 60 days
from the time of the publication of the aforesaid notice by the Supervisor
of Receipts of the City of his receipt of the assessment rolls shall have
added to them 1% of the amount for each month that the same shall remain
unpaid after said 60 days, the collection of which shall be enforced with the
original assessment. The collection of any such assessment may be enforced
by a sale of the building or lot assessed. Notice of sale shall, in all other
respects, be the same and shall be given in the same manner, and the same
proceedings for a sale shall be had and the building or lot shall be sold in the
same manner and upon the same terms and conditions of sale, and the same
conveyance shall be given and the same title acquired by the purchaser as
are prescribed by law for the sale of lands for unpaid taxes in said City.
The Supervisor of Receipts of the City shall, on the first day of each month
and at such other times as he may be requested, report to said Director
§ C2-10 SCHENECTADY CODE § C2-12
C:8
all payments of water rents and special rates made or collected during the
preceding month. (12-27-1988 by L.L. No. 6-1988, § 1)
§ C2-13. Disposition of water rents; accounts; tax levy for bonds.
The water rents collected as hereinbefore provided shall be paid into the
Supervisor of Receipts, and the Supervisor of Receipts shall keep a separate
account of the rents so received and all the payments made in each year
for operating the City waterworks and making repairs or alterations to the
same and the extension of the water mains and the salaries and wages
of officers, agents and employees and other expenses connected with the
waterworks system. The Supervisor of Receipts shall make a detailed
statement of the amount so received and the payments so made to the City
Council. The City Council shall apply the surplus remaining after making
such payments to the payment of the principal and interest on the bonds
issued for the construction, extension and improvement of the waterworks
system and the increase in the water supply as they become due. The City
Council shall cause to be raised by tax upon the property within the district
in said City supplied with water by such works, in the mode provided by law
for the raising of money by taxing for the payment of the general expenses
of said City, all such sums as shall be necessary to pay such bonds and the
interest thereon as they become due after deducting all moneys on hand
applicable thereto. At the time that the annual tax budget is presented to
the City Council, there shall be presented a statement showing the amount
of money to be raised by tax upon the property in such district for the
purpose of paying the principal and interest of such bonds as they become
due, and it shall be the duty of the City Council of the City of Schenectady to
cause such amount to be levied upon the property, real and personal in such
district, which shall be paid to the Supervisor of Receipts of said City in the
same manner and by the same means as taxes for the general expenses of
the City are now required by law to be collected and paid. (12-27-1988 by

such assessment, together with the interest due and accrued thereon,
shall not be paid when it shall become due and payable, as above
provided, the Council of the City of Schenectady may direct its
collection in the manner herein provided. In case of a sale of the land

through the mail, five days' notice of such intended correction, addressed
to the party interested, if he be a resident of the City, and be known, or to
the agent, if known, or any nonresident, to make the required correction;
and the apportionment and assessment thus corrected shall be collected in
any of the work and improvements authorized by the City Council,
except when the same are made by ordinance or law a City charge,
among all the houses and lots, vacant lots and franchises intended
to be benefited by such work and improvements, in proportion to the
advantage which each shall be deemed to acquire, specifying the names
of the owners or occupants, if known, or as they appear upon the tax
rolls in the office of the Department of Assessment and Taxation, of the
houses and lots or vacant lots and franchises intended to be benefited.
D. When the Board of Assessors shall have completed said apportionment
and assessment, it shall cause a notice of the same to be published in
the official newspaper of the City of Schenectady for five days, during
which time said apportionment and assessment shall be open for
inspection and examination by any person or persons interested; and on

address stated in such written application, which notice shall state the
time and place of a hearing to be held in the matter. After such hearing
and consideration of the objections presented, the Board may review

shall have confirmed the same, which confirmation must be had at a
regular meeting of the Board, as hereinbefore fixed, an abstract of the
apportionment and assessment, so approved and confirmed, shall be
filed with the City Treasurer and shall be binding and conclusive upon
the owner or owners, occupant or occupants of the houses and lots,
vacant lots and franchises mentioned and referred to in said
apportionment; and said apportionment shall be and remain a lien upon

the time of such confirmation until the said apportionment and
assessment shall be paid or satisfied; provided, however, that if the
assessment or apportionment is changed upon any hearing had

been given by publication, as above provided for, that the assessment
and apportionment as changed will be open to inspection, under which

like manner in all respects as the original apportionment and assessment.
(L. 1907, Ch. 756, § 48; L. 1931, Ch. 411, § 1)
§ C3-16. Notice to pay assessments.
Upon the filing by the Board of Assessors with the City Treasurer of the
apportionment and assessment, as approved and confirmed by said Board,
it shall be the duty of the City Treasurer to publish a notice in the official
newspaper once a week for four successive weeks that said report of
apportionment and assessment has been filed with him and requiring all
persons owning lands upon which any assessment is made therein to pay
the City Treasurer the amount assessed upon said lands, within a time to be
stated in said notice, which time shall not be less than four nor more than
six weeks from the first publication thereof. (L. 1907, Ch. 756, § 49; L. 1931,
Ch. 411, § 1)
§ C3-17. Collection of delinquent special assessments by sale of
lien.
In case the assessment upon any lot or parcel of land contained in said
apportionment and assessment shall remain unpaid for a period of six
months from the due date thereof, as aforesaid, the collection of such
unpaid assessments, including those of the Downtown Parking Lot
Assessment District, shall be enforced by sale of liens on the lands so
assessed, as hereinafter provided in this section. The Director of Finance
shall cause a notice to be published once in each of the official newspapers
of the City of Schenectady, requiring the owner of any lot or parcel of land
so assessed to pay the Director of Finance the amount of said assessment
with interest thereon from the expiration of the time originally limited for
the payment thereof, as aforesaid, at the rate of 1% per month for special
assessments and of 1 1/2% per month for Downtown Special Assessment
District. Within a time to be stated in such notice, which shall be not less
than four nor more than eight weeks from the publication thereof, and
that if default be made in such payment, the liens on each of such lots or
parcels will be sold at auction, at the front door of the City Hall in the City
of Schenectady, at a time therein to be specified. If the owner or owners
of any of the lot or lots shall refuse or neglect to pay such assessments
thereon, with interest, costs and charges for the publication of said notices
as aforesaid, before the time of sale, mentioned in such notice, the Director
of Finance, at the time and place stated for such sale, or to which said
sale may by him be adjourned, shall sell the liens on such lots at auction.
The Corporation Counsel shall attend such sale and purchase, in the name
of the City, all liens on the lots or parcels of land so offered for sale. The
City shall be the sole bidder allowed at such sales. The owner or owners of
any lot or parcel of land so sold and all persons interested therein may, at
any time within one year from such sale, redeem said real estate by paying
to said Director of Finance the sum bid for the same, with 12% interest
thereon from the time of sale, or may redeem any part thereof, which shall
be assessed separately, by paying a like proportional part of the charges

§ C3-18. Vacating illegal assessments; reassessments.
Whenever it shall be determined by the judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction that any assessment authorized by this article is illegal or void
for want of jurisdiction, or for any other cause, the City Council may pass
an ordinance designating the work so made or done, the whole expense
thereof, and the part or portion of the City deemed to be benefited thereby,
or equitably chargeable with the costs and expense thereof, and may assess
the several lots or parcels of land in the territory so designated in said
ordinance, according to the benefits received in the proportion in which
they are equitably chargeable therefor; and the same proceedings shall be
had for the enforcement and collection of such assessment, as in case of
other assessments which are properly made in the first instance. In case of
a reassessment under the provisions of this section, the City Council shall
cause a notice to be published in the official newspaper for at least five days
that it has made such reassessment and that it will meet, at a time and place
to be stated therein, to review the same and that all persons interested
therein, who shall then appear and desire to be heard, will be heard in
relation thereto. At the time and place so stated, or at such other time to
which the matter may be adjourned by a majority of all the members of the
City Council, then and there appearing, the City Council, after hearing all
persons interested who may desire to be heard, shall review and confirm or
modify the reassessment so made by it. The said assessment, so confirmed
or modified, shall be entered at length in the minutes of the City Council,
and an abstract of said assessment, so confirmed or modified, shall be filed
with the City Treasurer and shall be final and conclusive. Whenever any
money shall have been paid upon an assessment and a reassessment shall
have been made, in pursuance of this section, the amount so paid shall be
credited on such reassessment to the property for and on account of which
such payment was made, and in case of any alteration in the respective
amounts of the original assessment by such reassessment, whereby the
amount so paid shall exceed the amount reassessed on the same property,
the surplus shall be paid by the City to the person who paid the same,
or to his legal representatives or assigns, and in case the amount so paid
shall be insufficient to pay the amount so reassessed, the deficiency only
shall be collected under such reassessment, in the same manner as other
assessments. (L. 1907, Ch. 756, § 52; L. 1931, Ch. 411, § 1)
§ C3-19. Payment for local improvements under contract in

C:19
which does not exceed the sum of $3,000 and the cost and expense of
which is to be assessed in whole or in part upon the property benefited,
upon the presentation to the Director of Finance of a properly verified
claim setting forth an estimate and computation of work performed
under the provisions of such contract duly certified by the City
Engineer, the Director of Finance shall draw his warrant payable to
the order of the contractor, to the amount of 85% of the contract price
of the work actually done and performed as shown by said estimate
and computation and not theretofore paid, and the Director of Finance
shall pay the same out of any funds in his hands in advance and in
anticipation of the levy of the assessments for such improvement.
B. In case the aggregate amount to be paid under the terms of the contract
exceeds the sum of $3,000, money may be borrowed upon the faith and
credit of the City when authorized by the Board of Estimate and
Apportionment, to the extent required to pay such estimate and
computation, of the cost or any part of the cost of any such
improvement, or to repay any money borrowed hereunder with interest
thereon.
C. Temporary loan notes or certificates of indebtedness may be issued as
security for such borrowed moneys, such notes or certificates to be
signed in the name of the City by its Mayor and Treasurer and
countersigned by the Comptroller and to have the Corporate Seal
impressed thereon. They may be sold either at public or private sale, at
the option of the Comptroller, but at not less than par. The Comptroller
shall determine the date of issue and maturity.
D. The proceeds of the sale of such temporary loan notes or certificates of
indebtedness shall be deposited with the Treasurer and shall be used
only in payment of such estimate and computation as aforesaid. The
principal and interest thereof shall be paid from out of moneys collected
on assessments levied for the improvement or from the proceeds of the
sale of street improvement bonds or notes or sewer improvement bonds
or notes as hereinafter provided.
E. In case the assessment for any public improvement, including sewers,
shall be made payable in installments, as in this article provided, the
City Council shall cause to be executed the bonds or promissory notes
of the City, which shall be signed by the Mayor and the Treasurer and
countersigned by the Comptroller and shall be known as "street
improvement bonds or notes" or "sewer improvement bonds or notes,"
as the case may be, in such principal sums as shall be deemed
expedient.
F. Such bonds or notes shall bear interest at a rate not exceeding 5% per
annum, payable annually or semiannually, as the City Council shall
determine. The Comptroller shall sell such bonds or notes in the
manner provided by § 61 of the Second Class Cities Law. The proceeds
of the sale of such bonds or notes shall be used for no other purpose
than to defray the cost and expense of the improvement for which said

§ C3-20. Subdivided lands: reapportionment of assessments.
After any assessment or reassessment for street or other improvements has
been duly made and confirmed, the owner or owners of any piece or parcel
of land affected or covered by any such assessment who shall desire to
subdivide said land, or the owner or owners of any such subdivided part
or portion, may have the assessment or the portion or total amount of the
installments thereof still due and which is a lien thereon reapportioned or
assessed upon such subdivided part or portion in the manner hereinafter
provided. But no reapportionment shall be made under this and the
following section unless the City Engineer shall approve the map mentioned
in the next section, said map to be on the standard sized tracing, to the
scale, in the form and with the information required by said Engineer. (L.
1907, Ch. 756, § 54; L. 1931, Ch. 411, § 1)
§ C3-21. Subdivided lands: map required; division and
reassessment; release of lien.
The owner or owners of any such lands shall have a map or survey made
thereof, to be approved by the City Engineer, the original of which map shall
be filed and retained in the office of said Engineer, and shall have a copy
of said map filed in the office of the Treasurer of the City of Schenectady
and the Board of Assessors. And upon the request of any such owner or
owners, in writing, and upon the certificate of said Engineer that the said
map has been prepared and filed as aforesaid, the Board of Assessors shall
divide and reassess such portion of the original amount assessed upon
any larger lot and parcel of land as yet remains due and still a lien upon
such larger lot and parcel of land, and reapportion and reassess the same
upon such subdivided parts or portions in the same manner in which the
assessment shall be made, including any temporary loans with interest
thereon made under the authority hereof.
G. The principal and interest of such bonds or notes shall be paid by the
Treasurer as they respectively become due out of the amount collected
on the assessment on account of which they were made. Should there
not be sufficient money in the hands of the Treasurer collected upon
such assessment to pay the amount due on any such bond or note when
it becomes due, the comptroller shall borrow upon the note or notes of
the City the amount that is required to pay such deficiency, which notes
with interest thereon shall be paid out of the moneys finally collected on
such assessment, and if, at the end of six months after the last
installment of such assessment becomes due and payable, any of such
City notes given to raise money to pay a deficiency in the amount
collected upon such assessment, as above provided, shall remain
unpaid, the surplus of the amount due thereon for principal and interest
over the moneys in possession of the City Treasurer collected upon such
assessment shall be included in the annual tax budget and raised by tax
in the manner provided by law. (L. 1907, Ch. 756, § 53; L. 1931, Ch.
411, § 1; L. 1943, Ch. 710, § 914; L. 1945, Ch. 839, § 63)

original assessment was made, together with the proportionate amount of
legal interest and costs that have accrued on the original sum assessed
since the same became due and payable, and when such reassessments
have been confirmed by said Board of Assessors, such amounts as may be
so reapportioned, together with the proportion of the interest and costs
hereinbefore provided, shall be received by the City Treasurer of said City
in payment for and operate as a release of the lien created by the original
assessment so far as such lien may apply to such smaller or subdivision lot.
No such reassessment shall be made, after any such land shall have been
advertised for sale or sold by the City Treasurer of said City, upon the failure
of any owner or owners to pay the apportionment or assessment or any
installment or installments thereof which have heretofore become due and
payable. (L. 1907, Ch. 756, § 55; L. 1931, Ch. 411, § 1)
§ C3-22. Power of excess condemnation.
Whenever a portion only of any lots or parcels of land is necessary to be
acquired for the actual construction in the laying out, widening, extending
or relocating of parks, public places, highways or streets and the City
Council shall deem it necessary for the public interests to acquire so much
of the remaining portions of said lots or parcels of land as shall not exceed
in depth what is sufficient for suitable building sites abutting on said parks,
public places, highways or streets, the City shall have power to acquire
by gift, purchase or by condemnation such portions of said lots or parcels
of land as are actually required in the said construction, and, in addition
thereto, so much of the remaining portions of said lots or parcels of land
as are sufficient for said suitable building lots and, in its discretion, may
authorize the selling or leasing of said remaining portions after acquisition
of the same, subject to any restrictions deemed necessary for the public
benefit; provided, however, that any ordinance authorizing the acquisition
of any such excess property shall be approved by the Board of Estimate and
Apportionment. (L. 1907, Ch. 756, § 56; L. 1931, Ch. 411, § 1)4

Section 244 of Article 16, Chapter 55, Laws of 1909, as amended, entitled
"An Act in Relation to Cities of the Second Class, Constituting Chapter
53 of the Consolidated Laws," is hereby superseded and amended in its
application to the City of Schenectady to read as follows: "No civil action
shall be maintained against the City of Schenectady for damages or injuries
to person or property sustained in consequence of any street, highway,
bridge, culvert, sidewalk, crosswalk or park property, no matter where
situated, being defective, out of repair, unsafe, dangerous or obstructed,
in consequence of the existence of ice or snow thereon or out of repair,
defective, dangerous, unsafe or obstructed in any other way or manner or
by reason of any encumbrance thereon or attachment thereto being out
of repair, defective, unsafe, dangerous or obstructed or where any such
encumbrance or attachment by reason of its defective, unsafe or dangerous
condition creates an unsafe or dangerous condition on any street, highway,
bridge, culvert, sidewalk, crosswalk including any street, highway, bridge,
culvert, sidewalk, crosswalk located in any City park unless it is made to
appear that written notice thereof specifying the particular time and place
and condition of such street, highway, bridge, culvert, sidewalk, crosswalk
including any street, highway, bridge, culvert, sidewalk, crosswalk located
in any City park was actually given to the Office of the Commissioner of
Public Works to repair or remove such defect prior to such damage or
injury occurring and it appearing that there was a failure or neglect on the
part of the City of Schenectady to repair or remove such defect, danger,
condition or obstruction within a reasonable time after the receipt of such
written notice." The City shall not be liable in a civil action for damages
or injuries to person or property or the invasion of personal or property
rights of any name or nature whatsoever, whether casual or continuing,
arising at law or in equity alleged to have been caused or sustained in
whole or in part by or because of any omission of duty, wrongful act, fault
or neglect, misfeasance or negligence on the part of the City or any of its
agents, officers or employees, unless a written claim therefor shall, within
90 days after the happening of the accident or injury or the occurrence
of the act, omission, fault or neglect out of which or on account of which
the claim arose, and notice of intention to commence an action thereon,
be served upon the Corporation Counsel. All claims against the City shall
be made in writing and shall state the time when, the particular place
where and the circumstances under which the damages or injuries were
sustained and the cause thereof; it shall also state so far as practicable
the nature and extent of the damages or injuries; it shall also state the

place of residence of the claimant, by street and number, and, if there
be no street and number, it shall contain such statement as will disclose
the place of residence. It shall also state, so far as then practicable, the
name and residence of each and every witness to the occurrence, and such
claim shall be verified by the oath of the claimant. The City shall not be
liable in a civil action for damages or injuries to person or property or
invasion of personal or property rights of any name or nature whatsoever,
whether casual or continuing, arising at law or in equity alleged to have
been caused or sustained in whole or in part by or because of any omission
of duty, wrongful act, fault, neglect, misfeasance or negligence on the
part of the City or any of its agents, officers or employees, unless an
action shall be commenced thereon within one year and 90 days after
the happening of such accident or injury or the occurrence of such act,
omission, fault or neglect, but no action shall be commenced to recover
upon or enforce any such claim against the City until the expiration of
three months after the service of said notice upon the Corporation Counsel.
It shall be the duty of the Corporation Counsel to cause all claims for
damages or injuries to person or property to be thoroughly examined and
investigated, and to that end, he may take proof, examine witnesses and
require the claimant, with the privileges of counsel, to appear before and
be sworn by the City Judge or the City Clerk and answer orally, under oath,
any question relative to or that the Corporation Counsel may ask and which
may assist him in ascertaining the City's liability or the extent thereof, and
the Corporation Counsel shall advise the proper City Board or Committee
of the City Council in respect thereof. The claimant may designate another
time for said examination if he shall be physically unable to appear, which
designation shall be in writing and shall be served upon the Corporation
Counsel. Such examination shall be held, however, within 45 days after the
presentation of such claim, but the time thereof may be further extended
by the parties. No action, however, shall be commenced on any claim
where such examination has been required until the same is held, but
notwithstanding this requirement, such action must be commenced within
one year and 90 days of the happening of the event. It shall be the duty
of every member of the police force of the City, observing and having any
knowledge of an accident from which a cause of action might arise against
the City, to forthwith report the fact of such accident in writing to the
Corporation Counsel, and upon the request of the Corporation Counsel, the
Chief of Police shall detail some member of the force to aid the Corporation
Counsel in his investigation of claims against the City for injuries to person
and property. Nothing herein contained, however, shall be held to revive any
claim or cause of action now barred by an existing requirement or statute of
limitations nor to waive any existing limitation now applicable to any claim
or cause of action against the City but, on the contrary, shall be held to be
an additional requirement. (L.L. No. 1-1935, § 1; L.L. No. 6-1936, § 1; L.L.

ARTICLE VIII
Annexations and Boundaries
§ C8-1. Annexation of parts of Rotterdam and Niskayuna, 1914.
A. The portions of the Towns of Rotterdam and Niskayuna added to the
City of Schenectady by this Act17 shall cease to constitute portions of
such towns, and the boundaries of such towns shall be deemed changed
accordingly, but such alteration shall be subject to the provisions of this
subsection. Such added territory shall cease to be a part of the common
school district in which it is located at the time of the annexation under
the provisions of this Act and shall hereafter be under the jurisdiction of
the school authorities of the City of Schenectady. If an officer of either
of such towns resides in the portion thereof included by this Act within
the City, he shall continue to act as town officer until the expiration of
his term. The jurisdiction of a Justice of the Peace of either of such
towns shall not be affected or impaired by the inclusion of a portion
thereof within the City, and he shall, during the balance of his term,
have jurisdiction over the portion of the town so included in the same
manner and to the same extent as if such inclusion had not occurred;
but such jurisdiction shall not exclude the jurisdiction of the City Court
or Police Justice of the City of Schenectady over such territory. Taxes
heretofore levied by either of such towns or by such school district upon
the taxable inhabitants and property within the added territory, and not
yet collected, shall be applicable to the town or school district debts,
demands, claims and charges for which they were levied and shall be
collected by the town or district collector and applied accordingly, but
the property and inhabitants within such added territory shall hereafter
be taxable only within the City of Schenectady. The City shall be liable
for its proportions of the debts, claims, demands and charges of each
such town existing at the time that this Act takes effect remaining
unpaid after such taxes have been so applied, to be ascertained and
adjusted as provided in the ensuing subsections.
B. The members of the City Council of the City of Schenectady and of the
Town Board of each such town shall severally constitute boards of audit
for the purpose of adjusting town liabilities under the provisions of the
preceding subsection and shall, within 90 days after this Act takes
effect, meet and ascertain and audit all debts, claims, demands and
charges against the town, including outstanding bonds, if any, and
adjust the amount or proportion thereto to be paid by the City and by
the town, respectively, in proportion to the respective valuation of the
taxable property within the town and within the portion added to the
City by this Act as assessed upon the last preceding assessment roll.
Such Board of Audit shall make a statement in triplicate showing the
amount of such indebtedness and the items thereof and the
proportionate amounts to be paid by the City and town, respectively,
and file one copy thereof with the County Clerk of Schenectady County,
17.Editor's Note: "This Act" refers to Laws of 1914, Ch. 58.

one copy with the Town Clerk of the town in respect to which the
adjustment is made and one copy with the City Clerk. Such debts,
claims, demands and charges so adjusted shall be borne by the City and
town, respectively, pursuant to the terms of such adjustment. Moneys
raised within the City to pay the City's portion of any such adjusted
town debts, claims, demands or charges shall be paid by the City
Treasurer to the town officer or board charged by law or contract with
the duty of making payments to the claimant or creditor.
C. The debts, demands, claims and charges against the common school
district, which includes such added territory, shall be apportioned and
adjusted between the City and such school district in the same manner,
so far as practicable, as between the City and one of such towns of
which a portion is added to the City by this Act, except that the Board of
Audit shall consist of the City Council of the City, and the trustees of
such school district and the school district tax roll shall be used as the
basis of adjustment and apportionment, and except that the City and
the portion hereby annexed shall not be liable for any portion of a
bonded debt of the school district incurred subsequent to January 1,
1914, for the construction of a schoolhouse in the portion of the school
district not included by this Act in the City of Schenectady.
D. The title to all real property, if any, of said school district located within
the added territory, shall vest in the City, and the value thereof, as
determined by the Board of Audit, constituted by this Act for
apportioning liabilities between the town and such school district shall
be taken into account in fixing the City's liability for any outstanding
bonds of the school district issued and sold for the purchase or
improvement of such real property. Such Board of Audit shall also
apportion to the City such personal property of the school district as
may be just and equitable.
E. As soon as practicable after this Act takes effect, the election districts of
the City of Schenectady adjoining the easterly boundary thereof shall
be reestablished in such manner as to include in one or more districts
the territory added to the City by this Act, and necessary election
officers for said district or districts shall be appointed as provided by
law. (L. 1914, Ch. 58, §§ 4  8)

invest in and are empowered to make all necessary contracts and take
all necessary and proper action and proceedings in the premises, and
to make payments from said fund or pensions granted in pursuance to
this Charter. Said trustees shall, from time to time, establish such rules
and regulations for the administration of the Firemen's Pension Fund

No. 2-1939)
B. Assets of fund.
(1) The Permanent Firemen's Pension fund shall consist of:
(a) All fines imposed upon members of the Fire Department by the
Commissioner of Public Safety.
(b) All rewards, fees, gifts, testimonials and emoluments
presented, paid or given to said fund or to any member of the
Fire Department for or on account of fire services shall be

§ C11-2 SCHENECTADY CODE § C11-2
C:58

forfeited, deducted or withheld from any member of the Fire
Department on account of absence from duty and lost time
shall be paid monthly to the custodian of the Permanent
Firemen's Pension Fund.
(2) The City shall contribute annually from moneys received by the
Director of Finance raised by general municipal taxation, an
amount equal to 6% of the payroll of the members of the permanent
fire force who are members of the Permanent Firemen's Pension
Fund of the City of Schenectady for the year 1940, 7% for the year
1941, 8% for the year 1942, and 9% for the year 1943, and for each
and every succeeding year thereafter, which amounts shall be
transferred annually to the benefit of the Permanent Firemen's
Pension Fund of the City of Schenectady.
(3) The City shall also pay on account of any member or officer of its
Fire Department who has duly elected, or which hereafter duly
elects to contribute the additional amount required for the purpose
of retiring after 25 years of service, as provided by Subdivision 1 of
§ 68-6 of the Civil Service Law, or any subsequent amendments

pay 75% of the additional cost on account of fire service rendered
by such officer or member of the Fire Department after the date of
the adoption hereof.
(4) In the event that the annual income of the aforesaid fund is
insufficient for the payment of pensions and all other legal
disbursements from said fund, the Board of Trustees of said fund
may, if in their opinion they deem it advisable, use the assets of said
fund to meet the deficiency but only to the extent of 5% of the
entire fund in any one year. In the event that the Board of Trustees
of said fund does not draw on the assets of the fund as aforesaid to
meet the deficiency, or if after drawing on the assets of the fund as
aforesaid, there is still a remaining deficiency, the City shall include
such additional sums of money as may be necessary to meet the
deficiency in its annual estimate of revenues and expenses of the
City for the fiscal year and the amount of said deficiency shall be
paid by the City to the Permanent Firemen's Fund at the same time
that the City pays into said fund its annual contribution to said
fund. Upon the retirement and pensioning of the last member of the
permanent fire force, contributions to the aforesaid fund on the
part of the City shall cease and terminate and pensions to the
members may be paid from income of said pension fund, and if the
annual income from said fund is insufficient to meet the annual
pension or other payments, the balance of said pension or other

repealed by L.L. No. 2-1960.
§ C11-2 CHARTER AND RELATED LEGISLATION § C11-2
C:59
payments shall be paid out of the principal of said fund and if
before the death of the last pensioner the principal of said fund
has been wholly expended, the remaining members on pension
shall be paid their pensions in the same amount and in the same
manner out of the general funds of the City. If, after the death
of all the pensioners, there is no one living who is entitled to
further payments from the pension fund and there is any part of the
principal amount of said fund remaining, it shall revert to the City
and become part of its general funds.
(5) In the event that a member of said Permanent Firemen's Pension
Fund shall be separated from the service for any cause whatsoever,
there shall be paid to him immediately thereafter from the said
Permanent Firemen's Pension Fund the amount paid and
contributed by him into said fund, together with interest at the rate
of 4% per year. In the event that a member of said Permanent
Firemen's Pension Fund is retired and pensioned within the
provisions of this article and shall die before he has received from
said Permanent Firemen's Pension Fund the amount of money paid
and contributed by him into said fund, together with interest
thereon to be computed at the rate of 4% per year, there shall then
be paid to his beneficiary, his contingent beneficiary or to his
estate, as provided for in Subsection C(1) hereof, from said fund as
of the date of his death, a sum of money equal to the difference
between the amount paid by said deceased member into said fund,
together with interest thereon to be computed at the rate of 4% per
year, and the amount paid to him from said fund in the form of
pension or otherwise. (L. 1907, Ch. 182, § 2; L. 1918, Ch. 527, § 1;
L.L. No. 1-1926, § 2; L.L. No. 6-1938, §§ 1, 2; L.L. No. 2-1940, § 1;
L.L. No. 4-1946, § 1; L.L. No. 2-1960, § 1)
C. Benefits. The Board of Trustees shall have power, in their discretion, to
retire and dismiss from membership in said fire force and thereupon
grant pensions, as hereinafter provided, to any member of the fire force
of said City who shall have become disabled, mentally or physically, to
widows, children or next of kin of such members, to be paid from the
Firemen's Pension Fund by the Board of Trustees thereof as follows:
(1) To the widow of any member of the Fire Department who shall have
died while in active service, the amount paid and contributed by
said member into the fund, together with the interest at the rate of
4% per year, provided that said widow shall, at the time of such
death, have been living with such member, but if there is no such
widow and there is a child or children, then to said child or children
of such member in equal proportions of said sum, and if there is no
such child or children, then the sum shall be paid to the designated
beneficiary or estate of any member. The beneficiary entitled to
receive the above mentioned sum shall be designated by the
member of said Fire Department in writing, and such written
designation shall be filed in the office of the Assistant Mayor -
§ C11-2 SCHENECTADY CODE § C11-2
C:60
Director of Finance of the City of Schenectady, New York. In the
event no beneficiary shall have been so designated, or the last
designated beneficiary shall have died, then said sum shall be paid
to the estate of the deceased member. The members of the Fire
Department shall be permitted to change the beneficiary named
by filing with said Assistant Mayor - Director of Finance a written
revocation of the prior designation and naming in said writing the
new beneficiary. A member of said Department shall be construed
to be in active service when he is on the payroll as a permanent
member of said Fire Department. The designated beneficiary need
not necessarily be related to the member.
(2) To any member of such fire force, who whilst in the actual
performance of duty and by reason of the performance of such duty
and without fault or misconduct on his part, shall have become
permanently disabled, physically or mentally so as to be unfitted to
perform but a part of fire duty and so unable to earn his full salary,
1/2 of the salary of such member shall be paid to him annually
during his lifetime.
(3) The Board of Trustees may release and dismiss from the force and
service any member of the Fire Department upon a certificate of
the City physician or a licensed physician selected by the trustees
showing that such member of whatever age, who has served 20
years, is permanently disabled, physically or mentally, so as to be
unfit for duty, and place upon the roll of the Firemen's Pension
Fund and award and grant to be paid to such member from said
Firemen's Pension Fund, an annual pension during his lifetime of 1/
2 of the full salary or compensation of such member at the time of
such retirement. Any member of the permanent Fire Department
who has been in active service for 25 years may apply to the Board
of Trustees to be placed upon the roll of the Firemen's Pension
Fund and receive from said Firemen's Pension Fund an annual
pension during his lifetime of 1/2 of the full salary or compensation
of such member at the time of such retirement. Said period of 25
years of service must be one of active service but need not be one
of continuous service. This provision for retirement after 25 years
of service is not mandatory but is discretionary with said officer or
member. The pensions granted under this section shall be for the
natural life of the pensioner and shall not be revoked, repealed or
dismissed. The application for a pension shall set forth at what
time, not less than 30 days subsequent to the execution and filing
thereof, the member desires to be retired, and he shall be retired as
of the date set in the application and placed on the roll of the
pension fund, provided that at the time specified for his retirement
his term or tenure of office shall not have terminated or have been
forfeited and provided further that, upon his request in writing, the
member shall be granted a leave of absence from the date of the
filing of such application until the date the retirement becomes
effective. If the applicant dies prior to the granting of his pension
§ C11-2 CHARTER AND RELATED LEGISLATION § C11-2
C:61
and has not had his office terminated or forfeited prior to his death,
his rights and the rights of his estate and/or designated beneficiary
shall be determined as if the applicant was retired and placed on
the pension rolls as of the date of the submission of his application
to the Board.
(4) The Board of Trustees may, in their discretion, order any pension
granted, or any part thereof to cease, except in the cases of
members of the fire force retired after 20 years or 25 years, as
provided in the last preceding section, but in all cases said Board of
Trustees shall file a written statement of the reasons which caused
them to order any pension to so cease, and nothing herein
contained shall render the granting or payment of such pensions
obligatory to the Commissioner of Public Safety or upon the
trustees of the Firemen's Pension Fund or chargeable as a matter
of right upon said Permanent Firemen's Pension Fund, except as
provided in the last preceding section.

members of the Police Department of the City of Schenectady who shall
be elected in the manner provided by this section, shall constitute a
Board of Trustees of the Police Pension Fund hereinafter mentioned.
The Chief of the Police force of the City of Schenectady shall, on or
before December 1 of each year in which a Mayor shall be elected, call
a meeting of said police force to be held on the first Tuesday following
the first Monday in December of such year for the purpose of electing
two members of said force to be trustees of the said Police Pension
Fund. Each member of said force shall be entitled to vote for two
members of said police force for the office of trustee of the said fund.
Voting shall be by ballot and shall be secret. The two members having
the highest vote shall be declared elected. The Chief of Police shall
designate two members of said force who shall with himself canvass the
votes and declare the result. The two members of the police force so
elected as trustees of said fund shall take office on the first day of
January following such election and shall serve for two years. In the
event that a vacancy shall occur in the office of a trustee so elected, the
Chief of Police shall appoint a member of the police force to fill such
office of trustee for the remainder of the unexpired term. The Mayor of
the City of Schenectady shall be President of said Board, the
Commissioner of Public Safety of the City of Schenectady shall be
Secretary of said Board and the Comptroller of the City of Schenectady
shall be Treasurer of said Board. Said Board of Trustees shall have
charge of and administer said fund and from time to time invest the
same or any part thereof as they shall deem most beneficial to said
fund, in such securities as savings banks of the State of New York are
permitted to invest in, and are empowered to make all necessary
contracts and take all necessary and proper action and proceedings in
the premises and to make payments from said fund of pensions granted
in pursuance to this article. Said trustees shall from time to time
establish such rules and regulations for the administration of the Police
Pension Fund as they may deem best. They shall report in detail the
condition of the fund at the close of each fiscal year of the Police
Department, through their Secretary to the City Council, and said
report shall be published with the annual report of the Police
Department. No payment whatever shall be allowed or made by said
trustees as rewards, gratuities or compensation to any person for salary
or services rendered to or for said Board of Trustees. (L. 1907, Ch. 183,

B. Assets of fund.
(1) The Police Pension Fund shall consist of:
(a) All fines imposed upon members of the police force by the
Commissioner of Public Safety.
(b) All rewards, fees, gifts, testimonials and emoluments
presented, paid or given to any member of the police force, for
or on account of police services, except such as have been or
shall be allowed by the Commissioner of Public Safety to be
retained by such member.
(c) All moneys paid for special services of policemen at balls,
parties, weddings, excursions or picnics.
(d) All lost or stolen moneys remaining in the hands of the Police
Justice or the Clerk to the Commissioner of Public Safety for
the space of one year, and for which there shall be no lawful
claimant, and the moneys arising from the disposal of the
same, by said Police Justice or Clerk to the Commissioner of
Public Safety.26
(e) All moneys, pay, compensation or salary or any part thereof,
forfeited, deducted or withheld from any member of the police
force on account of absence from duty and lost time shall be
paid monthly to the custodian of the Police Pension Fund.
(2) Contributions.
(a) The City shall contribute annually from moneys received by the
Director of Finance, raised by general municipal tax, an
amount equal to 6% of the payroll of the members of the Police
Pension Fund of the City of Schenectady for the year 1940, 7%
for the year 1941, 8% for the year 1942, and 9% for the year
1943, and for each and every succeeding year thereafter,
which amounts shall be transferred annually to the benefit of
the Police Pension Fund of the City of Schenectady.
(b) The City shall also pay on account of any member or officer of
its Police Department who has duly elected, or which hereafter
duly elects to contribute the additional amount required for the
purpose of retiring after 25 years of service as provided by
Subdivision 1 of § 68-B of the Civil Service Law, or any
subsequent amendments thereto, the entire additional cost on
account of the police services rendered by such officer or
member of the Police Department prior to the date of the
adoption of this local law, and the City shall further pay 75% of
the additional cost on account of police service rendered by
26.Editor's Note: Former Subsection 5, which immediately followed this section, was repealed
by L.L. No. 1-1960, § 1.
§ C14-1 SCHENECTADY CODE § C14-1
C:76
such officer or member of the Police Department after the date
of the adoption hereof.
(c) In the event that the annual income of the aforesaid fund is
insufficient for the payment of pensions and all other legal
disbursements from said fund, the Board of Trustees of said
fund may, if in their opinion they deem it advisable, use the
assets of said fund to meet the deficiency but only to the extent
of 5% of the entire fund in any one year. In the event that the
Board of Trustees of said fund does not draw on the assets of
the fund as aforesaid to meet the deficiency, or if after drawing
on the assets of the fund as aforesaid there is still a remaining
deficiency, the City shall include such additional sums of money
as may be necessary to meet the deficiency in its annual
estimate of revenues and expenses of the City for the fiscal
year and the amount of said deficiency shall be paid by the City
to the Police Pension Fund at the same time that the City pays
into said fund its annual contribution to said fund. Upon the
retirement and pensioning of the last member of the police
force, contributions to the aforesaid fund on the part of the
City shall cease and terminate and pensions to the members
may be paid from income of said pension fund, and if the
annual income from said fund is insufficient to meet the annual
pension or other payments, the balance of said pension or
other payments shall be paid out of the principal of said fund,
and if before the death of the last pensioner the principal of
said fund has been wholly expended, the remaining members
on pension shall be paid their pension in the same amount and
in the same manner out of the federal funds of the City. If, after
the death of all the pensioners, there is no one living who is
entitled to further payments from the pension fund and there is
any part of the principal amount of said fund remaining, it shall
revert to the City and become part of its general funds.
(3) The Board of Trustees by a majority vote may extend the period of
service beyond the mandatory retirement age provided herein but
in no event shall such extension be in excess of two one-year
extensions. (L. 1907, Ch. 183, § 2; L. 1917, Ch. 378, §§ 2, 3; L.L. No.
2-1938, § 1; L.L. No. 5-1938, §§ 1, 2; L.L. No. 3-1941, § 1; L.L. No.
3-1946, § 1; L.L. No. 4-1957, § 1; 12-8-1975 by Intro. L.L. No.
7-1975, § 1)
C. Benefits. The Board of Trustees shall have power, in their discretion, to
retire and dismiss from membership in the said police force and
thereupon grant pensions, as hereinafter provided, to any member of
the police force of said City who shall have become disabled, physically
or mentally, to widows and orphans of such members, to be paid from
the Police Pension Fund by the Board of Trustees thereof as follows:
(1) To the designated beneficiary of any member of the police force
who shall have been killed in the actual performance of duty, or
§ C14-1 CHARTER AND RELATED LEGISLATION § C14-1
C:77
who shall have died from the effect of any injury received while
in the actual performance of such duty, the sum of $1,000. To the
designated beneficiary of any member of the police force who shall
have died after five or more years of continuous active service
in said Police Department, and while said member is in active
service therein, but whose death shall not have occurred as above
specified, the sum of $1,000. The beneficiary entitled to receive
either of the above-mentioned sums shall be designated by the
members of said police force in writing, and such written
designation shall be filed in the office of the Director of Finance
of the City of Schenectady. In the event that no beneficiary shall
have been so designated, or the last designated beneficiary shall
have died, then said sum of $1,000 shall be paid to the estate
of the deceased member. The members of the police force shall
be permitted to change the beneficiary named by filing with said
Director of Finance a written revocation of the prior designation
and naming in said writing the new beneficiary.
(2) To any member of such police force who whilst in the actual
performance of duty and by reason of the performance of such duty
and without fault or misconduct on his part shall have become
permanently disabled, physically or mentally, so as to be unfitted to
perform full police duty, 1/2 of the salary of such member shall be
paid to him annually during his lifetime.
(3) The Board of Trustees may release and dismiss from the force and
service any member of the police force upon a certificate of the City
physician or a licensed physician selected by the Board of Trustees,
showing that such member of whatever age, who has served 20
years, is permanently disabled, physically or mentally, so as to be
unfit for duty, and place upon the roll of the pension fund and award
and grant to be paid to such member, from said pension fund an
annual pension during his lifetime of 1/2 of the full salary or
compensation of such member at the time of such retirement. Any
member of said police force who has been in active service for 25
years or more shall upon his own application be retired without
physical examination and certification and be placed upon the roll
of the Police Pension Fund and receive from said Police Pension
Fund an annual pension of 1/2 of the full salary or compensation of
such member at the time of such retirement. Said period of 25
years of service must be one of active service but need not be one
of continuous and consecutive service. This provision for
retirement, after 25 years' active service is not mandatory but is
discretionary with such member. The pensions granted under this
subsection shall be for the natural life of the pensioner and shall
not be revoked, repealed or dismissed. The application for a
pension shall set forth at what time, not less than 30 days
subsequent to the execution and filing thereof, the member desires
to be retired, and he shall be retired as of the date set in the
application and placed on the roll of the pension fund, provided that
§ C14-1 SCHENECTADY CODE § C14-1
C:78
at the time specified for his retirement his term or tenure of office
shall not have terminated or have been forfeited and provided,
further, that upon his request in writing, the member shall be
granted a leave of absence from the date of the filing of such
application until the date the retirement becomes effective. If the
applicant dies prior to the granting of his pension and has not
had his office terminated or forfeited prior to his death, his rights
and the rights of his estate and/or designated beneficiary shall be
determined as if the applicant was retired and place on the pension
rolls as of the date of the submission of his application to the Board.
(4) The Board of Trustees may, in their discretion, order any pension
granted, or any part thereof to cease, except in cases of members of
the police force retired after 20 years' service, as provided in the
last preceding section, but in all such cases the said trustees shall
file a written statement of the causes which determined them in
ordering any pension to so cease, and nothing herein contained
shall render the granting or payment of such pension obligatory or
chargeable as a matter of right upon said Police Pension Fund,
except as provided in the last preceding section.
(5) No member of the police force shall be awarded, granted or paid a
pension on account of physical or mental disability or disease
unless upon the certificate of the City physician or licensed
physician selected by the Board of Trustees, which shall set forth
the cause, nature and extent of the disability, disease or injury of
each member of the police force who may be placed upon the
pension roll, and said certificate shall state distinctly whether or
not such disability, disease or injury was incurred or sustained by
said member of the police force in the performance of police duty,
and such certificate shall, in each case, be filed with and entered
upon the records of the Commissioner of Public Safety.
(6) None of the provisions of this article or any amending state or local
act shall apply to any member/members of the Schenectady police
force, appointed on or after December 31, 1937, and the pension,
retirement benefits, emoluments or awards created by virtue of the
Schenectady police pension system shall be discontinued as to such
member/members but in place and stead of membership in said
Schenectady police pension system, from and after December 31,
1937, such appointee/appointees shall be entitled to membership in
the New York State employees retirement system and entitled to all
of the pensions, retirement benefits, emoluments or awards as are
provided for in Chapter 741, Article 4, Laws of 1920, and Chapter
591, Article 5, Laws of 1922, as the same have from time to time
been amended and renumbered. The City of Schenectady hereby
gives its consent and approval to such membership/memberships in
the New York State employees retirement system of all member/
members of the Schenectady police force, who shall be appointed
on and after December 31, 1937.
§ C14-1 CHARTER AND RELATED LEGISLATION § C14-1
C:79
(7) In the event that a member of said Police Pension Fund shall be
separated from the service for any cause whatsoever, there shall be
paid to him immediately thereafter from said Police Pension Fund
the amount paid and contributed by him into said fund, together
with interest at the rate of 4% per year. In the event that a member
of said Police Pension Fund is retired and pensioned within the
provisions of this article and shall die before he has received from
said Police Pension Fund the amount of money paid and
contributed by him into said fund, together with interest thereon to
be computed at the rate of 4% per year, there shall then be paid to
his estate or his designated beneficiary or his contingent
beneficiary from said Police Pension Fund as of the date of his
death a sum of money equal to the difference between the amount
paid by said deceased member into said fund, together with
interest thereon to be computed at the rate of 4% per year, and the
amount paid to him from said fund in the form of pension or
otherwise.
(8) There is hereby authorized pursuant to Chapter 426 of the Laws of
1974 of the State of New York the payment of an additional
supplemental allowance over and above that mandated by § 207-i
of the General Municipal Law to all retirees under this pension fund

A. The City shall levy annual special assessments on each property within
the district. The amount of the annual assessment for each property in
the district is the proportionate share attributable to that property of
the total cost of services and benefits provided within the district. The
annual total cost benefit is the sum of the assessable debt service and
the operating costs for all services and benefits provided within the
district.31
B. Benefit charges used for assessment.
(1) The annual assessment for each parcel within the district shall be
the sum of the following benefit charges calculated with respect to
each parcel:
(a) Parking benefit.
(b) Environmental enhancement benefit.
(c) Business development benefit.
(2) The total of the benefit charges for a parcel represents the
proportionate share of the total cost of district services and
benefits for that parcel.
C. Benefit assessments.
(1) Parking benefit. A parking benefit assessment shall be calculated
for each parcel within the district with a building. The parking
benefit assessment for each parcel is based upon each parcel's
share of the total parking demand within the district. Parking
demand for each parcel shall be determined by multiplying the
gross floor area (GFA) for each parcel by a parking distance factor
relative to each lot within the district to determine the adjusted
floor area (AFA) for each parcel. The distance factor for each parcel
shall be determined by measuring from the center of each parcel to
the center of each district parking lot. The parking benefit
assessment for each parcel shall be determined based upon the
proportionate share which the adjusted floor area for each parcel
represents as compared to the total adjusted floor area of all
parcels within the district.
31.Editor's Note: Ordinance No. 2010-19, adopted 11-22-2010, authorized DSAD to levy an
annual assessment based on a factor-based formula. For details, refer to Ord. No. 2010-19,
which is on file in the City offices.
§ 9-5 SCHENECTADY CODE § 9-5
C:104
(2) Environment enhancement benefit. Each parcel within the district
shall be assessed for its proportionate share of all costs relating to
equipment, services, improvements and amenities designed to
enhance and improve the environment and appearance of the
district. The environment enhancement benefit assessed to each
parcel shall be based upon a factor representing the proportionate
share of all district costs for such activities attributed to each
parcel. The assessment for each parcel shall be determined by
multiplying the frontage use factor for each parcel by the service
zone factor for each parcel.
(3) Business development benefit. Each parcel within the district shall
be subject to an assessment for its proportionate share of all costs
incurred for the promotion, development, enhancement, attraction
and marketing of businesses and business activity within the
district. The assessment for each parcel shall be determined based
upon the percentage of the gross floor area (GFA) which that parcel
represents as compared to the total gross floor area (GFA) of all
parcels within the district.
D. Factors.
(1) Parking distance factor. If the distance from the building to a
district parking lot is 800 feet or more, the distance factor is
determined by subtracting that distance from 2,000 and dividing
the remainder by 666.7. If the distance is less than 800 feet, the
distance factor is determined by subtracting that distance from
1,143 and dividing the remainder by 114.3. In either case, the
factor to be used is the quotient to the nearest tenth.
(2) Frontage use factor: the number of front feet which a subject
parcel has on the street listed as the parcel's street address. The
frontage use factor for a parcel with frontage on two streets will be
the frontage as measured for the parcel's street address. The
determination of a parcel's frontage shall be based upon the City of
Schenectady's real property (RPS) assessment database.
(3) Service zone factor. Each parcel shall be assigned a service zone
factor, which factor represents the frequency of services and level
of amenities provided to parcels within specific zones of the
district.
(a) The service zones within the district shall be designated as
follows:
[1] Service Zone 1.
[2] Service Zone 2.
[3] Service Zone 3.
[4] Service Zone 4.

by L.L. No. 3-1986; 1-8-2001 by Ord. No. 2001-1]
(b) The services and amenities to be provided in each zone shall be
determined by the Downtown Special Assessment District
Operations and Development Committee, and each parcel shall
be assessed based upon the services provided in the zone
where the parcel is located.
(4) Gross floor area factor. Gross floor area factor shall be the total
number of square feet of a building or buildings located on a parcel.
The determination of the gross floor area for each parcel shall be
based upon the City of Schenectady's real property (RPS)
assessment database.
E. Each parcel located within the Downtown Special Assessment District
shall be subject to an annual minimum assessment not to exceed $450.
The amount of the minimum assessment shall be determined annually
by the Downtown Special Assessment District Operations and
Development Committee and shall be levied by the City, whenever such
minimum assessment shall exceed the assessment for any parcel as
computed under the provisions of this chapter.
F. The owner of a building which is subject to a special assessment may,
within 30 days after receiving notice of the assessment, appeal to the
City Assessor or other official designated by the City, but only for the
purpose of contesting the accuracy of the determination of the factors
utilized in calculating the assessment for that parcel.

exempt from special assessment: single-family residence (Class 210),
two-family residence (Class 220), three-family residence (Class 230)
and property owned by the City of Schenectady, and the United States
of America.
H. The City Assessor or other official designated by the City may adopt
rules and regulations to facilitate the preparation and administration of
the annual assessment in the district. The City Assessor or other official
designated by the City may utilize the other offices of the City
government and the Downtown Special Assessment District in
preparing the annual assessment.
A. In order to ensure the active participation of property owners within
the district, there is established a Downtown Special Assessment

personal relationship, rather than the recipient's status as a
municipal officer or employee, is the primary motivating factor for
the gift;
(3) Gifts given on special occasions, such as marriage, illness, or
retirement, which are modest, reasonable and customary;
(4) Unsolicited advertising or promotional material of little intrinsic
value, such as pens, pencils, notepads, and calendars;

approving consent of not less than five members of the City Council

inability to discharge the powers or duties of the office or violation of
this chapter after written notice of the charges and an opportunity for

activities as he may deem.
B. Every employee shall have the right to join or continue as a member of

head of each department shall be responsible for carrying out the
provisions of this policy and the regulations prescribed hereunder.
C. Administrative City officials are requested to weigh any public
statements they make concerning alleged violations before any

bureau head shall work for a satisfactory adjustment of the grievance
through conference, negotiation and agreement. The determination and
comments of the bureau head passing upon the grievance shall be in
writing, copies of which shall be transmitted to the aggrieved or his
representative upon issuance. The aggrieved has the right to appeal the
determination as provided in the next step of the grievance procedure.
C. Step 3. Within five working days after the decision in Step 2 shall have
been issued, the aggrieved shall have the right to appeal the
determination to the head of the department concerned. The head of
the department or his representative and the aggrieved and his
representative shall work for a satisfactory solution of the grievance or
complaint through conference, negotiation and agreement. Such

Best Value Contract Award
[Adopted 3-23-2015 by L.L. No. 3-2015]
§ 62-1. Title.
This article shall be known as the "Schenectady Best Value Contract Award
Law."
§ 62-2. Intent and purpose.
A. The State Legislature and the Governor approved legislation that
amended § 103 of the New York State General Municipal Law to provide
municipalities with greater flexibility in awarding contracts by
authorizing the award of purchase contracts on the basis of best value.
The state legislation requires counties with a population of less than
1,000,000 to pass a local law authorizing the use of the best value
award process.
B. Enactment of this legislation provides additional procurement options
to localities in ways that may expedite the procurement process and
result in cost savings. The "best value" standard for selecting goods is
critical to efforts to use strategic sourcing principles to modernize the
supply chain and ensure that taxpayers obtain the highest quality goods
at the lowest potential cost, while also ensuring fairness to all
competitors. The federal government, approximately half of the states
and many localities have added best value selection processes to their
procurement options, in recognition of these advantages. With the
increased complexity of the goods that municipalities must obtain in
order to serve taxpayers, it is critical to consider selection and
evaluation criteria that measure factors other than cost.
C. Taxpayers are not well served when a public procurement results in low
unit costs at the outset but ultimately engenders cost escalations due to
factors such as inferior quality, poor reliability and difficulty of
maintenance. Best value procurement links the procurement process
directly to the municipality's performance requirements, incorporating
selection factors such as useful lifespan, quality and options and
incentives for more-timely performance. Even if the initial expenditure
is higher, considering the total value over the life of the procurement
may result in a better value and long-term investment of public funds.
D. Best value procurement also encourages competition and, in turn, often
results in better pricing, quality and customer service. Fostering
healthy competition ensures that bidders will continue to strive for
excellence in identifying and meeting the needs of municipalities,
including such important goals as the participation of small, minority
and women-owned businesses and the development of environmentally
preferable goods and service delivery methods.

§ 62-3. Award based on lowest bidder or best value.
The City of Schenectady may award purchase contracts that have been
procured pursuant to competitive bidding under § 103 of the New York
State General Municipal Law by either lowest responsible bidder or best
value.
§ 62-4. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
BEST VALUE  The basis for awarding contracts for goods to the offerer
which optimizes quality, cost and efficiency, among responsive and
responsible offerers. Such basis shall reflect, wherever possible, objective
and quantifiable analysis. Such basis may also identify a quantitative factor
for offerers that are small businesses or certified minority- or women-owned
business enterprises, as defined in Subdivisions 1, 7, 15 and 20 of § 310
of the Executive Law to be used in evaluation of offers for awarding of
contracts for services.
§ 62-5. Requirements.
E. Best value procurement will provide much-needed flexibility in
obtaining important goods at favorable prices and will reduce the time
to procure such goods.
A. Goods procured and awarded on the basis of best value are those that
are determined to be of the highest quality while being the most costefficient.
The determination of quality and cost-efficiency shall be based
on objectively quantified and clearly described and documented
criteria, which may include, but shall not be limited to, any or all of the
following: cost of maintenance, proximity to the end user if distance or
response time is a significant term, durability, availability of
replacement parts or maintenance contractors, longer product life,
product performance criteria, and quality of craftsmanship. Whenever
any contract is awarded on the basis of best value instead of lowest
responsible bidder, the basis for determining best value shall be
thoroughly and accurately documented.
B. Upon awarding a contract on the basis of best value, the City must be
prepared to show that the offeror is responsive and responsible and
that objective and quantifiable standards were applied, whenever
possible, to determine that the offer optimizes quality, cost and
efficiency.
C. The City of Schenectady should have a written justification if it bases a
best value award on criteria that are not objective and quantifiable.

Retail stores have closed and businesses have moved, resulting in the
reduction of the real property tax base through both in rem
foreclosures and certiorari actions.

moved from the City or closed operations. This has contributed to
higher unemployment in Schenectady.
C. The City of Schenectady Industrial Development Agency will be
charged with the task of revitalizing the City's economy by making
efforts to retain those industrial and commercial firms presently located

For the purpose of this chapter, certain terms, words and phrases are herein
defined.
in the City, attempting to create in Schenectady an economic climate
attractive to new firms, and reversing the trend of increasing numbers
of vacant and deteriorating buildings in the downtown and thereby
decreasing the unemployment rate.
A. The City of Schenectady recognizes the negative effects vacant,
abandoned and tax-delinquent properties have on the social and
economic vitality of communities, surrounding properties, and
neighborhoods in general. It further recognizes that the existence of
the vacant, abandoned and tax-delinquent properties forces a
municipality to absorb the financial losses related to unpaid school,
county and City taxes as well as the increased costs of fire and police
responses to these areas. It is the intent of this legislation to provide
proactive tools to mitigate costs, spur investment and improve property
values within the land bank area. The resulting decreases in delinquent
taxes and emergency response costs will benefit the City financially as
well as improve quality of life of residents in those areas where
abandonment is successfully reversed.
B. It is the further intent of this legislation to provide a tool to other
municipal entities in the Capital Region of the State of New York (said
region being comprised of the Counties of Schenectady, Albany, Fulton,
Montgomery, Rensselaer, Saratoga and Schoharie), allowing them to
become a member of the Land Reutilization Corporation of the Capital
Region and benefit from the anticipated economies of scale for planned
activities.

A. Purpose. The legislative body recognizes that, in order to protect the
health, safety and general welfare of the people when an emergency
work situation exists, it shall be required that the employees of the City
of Schenectady reside near their place of employment. Additionally, the
City Council hereby determines that individuals who are employees of
the City of Schenectady take a greater interest, commitment and
involvement with the government which employs them by living within
that municipality. Thus, the City Council believes that the public need is
sufficient to require that employees hired after the effective date of this
section be residents of the City of Schenectady.
B. Coverage. This section shall affect all City employees initially appointed
after July 12, 1988. This section shall not supersede or override any
other residency provision existing in state or federal law or existing in
the Code of Ordinances of the City of Schenectady found to be contrary
to the provisions herein, except to the extent that § 92-1 of the
Schenectady Code of Ordinances is hereby repealed by this section.
This section shall affect all City employees, including all provisional,
permanent and temporary employees.
C. Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms shall have the
meanings indicated:
EMPLOYEE  Includes every person hired after July 12, 1988, by the
City of Schenectady.
D. Residency for new employees. Except as otherwise provided by
Subsection E of this section, the City Council hereby establishes a
residency requirement for all prospective employees of the City. Every
person initially employed by the City of Schenectady on or after July 12,
1988, shall, as a qualification of employment, be or become a resident
of the City of Schenectady within six months of the date of initial
appointment for said City. Furthermore, during the time of service of
such employees, no employee shall cease to be a resident of the City of
Schenectady, and such shall be deemed a voluntary resignation.
E. Residency for fire fighters. Every fire fighter initially employed by the
City of Schenectady on or after July 12, 1988, shall, as a qualification of
employment, be or become a resident in the County of Schenectady
within six months of the date of initial appointment for said City, and
during the time of said service of such employee, no employee shall
cease to be a resident of the County of Schenectady.
F. Board of Residency. There is hereby created the Board of Residency.
This Board shall consist of five members, one such member to be the
Mayor of the City of Schenectady or the Mayors appointee, one by the
§ 87-6.1 CHARTER AND RELATED LEGISLATION § 87-6.1
C:209
Corporation Counsel of the City of Schenectady and three members
appointed by the Council President. All members of this Board shall be
residents of the City of Schenectady, and, additionally, the members of
the Board appointed by the Council must be either current City Council
members or current employees of the City of Schenectady. This Board
shall have the following powers and obligations: [Amended 4-12-1993
by L.L. No. 5-1993; 10-13-2009 by L.L. No. 2-2009]
(1) The Board shall, upon written request of the Mayor, make a
determination granting an annual waiver of the residency
requirement to any City employee and thereby exempt said
employee from the provisions of this section. This determination
shall be based upon one or more of the following criteria:
(a) The degree of specialization and professionalism required in
any given field of employment.
(b) The existence of hardship such as may be determined by the
Board.
(2) The Board shall be the tribunal to which a dismissed employee shall
initially appeal, and the Board shall have the power to affirm,
reverse or in any other way modify the determination made by the
Mayor. However, in the case of police officers and firemen, this
subsection shall not apply, as it is a mandatory subject for collective
bargaining negotiations pursuant to a decision of the
administrative law judge of the Public Employment Relations Board
dated March 26, 1989.
(3) Each member of the Board of Residency shall serve a one-year term
of office, which shall expire on December 31 of each year.
(4) The Board shall render its decision within 20 days of receipt of an
application or after the conclusion of a fact-finding hearing, and a
copy of its decision shall be forwarded to the Mayor and employee.
G. Notification. A copy of this section shall be provided to all prospective
employees at the time of their application for a position and to all
current employees by the effective date of this section.
H. Breach of residency requirement. If an allegation is made that an
employee of the City of Schenectady is in violation of this section, the
Mayor, after investigation and upon probable cause shown, shall
determine that an employee is in violation of this section and shall
terminate said employee upon the expiration of 10 days from the time
notice is given to said employee of said finding. Said employee may,
within 10 days, apply to the Board of Residency for modification of the
Mayor's determination by making a formal application to the
Schenectady Corporation Counsel's office, and the Board shall then act
pursuant to the powers granted it in Subsection F(1)(b) of this section.
If the employee shall not so apply within said ten-day period, he shall be
deemed to have voluntarily resigned. However, the second sentence of

deemed by a court of law to be in conflict with any provision of New
York State statutory law, the New York State Constitution or the United

Schenectady hereby elects to provide for cash payment of the monetary
value of accumulated time standing to the credit of present City

State of New York.
B. Compensatory time off. Where practicable, the City employee, who has
to his credit accumulated overtime, will be permitted to take
compensatory time off for every hour to his credit.
C. Records used to determine amount of accumulated time. The records of
the Department of Finance will be used in instances as the official
record to determine the amount of accumulated time, unless the

discrepancy in the hours credited to him. The Director of Finance is to
make the determination as to the authenticity of the independent
records submitted by the employee.
D. Retirement or death in service; payment. Upon retirement, or in case of

attendance on a time card or attendance sheet. Falsification of this time
record is cause for dismissal. The time record shall be submitted to the
Department of Finance weekly. Employees are required to report to work
on time, both morning and lunch time. Tardiness will result in a payroll
deduction. Accumulated tardiness of more than 1/2 hour in any payroll
period (one week) shall be deducted from the employee's pay. Habitual
tardiness is cause for suspension or dismissal.
§ 87-11. Holidays. [Amended 5-29-1973 by Ord. No. 16070]
The following days are holidays for all regular full-time employees, and they

contract shall accumulate 1 1/2 days sick leave per month, not to
exceed 18 days per year, with a maximum accumulation of 240 days.
Those employees shall accumulate sick leave as long as they are in the

maximum accumulation of 240 days to cash, upon termination of his
services as an employee with the City.

sick leave, provided that the employee reports the illness to his
supervisor within two hours of the first working day of absence. The
employee must keep the supervisor advised of the necessity for

illness, the employee must present a written statement by a licensed
physician certifying that the employee's condition prevented him from
performing the duties of his position.

covers a period for which an employee has used his accrued sick
leave, then said proportion of the compensation award shall be
credited to restoring a pro rata share to employee's sick leave
accrual.
E. If an illness in the employee's immediate family requires the employee's
personal care and attention, he may make a written application for
leave of absence to his department head and if approved, the employee
may use his accrued sick leave in such instance.
F. An employee shall be granted limited sick leave upon application to his
department head, when death in the employee's immediate family
occurs. However, leave shall not be allowed in excess of five days and

pass, pursuant to pending state law date of effect. In such instances, official
business cannot or may not be conducted, which may delay or impede
adherence to required timelines. The use of an alternate member in such
instances is hereby authorized pursuant to the provisions of this article.

established such Planning Commission, as amended to date.

pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 91 of the City Code.
§ 91-21. Purpose; appointment; designation; powers and duties.

provide a process for appointing an alternate member of the Planning
Commission. This individual would serve when members are absent or
unable to participate on an application or matter before the respective
Commission to which he or she is appointed as an alternate.
B. One alternate member of the Planning Commission shall be appointed
by the Mayor, for a term the length of which shall be the same as a

exception of specific duty, responsibility and authority reserved to
officers. Such designation shall be entered into the minutes of the initial
Planning Commission meeting at which the substitution is made.
D. All provisions of state law relating to Planning Commission member

property. Priority for financial assistance will also be given to those
candidates who can demonstrate the ability to complete a portion of the

work and as to which part of the rehabilitation can be accomplished
through self-help will be made in conjunction with the Self-Help

Adult Bookstores
[Adopted 11-22-1982 by Ord. No. 82-93]
§ 115-1. Findings; purpose.
In the development and execution of this article, it is recognized that adult
bookstores, because of their very nature, are recognized as having serious
objectionable operational characteristics, particularly when several of them
are concentrated under certain circumstances, thereby having a deleterious
effect upon the adjacent area. Special regulation of such uses is necessary
to ensure that these adverse effects will not contribute to the blighting
or downgrading of the surrounding neighborhood. The primary control or
regulation is for the purpose of preventing a concentration of this use in any
one area.
§ 115-2. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
ADULT BOOKSTORE  An establishment having, as a substantial or
significant portion of its stock-in-trade, books, magazines and other
periodicals which are distinguished or characterized by their emphasis
on matter depicting or relating to specified sexual activity or specific
anatomical areas, as defined below, for observation by patrons therein.

A.
Human male genitals in a discernibly turgid state, even if completely
and opaquely covered.
B.

B. Acts of human masturbation, sexual intercourse or sodomy.
Fondling or other erotic touching of human genitals, pubic region,
buttock or female breast.

library, park or playground and at least 500 feet from the nearest property
line of any church, convent, monastery, synagogue or other place of
worship.
§ 115-5. Penalties for offenses.
Violation of this article is punishable by a fine not exceeding $1,000 or by
imprisonment not exceeding six months, or by both fine and imprisonment.
Each day during any portion of which any violation of this article is
committed, permitted or continued shall constitute a separate offense.

§ 115-6. Unlawful to promote.
It shall be unlawful and a misdemeanor, punishable as authorized by state
law, for any person to promote or possess with intent to promote any
obscene material when knowing of its content and character. Each day that
said violation continues may be treated as a separate offense.
§ 115-7. Presumptive evidence.
A person who promotes obscene material or possesses the same with intent
to promote it, in the course of his business, is presumed to do so with
knowledge of its content and character.
§ 115-8. Definitions.
For the purposes of this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
MATERIAL  Anything tangible, capable of being used or adapted to arouse
interest, whether through the medium of reading, observation, sound or in
any other manner.
OBSCENE  Any material or performance is "obscene" if the average
person, applying contemporary community standards, would find that,
considered as a whole, its predominant appeal is to the prurient interest
in sex and depicts or describes, in a patently offensive manner, actual
or simulated sexual intercourse, sodomy, sexual bestiality, masturbation,
sadism, masochism, excretion or lewd exhibition of the genitals and,
considered as a whole, it lacks serious literary, artistic, political and
scientific value. Predominant appeal shall be judged with reference to
ordinary adults, unless it appears from the character of the material or
the circumstances of its dissemination to be designed for children or other
specially susceptible audiences.
PROMOTE  To manufacture, issue, sell, give, provide, lend, mail, deliver,
transfer, transmute, publish, distribute, circulate, disseminate, present,
exhibit or advertise or to offer or agree to do the same.

possesses the same with intent to promote or wholesale promote it, in
the course of his business, is presumed to do so with knowledge of its
content and character.
B. A person who possesses six or more identical or similar obscene articles

COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATION PROGRAM
§ 141-1. Legislative findings; intent and purpose; authority.
A. It is the policy of both the City of Schenectady ("Municipality") and the
State of New York to reduce costs and provide cost certainty for the
purpose of economic development, to promote deeper penetration of
energy efficiency and renewable energy resources such as wind and
solar, and wider deployment of distributed energy resources as well as
to examine the retail energy markets and increase participation of and
benefits for eligible consumers in those markets. Among the policies
and models that may offer benefits in New York is Community Choice
Aggregation ("CCA"), which allows local governments to determine the
default supplier of electricity and natural gas on behalf of eligible
consumers.
B. The purpose of CCA is to allow participating local governments to
procure energy supply service for eligible consumers, who will have the
§ 140-5 SCHENECTADY CODE § 141-1

the meanings employed in the State of New York Public Service
Commission's Uniform Business Practices or, if not so defined there, as
indicated below:
AGGREGATED DATA  Aggregated and anonymized information including
the number of consumers by service class, the aggregated peak demand
(kW) (for electricity) by month for the past 12 months, by service class
to the extent possible, and the aggregated energy (kWh) for electricity by
month for the past 12 months by service class.
CCA ADMINISTRATOR  The City of Schenectady or third party CCA
Administrator duly authorized to put out for bid the total amount of being
purchased by participating consumers. CCA administrator is responsible for

any customer-specific alternate billing name, address, and phone number.
opportunity to opt out of the procurement, while maintaining
transmission and distribution service from the existing distribution
utility. This chapter establishes a program ("CCA Program") that will
allow the Municipality and other local governments to work together
through a shared purchasing model to put out for bid the total amount
of electricity being purchased by eligible consumers within the
jurisdictional boundaries of participating municipalities. Eligible
consumers will have the opportunity to have more control to lower their
overall energy costs, to spur clean energy innovation and investment,
to improve customer choice and value, and to protect the environment;
thereby, fulfilling the purposes of this chapter and fulfilling an
important public purpose.
C. The Municipality is authorized to implement this CCA Program
pursuant to § 10(1)(ii)(a)(12) of the New York Municipal Home Rule
Law; and State of New York Public Service Commission Case No.
14-M-0224, Proceeding on Motion of the Commission to Enable
Community Choice Aggregation Programs (issued April 21, 2016) as

products and services to participating consumers, including
opportunities to participate in local renewable energy projects, shared
solar, energy efficiency, microgrids, storage, demand response, energy
management, and other innovative Reforming the Energy Vision (REV)
initiatives and objectives designed to optimize system benefits, target
and address load pockets/profile within the CCA zone, and reduce costs
for CCA customers.

Erosion and Sediment Control
[Adopted 5-14-2007 by L.L. No. 5-2007]
§ 148-1. Findings.
It is hereby determined that:
§ 148-2. Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to safeguard persons, protect property, and
prevent damage to the environment in the City of Schenectady, New York.
This article will also promote the public welfare by guiding, regulating,
and controlling the design, construction, use, and maintenance of any land
development activity as it relates to erosion and sedimentation control and
stormwater management. This article seeks to meet these purposes by
achieving the following objectives:
A. Uncontrolled drainage and runoff associated with land development
has a significant impact upon the health, safety and welfare of the
community.
B. Eroded soil endangers water resources by reducing water quality and
causing the silting of streams, lakes and other water bodies adversely
affecting aquatic life.
C. Stormwater runoff and sediment transports pollutants such as heavy
metals, hydrocarbons, nutrients and bacteria to water resources,
degrading water quality.
D. Eroded soil necessitates repair and accelerates the maintenance needs
of stormwater management facilities.
E. Clearing, grading and altering natural topography during construction
tends to increase erosion.
F. Improper design and construction of drainage facilities can increase
the velocity of runoff, thereby increasing stream bank erosion and
sedimentation.
G. Impervious surfaces increase the volume and rate of stormwater runoff
and allow less water to percolate into the soil, thereby decreasing
groundwater recharge and stream baseflow.
H. Improperly managed stormwater runoff can increase the incidence of
flooding and the severity of floods that occur, endangering property and
human life.
I. Substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts.
J. Stormwater runoff, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be
controlled and minimized through the regulation of land development
activities.
§ 148-1 CHARTER AND RELATED LEGISLATION § 148-2
C:441
§ 148-3. Statutory authority.
In accordance with § 10 of the Municipal Home Rule Law of the State of
New York, the governing Board of the City of Schenectady has the authority
to enact local laws and amend local laws for the purpose of promoting the
health, safety or general welfare of the City of Schenectady and for the
protection and enhancement of its physical environment.
§ 148-4. Applicability; exempt activities.
A. Meet the requirements of minimum control measures four
(construction site stormwater runoff control) and five (postconstruction
stormwater management) of the State Pollution Discharge
Elimination System (SPDES) General Permit for Stormwater
Discharges from Municipal Separate Stormwater Sewer Systems
(MS4s), Permit GP-02-02, or as amended or revised.
B. Require land development activities to conform to the substantive
requirements of the NYS Department of Environmental Conservation
(SPDES) General Permit for Construction Activities GP-02-01, or as
amended or revised.
C. Minimize soil erosion and sedimentation impacts on streams, water
bodies, and neighboring properties.
D. Avoid excessive and/or unnecessary tree and vegetation removal.
E. Minimize windblown soil associated with properties being cleared and
graded for development.
F. Maintain the integrity of watercourses and sustain their hydrologic
functions.
G. Minimize increases in the magnitude and frequency of stormwater
runoff to prevent an increase in flood flows and the hazards and costs
associated with flooding.
H. Minimize decreases in groundwater recharge and stream baseflow to
maintain aquatic life, assimilative capacity, and water supplies.
I. Facilitate the removal of pollutants in stormwater runoff to perpetuate
the natural biological function of water bodies.
A. Except as otherwise provided herein, no person shall commence or
perform any land development activity as defined in § 148-5 herein
without the review and approval of a stormwater pollution prevention
plan (SWPPP) by the responsible board and/or the Stormwater
Management Officer.
B. Applicants shall also obtain all other permits required by state, federal,
and local laws. Whenever the particular circumstances of proposed
land development activity require compliance with special use, site
plan, or subdivision procedures of the City of Schenectady, the
§ 148-2 SCHENECTADY CODE § 148-4
C:442
responsible board shall integrate the requirements prescribed herein
as appropriate and determine the adequacy of the SWPPP.
C. Redevelopment projects.
(1) Redevelopment projects as defined herein provide an opportunity
to reduce pollutant discharges and the rate, the amount as well as
the quality of stormwater runoff leaving the redevelopment site.
However, the nature of the site, particularly in an urban location,
may impose constraints that prevent implementation of full postconstruction
compliance. Chapter 9 of the "New York State
Stormwater Management Design Manual" sets forth the standards
for compliance with water quantity and quality standards and
specifications.
(2) Consideration shall be given to using alternative stormwater
management practices such as rain gardens, pervious pavers,
green roofs and other low-impact development techniques to
reduce stormwater impacts.
D. No SWPPP is required for the following exempt activities:
(1) Any emergency activity that is immediately necessary for the
protection of life, property, or natural resources.
(2) Agricultural operations conducted as a permitted principal or
accessory use, including the construction of structures where the
land disturbance is less than one acre.
(3) Routine maintenance activities that are performed to maintain the
original line and grade, hydraulic capacity, or original purpose of a
stormwater management facility. This includes roadway drainage
ditch maintenance (although erosion and sedimentation impacting
waters of the United States is still a violation under the Clean
Water Act).
(4) Mining as defined herein.
(5) The renovation/replacement of a septic system serving an existing
dwelling or structure.
(6) Normal lawn and landscaping activities/maintenance.
(7) Activities of an individual engaging in home gardening by growing
flowers, vegetables and other plants primarily for use by that
person and his or her family.
(8) Silviculture activities, i.e., the harvest of timber in accordance with
a forest-management plan prepared by a forest-management
professional. Activities include selective cutting of timber,
delimbing and trimming, felling, skidding, log haul road
construction and maintenance, loading, stacking and temporary
storage prior to transport from the site. (Note: one-time clear-

A. All land development activities shall be subject to the following design
and performance standards:
(1) For the purpose of this article, the following documents shall serve
as the official guides and standards for stormwater management.
Stormwater management practices in accordance with these
technical documents shall be presumed to meet the standards
imposed by this article.
(2) Land development activities as defined herein, including grading,
erosion, and sediment control practices, and waterway crossings
shall meet the design criteria set forth in the most recent version of
the "New York Standards and Specifications for Erosion and
Sediment Control" published by the Empire State Chapter of the
Soil and Water Conservation Society. For the design of postconstruction
stormwater management practices, the technical
standards are currently detailed in the publication "New York State
Stormwater Management Design Manual published by the New
York State Department of Environmental Conservation.
B. Equivalence to technical standards. Where stormwater management
practices are not in accordance with above design and technical
standards, the applicant or developer must demonstrate equivalence to
the design and technical standards set forth in this section and the
equivalence shall be documented and certified by a licensed/certified
professional as part of the SWPPP.
(1) Cut and fill slopes shall be no greater than 2:1, except where
retaining walls, structural stabilization or other methods
acceptable to the City of Schenectady designated licensed/certified
professional are used. Disturbed areas shall be restored as natural
appearing landforms, and shall blend in with the terrain of adjacent
undisturbed land. Abrupt, angular transitions shall be avoided.
(2) Clearing and grading shall be substantially confined to designated
building envelopes, utility easements, driveways, and parking
footprint. Clearing and grading techniques that retain natural
vegetation and drainage patterns, as described in the most recent
version of "Standards and Specifications for Erosion and Sediment
Control" referenced above shall be used to the satisfaction of the
responsible board. No clearing or grading shall take place within
the established fifty-foot watercourse buffer area except to provide
road crossings where permitted.
(3) Clearing, except that necessary to establish sediment control
devices, shall not begin until all sediment control devices have
been installed and have been stabilized.
(4) Phasing shall be required on all sites disturbing greater than 30
acres, with the size of each phase to be established at plan review
§ 148-11 CHARTER AND RELATED LEGISLATION § 148-11
C:451
and as approved by the responsible board. There shall not be
more than five acres of disturbed soil at any one time without
prior written approval from the NYS Department of Environmental
Conservation.
(5) The permittee shall initiate stabilization measures as soon as
practicable in portions of the site where construction activities
have temporarily or permanently ceased, but in no case more than
14 days after the construction activity in that portion of the site has
temporarily or permanently ceased. This requirement does not
apply in the following instances:
(a) Where the initiation of stabilization measures by the 14th day
after construction activity temporarily or permanently ceased
is precluded by snow cover or frozen ground conditions,
stabilization measures shall be initiated as soon as practicable;
(b) Where construction activity on a portion of the site is
temporarily ceased, and earth-disturbing activities will be
resumed within 21 days, temporary stabilization measures
need not be initiated on that portion of the site.
(6) The mere parking and moving of construction vehicles around the
site does not constitute construction or earth-disturbing activity. If
the permittee is not diligently pursuing the project toward
completion as determined by the City of Schenectady Stormwater
Management Officer or designated agent, the Stormwater
Management Officer may issue a notice of violation (see § 148-18A)
and stipulate that the stabilization measures as outlined above
shall be undertaken to prevent site erosion.
(7) If seeding or another vegetative erosion control method is used, it
shall become established within 14 days or the applicant may be
required to re-seed the site or use a nonvegetative option.
(8) Special techniques that meet the design criteria outlined in the
most recent version of "Standards and Specifications for Erosion
and Sediment Control" shall be used to ensure stabilization on
steep slopes or in drainageways.
(9) Soil stockpiles must be stabilized or covered at the end of each
workday.
(10) The entire site must be stabilized using a heavy mulch layer or
another method that does not require germination to control
erosion at the close of the construction season.
(11) Techniques shall be employed to prevent the blowing of dust or
sediment from the site.
(12) Techniques that divert upland runoff past disturbed slopes shall be
employed.

Any land development activity shall not result in:
§ 148-13. Erosion and sediment control inspection.
(13) Adjacent properties shall be protected by the use of a vegetated
buffer strip in combination with perimeter controls.
(14) In general, wetlands and watercourses should not be filled, graded
or altered. The crossing of watercourses should be avoided to the
maximum extent practicable. When protection of wetlands,
watercourses, trees, steep slopes or other environmentally
sensitive area is required, the location shall be shown on the
erosion control plan and the method of protection during
construction identified (e.g., silt fence, construction fence, stakes,
etc.). A vegetative buffer (twenty-five-foot minimum) shall be
maintained between disturbed areas and protected federal
wetlands that are not proposed to be filled as part of an Army Corps
of Engineers wetlands permit. In the case of state designated
wetlands, the adjacent area of 100 feet shall not be disturbed
without a NYS Department of Environmental Conservation permit.
(15) Stabilization shall be adequate to prevent erosion located at the
outlets of all pipes and paved/riprap channels.
(16) Sediment shall be removed from sediment traps or sediment ponds
whenever their design capacity has been reduced by 50%.
(17) Development should relate to site conditions and disturbance of
steep slopes should be avoided. Grading should be minimized by
utilizing existing topography whenever possible. Roads and
driveways shall follow the natural topography to the greatest
extent possible.
(18) In areas of severe slopes (exceeding 25%), land-disturbing
activities are not permitted. A twenty-five-foot buffer must be
maintained between any disturbed area and the top of slopes 25%
and greater.
A. An increase in turbidity that will cause a substantial visible contrast to
natural conditions;
B. An increase in suspended, colloidal and settleable solids that will cause
deposition or impair the waters for their best uses; or
C. Residue from oil and floating substances, nor visible oil film, or globules
of grease.
A. Stormwater Management Officer inspections.

at the construction site in a prominent place for public viewing. A copy
of the SWPPP shall be retained at the site of the land development
activity during construction from the beginning of construction
activities to the date of final stabilization. The SWPPP and inspection
reports are public documents that the operator must make available for
inspection, review and copying by any person within five business days
of the operator receiving a written request by such person to review the
SWPPP and/or the inspection reports. Copying of documents will be
done at the requester's expense.
D. The operator shall maintain a record of all inspection reports in a site
log book. The site log book shall be maintained on site and be made
available to the City of Schenectady upon request. The operator shall
post at the site, in a publicly accessible location, a summary of the siteinspection
activities on a monthly basis.
E. The Stormwater Management Officer or designated agent shall enter
the property of the applicant as deemed necessary to make regular
inspections to ensure the validity of the reports filed under Subsection

discharges.
the SMO may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or
minimize damage to the MS4 or to minimize danger to persons.
B. Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person
discharging to the municipality's MS4 in violation of this article may
have his or her MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate
or reduce an illicit discharge. The SMO will notify a violator in writing
of the proposed termination of its MS4 access and the reasons therefor.
The violator may petition the SMO for a reconsideration and hearing.
Access may be granted by the SMO if he/she finds that the illicit
discharge has ceased and the discharger has taken steps to prevent its
recurrence. Access may be denied if the SMO determines in writing
that the illicit discharge has not ceased or is likely to recur. A person
commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises
terminated pursuant to this section without the prior approval of the
SMO.
A. Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that the SMO must
inspect to enforce any provision of this article, or whenever the
authorized enforcement agency has cause to believe that there exists,
or potentially exists, in or upon any premises any condition which
constitutes a violation of this article.
B. Access to facilities.
(1) The SMO shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject
to regulation under this article as often as may be necessary to
determine compliance with this article. If a discharger has security
measures in force which require proper identification and
clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make
the necessary arrangements to allow access to the SMO.
(2) Facility operators shall allow the SMO ready access to all parts of
the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination
and copying of records as may be required to implement this
article.

Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person
responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency
response for a facility or operation has information of any known or
suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal
discharges or pollutants discharging into the MS4, said person shall take all
necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such
release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials, said person
shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence
via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of nonhazardous
materials, said person shall notify the municipality in person or by
telephone or facsimile no later than the next business day. Notifications
in person or by telephone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed
and mailed to the municipality within three business days of the telephone
notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial
or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment
shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions
taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least
three years.

sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all
times in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at
its own expense. All devices used to measure stormwater flow and
quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
(5) Unreasonable delays in allowing the municipality access to a
facility subject to this article is a violation of this article. A person
who is the operator of a facility subject to this article commits an
offense if the person denies the municipality reasonable access to
the facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or
required by this article.
(6) If the SMO has been refused access to any part of the premises
from which stormwater is discharged, and he/she is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a
violation of this article, or that there is a need to inspect and/or
sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program
designed to verify compliance with this article or any order issued
hereunder, then the SMO may seek issuance of a search warrant
from any court of competent jurisdiction.
A. Notice of violation.

C:469
§ 148-33. Injunctive relief.
It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any provision or fail to comply
with any of the requirements of this article. If a person has violated or
continues to violate the provisions of this article, the SMO may petition for
a preliminary or permanent injunction restraining the person from activities
(1) When the municipality's SMO finds that a person has violated a
prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this article, he/she
may order compliance by written notice of violation to the
responsible person. Such notice may require, without limitation:
(a) The elimination of illicit connections or discharges;

required, the notice shall set forth a deadline within which such
remediation or restoration must be completed. Said notice shall
further advise that, should the violator fail to remediate or restore
within the established deadline, the work will be done by a
designated governmental agency or a contractor and the expense
thereof shall be charged to the violator.
B. Penalties. In addition to or as an alternative to any penalty provided
herein or by law, any person who violates the provisions of this article
shall be guilty of a violation punishable by a fine not exceeding $350 or
imprisonment for a period not to exceed six months, or both for
conviction of a first offense; for conviction of a second offense, both of
which were committed within a period of five years, punishable by a
fine not less than $350 nor more than $700 or imprisonment for a
period not to exceed six months, or both; and upon conviction for a third
or subsequent offense, all of which were committed within a period of
five years, punishable by a fine not less than $700 nor more than $1,000
or imprisonment for a period not to exceed six months, or both.
However, for the purposes of conferring jurisdiction upon courts and
judicial officers generally, violations of this article shall be deemed
misdemeanors and for such purpose only all provisions of law relating
to misdemeanors shall apply to such violations. Each week's continued
violation shall constitute a separate additional violation.

which would create further violations or compelling the person to perform
abatement or remediation of the violation.
§ 148-34. Violations deemed a public nuisance.
In addition to the enforcement processes and penalties provided, any
condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions of
this article is a threat to public health, safety, and welfare, and is declared
and deemed a nuisance, and may be summarily abated or restored at
the violator's expense, and/or a civil action to abate, enjoin, or otherwise
compel the cessation of such nuisance may be taken.

§ 149-14. Application criteria.
Upon the submission of an application, EIC, acting on behalf of the
municipality, shall make a positive or negative determination on such
application based upon the following criteria for the making of a financing:
behalf of the municipality, and with the consent of the benefited
property owner, will record a benefit assessment lien on the benefited
property in the secured amount (the "benefit assessment lien") on the
land records for the municipality. Such recording shall be exempt from
any charge, mortgage recording tax or other fee in the same manner as

B. Before a qualified property owner and a financing party enter into a
finance agreement which results in a loan to finance a qualified project,
repayment of which is secured by a benefit assessment lien, a written
consent from each existing mortgage holder of the qualified property
shall be obtained, permitting the benefit assessment lien and each
annual installment lien to take priority over all existing mortgages.

EIC on such forms as have been prepared by EIC and made available to
property owners on the website of EIC and at the municipality's offices.
B. Every application submitted by a property owner shall be reviewed by
EIC, acting on behalf of the municipality, which shall make a positive or

§ 149-16. Terms and conditions of repayment.
The finance agreement shall set forth the terms and conditions of
repayment in accordance with the following:

on the qualified property; and
F. Such additional criteria, not inconsistent with the criteria set forth
above, as the state, the municipality, or EIC acting on its behalf, or
other financing parties may set from time to time.
A. A qualified property owner may participate in the Program through the
execution of a finance agreement made by and between the qualified
property owner and a financing party, to which EIC, on behalf of the
municipality, shall be a third-party beneficiary (the "finance
agreement"). Upon execution and delivery of the finance agreement,
the property that is the subject of the finance agreement shall be
deemed a benefited property.
B. Upon execution and delivery of the finance agreement, the benefited
property owner shall be eligible to receive funds from the financing
party for the acquisition, construction, and installation of a qualified
project, together with eligible costs and financing charges approved by
EIC and by the financing party, provided the requirements of the
Enabling Act, the municipal agreement and this article have been met.

financing charges approved by EIC and by the financing party, shall be
specially assessed against the benefited property and will be evidenced
by a benefit assessment lien recorded against the benefited property on
the land records on which liens are recorded for properties within the
municipality. The special benefit assessment shall constitute a "charge"
within the meaning of the Enabling Act and shall be collected in annual
installments in the amounts certified by the financing party in a
schedule provided at closing and made part of the benefit assessment
lien. Said amount shall be annually levied, billed and collected by EIC,
on behalf of the municipality, and shall be paid to the financing party as
provided in the finance agreement.
B. The term of such repayment shall be determined at the time the finance
agreement is executed by the benefited property owner and the

financing party, not to exceed the weighted average of the useful life of
the systems and improvements as determined by EIC, acting on behalf
of the municipality.
C. The rate of interest for the secured amount shall be fixed by the
financing party in conjunction with EIC, acting on behalf of the
municipality, as provided in the finance agreement.
A. Upon the making of the loan pursuant to the finance agreement, the
secured amount shall become a special benefit assessment lien on the
benefited property in favor of the municipality. The amount of the
benefit assessment lien shall be the secured amount. Evidence of the
benefit assessment lien shall be recorded by EIC, on behalf of the
municipality, in the land records for properties in the municipality. Such
recording shall be exempt from any charge, mortgage recording tax or
other fee in the same manner as if recorded by the municipality. The
benefit assessment lien shall not be foreclosed upon by or otherwise
enforced by the municipality.
B. The finance agreement shall provide for the repayment of the secured
amount in installments made at least annually, as provided in a
schedule attached to the benefit assessment lien (the "annual
installment amount"). The annual installment amount shall be levied by
EIC, on behalf of the municipality, on the benefited property in the same
manner as levies for municipal charges, shall become a lien on the
benefited property as of the first day of January of the fiscal year for
which levied (the "annual installment lien") and shall remain a lien until
paid. The creation or any recording of the annual installment lien shall
be exempt from any charge, mortgage recording tax or other fee in the
same manner as if recorded by the municipality. Payment to the
financing party shall be considered payment for this purpose. Such
payment shall partly or wholly discharge the annual installment lien.
Delinquent annual installment amounts may accrue financing charges
as may be provided in the finance agreement. Any additional financing
charges imposed by the financing party pursuant to the finance
agreement shall increase the annual installment amount and the annual
installment lien for the year in which such overdue payments were first
due.
C. The benefit assessment lien shall be reduced annually by the amount of
each annual installment lien when each annual installment lien
becomes a lien. Each annual installment lien shall be subordinate to all
municipal liens, whether created by § 902 of the RPTL or by any other
state or local law. No portion of a secured amount shall be recovered by
the municipality, EIC, or an assignee upon foreclosure, sale or other
disposition of the benefited property unless and until all municipal liens
are fully discharged. Each annual installment lien, however, shall have

C:484
§ 149-18. Verification and report.
EIC, on behalf of the municipality, shall verify and report on the installation
and performance of renewable energy systems and energy efficiency
improvements financed by the program in such form and manner as the
Authority may establish.
§ 149-19. Severability.
If any clause, sentence, paragraph, section, or part of this article shall
be adjudged by any court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such
judgment shall not affect, impair or invalidate the remainder thereof, but
shall be confined in its operation to the clause, sentence, paragraph,
priority over all non-municipal liens, irrespective of when created,
except as otherwise required by law.
D. Neither the benefit assessment lien nor any annual installment lien
shall be extinguished or accelerated in the event of a default or
bankruptcy of the benefited property owner. Each annual installment
amount shall be considered a charge upon the benefited property and
shall be collected by EIC, on behalf of the municipality, at the same time
and in the same manner as real property taxes or municipal charges.
Each annual installment lien shall remain a lien until paid. Amounts
collected in respect of an annual installment lien shall be remitted to
EIC, on behalf of the municipality, or the financing party, as may be
provided in the finance agreement.
E. EIC shall act as the municipality's agent in collection of the annual
installment amounts. If any benefited property owner fails to pay an
annual installment amount, the financing party may redeem the
benefited property by paying the amount of all unpaid municipal liens
thereon, and thereafter shall have the right to collect any amounts in
respect of an annual installment lien by foreclosure or any other
remedy available at law. Any foreclosure shall not affect any subsequent
annual installment liens.
F. EIC, on behalf of the municipality, may sell or assign for consideration
any and all benefit assessment liens and annual installment liens to
financing parties that provide financing to qualified properties pursuant
to finance agreements. The financing parties may sell or assign for
consideration any and all benefit assessment liens and annual
installment liens received from EIC, on behalf of the municipality,
subject to certain conditions provided in the administration agreement
between EIC and the financing party. The assignee or assignees of such
benefit assessment liens and annual installment liens shall have and
possess the same powers and rights at law or in equity as the
municipality would have had if the benefit assessment lien and the
annual installment liens had not been assigned with regard to the
precedence and priority of such lien, the accrual of interest and the fees
and expenses of collection.

erosion or in flood heights or velocities.
B. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve
such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction.
C. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of
floodwaters.
D. Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damages.
E. Regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert
floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.
F. Qualify for and maintain participation in the National Flood Insurance
Program.
A. Protect human life and health.
§ 156-12 CHARTER AND RELATED LEGISLATION § 157-3

E. Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities, such as water and gas
mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard.
F. Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future
flood-blight areas.

The areas of special flood hazard are identified by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency in a scientific and engineering report entitled the
"Flood Insurance Study for the City of Schenectady of Schenectady County,
New York," dated March 30, 1983, with accompanying Flood Insurance
Rate Maps and Flood Boundary - Floodway Maps, which is hereby adopted
and declared to be a part of this chapter. The Flood Insurance Study and
maps are on file at the office of the City Clerk.
§ 157-7. Interpretation; conflict with other provisions.
SAND DUNES  Naturally occurring accumulations of sand in ridges
or mounds landward of the beach.
START OF CONSTRUCTION  The initiation, excluding planning and
design, of any phase of a project or physical alteration of the property,
and shall include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling;
the installation of streets and/or walkways; excavation for a basement,
footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms. It also
includes the placement and/or installation on the property of accessory
buildings (garages, sheds), storage trailers and building materials. For
manufactured homes, the "actual start" means the affixing of the
manufactured home to its permanent site.
STRUCTURE  A walled and roofed building, a manufactured home or
a gas- or liquid-storage tank that is principally above ground.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT  Any repair, reconstruction or
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50%
of the market value of the structure either before the improvement or
repair is started or, if the structure has been damaged and is being
restored, before the damage occurred. For the purposes of this
definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to commence when
the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part
of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the
external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however,
include either any project for improvement of a structure to comply
with existing state or local building, fire, health, sanitary or safety
code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living
conditions; or any alteration of a structure or contributing structure
listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a State Inventory
of Historic Places.
VARIANCE  A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter
which permits construction or use in a manner that would otherwise be
prohibited by this chapter.
§ 157-4 CHARTER AND RELATED LEGISLATION § 157-7
C:509
§ 157-8. Penalties for offenses.
No structure shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted
or altered and no land shall be excavated or filled without full compliance
with the terms of this chapter and any other applicable regulations. Any
infraction of the provisions of this chapter by failure to comply with any
of its requirements, including infractions of conditions and safeguards
established in connection with conditions of the permit, shall constitute
a violation. Any person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with
any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined no more
than $250 or be imprisoned for not more than 15 days, or both. Each day
of noncompliance shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein
contained shall prevent the City of Schenectady from taking such other
lawful action as necessary to prevent or remedy an infraction. Any structure
found not compliant with the requirements of this chapter, for which the
developer and/or owner has not applied for and received an approved
variance under §§ 15716 and 157-17, will be declared noncompliant and
notification sent to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
§ 157-9. Warning and disclaimer of liability.
The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and
engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare
occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes.
This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood
hazard or that uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or
flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the City
of Schenectady, any officer or employee thereof or the Federal Emergency
Management Agency for any flood damages that result from reliance on this
chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
§ 157-10. Designation of local administrator.
The Building Inspector is hereby appointed local administrator to
administer and implement this chapter by granting or denying development
permit applications in accordance with its provisions.
A. This chapter is adopted in response to revisions to the National Flood
Insurance Program effective October 1, 1986, and shall supersede all
previous laws adopted for the purpose of establishing and maintaining
eligibility for flood insurance.
B. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter
shall be held to be minimum requirements, adopted for the promotion
of the public health, safety and welfare. Whenever the requirements of
this chapter are at variance with the requirements of any other lawfully
adopted rules, regulations or ordinances, the most restrictive or that
imposing the higher standards shall govern.

C:517
§ 157-15. Floodways.
Located within areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as
floodways. (See definition, § 157-4.) The floodway is an extremely hazardous
area due to high-velocity floodwaters carrying debris and posing additional
threats from potential erosion forces. When floodway data is available for
a particular site as provided by §§ 157-6 and 157-12B, all encroachments,
including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other
development, are prohibited within the limits of the floodway unless a
technical evaluation demonstrates that such encroachments shall not result
in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood
discharge.
§ 157-16. Appeals board.
(c) Openings may be equipped with louvers, valves, screens or
other coverings or openings, provided that they permit the
automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.
A. The Zoning Board of Appeals as established by the City of Schenectady,
shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the
requirements of this chapter.
B. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall hear and decide appeals when it is
alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision or determination
made by the local administrator in the enforcement or administration of
this chapter.
C. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Zoning Board of Appeals may
appeal such decision to the Supreme Court pursuant to Article 78 of the
Civil Practice Law and Rules.
D. In passing upon such applications, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall
consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards
specified in other sections of this chapter and:
(1) The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
(2) The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage.
(3) The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
(4) The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community.
(5) The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
(6) The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which
are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
§ 157-14 SCHENECTADY CODE § 157-16
C:518
§ 157-17. Conditions for variances.
(7) The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development.
(8) The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Plan
and floodplain management program of that area.
(9) The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles.
(10) The costs to local governments and the dangers associated with
conducting search and rescue operations during periods of
flooding.

this chapter, the Zoning Board of Appeals may attach such conditions to
the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes
of this chapter.
F. The local administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions,
including technical information, and report any variances to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency upon request.
A. Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of 1/2 acre or less in
size, contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures
constructed below the base flood level, provided that the items in
§ 157-16D(1) through (12) have been fully considered. As the lot size
increases beyond the 1/2 acre, the technical justification required for
issuing the variance increases.
B. Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or
restoration of structures and contributing structures listed on the
National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic
Places without regard to the contributing structures procedures set
forth in the remainder of this section.

Definitions
§ 158-4. Definitions.
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter
shall be interpreted so as to give them the meanings they have in common
usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.
APPEAL  A request for a review of the local administrator's interpretation
of any provision of this chapter or a request for a variance.
AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING  A designated AO, AH or VO Zone on
a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), with a one-percent or
greater annual chance of flooding to an average annual depth of one to
three feet, where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path
of flooding is unpredictable, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such
flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD  The land in the floodplain within
a community subject to a one-percent or greater chance of flooding in any
given year. This area may be designated as Zone A, AE, AH, AO, A1-A30,
A99, V, VO, VE or V1-V30. It is also commonly referred to as the "base
floodplain" or "one-hundred-year floodplain." For purposes of this chapter,
the term "special flood hazard area (SFHA)" is synonymous in meaning with
the phrase "area of special flood hazard."
BASE FLOOD  The flood having a one-percent chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year.
BASEMENT  That portion of a building having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all sides.

§ 158-13. Application for permit.
The applicant shall provide the following information as appropriate.
Additional information may be required on the permit application form.
A. Purpose.
(1) A floodplain development permit is hereby established for all
construction and other development to be undertaken in areas of
special flood hazard in this community for the purpose of
protecting its citizens from increased flood hazards and ensuring
that new development is constructed in a manner that minimizes its
exposure to flooding. It shall be unlawful to undertake any
development in an area of special flood hazard, as shown on the
Flood Insurance Rate Map enumerated in § 158-6, without a valid
floodplain development permit.
(2) Application for a permit shall be made on forms furnished by the
local administrator and may include, but not be limited to: plans, in
duplicate, drawn to scale, and showing: the nature, location,
dimensions, and elevations of the area in question, existing or
proposed structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage facilities,
and the location of the forgoing.
B. Fees. All applications for a floodplain development permit shall be
accompanied by an application fee of $50. In addition, the applicant
shall be responsible for reimbursing the City of Schenectady for any
additional costs necessary for review, inspection and approval of this
project. The local administrator may require a deposit of no more than
$500 to cover these additional costs.
A. The proposed elevation, in relation to mean sea level, of the lowest floor
(including basement or cellar) of any new or substantially improved
structure to be located in Zone A1-A30, AE, or AH, or Zone A if base
flood elevation data are available. Upon completion of the lowest floor,
the permittee shall submit to the local administrator the as-built
elevation, certified by a licensed professional engineer or surveyor.

floodproofed elevation, certified by a professional engineer or surveyor.
C. A certificate from a licensed professional engineer or architect that any
utility floodproofing will meet the criteria in § 158-16C, Utilities.
D. A certificate from a licensed professional engineer or architect that any
nonresidential floodproofed structure will meet the floodproofing
criteria in § 158-18, Nonresidential structures.
E. A description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or
relocated as a result of proposed development. Computations by a
licensed professional engineer must be submitted that demonstrate
that the altered or relocated segment will provide equal or greater
conveyance than the original stream segment. The applicant must
submit any maps, computations or other material required by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise the
documents enumerated in § 158-6, when notified by the local
administrator, and must pay any fees or other costs assessed by FEMA
for this purpose. The applicant must also provide assurances that the
conveyance capacity of the altered or relocated stream segment will be
maintained.
F. A technical analysis, by a licensed professional engineer, if required by
the local administrator, which shows whether proposed development to
be located in an area of special flood hazard may result in physical
damage to any other property.
G. In Zone A, when no base flood elevation data are available from other
sources, base flood elevation data shall be provided by the permit
applicant for subdivision proposals and other proposed developments
(including proposals from manufactured home and recreational vehicle
parks and subdivisions) that are greater than either 50 lots or five
acres.
A. Permit application review. The local administrator shall conduct the
following permit application review before issuing a floodplain
development permit:
(1) Review all applications for completeness, particularly with the
requirements of § 158-13, Application for permit, and for
compliance with the provisions and standards of this chapter.
(2) Review subdivision and other proposed new development,
including manufactured home parks, to determine whether
proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a
proposed building site is located in an area of special flood hazard,

C:532
all new construction and substantial improvements shall meet the
applicable standards of Article V, Construction Standards, and, in
particular, § 158-15A, Subdivision proposals.
(3) Determine whether any proposed development in an area of special
flood hazard may result in physical damage to any other property
(e.g., stream bank erosion and increased flood velocities). The local
administrator may require the applicant to submit additional
technical analyses and data necessary to complete the
determination. If the proposed development may result in physical
damage to any other property or fails to meet the requirements of
Article V, Construction Standards, no permit shall be issued. The
applicant may revise the application to include measures that
mitigate or eliminate the adverse effects and resubmit the
application.
(4) Determine that all necessary permits have been received from
those governmental agencies from which approval is required by
state or federal law.
B. Use of other flood data.

areas of special flood hazard on the community's Flood Insurance
Rate Map (FIRM) but has neither produced water surface elevation
data (these areas are designated Zone A or V on the FIRM) nor
identified a floodway, the local administrator shall obtain, review
and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data
available from a federal, state or other source, including data
developed pursuant to § 158-13G, as criteria for requiring that new
construction, substantial improvements or other proposed
development meet the requirements of this chapter.
(2) When base flood elevation data are not available, the local
administrator may use flood information from any other
authoritative source, such as historical data, to establish flood
elevations within the areas of special flood hazard, for the purposes
of this chapter.
C. Alteration of watercourses. The local administrator shall:
(1) Provide notification to adjacent communities and the New York
State Department of Environmental Conservation prior to
permitting any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and
submit evidence of such notification to the Regional Administrator,
Region II, Federal Emergency Management Agency.
(2) Determine that the permit holder has provided for maintenance
within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood-carrying capacity is not diminished.

data are available, upon placement of the lowest floor or
completion of floodproofing of a new or substantially improved
structure, the local administrator shall obtain from the permit
holder a certification of the as-built elevation of the lowest floor or
floodproofed elevation, in relation to mean sea level. The certificate
shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a licensed
land surveyor or professional engineer and certified by same. For
manufactured homes, the permit holder shall submit the certificate
of elevation upon placement of the structure on the site. A
certificate of elevation must also be submitted for a recreational
vehicle if it remains on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer
(unless it is licensed and ready for highway use).
(2) Any further work undertaken prior to submission and approval of
the certification shall be at the permit holder's risk. The local
administrator shall review all data submitted. Deficiencies detected
shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the project unless
immediately corrected.
E. Inspections. The local administrator and/or the developer's engineer or
architect shall make periodic inspections at appropriate times through
the period of construction in order to monitor compliance with permit
conditions and enable said inspector to certify, if requested, that the
development is in compliance with the requirements of the floodplain
requested permit and/or any variance provisions.
F. Stop-work orders.
(1) The local administrator shall issue, or cause to be issued, a stopwork
order for any floodplain development found ongoing without a
development permit. Disregard of a stop-work order shall subject
the violator to the penalties described in § 158-9 of this chapter.

Variance Procedure
§ 158-20. Appeals Board.
A. The Board of Zoning Appeals as established by the City of Schenectady
shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the
requirements of this chapter.
B. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall hear and decide appeals when it is
alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination
made by the local administrator in the enforcement or administration of
this chapter.
C. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals may
appeal such decision to the Supreme Court pursuant to Article 78 of the
Civil Practice Law and Rules.
D. In passing upon such applications, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall
consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards
specified in other sections of this chapter and:
(1) The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
(2) The danger to life and property due to flooding and erosion
damage;
(3) The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
(4) The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
(5) The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
(6) The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which
are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
(7) The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
(8) The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Plan
and floodplain management program of that area;
(9) The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
(10) The cost to the local governments and dangers associated with
conducting search and rescue operations during periods of
flooding;
§ 158-20 CHARTER AND RELATED LEGISLATION § 158-20
C:543
§ 158-21. Conditions for variances.
(11) The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
(12) The cost of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including search and rescue operations, maintenance
and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas,
electrical, and water systems and streets and bridges.
E. Upon consideration of the factors of Subsection D and the purposes of
this chapter, the Board of Zoning Appeals may attach such conditions to
the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes
of this chapter.
F. The local administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions,
including technical information, and report any variances to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency upon request.
A. Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of 1/2 acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures
constructed below the base flood level, provided that the items in
§ 158-20D(1) through (12) have been fully considered. As the lot size
increases beyond the 1/2 acre, the technical justification required for
issuing the variance increases.
B. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that:
(1) The proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure's continued designation as an "historic structure"; and
(2) The variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic
character and design of the structure.
C. Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and
substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the
conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided that:
(1) The criteria of Subsections A, D, E and F of this section are met;
and
(2) The structure or other development is protected by methods that
minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no
additional threat to public safety.
D. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
E. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is
the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
§ 158-20 SCHENECTADY CODE § 158-21
C:544
F. Justification; notifications.
(1) Variances shall only be issued upon receiving written justification
of:
(a) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
(b) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
(c) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
or extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud
on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local
laws or ordinances.
(2) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted for a building with the
lowest floor below the base flood elevation shall be given written
notice over the signature of a community official that:
(a) The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the
base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood
insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance
coverage; and
(b) Such construction below the base flood level increases risk to
life and property.
(3) Such notifications shall be maintained with the record of all
variance actions as required in § 158-14H of this chapter.

§ 161-1. Legislative intent and findings.
A. The City of Schenectady finds that a significant amount of recyclable
material that could be removed from the solid waste stream is
needlessly landfilled each year. The source separation of this solid
waste so that recyclable material is recovered for reuse will:
(1) Reduce the consumption of and demand for scarce landfill capacity.
(2) Ensure a comprehensive mandatory City-wide program of source
separation.
(3) Aid in the conservation of vital materials, resources and energy.
(4) Protect the environment and the health and safety of the citizens
living and working in the City.
B. The enactment by the New York State Legislature of the Solid Waste
Management Act of 198880 created the need for the City to demonstrate
its long-term commitment to effective solid waste management and
required the City to enact appropriate legislation to require the source
separation and segregation of recyclables or reusable materials from
solid waste by September 1, 1992. The City declares that the measures
taken by the City be environmentally sound and yet achieve
economically desirable waste reduction through waste recycling and
reuse to not only meet, but substantially surpass, the goals established
by the state. The state has established a goal of 25% waste reduction by
September 1, 1992, and 50% waste reduction by 1997. The City finds
that voluntary recycling programs that were not mandatory in other
communities have not achieved the goals that have been set for them.
C. This chapter will accomplish a requirement for comprehensive source
separation. The solid waste categories will be consolidated with similar
materials to allow economic access to secondary markets. This chapter
will put all persons in the City into a class who source-separate their
solid waste.
D. Accordingly, the City finds that, to achieve these goals, it would be
appropriate to:
(1) Implement the applicable provisions of the New York State Solid
Waste Management Act of 198881;
(2) Create a program that provides for everyone in the City to recycle;

(3) Establish a mandatory City-wide comprehensive source separation
program so that each category of separated solid waste can be
individually addressed for recycling;
(4) Set forth a methodology for efficiently separating and collecting
reusable and recyclable materials from the City's solid waste
stream;
(5) Encourage and support the use of solid resources and skills of local
community organizations and members in addressing and aiding a
recyclable program;
(6) Institute penalties for noncompliance with this chapter.
A. The "City of Schenectady Mandatory Recycling Law" shall be cited as
this chapter.

(1) To provide for the efficient, economic and environmentally safe
management of all solid waste and especially recyclable wastes in
the City of Schenectady.
C. Specific purpose. The specific purposes of this chapter are the
following:
(1) To provide for the separation of solid waste categories which
include recyclables and nonrecyclables.
(2) To avoid the high cost of disposal of unseparated solid waste.
(3) To enhance the reuse and recyclability of solid waste and to limit
the landfilling of solid waste.
(4) To minimize to the greatest extent possible the burning and the
landfilling of recyclable solid waste.
(5) To provide education to all generators of solid waste in the City on
how to reduce solid waste generation, and how to properly prepare
materials for source separation.
(6) To provide for the enactment of regulations to comply with the
Solid Waste Management Act of 1988.82
(7) To provide for the enactment of regulations pertaining to waste
collection and recycling practices as they apply to residential,
commercial not-for-profit and institutional properties.

ARTICLE V
Fee-Based System for Collection of Solid Waste and Recyclables
[Adopted 11-22-2004 by L.L. No. 2-200490]
§ 161-17. Purpose, legislative findings and intent.
A. It shall be the purpose of this article to provide for the protection of the
public health, safety and general welfare of the people of the City of
Schenectady by establishing rules and regulations governing the
generation, separation, storage, collection, transportation, processing
and disposal of solid waste within the City limits; regulating residential,
institutional and commercial solid waste management; establishing
regulations for licensure of commercial solid waste collectors;
establishing rules and regulations governing the preparation,
collection, transportation and disposal of recyclable items in
accordance with state law; and providing for the proportionate
distribution of the costs of regulation, collection and disposal of solid
waste among those benefiting from the services provided by the City.
B. The City of Schenectady finds that financing the costs associated with
the regulation, collection, removal and disposal of solid waste through
ad valorem tax levy inequitably burdens taxpayers with the cost of
providing general solid waste collection services benefiting the
community as a whole, including organizations exempt from taxation.
C. The City of Schenectady also finds that funding waste collection
services provided by the City through ad valorem levy
disproportionately burdens certain taxpayers, resulting in the
subsidization of the costs of the services provided to other residents
arid taxpayers.
D. To equalize this disparity and reduce the cost of providing waste
collection services, the City finds that it is in the best interests of the
City to adjust and reallocate the cost of solid waste collection and
disposal by assessing proportionate collection fees on all users of the
City's solid waste collection services and to extend fee-based waste
collection services to tax-exempt organizations and institutions and to
commercial, mixed-use and multiple residential users, thereby reducing
the burden shared by all taxpayers and limiting that shared burden to
the costs of general services benefiting the City as a whole, continuing
to fund the costs of such general services by ad valorem tax, and
proportionally allocating the cost of individual collection and disposal
services among the class of persons utilizing the City's solid waste
collection and disposal services.

charge the property owner the cost of the abatement. Unpaid charges

determination of a nuisance or violation made by the Bureau. The
owner and other interested parties may be represented by counsel.

time heretofore prescribed after service of such notice or order, the
Bureau may proceed with the removal of such nuisance or
violation, as provided in the notice or order, or may cause the same
to be done. If the removal of the nuisance or violation requires the
demolition of said building or part of said building, the Corporation
Counsel shall present the records and papers of all prior
proceedings and hearings, if any, upon which the Bureau's
determination and notice and order are based to a Justice holding a
special term of the Supreme Court for the County of Schenectady
for review of said determination and confirmation thereof, at which
time the court may either annul or confirm, wholly or partly, or
modify the determination reviewed.

of corrective action by the City, the Bureau may cause such
building, in whole or in part, to be vacated and demolished but, in
such case, the Bureau shall commence a proceeding or action in
the Supreme Court for such relief in the manner prescribed by
Article 63 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules. During the pendency
of such proceeding, the Bureau may obtain a temporary order for
the immediate vacating of such building upon proof of a present
danger to human life or detriment to health.
(3) If the owner interferes in any way with or causes delay to the taking
of corrective action by the City, the Bureau may commence a
proceeding or action in the Supreme Court to restrain such
interference or delay.

ARTICLE XI
Drug-Related Nuisances
[Added 10-6-1997 by Ord. No. 97-27]
§ 167-71. Purpose.
§ 167-72. Public nuisances enumerated.
For purposes of this article, the following are declared to be public
nuisances:
§ 167-73. Additional enforcement procedures.
In addition to the enforcement procedures established elsewhere in the
Code of the City of Schenectady, the Mayor or his designee, after notice and
hearing, as hereinafter required, shall be authorized to:
A. The City Council of the City of Schenectady finds that there is an
increasing use of real property within the City of Schenectady for the
purpose of flagrant violations of the penal laws relating to dangerous
drugs and illegal firearms. The City Council also finds that such use
continues even after the interdiction by police authorities, with
repeated offenses being committed at the same properties.
B. The City Council finds that this situation seriously interferes with the
interest of the general public in the areas of quality of neighborhood life
and environment; diminution of property values; safety of the public
upon the streets and sidewalks; and increasing costs of law
enforcement as a result of these illegal activities.
C. The City Council, therefore, finds it in the public interest to authorize
and empower the appropriate City officials to impose sanctions and
penalties for such public nuisances as an additional and appropriate
method of law enforcement in response to the apparent proliferation of
these public nuisances without prejudice to the use of any other
procedures and remedies available under any other law.
A. Any room, building, structure, inhabitable structure or portion thereof
which is used for the illegal use, possession or selling of controlled
substances and/or illegal firearms as enumerated in the Penal Law of
the State of New York and the Laws of the United States of America.
B. For purposes of this chapter, inhabitable structures defined in
accordance with the provisions of § 167-6 of the Code of the City of
Schenectady.
C. For purposes of this chapter, illegal use, possession or selling of
controlled substances or marijuana and/or illegal firearms shall be
defined as any use, possession or selling of controlled substances or
marijuana and/or illegal firearms which is unlawful under federal or
New York State laws. [Amended 12-1-1997 by Ord. No. 97-31]
§ 167-71 CHARTER AND RELATED LEGISLATION § 167-73
C:655
§ 167-74. Notice procedure.
A. Order the discontinuance of such activity at the room, building,
structure, inhabitable structure, or any portion thereof, where such
public nuisance exists; and/or
B. Order the closing of said room, building, structure, inhabitable
structure, or portion thereof, to the extent necessary to abate the
nuisance, as prescribed hereafter.
A. Whenever the Department of Neighborhood Revitalization, or its
successor agency, is notified that a search warrant has been issued and
executed for any room, building, structure, inhabitable structure or
portion thereof in the City of Schenectady and that controlled
substances or marijuana, as defined in the New York State Penal Law,
have been confiscated as a result of said search warrant; or that an
arrest has been made in any room, building, structure, inhabitable
structure or portion thereof, and that controlled substances or
marijuana have been confiscated as a result of said arrest, said
Department shall cause a notice to be served on all owners of said
room, building, structure, inhabitable structure or portion thereof
notifying them of a violation of this chapter. The notice shall advise the
owners that the property will be declared a public nuisance if there are
any additional violations of this article. Said notice shall be given in
accordance with Subsection D of this section. [Amended 12-1-1997
by Ord. No. 97-31]
B. Upon notice to the Department of Neighborhood Revitalization, or its
successor agency, of a subsequent violation of this chapter within a
period of three years of the initial notice under this chapter, that
Department shall thereafter send a notice to all owners and mortgagors
that a public nuisance may exist under this chapter and that if said
nuisance is not abated within 14 days of the date of the notice the
Mayor may direct the Commissioner of the Department of
Neighborhood Revitalization to take action pursuant to this chapter.
Said notice shall be in accordance with Subsection D of this section.
C. If the notified parties fail to provide evidence of substantial abatement
of the nuisance at the end of the fourteen-day period, the Department of
Neighborhood Revitalization may give notice of a hearing to be
conducted before the Mayor, or his designee, under the provisions of
this chapter. All interested parties, including owners, lessees,
mortgagors, tenants and neighbors of the property, may attend the
hearing and present testimony. Notice of said hearing shall be given in
accordance with Subsection D of this section.
D. All notices required herein shall be served by means of certified mail,
return receipt requested, sent to the last known address of the required
party. If a signed, return receipt is not received within 14 days of
mailing, a copy of the notice shall be served in the manner provided for
service of a summons under the New York State Civil Practice Law and

conspicuous place on said premises shall be sufficient.
E. In addition to any notice served pursuant to Subsection D of this
section, all notices of hearings before the Mayor or his designee shall
be posted in a conspicuous place on the premises involved.

responsibility for a public nuisance on the part of the owners, lessors,
lessees, mortgagees and all those persons in possession or having
charge of, as agent or otherwise, or having any interest in the property,
real or personal, used in conducting or maintaining the public nuisance
shall not be a defense by such owners, lessors and lessees, mortgagees
and such other persons.
A. Within ten business days of the mailing of the notice and the posting of
the notice, at a time and place as contained in said notice, the Mayor, or
his designee, shall commence a hearing for the purpose of determining
whether a public nuisance exists under this chapter. Each person
designated to receive notice above shall be given an opportunity to
present evidence, under oath, and to be represented by counsel. The
Mayor or his designee shall have the power, on his own motion, to
subpoena witnesses and to take testimony, under oath, pertaining to all
relevant matters. The Mayor or his designee may continue all or part of
a hearing, if necessary, to conclude the investigation.
B. As part of his deliberations, the Mayor or his designee shall determine
whether the violation of this chapter is a significant, continuous, and
unreasonable interference with rights common to all members of the
community in general, such as public health, safety, peace, morals, or
convenience. In determining whether a room, building, structure,
inhabitable structure, or portion thereof should be closed as a result of
a violation under this chapter, the Mayor or his designee shall consider,
in addition to all other relevant factors, the impact of the closure on
innocent parties.
C. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Mayor, or his designee, may issue
an appropriate order. Results of the hearing shall be mailed to the
owner and any known mortgagee, by means of certified mail, return
receipt requested. Any person or organization present at the hearing
may request a copy of the order. A copy of said order shall also be
posted at the premises within 48 hours of the decision. Five days after
the posting of an order issued pursuant to this chapter, not excluding
Saturday and Sunday, officers of the Schenectady Police Department,
and in addition any other person authorized under this chapter to issue
appearance tickets, are authorized to act upon and enforce such orders.

§ 167-77. Recovery of costs.
In the event that the owner(s) do not promptly reimburse the City for
necessary steps taken, the Department of Neighborhood Revitalization shall
certify and report the charges to the Department of Finance. Costs incurred
under this article shall be paid out of the municipal treasury upon
certification of the Department of Neighborhood Revitalization. Any person
issued a notice pursuant to any provision of this chapter shall be subject
to an administrative fee of $50. Such costs, together with said fifty-dollar
administrative fee, shall be charged against the land on which the building
existed as a municipal lien or cause such cost and/or administrative fee
to be added to the tax rolls as an assessment or to be levied as a special
tax against the land upon which the building stands or did stand or to be
recovered in a suit at law against the owner.

A. Declaration of legislative findings.
(1) The Council finds that public nuisances exist in the City of
Schenectady in the operation of certain establishments and the use

Code provisions, which nuisances substantially and seriously
interfere with the interest of the public in the quality of life and
total community environment, commerce in the City, property
values and the public health, safety and welfare.
(2) The Council further finds that the continued occurrence of such
activities and violations is detrimental to the health, safety and
welfare of the people of the City of Schenectady and of the
businesses thereof and the visitors thereto. It is the purpose of the
Council to authorize and empower the Mayor to impose sanctions
and penalties for such public nuisances, and such powers of the
Mayor may be exercised either in conjunction with or apart from
the powers contained in other laws without prejudice to the use of
procedures and remedies available under such other laws.

by the Mayor pursuant to this chapter constitute an additional and
appropriate method of law enforcement in response to the
proliferation of the above-described public nuisances. The

designee may vacate the provisions of the order that direct the closing

battery or fighting.

§ 192-2.1. Curfew. [Added 9-17-1990 by Ord. No. 90-68; amended
9-28-1992 by Ord. No. 92-47; 8-1-1994 by Ord. No. 94-23]
A. Findings. The City of Schenectady finds that unsupervised minors have
recently been creating neighborhood problems, including gambling,
drug dealing, vandalism, noise, intoxication, physical assaults, thefts,
prostitution and other detrimental activities, and that it is in the best
interest of its people to preserve public health, safety and welfare of the
community in adopting a curfew directed toward youth within its City
limits under the age of 16 to protect minors from each other, to protect
others and their property and to reduce juvenile crime. It is found that
the following curfew legislation is reasonable in relation to the ends
sought to be achieved and does not infringe on the fundamental rights
of juveniles. Therefore:
(1) It shall be unlawful for any minor under the age of 16 to be in or
remain upon any public building, street, highway, park, vacant lot
or other public place during the following hours: Sunday, Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday between the hours of 10:00 p.m.
and 6:00 a.m. and Friday and Saturday between the hours of 11:00
p.m. and 6:00 a.m.
(2) The following shall constitute valid exceptions to the operation of
the curfew:
(a) At any time, if the minor is accompanied by his or her parent,
legal guardian, custodian or other legally responsible person
who is over the age of 21 and approved by the minor's parent,
legal guardian or custodian.
(b) At any time, if the minor is on an emergency errand as directed
by his or her parent, legal guardian or custodian.
(c) If the minor is legally employed, for the period from one-half
hour before to one-half hour after work, while going directly
between his or her home and place of employment. This
exception shall also apply if the minor is in a public place
during curfew hours in the course of his or her employment. To
come under this exception, the minor must be carrying a
§ 192-1 CHARTER AND RELATED LEGISLATION § 192-2.1
C:713
written statement from the employer attesting to the place and
hours of employment.
(d) Until the hour of 12:30 a.m., if the minor is on the property of
or the sidewalk directly adjacent to the building in which he or
she resides or the buildings immediately adjacent thereto.
(e) If the minor is coming directly home from a community, school
or religious event or place of public entertainment, such as a
movie, play or sporting event. This exception will apply for onehalf
hour after the completion of such event, but in no case
beyond 12:30 a.m. If the event is not commercial in nature or
does not have a fixed publicly known time at which it will end,
the sponsoring organization must register the event with the
Police Department at least 24 hours in advance, informing it of
the time such event is scheduled to begin, the place at which it
shall be held, the time at which it will end and the name of the
sponsoring organization.
B. A police officer who has probable cause to believe that a minor is in
violation of this section shall ascertain the name and address and proof
of age of said minor and inform the minor that he or she is in violation of
curfew. A record shall be kept for future reference, and the officer shall
take or direct such minor to the minor's parent, guardian or custodian
and, if there is no parent, guardian or custodian available, then to the
police station where an immediate attempt shall be made to notify the
minor's parent, guardian or custodian that the minor is in police
custody and that they can come to the police station to take the minor
home. If no parent, guardian or custodian has arrived at the police
station within two hours after the minor's arrival at the police station,
the minor shall be turned over to the custody of the City Police
Department Youth Aide Bureau and be held in a shelter run by a
licensed Division for Youth facility until a parent, guardian or custodian
can take custody of him or her. If the minor refuses to inform the officer
of his or her parent, guardian or custodian, name and address, the
minor may be taken to the police station and be turned over to the
custody of the City Police Department Youth Aide Bureau to be dealt
with in accordance with appropriate law and procedure.
C. At the time the Police Officer takes the minor to his or her parent,
guardian or custodian, the officer shall provide the parent, guardian or
custodian with a copy of this section and inform them that a proceeding
may be instituted in Family Court under Article 7 of the New York State
Family Court Act to determine whether the minor is a person in need of
supervision.
D. Names of absent parents are to be reported to the Schenectady County
Department of Social Services for investigation of possible child
neglect.

pollutants which will interfere with the operation of the system or
contaminate the resulting sludge.
(2) Prevent the introduction of pollutants into the municipal
wastewater system which will pass through the system,
inadequately treated, into receiving waters or the atmosphere or
otherwise be incompatible with the system.
(3) Improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewaters and
sludges from the system.
(4) Provide for equitable distribution of the cost of the municipal
wastewater system.
C. Part 2 of this chapter provides for the regulation of indirect
contributors to the municipal wastewater system through the issuance
of permits to certain nondomestic users and through enforcement of
general requirements for the other users, authorizes monitoring and
enforcement activities, requires user reporting, assumes that existing
customers' capacity will not be preempted and provides for the setting

into the City POTW, any pollutant(s) or wastewater which will pass
through or cause interference with the operation or performance of the
§ 220-28 CHARTER AND RELATED LEGISLATION § 220-32
C:803
City POTW. These general prohibitions and the specific prohibitions
below apply to each user introducing pollutants into the City POTW
whether or not the user is subject to other national pretreatment
standards or any national, state, or local pretreatment requirements.
(40 CFR § 403.5.)
B. Specific prohibitions.
(1) Fire or explosion hazards.
(a) Any liquids, solids or gases which by reason of their nature or
quantity are, or may be, sufficient either alone or by
interaction with other substances to cause fire or explosion or
be injurious in any other way to the POTW or to the operation
of the POTW. At no time shall two successive readings on an
explosion hazard meter at the point of discharge into the
system (or at any point in the system) be more than 5%, nor
any single reading over 10% of the lower explosive limit (LEL)
of the meter.
(b) Pollutants which create a fire or explosion hazard in the POTW,
including, but not limited to, waste streams with a closed cup
flashpoint of less than 140° F. or 60° C. using the test methods
specified in 40 CFR 61.21.
(2) Solid or viscous substances which may cause obstruction to the
flow in a sewer or other interference with the operation of the
wastewater treatment facilities, such as but not limited to grease
and garbage with particles greater than 1/2 inch in any dimension.
Solid or viscous pollutants in amounts which will cause obstruction
to the flow in the POTW resulting in interference.
(3) Other hazards.
(a) Any wastewater or pollutants having a pH less than 5.5 or
greater than 9.5, unless a permit is specifically issued to
accommodate such wastewater, or wastewater having any
other corrosive property capable of causing damage or hazard
to structures, equipment and/or personnel of the POTW.
Pollutants which will cause corrosive, structural damage to the
POTW, but in no case discharges with pH lower than 5.0, unless
the works is specifically designed to accommodate such
discharges.
(b) Any pollutant, including oxygen-demanding pollutants (BOD,
etc.), released in a discharge at a flow rate and/or pollutant
concentration which will cause interference with the POTW.
(c) Petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oil, or products of
mineral oil origin in amounts that will cause interference or

§ 220-32 SCHENECTADY CODE § 220-32
C:804
(4) Any wastewater containing toxic pollutants in sufficient quantity,
either singly or by interaction with other pollutants, to injure or
interfere with any wastewater treatment process, to produce toxic
effect in the receiving waters of the POTW or to exceed the
limitation set forth in a Categorical Pretreatment Standard. A toxic
pollutant shall include, but not be limited to, any pollutant
identified pursuant to Section 307(a) of the Act.
(5) Pollutants which result in the presence of toxic gases, vapors, or
fumes within the POTW in a quantity that may cause acute worker
health and safety problems. This shall include any noxious or
malodorous liquids, gases or solids which, either singly or by

State Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit or the
receiving water quality standards.
(8) Any wastewater with objectionable color not removed in the
treatment process, such as but not limited to dye wastes and
vegetable tanning solutions.
(9) Heat in amounts which will inhibit biological activity in the POTW
resulting in interference, but in no case heat in such quantities that
the temperature at the POTW treatment plant exceeds 40° C. (104°
F.) unless the approval authority, upon request of the City, approves
alternate temperature limits.
(10) Any pollutants, including oxygen demanding pollutants (BOD, etc.)
released at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration which a user
knows or has reason to know will cause interference to the POTW
treatment plant or is in contravention of permit conditions.
(11) Any wastewater containing any radioactive wastes or isotopes of
such half-life or concentration as may exceed limits established by
the Director in compliance with applicable state or federal
regulations.

§ 220-33. Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards. [Amended
12-12-1988 by Ord. No. 88-91]
Upon the promulgation of the Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards
for a particular industrial subcategory, the federal standard, if more
stringent than limitations imposed under this Part 2 for sources in that
subcategory, shall immediately supersede the limitations imposed under
this Part 2. The Director shall notify all affected users of the applicable
reporting requirements under 40 CFR Part 403.12.
§ 220-34. Point of discharge.
No person shall discharge substances directly into a manhole or other
sanitary opening in a sanitary sewer, other than through an approved
building sewer.
§ 220-35. Holding tank waste. [Amended 12-12-1988 by Ord. No.
88-91]
No person shall discharge any holding tank waste into a manhole or other
opening in a sanitary sewer. All holding tank waste discharged within the
Schenectady POTW system shall be discharged at a facility at locations
designated by the Director. Each separate load of holding tank waste shall
be registered with the operator of the treatment facility. The user shall pay
the applicable charges and fees and shall meet such other conditions as
required by the Department. The Department shall have the right to inquire
about the type of waste, the approximate volumes and the origin of holding
(12) Any water or waste containing fats, wax, grease or oils, whether
emulsified or not, or containing substances which may solidify or
become viscous at temperatures between 32º and 104º F. (0º and
40º C.)
(13) Any garbage that has not been properly shredded.
(14)Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to
treatment or reduction by the sewage treatment processes
employed or are amenable to treatment only to such degree that
the sewage treatment plant effluent cannot meet the requirements
of other agencies having jurisdiction over discharge to the
receiving waters.
(15) Any trucked or hauled pollutants, except at discharge points
designated by the POTW.
C. When the Director determines that a user is contributing to the POTW
any of the above-enumerated substances in such amounts as to
interfere with the operation of the POTW, the Director shall advise the
user of the impact of the contribution on the POTW pursuant to
procedures in § 220-81 et seq. of this Part 2.

permit from the NYSDEC.
§ 220-36. Modification of federal standards.
Where the City's wastewater treatment system achieves consistent removal
of pollutants limited by federal pretreatment standards, the City may apply
to the Approval Authority for modification of specific limits in the federal
pretreatment standards. "Consistent removal" shall mean reduction in the
amount of a pollutant or alteration of the nature of the pollutant by the
wastewater treatment system to a less toxic or harmless state in the effluent
which is achieved by the system in 95% of the samples taken when
measured according to the procedures set forth in 40 CFR Part 403.7(c)(2),
General pretreatment regulations for existing and new sources of pollution,
promulgated pursuant to the Act. The City may then modify pollutant
discharge limits in the federal pretreatment standards if the requirements
contained in 40 CFR Part 403.7 are fulfilled and prior approval from the
Approval Authority is obtained.
§ 220-37. Limitations. [Amended 12-12-1988 by Ord. No. 88-91;

A. Written approval by the Director is required for all new discharges from
industrial users or any planned significant changes to the users
operations or system added to the City sewer system. The Director
reserves the right to deny or condition new or increased contributions
of wastes or changes in wastewater constituents and characteristics, to
require an industrial user to obtain an industrial wastewater discharge
permit as specified in § 220-44, to require the development of a
schedule of compliance for an industrial user for the installation of
technology required to meet pretreatment standards and requirements
and/or to require the industrial user to submit to the Department selfmonitoring
reports. Any industrial facility expansion, production
increase, or other modifications which result in new, different, or
increased discharges of pollutants must be reported to the Department
at least 90 days prior to any such discharge.
B. Industrial users required to obtain an industrial waste discharge permit
shall complete and file with the Department an application in the form
prescribed by the City at least 90 days prior to connecting to or
contributing to the City. In support of the application, the user may be
required to submit, in units and terms appropriate for evaluation, the
following information:
(1) A description of all activities, facilities and plant processes directly
related to sewer discharges. This description shall include all those
materials which are or could reasonably be expected to be
discharged, including hazardous materials as defined by
regulations promulgated under the federal Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act (42 U.S.C. § 6901).

§ 220-42.2. Notification of discharge of hazardous waste. [Added
12-27-2010 by Ord. No. 2010-23]
A. Septic tank waste may be introduced into the POTW only at locations
designated by the City, and at such times as are established by the City.
Such waste shall not violate § 220-32 or any other requirements
established by the City. The City may require septic tank waste haulers
to obtain wastewater discharge permits.
B. Haulers of industrial wastes shall obtain wastewater discharge permits.
The City may require generators of hauled industrial waste to obtain
wastewater discharge permits. The City also may prohibit the disposal
of hauled industrial waste. The discharge of hauled industrial waste is
subject to all other requirements of this part.
C. Industrial waste haulers may discharge loads only at locations
designated by the City. No load may be discharged without prior
consent of the City. The City may collect samples of each hauled load to
ensure compliance with applicable standards. The City may require the
industrial waste hauler to provide a waste analysis of any load prior to
discharge.
D. Industrial waste haulers must provide a waste-tracking form for every
load. This form shall include, at a minimum, the name and address of
the industrial waste hauler, permit number, truck identification, names
and addresses of sources of waste, and volume and characteristics of
waste. The form shall identify the type of industry, known or suspected
waste constituents, and whether any wastes are RCRA hazardous
wastes.
A. Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify
the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and
state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the
POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a
hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include
the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the
EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous,
batch, or other). If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such
waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall
contain the following information to the extent such information is
known and readily available to the user: an identification of the
hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the
mass and concentration of such constituents in the waste stream
discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass
of constituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged during
the following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than
180 days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this
Subsection need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste
discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must be
submitted under § 220-42. The notification requirement in this section
does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to
§ 220-42.1 SCHENECTADY CODE § 220-42.2
C:810
categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring
requirements of § 220-46M.
B. An existing user must submit the above notification no later than at the
time it submits its next renewal application after the effective date of
this provision.
C. Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of Subsection A of
§ 220-42.2, above during a calendar month in which they discharge no
more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are
acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(c).
Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a
calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as
specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(c), requires a one-time
notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges
more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require
additional notification.
D. In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA
identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any
additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the
City, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and
state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance
within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations.
E. In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall
certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity
of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be
economically practical.
F. This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not
otherwise permitted to be discharged by this part, a permit issued
thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.

§ 220-52. Inspection and sampling.
A. Users who discharge, who propose to discharge or who, in the
judgment of the Director, could discharge now or in the future
wastewater with constituents and characteristics different from that
produced by a domestic premises shall be required to install a
monitoring facility.
B. When, in the judgment of the Director, there is a significant difference
in the wastewater constituents and characteristics produced by
different operations of a single user, the Director may require that
separate monitoring facilities be installed for each discharge. In
addition, a user may be compelled to install a monitoring facility to
determine compliance with federal standards.
C. Monitoring facilities are to be constructed at a common location into
which all flows from the user are combined. Sanitary wastewater may
be excluded. Whenever the installation of a monitoring facility in a
common location is impossible or impractical, the user shall construct
and maintain, at the user's expense, in lieu of one common monitoring
facility two or more monitoring facilities as required by the Director.
D. Monitoring facilities that are required to be installed shall be
constructed, operated and maintained at the user's expense. The
purpose of the facility is to enable inspection, sampling and flow
measurement of wastewaters produced by the user. If sampling and
metering equipment is also required by the Department, it shall be
provided, installed, operated and maintained at the user's expense. The
monitoring facility will normally be required to be located on the user's
premises outside of the building. If the monitoring facility is inside the
user's fence, there shall be accommodation to allow safe and immediate
access for the department personnel, such as a gate secured with a
department lock. There shall be ample room in or near such facility to
allow accurate sampling and composition of samples for analysis. The
entire facility and the sampling and measuring equipment shall be
maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by and
at the expense of the user. In the event that no special monitoring
facility is required, sampling shall be conducted at a point or points
selected by the Director.
A. The Director and other authorized employees of the Department,
designated agents or representatives of the City and employees of the
EPA and NYSDEC bearing proper credentials and identification shall be
permitted to enter all properties at all reasonable times for the purpose
of inspection, observation, sampling, flow measurement and testing to
ascertain compliance with this Part 2. The Department shall have the
right to set up on the user's property such devices as are necessary to
conduct sampling or flow measurement. Where a user has security

industrial process, except to the extent necessary to ascertain the kind
and source of discharge to sewers. While on private property, the
representatives shall observe all established safety rules applicable to
the premises. The City shall indemnify a property owner against loss or
damage to the owner's property and against third-party claims caused
by representatives of the City while upon the property, except for loss
or damage or third-party claims caused by the negligence of the owner
or the owner's failure to maintain safe conditions.
A. Where necessary, in the opinion of the Director, users shall make
wastewater acceptable under the limitations established by this Part 2
and by Section 307 of the Federal Act before discharging into the City
sewer system. Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level
acceptable to the Department shall be provided and maintained at the
user's expense. Detailed plans showing pretreatment facilities and
operating procedures shall be submitted to the Director for review and
shall be approved by the Director before construction of the facility. The
review and approval of such plans and operating procedures will in no
way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as
necessary to produce an effluent complying with the provisions of this
Part 2. All subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method
of operation shall be reported to and be approved by the Department.
When pretreatment regulations are adopted by EPA or NYSDEC for any
industry, then that industry must immediately conform to the EPA or
NYSDEC timetable for adherence to federal or state pretreatment
requirements and any other applicable requirements promulgated by
EPA or NYSDEC in accordance with Section 307 of the Federal Act.
Additionally, such industries shall comply with any other stringent
standards necessitated by local conditions as determined by the City.
B. The City may adopt charges and fees which may include:
(1) Fees for reimbursement of costs of setting up and operating the
City's pretreatment program;
(2) Fees for monitoring, inspections and surveillance procedures,
including the cost of collection and analysis of a users discharge,
and reviewing monitoring reports submitted by users;

requirements.
C. These fees related solely to the matters covered by this Part 2 are
separate from all other fees chargeable by the City.
A. Each user shall provide protection from accidental and slug discharges
of prohibited materials or other wastes regulated by this Part 2 or plans
to minimize such occurrences should they occur. Facilities to prevent
accidental and slug discharges of prohibited materials shall be provided
and maintained at the users expense. Detailed plans showing facilities
and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted
to the Director for review and shall be approved by the Department
before construction of the facility. At least once every two years, the
City shall evaluate whether each significant industrial user needs an
accidental discharge/slug control plan. The City may require any user
to develop, submit for approval, and implement such a plan.
Alternatively, the City may develop such a plan for any user. An
accidental discharge/slug control plan shall address, at a minimum, the
following: [Amended 12-12-1988 by Ord. No. 88-91; 12-27-2010

No. 88-91; 12-27-2010 by Ord. No. 2010-23]
The industrial waste surcharge shall be based upon the measured or
estimated constituents and characteristics of the wastewater discharge of
the user which may include, but are not limited to, flow rate, biochemical
oxygen demand, total suspended solids, chemical oxygen demand and total
organic carbon. The wastewater constituents and characteristics used to
calculate the industrial waste surcharge will be those listed in § 220-37B of
this Part 2, as well as those determined by the Director. Any data provided
by the user may be used in addition to the data obtained by the Director.
§ 220-73. Volume determination. [Amended 12-12-1988 by Ord. No.
88-91; 12-27-2010 by Ord. No. 2010-23]
In applying the surcharge formulas, the Director may represent flow
discharged into the sewer system by:
(1) The total industrial waste surcharge (IWS) will be based upon the
industry share of the operation and maintenance charges and
annual debt service less the adjusted share of any sewer rent
payments made by the user. The adjusted share of sewer rent (ASR)
for operating and maintaining and/or the capital costs of the POTW
shall be calculated using the following formula:
ASR = SR [(A + D)/SF]
Where: A and D have the meanings set forth in Subsection C
hereof; SR shall equal the annual amount of any sewer rent
charges paid by the user; and SF shall equal the total annual
sewer fund operating budget as established by the City (as may
adjusted by the Director to account for anomalies).
(2) The IWS will be calculated using the following formula:
IWS = (OMC + DSC) - ASR
Where: OMC and DSC shall have the meanings set forth in
Subsection C hereof.
(3) If the ASR exceeds the sum of the OMC and the DSC, there will be
no IWS imposed and no reimbursement of SR.
(4) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in calculating the IWS for users
located outside the territorial limits of the City, the amount of the
ASR to be deducted from the sum of the OMC + DSC may not
exceed the projected ASR for that users facility if it were located
within the territorial limits of the City.

§ 220-75. Resampling of pollutant concentration.
In the event that the pollutant concentration of the waste discharged from
the premises to a public sewer as determined under § 220-74 of this Part 2
is disputed by a user, a program of resampling and flow measurement with
subsequent analytical determination may be instituted as follows:
B. The volume of wastewater discharged into the sewer system as
determined by the measurements and samples taken at a monitoring
facility installed by the owner of the property served by the sewer
system;
C. Allowances for water not discharged to the sewer system will be made
at the discretion of the Director; or
D. A figure determined by the Director by any combination of the
foregoing or by any other equitable method.
A. The pollutant concentration of any wastewater shall be determined
from the analysis of representative samples taken prior to discharge
into the City sewers, taken by representatives of the Director at
sampling stations as described in § 220-51 of this Part 2 at any period or
time or of such duration and in such a manner as the Director may
elect, or at any place or manner mutually agreed upon between the user
and the Director. The intent of any sampling procedure is to establish
the pollutant concentration in the wastewater discharge during an
average or typical working day. This concentration may be derived

§ 220-80.1. Search warrants. [Added 12-27-2010 by Ord. No.
2010-23]
If the City has been refused access to a building, structure, or property, or
any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that
there may be a violation of this Part 2, or that there is a need to inspect
and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program of the
City designed to verify compliance with this Part 2 or any permit or order
issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare
of the community, then the City may seek issuance of a search warrant in
accordance with NY Criminal Procedure Law § 690.35.
§ 220-80.2. Remedies nonexclusive. [Added 12-27-2010 by Ord. No.
2010-23]
The remedies provided for in this Part 2 are not exclusive. The City may take
any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant user.
Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance
with the Citys Enforcement Response Plan. However, the City may take
other action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the
City is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any
noncompliant user.
§ 220-81. Harmful discharges.
A. The City is hereby authorized to enforce all pretreatment requirements
necessary to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the
City of Schenectady State Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
permit issued by the NYSDEC pursuant to the Act.
B. The enforcement response plan dated October 19, 1995, as approved by
the United States Environmental Protection Agency, is hereby adopted
as the official enforcement response plan for the City of Schenectady
with respect to its ordinances affecting water, wastewater and sewer
usage.
A. The City may suspend the wastewater treatment service and/or an
industrial wastewater discharge permit when such suspension is
necessary, in the opinion of the City, in order to stop an actual or
threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or
substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or to the
environment, causes interference to the POTW or causes the City to
violate any condition of its SPDES permit.

C:835
§ 220-82. Notice of violation. [Amended 12-12-1988 by Ord. No.
88-91]
Whenever the Director finds that any user has violated or is violating
this Part 2, the industrial wastewater discharge permit or any prohibition,
limitation or requirement contained herein, the City may serve upon such
person a written notice stating the nature of the violation. Within 15 days of
the date of the notice, a plan for the satisfactory correction thereof shall be
submitted to the Director by the user.
§ 220-83. Hearing. [Amended 12-12-1988 by Ord. No. 88-91]
B. Any person notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment
service and/or the industrial wastewater discharge permit shall
immediately stop or eliminate the contribution. In the event of a failure
of the person to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the City
shall take steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of
the sewer connection to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW
system or endangerment to any individuals or the environment. In such
case as severance or termination of the sewer connection is required,
any and all expense connected therewith shall be borne by the owner
and chargeable against the property at which such service was
terminated. The service shall remain terminated until all charges
relating to the termination have been paid. The City shall reinstate the
industrial wastewater discharge permit and/or the wastewater
treatment service upon proof of the elimination of the noncomplying
discharge. [Amended 12-27-2010 by Ord. No. 2010-23]
A. The Director may order any user who causes or allows any
unauthorized discharge to enter the POTW to show cause before a
Sewer Complaint Review Board why the proposed enforcement action
should not be taken. The Board shall consist of the Mayor of the City of
Schenectady, the Director and the City Engineer. A notice shall be
served on the user specifying the time and place of a hearing to be held
by the Board regarding the violation, the reasons why the action is to be
taken, the proposed enforcement action and directing the user to show
cause before the Board why the proposed enforcement action should
not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by
registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, at least 15 days
before the hearing. Service may be made on any agent or officer of a
corporation. A show-cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or
prerequisite for, the City taking any other action against the user.
[Amended 12-27-2010 by Ord. No. 2010-23]
B. Whenever, because of danger to the public health, safety or welfare, it
appears prejudicial to the public interest to delay action for 15 days, the
Director may serve the respondent with an order requiring certain
action or the cessation of certain activities immediately or within a
specified period of less than 15 days, and the Director shall provide an
§ 220-81 SCHENECTADY CODE § 220-83
C:836
opportunity to be heard within 15 days after the date the order is
served.
C. The Board may itself conduct the hearing and take the evidence, or may
designate any of its members or any officer or employee of the
Department of Water and Wastewater to:
(1) Issue, in the name of the Board, notices of hearings requesting the
attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of
evidence relevant to any matter involved in such hearings.
(2) Take the evidence.
(3) Transmit a report of the evidence and hearing, including
transcripts and other evidence, together with recommendations to
the Board for action thereon.
D. The Board, or its designee, shall not be bound by laws of evidence in the
conduct of hearing proceedings, but the determination shall be founded
upon sufficient legal evidence to sustain it. Proceedings will follow the
New York State Administrative Procedures Act.
E. The Corporation Counsel may prefer charges, attend hearings, present
the facts and take any and all proceedings in connection therewith.
F. At a hearing, the respondent may appear personally, shall have the right
of counsel and may cross-examine witnesses against him and produce
evidence and witnesses in his behalf.
G. A record, or summary thereof, of the proceedings of said hearings shall
be made and filed with the Department. If requested to do so by any
interested party concerned with said hearing, the full stenographic
notes of the testimony presented at said heading shall be taken and
filed. The stenographer shall, upon the payment of his fees allowed by
law therefor, furnish a certificate transcript of the whole or any part of
his notes to any party to the action requiring the same.
H. Unless precluded by law, disposition may be made of any hearing by
stipulation, agreed settlement, consent order, default or other informal
method. Within 10 days of the notice specified in § 220-82, the user may
request a prehearing conference with the City's representative for an
informal disposition of any or all charges.
I. Upon request made by any party upon the Department within a
reasonable time but prior to the time for commencement of judicial
review of its giving notice of its decision, determination, opinion or
order, the Board or its representative shall prepare the record, together
with any transcript of proceedings within a reasonable time and shall
furnish a copy of the record and transcript or any part thereof to any
party as he may request. Except when any law provides otherwise, the
Department is authorized to charge not more than its cost for the
preparation and furnishings of such record or transcript or any part
§ 220-83 CHARTER AND RELATED LEGISLATION § 220-83
C:837
thereof or the rate specified in the contract between the agency and a
contractor if prepared by a private contractor.

held in conformance with the procedures set forth in Article X of this
chapter. Each violation shall be a separate and distinct violation and, in
the case of a continuing violation, each day's continuance thereof shall

civilly liable to the City for any expense, loss or damage occasioned to the
City by reason of such violation. The City may recover fines and penalties
imposed by any regulatory agency on the City that can be reasonably
attributed to the user discharges of any person to the wastewater collection
or treatment system. The City may also recover from any responsible party
any reasonable attorneys fees, court costs, other expenses associated with
levy administrative fines, and have the power to enter into consent
decrees with any party, subject to the approval of the Corporation

§ 220-89. Affirmative defenses. [Added 12-27-2010 by Ord. No.
2010-23]
A. Notwithstanding any inconsistent provisions of law, whenever the
Director finds, after investigation, that any user is causing, engaging in
or maintaining a condition or activity which, in his judgment, presents
an imminent danger to the public health, safety or welfare or to the
environment or is likely to result in irreversible or irreparable damage
to the public sewer system and it therefore appears to be prejudicial to
the public interest to delay action until notice and an opportunity for a
hearing can be provided, the Director may, without prior hearing, order
such user, by notice, in writing, wherever practicable or in such other
form as in the Director's judgment will reasonably notify such person
whose practices are intended to be proscribed, to discontinue, abate or
alleviate such condition or activity; or, where the giving of notice is
impracticable, or in the event of a user's failure to comply voluntarily
with an emergency order, the Director may take all appropriate action
to abate the violating condition. As promptly as possible thereafter, not
to exceed 15 days, the Director shall provide the user an opportunity to
be heard in accordance with the provisions of Article X of this chapter.
B. The Director, acting upon the belief that an emergency exists, shall be
indemnified against any personal liability that may arise in the
performance of his duties to protect the public health, safety or welfare
or preserve the public sewer system.
A. A user shall have an affirmative defense in any action brought against it
alleging a violation of the general prohibitions at § 220-32 and the
specific prohibitions in § 220-32B(2), (3)(b), (3)(c), (5), and (9) where
the user can demonstrate that:
(1) It did not know or have reason to know that its discharge, alone or
in conjunction with a discharge or discharges from other sources,
would cause pass through or interference; and
(2) A local limit designed to prevent pass through and/or interference,
as the case may be, was developed for each pollutant in the user's
discharge that caused pass through or interference, and the user

The City may decline to issue or reissue a wastewater discharge permit
to any user who has failed to comply with any provision of this Part 2, a
previous wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any
other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless such user first files
a satisfactory bond, payable to the City, in a sum not to exceed a value
determined by the City to be necessary to achieve consistent compliance.

The City may decline to issue or reissue a wastewater discharge permit
to any user who has failed to comply with any provision of this Part 2, a
previous wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any
other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless the user first submits
proof that it has obtained financial assurances sufficient to restore or repair
damage to the POTW caused by its discharge.
§ 220-92. Water supply severance. [Added 12-27-2010 by Ord. No.
2010-23]
Whenever a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this
Part 2, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any
other pretreatment standard or requirement, water service to the user may
be severed. Service will only recommence, at the user's expense, after it
has satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply. Such severance of any
water service shall not be carried out except in the manner and upon the
notice as is required of a waterworks corporation pursuant to Subdivisions
3-a, 3-b and 3-c of §§ 89-6 and 116 of the Public Service Law.
was in compliance with each such local limit directly prior to
and during the pass through or interference; or if a local limit
designed to prevent pass through and/or interference, as the case
may be, has not been developed for the pollutant(s) that caused
the pass through or interference, the user's discharge directly prior
to and during the pass through or interference did not change
substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior
discharge activity when the POTW was regularly in compliance
with the POTW's NPDES permit requirements and, in the case of
interference, applicable requirements for sewage sludge use or
disposal.
B. When the City determines that a User(s) is contributing to the POTW
any of the substances set forth at § 220-37 in such amounts as to
interfere with the operation of the POTW, the City shall advise the
User(s) of the impact of the contribution on the POTW pursuant to
procedures in § 220-81 et seq. of this Part 2.

A violation of any provision of this Part 2, a wastewater discharge permit, or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement
is hereby declared a public nuisance and shall be corrected or abated as
directed by the City. Any person(s) creating a public nuisance shall be
subject to the provisions of § 220-80 et seq. governing such nuisances,
including reimbursing the City for any costs incurred in removing, abating,
or remedying said nuisance.

12-27-2010 by Ord. No. 2010-23]
The City shall publish annually, in the largest daily newspaper published
in the municipality where the POTW is located, a list of the users which,
during the previous 12 months, were in significant noncompliance with
applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. The term "significant
noncompliance" shall mean:
A. Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those
in which 66% or more of wastewater measurements taken during a six
month period exceed (by any magnitude) a numeric pretreatment
standard or requirement, including instantaneous limits;
B. Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in
which 33% or more of wastewater measurements taken for each
pollutant parameter during a six-month period equal or exceed the
product of the numeric pretreatment standard or requirement,
including instantaneous limits, multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4
for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants
except pH);
C. Any other discharge violation that the City believes has caused, alone or
in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through,
including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general
public;
D. Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment to
the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the City's exercise
of emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge;
E. Failure to meet, within 90 days of the scheduled date, a compliance
schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or
enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction,
or attaining final compliance;
F. Failure to provide, within 30 days after the due date, any required
reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance
with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic selfmonitoring

§ 224-1. Permit required; exception.
A. The City of Schenectady recognizes that people have a right to safety
and comfort in their homes. While the City also recognizes the right of
people to sell commodities, products, and services door to door, the
government also has a substantial interest in protecting the safety and
comfort of people while they are in their homes. As door-to-door sales
bring strangers onto the property of others, and as many find that to be
an uncomfortable and/or unwanted situation, the City of Schenectady
shall require all business entities and people who take part in door-todoor
sales within City limits to apply for and receive a permit
authorizing said door-to-door sales activities and to follow the rules set
forth in this chapter, which are deemed to be the least restrictive
possible while being able to safeguard the rights of the general public.
B. Except as noted in Subsection C of this section, it shall be unlawful for
any person, business entity, firm, organization, group, church, society,
or charitable institution to solicit funds or contributions, sell or offer to
sell any commodity, service, or product, either edible or inedible, by
means of door-to-door canvassing or solicitation of residential

earnings, net income from self-employment, and unreimbursed medical
expenses, but shall not include gifts or inheritances. [Amended
12-26-2012 by Ord. No. 2012-14]
C. No exemption shall be granted:
(1) Unless the title of the property shall have been vested in the owner
or all of the owners of the property for at least 24 consecutive
months prior to the date of making application for exemption;
provided, however, that in the event of the death of either a
husband or wife in whose name title of the property shall have been
vested at the time of death and then becomes vested solely in the
survivor by virtue of devise by or descent from the deceased
husband or wife, the time of ownership of the property by the
§ 234-1 CHARTER AND RELATED LEGISLATION § 234-1
C:905
deceased husband or wife shall be deemed also a time of ownership
by the survivor, and such ownership shall be deemed continuous for
the purposes of computing such period of 24 consecutive months;
and provided further that where property of the owner or owners
has been formerly acquired to replace property owned by such
owner or owners and taken by eminent domain or other involuntary
proceedings, except a tax sale, the period of ownership of the
former property shall be combined with the period of ownership
of the property for which application is made for exemption, and
such periods of ownership shall be deemed to be consecutive for
purposes of this section.
(2) Unless the property is used exclusively for residential purposes.
(3) Unless the real property is the legal residence of and is occupied, in
whole or in part, by the owner or by all of the owners of the
property.
D. Application. [Amended 2-1-1993 by Ord. No. 93-04]
(1) Application for such exemption must be made by the owner or all of
the owners of the property on forms prescribed by the State Board
to be furnished by the Department of Assessment and shall furnish
the information and be executed in the manner required or
prescribed in such forms and shall be filed in the Assessor's office
on or before the taxable status date. Additionally, proof of any
unreimbursed medical expenses must be filed with the Assessor in
a manner as, from time to time, may be prescribed by the
Department of Assessment. Any person otherwise qualifying under
this section shall not be denied the exemption under this section if
he or she becomes 65 years of age after the appropriate taxable
date and on or before December 31 of the same year. [Amended
12-26-2012 by Ord. No. 2012-14]
(2) An application for such exemption may be filed with the Assessor
after the appropriate taxable status date but not later than the last
date on which a petition with respect to complaints of assessment
may be filed where failure to file a timely application resulted from
a death of the applicant's spouse, child, parent, brother or sister or
an illness of the applicant or the applicant's spouse, child, parent,
brother or sister which actually prevents the applicant from filing
on a timely basis, as certified by a licensed physician. The Assessor
shall approve or deny such application as if it had been filed on or
before the taxable status date.
E. At least 60 days prior to the taxable status date, the Department of
Assessment shall mail to each person who was granted exemption,
pursuant to this section on the latest completed assessment roll, an
application form and a notice that such application must be filed on or
before the taxable status date and be approved in order for the
exemption to be granted. Failure to mail any such application form and
§ 234-1 SCHENECTADY CODE § 234-1
C:906
notice or the failure of such person to receive the same shall not
prevent the levy, collection and enforcement of the payment of the taxes
on property owned by such person.
(1) Any person who has been granted exemption pursuant to this
section on five consecutive completed assessment rolls, including
any years when the exemption was granted to a property owned by
a husband and/or wife while both resided in such property, shall not
be subject to the requirements set forth in Subsection E of this
section, and said person shall be mailed an application form and a
notice informing him or her of his or her rights. Such exemption
shall be automatically granted on each subsequent assessment roll;
provided, however, that when tax payment is made by such person,
a sworn affidavit must be included with such payment which shall
state that such person continues to be eligible for such exemption.
Such affidavit shall be on a form prescribed by the State Board. If
such affidavit is not included with the tax payment, the collecting
officer shall proceed pursuant to § 551-a of the New York Real
Property Tax Law. [Amended 2-1-1993 by Ord. No. 93-03]
F. Any conviction of having made any willful false statement in the
application for such exemption shall be punishable by a fine of not more
than $100 and shall disqualify the applicant or applicants from further
exemption for a period of five years.
G. Notwithstanding the provisions of § 234-1D and E of this article, the
Assessor is authorized to accept applications for renewal of exemptions
pursuant to this section after taxable status date. In the event that the
owner or all of the owners of property which has received an exemption
pursuant to this section on the preceding assessment roll fail to file the
application required pursuant to this section on or before the taxable
status date, such owner or owners may file the application, executed as
if such application had been filed on or before the taxable status date,
with the Assessor on or before the date for the hearing of the
complaints. [Added 2-1-1993 by L.L. No. 2-1993]

months preceding each such return date, including any period for which
the tax imposed hereby or by any amendment hereof is effective, each of
which returns shall state the gross income or gross operating income for
the period covered by each such return. Returns shall be filed with the
Director of Finance on a form to be furnished by him for such purpose
and shall contain such other data, information or matter as the Director of

provisions of this section, any utility whose average gross income or
average gross operating income for the aforesaid three-month period is less
than $1,500 may file a return annually on June 25 for the 12 preceding
calendar months, and the Director of Finance may require any utility doing
business in the City of Schenectady to file an annual return which shall
contain any data specified by the Director of Finance, regardless of whether
the utility is subject to a tax under this section. The Director of Finance,
in order to ensure payment of the tax imposed, may require, at any time,
a further or supplemental return which shall contain any data that may
be specified by the Director of Finance. Every return shall have annexed
thereto an affidavit of the head of the utility making the same, or of the
owner or of the copartner thereof, or of a principal official of the
corporation, if such business be conducted by a corporation, to the effect
that the statements contained therein are true.
§ 234-9. Payment of tax.
At the time of filing a return as required by this article, each utility shall
pay to the Director of Finance the tax imposed by this section for the period
covered by such return. Such tax shall be due and payable at the time of
filing the return or, if a return is not filed when due, on the last day on which
the return is required to be filed.
§ 234-10. Determination of tax by City. [Amended 7-10-1939 by L.L.
No. 4-1939]
In case any return filed pursuant to this article shall be insufficient or
unsatisfactory to the Director of Finance and if a corrected or sufficient
return is not filed within 20 days after the same is required by notice
from the Director of Finance or if no return is made for any period, the
Director of Finance shall determine the amount of tax due from such
information as he is able to obtain and, if necessary, may estimate the tax
on the basis of external indexes or otherwise. The Director of Finance shall
give notice of such determination to the person liable for such tax. Such
§ 234-8 CHARTER AND RELATED LEGISLATION § 234-10
C:915
determination shall finally and irrevocably fix such tax, unless the person
against whom it is assessed shall, within 30 days after the giving of notice
of such determination, apply to the Director of Finance for a hearing or
unless the Director of Finance, of his own motion, shall reduce the same.
After such hearing, the Director of Finance shall give notice of his decision
to the person liable for the tax. The decision of the Director of Finance
may be reviewed by a proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Act
of the State of New York,120 if application therefor is made within 30 days
after the giving of notice of such decision. An order to review such decision
shall not be granted unless the amount of any tax sought to be reviewed,
with interest and penalties thereon, if any, shall be first deposited with
the Director of Finance and an undertaking filed with him, in such amount
and with such sureties as a justice of the Supreme Court shall approve, to
the effect that if such proceeding be dismissed or the tax confirmed, the
applicant will pay all costs and charges which may accrue in the prosecution
of such proceeding, or at the option of the applicant, such undertaking may
be in a sum sufficient to cover the tax, interest, penalties, costs and charges
aforesaid, in which event the applicant shall not be required to pay such
tax, interest and penalties as a condition precedent to the granting of such
order.
§ 234-11. Manner of giving notices.
Any notice authorized or required under the provisions of this article may
be given by mailing the same to the person for whom it is intended in a
postpaid envelope addressed to such person at the address given by him
in the last return filed by him under this article or, if no return has been
filed, then to such address as may be obtainable. The mailing of such notice
shall be presumptive evidence of the receipt of the same by the person to
whom addressed. Any period of time, which is determined according to the
provisions of this section by the giving of notice, shall commence to run
from the date of mailing of such notice.
§ 234-12. Penalty.
Any person failing to file a return or corrected return or to pay any tax or
any portion thereof within the time required by this section shall be subject
to a penalty of 5% of the amount of tax due plus 1% of such tax for each
month of delay or fraction thereof, excepting the first month, after such
return was required to be filed or such tax became due; but the Director
of Finance, if satisfied that the delay was excusable, may remit all or any
portion of such penalty.
§ 234-13. Refunds. [Amended 7-10-1939 by L.L. No. 4-1939]
If, within one year from the payment of any tax or penalties, the payer
thereof shall make application for a refund thereof and the Director of
Finance or the court shall determine that such tax or penalty, or any portion
120. Editor's Note: See Article 78 of The Civil Procedure Law and Rules.
§ 234-10 SCHENECTADY CODE § 234-13
C:916
thereof, was erroneously or illegally collected, the Director of Finance shall
refund the amount so determined. For like cause and within the same
period, a refund may be so made on the initiative of the Director of Finance.
However, no refund shall be made of a tax or penalty paid pursuant to a
determination of the Director of Finance as hereinbefore provided, unless
the Director of Finance, after a hearing as hereinbefore provided or of his
own motion, shall have reduced the tax or penalty or it shall have been
established in a proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Act of
the State of New York (Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules) that
such determination was erroneous or illegal. All refunds shall be made out
of moneys collected under this section. An application for a refund made
as hereinbefore provided shall be deemed an application for the revision of
any tax or penalty complained of, and the Director of Finance may receive
additional evidence with respect thereto. After making this determination,
the Director of Finance shall give notice thereof to the person interested,
and he shall be entitled to an order to review such determination under said
Article 78, subject to the provisions hereinbefore contained relating to the
granting of such an order.
§ 234-14. Taxation declared part of cost.
The tax imposed by this article shall be charged against and be paid by the
utility and shall not be added as a separate item to bills rendered by the
utility to customers or others but shall constitute a part of the operating
costs of such utility.
§ 234-15. Enforcement by suit; lien declared.
Whenever any person shall fail to pay any tax or penalty imposed by this
article, the Corporation Counsel shall, upon the request of the Director of
Finance, bring an action to enforce payment of the same. The proceeds of
any judgment obtained in any such action shall be paid to the Director of
Finance. Each such tax and penalty shall be a lien upon the property of the
person liable to pay the same, in the same manner and to the same extent
that the tax and penalty imposed by § 186-b of the Tax Law is made a lien.
§ 234-16. General powers of Director of Finance.
In the administration of this section, the Director of Finance shall have
power to make such reasonable rules and regulations, not inconsistent with
law, as may be necessary for the exercise of his powers and the performance
of his duties, and to prescribe the form of blanks, reports and other records
relating to the administration and enforcement of the tax, to take testimony
and proofs, under oath, with reference to any matter within the line of his
official duty under this section and to subpoena and require the attendance
of witnesses and the production of books, papers and documents.

income or any particulars set forth or disclosed in any return under this
section. The officer charged with the custody of such returns shall not
be required to produce any of them or evidence of anything contained

City of Schenectady in an action or proceeding under the provisions of
this article or on behalf of the State Tax Commission in an action or
proceeding under the provisions of the Tax Law of the State of New
York or on behalf of any party to any action or proceeding under the
provisions of this article, when the returns or facts shown thereby are
directly involved in such action or proceeding, in either of which events,
the court may require the production of and may admit in evidence so
much of said returns, or of the facts shown thereby, as are pertinent to
the action or proceeding, and no more. Nothing herein shall be
construed to prohibit the delivery to a person, or his duly authorized
representative, of a copy of any return filed by him nor to prohibit the
publication of statistics so classified as to prevent the identification of
particular returns and the items thereof or the publication of delinquent
lists showing the names of persons who have failed to pay their taxes at
the time and in the manner provided for by this article, together with
any relevant information which, in the opinion of the Director of
Finance, may assist in the collection of such delinquent taxes, or the
inspection by the Corporation Counsel or other legal representatives of
the City of Schenectady of the return of any person who shall bring
action to set aside or review the tax based thereon or against whom an
action has been instituted in accordance with the provisions of this
article.
B. Any offense against the foregoing secrecy provisions shall be
punishable by a fine not exceeding $1,000 or by imprisonment not
exceeding six months, or both, and if the offender be an officer, agent,
clerk or employee of the City of Schenectady, he shall be dismissed from
office and shall be incapable of holding any office or employment in the
City of Schenectady for a period of five years thereafter.
C. Notwithstanding any provision of this section, the Director of Finance
may exchange with the chief fiscal officer of any other City in the State
of New York information contained in returns filed under this article,
provided such other City grants similar privileges to the City of
Schenectady, and provided such information is to be used for tax
purposes only, and the Director of Finance shall, upon request, furnish
the State Tax Commission with any information contained in such
returns.

§ 234-21.1. Amount of exemption. [Added 4-10-2006 by L.L. No.
1-2006122]
A. In the event that the total assessed value of any real property for which
an exemption prescribed in Subdivision 1 or 2 of § 458 of the Real
Property Tax Law has been granted increases or decreases as the result
of a revaluation or update of assessments, and a material change in
level of assessment, as provided in Title 2 of Article 12 of the Real
Property Tax Law, is certified for the assessment roll pursuant to the
rules of the State Board of Equalization and Assessment, the City of
Schenectady Assessor shall increase or decrease the amount of such
exemption by multiplying the amount of such exemption by such
change in level of assessment. If the Assessor receives the certification
after the completion, verification and filing of the final assessment roll,
the Assessor shall certify the amount of exemption as recomputed
pursuant to this subsection to the local officers having custody and
control of the roll, and such local officers are hereby directed and
authorized to enter the recomputed exemption certified by the Assessor
on the roll.
B. Owners of property who previously received an exemption pursuant to
§ 458 of the Real Property Tax Law, but who opted instead to receive
exemption pursuant to § 458-a of the Real Property Tax Law, may again
receive an exemption pursuant to § 458 of the Real Property Tax Law
upon application by the owner within one year of the adoption of this
article. The Assessor shall recompute all exemptions granted pursuant
to § 458 of the Real Property Tax Law by multiplying the amount of each
such exemption by the cumulative change in level of assessment
certified by the State Board of Equalization and Assessment measured
from the assessment roll immediately preceding the assessment roll on
which exemptions were first granted pursuant to § 458-a of the Real
Property Tax Law; provided, however, that if an exemption pursuant to
§ 458 of the Real Property Tax Law was initially granted to a parcel on a
later assessment roll, the cumulative change in level factor to be used
in recomputing that exemption shall be measured from the assessment
roll immediately preceding the assessment roll on which that exemption
was initially granted. No refunds or retroactive entitlements shall be
granted.
C. The provisions of this article shall be applied retroactively to an
assessment roll prepared on the basis of a taxable status date on or
after March 1, 1994.

of the assessed value of such property multiplied by 50% of the
veteran's disability rating; provided, however, that such exemption shall
not exceed $120,000 or the product of $120,000 multiplied by the latest
state equalization rate for the assessing unit or, in the case of a special
assessing unit, the latest class ratio, whichever is less. For the purposes
of this subsection, where a person who served in the active military,
naval or air service during a period of war died in service of a serviceconnected

Vehicles and traffic  See Ch. 249.
§ 247-1. Purpose.
The outdoor storage of junked, abandoned, unused or dangerous motor
vehicles, or the parts therefrom, within the City of Schenectady is a hazard
to the preservation of the public health, welfare and safety in that it
constitutes a health, fire and safety hazard and is an attractive nuisance to
children, which is a peril to their safety. Their outdoor storage constitutes
a blight on the City's landscape, and they are generally unsightly, and their
existence tends to depreciate the value of property in the neighborhood and
the City generally. The control of the outdoor storage of junked, abandoned,
unused or dangerous motor vehicles, or parts therefrom, within the City of
Schenectady is therefore regulated for the preservation of the public health,
safety and welfare of its residents.
§ 247-2. Definitions.

indicated:
ABANDONED  Any motor vehicle, the ownership of which cannot be
reasonably determined or of which the owner does not intend to recover
possession.

for use on a track or dragstrip that they cannot be legally operated on a
public way.
DANGEROUS  Any motor vehicle which has smashed and broken windows
and/or areas of sharp and torn metal edges and points and which cannot
legally be operated upon a public way.
HISTORIC MOTOR VEHICLE  A motor vehicle manufactured more than
25 years prior to the current calendar year, which is owned and operated
as an exhibition piece or collectors item and is used for participation in
club activities, exhibits, tours, parades and for occasional transportation
and similar uses, but not used for general daily transportation.

York or any other state and is not operable.

§ 248-38. Parking during or after snowfall. [Amended 10-11-1994
by Ord. No. 94-30]
A. Where specifically posted, all-night parking is permitted during twentyfour-
hour periods, commencing at the hour posted, on the evennumbered
side of the highways within this City on Monday, Wednesday
and Friday and on the odd-numbered side of the highways within this

6-2-1986 by L.L. No. 2-1986]
A. Whenever the Mayor finds that an accumulation of snow and ice of
more than three inches will make it necessary that motor vehicle traffic
be expedited and that parking on City streets be prohibited or
restricted for snowplowing, sanding and other purposes, he may
declare a "snow emergency" and implement the parking prohibition
rules as described by this section. When the Mayor has declared a snow
emergency, the following rules shall apply:
(1) Alternate parking regulations and priority street regulations are
temporarily suspended on all City streets.
(2) Parking prohibitions on all City streets shall start at either 8:00
a.m. or 8:00 p.m. at which time it shall be required that vehicles be
moved to the even-numbered side of the street. Parking on the oddnumbered
side of the street is strictly prohibited for the next 24
hours. After said twenty-four-hour period, and for the next 24
hours, parking is strictly prohibited on the even-numbered side of
the street. Therefore, all vehicles must be moved to the odd side of
the street for this second twenty-four-hour period. After 48 hours
have elapsed from the initial designated time, the Mayor will
officially declare snow emergency parking ended unless conditions
require an extension.
§ 248-35 CHARTER AND RELATED LEGISLATION § 248-38
C:983
(3) Driving prohibitions. In a declared snow emergency, the Mayor may
also restrict driving on all or designated portions of City streets.
(4) The Mayor shall notify radio and television stations and
newspapers that alternate side of the street parking rules are in
effect and/or that a snow emergency has been declared and request
them to notify the public of parking and driving prohibitions.
B. Special snow removal. The City may restrict parking on designated
streets and areas for special snow removal purposes. Emergency signs
shall be posted.
C. Condition of motor vehicles operated during snow emergencies.
(1) It shall be unlawful for any person to operate a motor vehicle
during a snow emergency which shall allow such vehicle to become
stalled wholly or partly because the drive wheels thereof are not
equipped properly for snow.
(2) It shall be unlawful for any person operating a motor vehicle on a
street when there is a covering of snow, sleet or ice on which there
is a parking prohibition in effect to allow such vehicle to become
stalled because the motor fuel is exhausted or the battery has
become inoperative.
D. Stalled vehicles. Whenever a vehicle becomes stalled for any reason,
whether or not in violation of this section, on any part of a street on
which there is a covering of snow, sleet or ice or on which there is a
parking prohibition in effect, the person operating such vehicle shall
take immediate action to have the vehicle towed or pushed off the
roadway into the first available legal parking space. No person shall
abandon or leave his vehicle in the roadway (regardless of whether he
indicated, by raising the hood or otherwise, that the vehicle is stalled)
except for the purpose of securing assistance during the actual time
necessary to go to a nearby telephone or to a nearby garage, gasoline
station or other place of assistance and return without delay.
E. Provisions temporarily effective to take precedence. Any provision of
this section which becomes effective by declaration of the Mayor, while
temporarily in effect, takes precedence over other conflicting
provisions of law normally in effect, except that it shall not take
precedence over provisions of law relating to the following:
(1) Vehicles may not be parked on either side of a street presently
restricted on both sides during a declared snow emergency.
(2) Parking at fire hydrants, crosswalks, in front of driveways and
turning lanes or anywhere that may be considered a traffic hazard
is never permissible. Vehicles parked at these locations will be
ticketed and towed.
§ 248-38 SCHENECTADY CODE § 248-38
C:984
(3) The City Traffic Commission may from time to time exempt certain
streets from the provisions of this section.
F. Removal and storage of vehicles. Any vehicle parked on any street in
violation of any of the provisions of this section may be removed and
stored pursuant to §§ 248-53, 248-54 and 248-55 of the Schenectady
Code.
(1) Unclaimed vehicles; public auction. Whenever any vehicle which
has been impounded by the Police Department remains in the
possession of the Department unclaimed by any person having the
right to the possession of such vehicle for a period of 60 days, such
vehicle shall be sold under the direction of the purchasing agent, at
public auction, to the highest bidder, after notice of such auction
has been given for not less than one week, by one publication in the
official newspaper of the City of Schenectady.
(2) Publication requirements. Such notice of publication shall describe
the vehicle with reasonable certainty, by manufacturer's trade
name or make, registration or license number and the name of the
person to whom, if known, the vehicle belongs, or, if the name of
the owner is unknown, that fact shall be stated.
(3) Redeeming of vehicles. The owner of such vehicle or his agent may,
within 60 days from the date of impounding, redeem the vehicle by
making payment to the City of Schenectady. The amount of the
administration fee shall be set by resolution of the City Council, for
each vehicle so removed or stored. Said owner shall also sign a
written receipt for such vehicle. Said sum shall be in addition to any
bond required for the violation for which the vehicle was towed.
[Amended 7-8-2013 by Ord. No. 2013-20]
G. Parking during general plowing. Whenever Subsection A of this section
is not put into effect, but, whereas general plowing operations are to be
carried out, all other posted parking restrictions shall remain in effect.
H. Penalties for offenses.

be punished by a fine not to exceed $65 for a first offense, $150 for
the second offense and $300 and/or a term of imprisonment of two
days in jail or three days community service for the third and
subsequent offenses.

shall be punished by a fine of $25 for a first offense, $50 for a

imposed on delinquent taxes on real property within the City for each month
that the same remain unpaid, the collection of which shall be enforced with
the original assessment.
§ 255-65. Prorating charges.
Where meters are installed at any premises, the Water and Wastewater
Department may cause meter rates to become effective at such premises
immediately thereupon, but such rates shall, in all cases, become effective
at such premises at the beginning of the next water fiscal year. Where
an annual flat rate has been paid prior to such installation of a meter,
the amount of such flat rate so paid shall be offset against the amount
chargeable at such flat rate for the period preceding such installation, plus
the amount of meter bills covering the current fiscal year, and the difference
so arrived at will be refunded, or collected by meter bill, in accordance with

this chapter and said charges are not paid and the water shall be turned off
on account of such nonpayment, no application for water service for such
premises need be granted by the Department of Water and Wastewater,
notwithstanding said premises may have changed ownership, until such
charge shall have been paid in full to the City Treasurer. Further, if water
service is not turned off on account of such nonpayment, any such unpaid
bills will become a lien against the property and will be added to the City's
assessment rolls for collection.

§ 255-70. Rebates for service to multiple premises.
In case only one or several separate buildings belonging to the same owner
or owners occupy the frontage of a single City lot and the others are located
in the rear of said front building, then permission may be granted to supply
all of said buildings from one service, but the owner will be required to give
notice to the Department of Water and Wastewater immediately after either
building becomes vacant and also immediately after it is again occupied, so
that an inspection and verification may be made, otherwise a rebate for a
nonoccupied building will not be made. A rebate will not be made in any
case for a nonoccupied building that has been vacant for longer then six
months.
§ 255-71. Conditions under which rebates not permitted.
No rebate from any water bill need be made when the owner or consumer
has not complied with the requirements of this chapter in making
application at the office of the Department of Water and Wastewater for
the discontinuance of the use of water; in making application to have any
fixtures disconnected or to have the water turned off from service; in giving
the notice required; in cases where more than one dwelling on an undivided
City lot is supplied from a single service; or where the claimed overcharge
in the bill is the result of failure on his part to perform any act required by
these rules.
§ 255-72. Failure to make repairs bars rebates.
No rebate from any water bill will be made in cases where the charges
result from the failure on the part of the owner or consumer to promptly
repair any broken, frozen or defective fixture or service.

below:
(1) Auxiliary water supply. Each service connection from the City water
supply for furnishing water to premises having an auxiliary water
supply shall be protected against backflow of water from the
premises into the City water supply.
(a) If the auxiliary water supply is handled in a separate piping
system with no known cross-connection, the City water supply
shall be protected by an approved double check valve assembly
installed at the service connection to the premises. When the
auxiliary water supply may be contaminated as determined by
the Director, he may order the City water supply protected by
an air gap separation or an approved reduced-pressure
§ 255-77 CHARTER AND RELATED LEGISLATION § 255-78
C:1049
principal backflow prevention device installed at the service
connection to the premises.
(b) If the auxiliary water supply is handled in a separate piping
system and cross-connections are known to exist between the
City water supply and the auxiliary water supply which cannot
be presently eliminated, the City water supply shall be
protected by an approved reduced pressure zone device
installed at the service connection to the premises. When the
auxiliary water supply may be contaminated as determined by
the Director, he may order the City water supply protected by
an air gap installed at the service connection.
(2) Toxic or hazardous substances.
(a) Should a facility be rated as hazardous as determined by the
Director and the facility is not under pressure, the City water
supply shall be protected by an air gap separation or an
approved reduced-pressure zone device. If an air gap is
installed, it shall be located as close as practical to the water
meter, and all piping between the water meter and air gap shall
be entirely visible. A reduced pressure zone device, when
installed, shall be as close as possible to the service
connection.

Code, where appropriate. The City may waive or vary the requirements
of underground installation of utilities when, in the opinion of the City,
such variance or waiver shall not be detrimental to the health, safety,
general welfare and environment, including the visual and scenic
characteristics of the area.
K. All wireless telecommunications facilities permit applicants shall
demonstrate that the proposed facility will be sited so as to be the least
visually intrusive to the extent reasonably possible, and thereby have
the least adverse visual effect on the environment and its character, on
existing vegetation, and on the residences in the area. A visual impact
assessment as set forth in Subsection H may be used to satisfy this
requirement.
L. Both the wireless telecommunications facility and any and all accessory
or associated facilities shall maximize the use of building materials,
§ 257-4 SCHENECTADY CODE § 257-4
C:1076
colors and textures designed to blend with the structure to which it
may be affixed and/or to harmonize with the natural surroundings. This
shall include the utilization of stealth or concealment technology as may
be required by the City, including but not limited to the placement of
associated facilities underground.
M. At a wireless telecommunications facility site, an access road,
turnaround space and/or parking area shall be provided to assure
adequate emergency and service access. Maximum use of existing
roads, whether public or private, shall be made to the extent
practicable. Road construction shall at all times minimize ground
disturbance and vegetation-cutting. Road grades shall closely follow
natural contours to assure minimal visual disturbance and reduce soil
erosion.

telecommunications facilities shall construct, operate, maintain, repair,
provide for removal of, modify or restore the permitted wireless
telecommunications facilities in strict compliance with all current
applicable technical, safety and safety-related codes adopted by the
county, the state, or the United States, including but not limited to the
most recent editions of the National Electrical Safety Code and the
National Electrical Code, as well as accepted and responsible
workmanlike industry practices and recommended practices of the
National Association of Tower Erectors. The codes referred to herein
are codes that include, but are not limited to, construction, building,
electrical, fire, safety, health, and land use codes. In the event of a
conflict between or among any of the preceding, the more stringent
shall apply.
O. A holder of a special use permit granted under the provisions of this
chapter shall obtain, at its own expense, all permits and licenses
required by applicable law, rule, regulation or code, and must maintain
the same, in full force and effect, for as long as required by the City or
other governmental entity or agency having jurisdiction over the
applicant.
P. The applicant shall examine the feasibility of designing a proposed
telecommunications tower to accommodate future demand for at least
five commercial applications, for example, future collocations. The
scope of this examination shall be determined by the City or its duly
authorized agent. The telecommunications tower shall be structurally
designed to accommodate at least five additional antenna arrays equal
to those of the applicant and located as close to the applicant's antenna
as possible without causing interference. This requirement may be
waived, provided that the applicant, in writing, demonstrates that the
provisions of future shared usage of the telecommunications tower is
not technologically feasible, is commercially impracticable or creates
an unnecessary and unreasonable burden, based upon:
(1) The foreseeable number of FCC licenses available for the area;
§ 257-4 CHARTER AND RELATED LEGISLATION § 257-4
C:1077
(2) The kind of wireless telecommunications facilities site and
structure proposed;
(3) The number of existing and potential licenses without wireless
telecommunications facilities spaces/sites; and
(4) Available space on existing and approved telecommunications
towers.
Q. The applicant for a new tower shall submit a letter of intent committing
the owner of the proposed new tower, and his/her successors in
interest, to negotiate in good faith for the shared use of the proposed
tower by other telecommunications providers in the future. This letter
shall be filed in the City's Planning Department. Failure to abide by the
conditions outlined in the letter may be grounds for revocation of the
special use permit. The letter shall commit the new tower owner and
his/her successors in interest to:
(1) Respond within 60 days to a request for information from a
potential shared-use applicant;
(2) Negotiate in good faith concerning future requests for shared use
of the new tower by other telecommunications providers; and
(3) Allow shared use of the new tower if another telecommunications
provider agrees in writing to pay reasonable charges. The charges
may include, but are not limited to, a pro rata share of the cost of
site selection, planning, project administration, land costs, site
design, construction and maintenance financing, return on equity,
less depreciation, and all of the costs of adapting the tower or
equipment to accommodate a shared user without causing
electromagnetic interference.
R. Unless waived by the City there shall be a preapplication meeting. The
purpose of the preapplication meeting will be to address issues which
will help to expedite the review and permitting process. A
preapplication shall also include a site visit, unless otherwise waived by
the City. The costs of the consultants to prepare for and attend the
preapplication meeting will be borne by the applicant. The
preapplication meeting could be conducted by telephone or video
conference at the discretion of the City.
S. The holder of a special use permit shall notify the City of any intended
modification of a wireless telecommunications facility and shall apply to
the City to modify, relocate or rebuild a wireless telecommunications
facility; provided, however, that nothing in this section shall be deemed
to require an approval of a modification of a special use permit for the
replacement of existing antennas or base station electronic equipment
at a wireless transmission facility.
T. If required by the City, in order to better inform the public relative to
the application for construction of a new telecommunications tower, the

After an approved special use permit is recorded, the applicant shall submit,
as part of the site plan approval and building permit process, the following
information:
§ 257-6. Location of wireless telecommunications facilities.
applicant shall, prior to the Planning Board meeting and the public
hearing on the application, hold a "balloon test" as follows: the
applicant shall arrange to fly, or raise upon a temporary mast, a
minimum of a three-foot-diameter brightly colored balloon at the
maximum height of the proposed new tower. The dates (including a
second date, in case of poor visibility on the initial date), times and
location of this balloon test shall be advertised by the applicant seven
and 14 days in advance of the first test date in a newspaper in general
circulation in the City and as agreed to by the City. The applicant
shall inform the City, in writing, of the dates and times of the test, at
least 14 days in advance. The balloon shall be flown for at least eight
consecutive hours sometime between 7:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. on the
dates chosen. The primary date shall be on a weekend, but the second
date, in case of poor visibility on the initial date, may be on a weekday.
U. The applicant will provided a written copy of an analysis, completed by
a qualified individual or organization, to determine if the
telecommunications tower or existing structure intended to support
wireless telecommunications facilities requires lighting under Federal
Aviation Administration Regulation Part 77. This requirement shall be
for any new tower or for an existing structure or building where the
application increases the height of the structure or building. If this
analysis determines that the FAA must be contacted, then all filings
with the FAA, all responses from the FAA and any related
correspondence shall be provided in a timely manner.
A. The make, model and manufacturer of the tower(s) and antenna(s);
B. Certification that a topographic and geomorphologic study and analysis

and erect said wireless telecommunications facilities in accordance
with the following priorities, Subsection B(1) being the highest priority
and Subsection B(5) being the lowest priority:
(1) On existing telecommunications towers or other tall structures;
(2) On public-owned properties;
(3) On compatible use structures, such as utility poles and towers;
(4) On a site with existing wireless telecommunications facilities or
structures; and
(5) On other property in the City.
C. If the proposed property site is not the highest priority listed above,
then a detailed explanation must be provided as to why a site of a
higher priority was not selected. The person seeking such an exception
must satisfactorily demonstrate the reason or reasons why such a
permit should be granted for the proposed site, and the hardship that
would be incurred by the applicant if the permit were not granted for
the proposed site.
D. An applicant may not bypass sites of higher priority by stating the site
proposed is the only site leased or selected. An application shall
address collocation as an option. If such option is not proposed, the
applicant must explain to the reasonable satisfaction of the City why
collocation is commercially or otherwise impracticable. Agreements
between providers limiting or prohibiting collocation shall not be a
valid basis for any claim of commercial impracticability or hardship.
E. Notwithstanding the above, the City may approve any site within an
area in the above list of priorities, provided that the City finds that the
proposed site is in the best interest of the health, safety and welfare of
the City and its inhabitants and will not have a deleterious effect on the
nature and character of the community and neighborhood.
F. The applicant shall submit a written report demonstrating the
applicant's review of the above locations in order of priority,
demonstrating the technological reason for the site selection. If
appropriate based on selecting a site of lower priority, a detailed
written explanation as to why sites of a higher priority were not
selected shall be included with the application.
G. The applicant shall, in writing, identify and disclose the number and
locations of any additional sites that the applicant has been, is, or

its border, for a two-year period following the date of the application,
based on the information currently available to the applicant at that
time.
H. Notwithstanding that a potential site may be situated in an area of
highest priority or highest available priority, the City may disapprove an
application for any of the following reasons:
(1) Conflict with safety and safety-related codes and requirements;
(2) Conflict with traffic laws or adverse impact upon traffic needs or
definitive plans for changes in traffic flow;
(3) Adverse impact upon the historic nature or character of a
neighborhood or historical district;
(4) The use or construction of wireless telecommunications facilities
which is contrary to an already stated purpose of a specific zoning
or land use designation;
(5) The placement and location of wireless telecommunications
facilities which would create an unacceptable risk, or the
reasonable probability of such, to residents, the public, employees
and agents of the City or employees of the service provider or other
service providers;
(6) Conflicts with the provisions of this chapter; and/or
(7) There is no demonstration of need for a facility.
I. When telecommunications facilities are to be located on property
owned by the City of Schenectady:
(1) The standards specified herein shall apply, and, at the discretion of
the City of Schenectady, appropriate fees may be charged;
however, the application shall be exempt from the procedures and
processes outlined herein.
(2) The rent or other compensation paid to the City of Schenectady
shall be negotiated and subject to the approval of the City Council.
A. Shared use of existing wireless telecommunications facilities shall be
preferred by the City, as opposed to the construction of a new
telecommunications support facility. Where such shared use is
unavailable, location of antennas on other pre-existing structures shall
be preferred. The applicant shall submit a comprehensive report
inventorying existing towers and other appropriate compatible
structures within four miles of any proposed new tower site, unless the
applicant can show that some other distance is more reasonable,
outlining opportunities for the shared use of existing facilities and the

§ 257-11. Signage.
§ 257-12. Lot size and setbacks.
All proposed wireless telecommunications facilities shall be set back from
abutting parcels, recorded rights-of-way and road and street lines by the
greater of the following distances: a distance equal to the height of the
tallest wireless telecommunications facility support structure plus 25 feet,
or the existing setback requirements of the underlying zoning district,
whichever is greater. If the tower is designed to break in the event of failure,
the tallest shall be the greatest distance from the base of the tower that
any single portion of the tower may reach. Any accessory structure shall be
located so as to comply with the applicable minimum setback requirements
for the property on which it is situated.
§ 257-13. Expert assistance: hiring; escrow account; review of
invoices.
A. All antennas, towers and other supporting structures, including guy
wires, shall be made inaccessible to individuals and constructed or
shielded in such a manner that they cannot be climbed or run into; and
B. Transmitters and telecommunications control points must be installed
in such a manner that they are readily accessible only to persons
authorized to operate or service them.
A. Wireless telecommunications facilities shall contain a sign adequate to
provide adequate notification to persons in the immediate area of the
presence of an antenna that has transmission capabilities. The sign
shall contain the name(s) of the owner(s) and operator(s) of the
antenna(s) as well as emergency phone number(s). The sign shall be on
the equipment shelter or shed of the applicant and be located so as to
be visible from the access point of the site. The sign shall not be lighted,
unless the City expressly allows such lighting or unless such lighting is
required by applicable provisions of law. The sign shall be approved by
the City before installation. No other signage, including advertising,
shall be permitted on any facilities, antennas, supporting structures or
antenna towers, unless required by law.
B. This section shall not prevent lighting and signs when the wireless
telecommunications facilities are installed as a shared use on billboards
or other similar structures.
A. The City may hire any consultant and/or expert necessary to assist in
reviewing and evaluating the application.
B. An applicant shall deposit with the City funds sufficient to reimburse for
all reasonable costs of review of the application plus the cost of
consultants and/or expert evaluation and consultation to the City in
connection with the review of any application. The amount of the initial
deposit shall be established by the City and may be changed within the

discretion of the City. These funds shall be deposited with the City
five days prior to the preapplication meeting. The City consultants and/
or experts shall bill or invoice the City, and the City will immediately
notify the applicant of the amount being billed. If the balance in escrow
should be diminished to an amount deemed insufficient to complete
the review process, the applicant shall immediately, upon request by
the City, replenish said escrow account by an amount determined by
the City. Such additional escrow funds shall be deposited with the City
before any further action or consideration is taken on the application.
In the event that the amount held in escrow by the City is more
than the amount of the actual billing or invoicing at the conclusion of
the project, the remaining balance shall be promptly refunded to the
applicant. All invoices shall be itemized and be public records available
for inspection.
C. The total amount of the funds needed as set forth above may vary with
the scope and complexity of the project, the completeness of the
application and other information as may be needed by the City and/or
its consultants and/or experts to complete the necessary review and
analysis. Additional escrow funds, as reasonably required and
requested by the City shall be paid by the applicant. However,
notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, if the total amount
paid to the consultants and/or experts exceeds $7,500 for a single
application, such amount shall be subject to review and approval by the
City Council at the request of the applicant.

changed within the discretion of the City to an amount not to exceed an
amount commensurate with the complexity of the application, and in order
the facility or imposing a penalty shall be in writing and supported
by substantial evidence contained in a written record and shall be
promptly provided to the owner of the facility.
G. If the applicant has submitted all of the information requested by the
City and required by this chapter, and if the City does not complete its
review, as noted above, prior to the five-year anniversary date of the
special use permit, or subsequent fifth anniversaries, then the applicant
for the permitted wireless telecommunications facilities shall receive an
extension of the special use permit for up to six months, in order for the
City to complete its review.
H. If the holder of a special use permit for wireless telecommunications
facilities does not submit documentation for recertification of such
special use permit within the time frame noted above, then such special
use permit and any authorizations granted thereunder shall cease to
exist on the date of the fifth anniversary of the original granting of the
special use permit, or subsequent fifth anniversaries, unless the holder
of the special use permit adequately demonstrates to the City that
extenuating circumstances prevented a timely submission of
recertification documentation. If the City agrees that there were
legitimately extenuating circumstances, then the holder of the special
use permit may submit late documentation or an application for a new
special use permit.
A. Such special use permit shall be nonexclusive;
B. Such special use permit shall run with the land and be enforceable upon
successor owners and may be assigned, transferred or conveyed to
successor owners of the wireless transmission facility after express
prior written notification to the City.
C. Such special use permit may, following a hearing upon due prior notice

or expenses arising therefrom, either at law or in equity, which might arise
out of, or are caused by, the placement, construction, erection, modification,
location, products performance, use, operation, maintenance, repair,
installation, replacement, removal, or restoration of said facility, excepting,
however, any portion of such claims, suits, demands, causes of action or
award of damages as may be attributable to the negligent or intentional
acts or omissions of the City, or its servants or agents. With respect to
the penalties, damages or charges referenced herein, reasonable attorney's
fees, consultants' fees, and expert witness fees are included in those costs
that are recoverable by the City.
§ 257-23. Default and/or revocation.
If wireless telecommunications facilities are repaired, rebuilt, placed,
moved, relocated, modified or maintained in a way that is inconsistent or
not in compliance with the provisions of this chapter or of the special use
permit, then the City may notify the holder of the special use permit, in
writing, of such violation. The applicant and/or holder of the special use
permit shall have 60 days to cure any specified default. Upon a failure to
cure the stated default, the City may revoke the special use permit and all
use of the wireless telecommunications facilities shall cease.
§ 257-24. Removal of wireless telecommunications facilities.
A. Under the following circumstances, the City may determine that the

unique opportunities for the development and maintenance of
water-oriented uses within certain areas of the City adjacent to the
Mohawk River. The C-3 District permits certain recreational, open
space, business and residential uses which will generally benefit
from and enhance the unique aesthetic, recreational and

access to the shoreline and to encourage appropriate wateroriented
recreational uses along the shoreline.
(2) The specific purposes of this district include the following:

to the river in a manner that is compatible with the primary
purpose of the proposed development or activity.
(f) To promote opportunities for increased tourism.

the City's waterfront, the Planning Commission may allow, by
application for a special permit, an increase in zoning density as set
forth below if the development of a lot includes access or
recreational opportunities for the public along the Mohawk River.
(2) Density incentives. In order to encourage the development of
additional public access on the waterfront, the following exceptions
to the bulk, space and yard requirements may be permitted by the
Planning Commission through the granting of a special permit
based on the extent of the provision of a public waterfront access
element described in Subsection E(4) above:

clientele. The district is also intended to provide locations for smallscale
assembly, processing and light manufacturing uses, which are
generally compatible in scale and nature with other permitted uses and
which may provide employment opportunities for community residents.
The C-5 District is characterized by good highway accessibility and
exposure afforded by location on major streets and highways.
B. Permitted and special permit uses. See Schedule B, Use Regulations for
Nonresidential Districts.163
C. Bulk, space and yard requirements. See Schedule C, Lot Development
Standards.164
D. Additional limitations. The following limitations and conditions shall
apply to and be complied with by all uses permitted and permissible in
the C-5 District:
(1) Screening and landscaping shall be provided along all lot lines
abutting a side or rear lot line of any residentially zoned or
developed property in a manner which largely obscures the
nonresidential use and its operation from all points located on such
residential lot when viewed from the ground level.
(2) No use shall be conducted in any manner which would render it
noxious or offensive by reason of dust, refuse matter, odor, smoke,
gas fumes, noise, vibration or glare.
E. Accessory uses and structures. Accessory uses and structures are
permitted in the C-5 District subject to the provisions of § 264-29 of this
chapter. [Amended 3-23-2009 by Ord. No. 2009-02]
A. Purpose. The Institutional (I) District is established to allow for an
increased development scale and intensity than would typically be
found in the adjacent residential districts to reflect their respective
institutional missions and to support continued growth and flexibility.
Development is intended to respect the historic development pattern of
the existing campuses as well as the surrounding residential
neighborhoods and be predominantly pedestrian oriented.

D. Density incentive.
(1) Purpose. The purpose of a density incentive is to encourage
expansion and redevelopment projects on institutional campuses in
coordination and cooperation with the City of Schenectady and the
surrounding neighborhoods by providing some additional flexibility
to these uses. To provide an incentive which will further encourage
coordination and the most appropriate use and development of the
City's campuses, institutional uses may request a density bonus to
allow for seventy-percent lot coverage of principal structures if it
provides a long-range plan to the City as part of special use permit
review.
E. Accessory uses and structures. Accessory uses and structures are
permitted in the I District subject to the provisions of § 264-29 of this
chapter. [Amended 3-23-2009 by Ord. No. 2009-02]
A. Purpose. The M-1 Light Manufacturing and Warehousing District is
intended to provide areas where light manufacturing, warehousing and
business establishments may locate. Uses in the M-1 District
themselves require protection from the potential adverse impact of
heavier industrial uses, and therefore, such heavier industrial uses have
been excluded from the M-1 District. The M-1 District is intended to be
located primarily in those areas that are not residentially developed.
[Amended 3-23-2009 by Ord. No. 2009-02]
B. Permitted and special permit uses. See Schedule B, Use Regulations for
Nonresidential Districts.167
C. Bulk, space and yard requirements. See Schedule C, Lot Development
Standards.168
D. Performance standards for permitted uses. All uses permitted in this
district shall operate in compliance with the following standards.
Failure to operate in compliance with these standards shall be a
violation of the Zoning Code and shall be subject to penalties as
specified by Article XVIII of this chapter.

A. Purpose. The OH Overlay Historic District is intended to promote,
maintain and enhance areas, buildings and neighborhoods of historic,
architectural, cultural or aesthetic value and to promote the purpose
and intent of Article X governing historic districts. The OH District
provides a means of applying historic district review and protection to
individual landmark buildings or to areas of diverse land use that may
not reasonably be classified as either an RH-1 or RH-2 Historic District.
As an overlay district, the OH District shall always be mapped in
conjunction with an underlying district.
B. Effects. The OH District shall not be independently mapped upon the
Zoning Map but shall be mapped, pursuant to the procedure for zoning
amendments established in Article XIX of this chapter, only in
conjunction with an underlying residential or nonresidential district.
When so mapped, the OH District shall apply the requirements for
historic districts established in Article X of this chapter, in addition to
all the requirements and limitations applicable in the underlying
district.
A. Purpose. This section creates a zoning district which would permit the
establishment of planned residential developments (PRDs) and planned
mixed-use developments (PMDs) on one or more sites to achieve the
following objectives:
(1) A land use pattern in harmony with the objectives of the City
Comprehensive Development Plans.

C:1133
(2) A more desirable environment than would be possible through the
strict application of other land use and development regulations of
the City.
(3) A creative use of land and related physical development which
allows an orderly transition from one land use to another.
(4) An efficient use of land resulting in smaller networks of utilities and
streets and thereby lower development and housing costs.
(5) Diversification in the uses permitted and variation in the
relationship uses, structures, open spaces and height of structures
in developments conceived as cohesive unified projects.
(6) Higher standards of site and building design through the use of
trained and experienced land planners, architects, landscape
architects and engineers.
(7) Innovations in residential development to the end that the growing
demands for housing at all economic levels may be met by greater
variety in tenure, type, design and siting of dwellings.
(8) The preservation and enhancement of desirable characteristics,
such as natural topography, vegetation and geologic features, and
the prevention of soil erosion.

development is an area of land, together with any improvements
thereon, intended for the aesthetic, leisure and recreational use of
all owners and occupants of the planned development. Common
property shall comprise a minimum of 25% of the total land area in
any planned development. Common property shall be either public
or private and shall be in such location and configuration that shall
adequately serve and be accessible to all residents of the planned
development.
(6) Private common property. In cases of common property maintained
privately, such land shall be covenanted to the satisfaction of the
City Corporation Counsel to ensure that such areas shall not be
utilized for building sites. The planned development plans shall
include such provisions for the ownership and maintenance of such
common property and facilities as are reasonably necessary to
ensure their continuity, care, conservation, maintenance and
operation in accordance with predetermined standards and to
ensure that remedial measures will be available to the City if such
common property or facilities are permitted to deteriorate or are

(13) Accessory home-care units in single-family dwellings. This
subsection of Chapter 264 authorizes the establishment of a
temporary accessory home-care unit on the same lot as an existing
single-family dwelling upon issuance of a special use permit in
accordance with Article XIV of this chapter.
(a) Purpose. The purpose of permitting temporary accessory
home-care units is to:
[1] Provide housing arrangements which meet the needs of
the elderly and/or disabled population in the community by
affording an opportunity for them to live in close proximity
to those who can help maintain their health, independence
and privacy.
[2] Preserve the character of a single-family residential
neighborhood by ensuring that temporary accessory
home-care units are installed only in conjunction with
owner-occupied single-family houses and under such
additional conditions as may be appropriate.
(b) General requirements. An application to the Planning
Commission for a special use permit for an accessory homecare
unit shall be subject to the following standards and
criteria:
[1] An accessory home-care unit may be:
[a] Located within an existing single-dwelling home;
[b] Constructed as an attached permanent addition to an
existing single-dwelling home;
[c] A temporary structure either separate from or
attached to an existing single-dwelling home; or
[d] Located within an existing accessory structure, such
as a garage, on an existing single-dwelling lot.
[2] Only one home-care unit shall be created per lot.
172. Editors Note: This ordinance also redesignated former Subsection B(11) as Subsection
B(12).

§ 264-29 SCHENECTADY CODE § 264-29
C:1144
[3] If the accessory home-care unit is a permanent addition or
attached as a temporary structure to the single-family
home, it shall be designed so that, to the maximum extent
feasible, the exterior appearance of the building matches
the principal dwelling and must have interior access
between dwelling units. (When use is discontinued, access
between units will facilitate the incorporation of the
addition into principal unit living space.) Only one front
entrance is allowed. Any additional entrances shall be
located on the rear or side of the building.
[4] If the accessory home-care unit is a temporary attached or
detachable accessory unit or a converted accessory
structure such as a garage, it shall be designed, placed
and screened to minimize its visual impact on adjacent
properties. Both detached and attached units shall be
located behind or to the side of the principal structure.
Landscaping, such as shrubs or trees, or fencing shall be
installed to screen the unit from adjacent properties as per
a submitted landscaping plan.
[5] An accessory home-care unit must meet the bulk, space
and yard requirements of the zoning district in which it
will be located and/or the requirements stated in § 264-29.
[6] At least one parking space shall be provided for an
accessory home-care unit. An applicant must demonstrate
that the site can accommodate sufficient parking for the
accessory and principal units during special use permit
review.
[7] The accessory home-care unit must be temporary. The
owner shall submit with the application a restoration plan,
including cost information detailing the work necessary to
remove all apartment features that include but are not
limited to exterior structures, kitchen facilities (cabinets,

ARTICLE VI
Off-Street Parking and Loading
§ 264-39. Purpose.
The purpose of the following requirements is to prevent or alleviate the
congestion of public streets and to promote the safety and welfare of
the public by establishing minimum standards and requirements for the
off-street parking, loading and unloading of motor vehicles. Additional
provisions related to ancillary parking are enumerated in § 264-102 of this
chapter.
§ 264-40. Applicability.
The provisions of this section shall apply to all new and existing uses, except
as may be provided otherwise in the following Subsections A, B and C:
§ 264-41. Landscaping requirements.
Refer to § 264-50 for landscaping requirements for parking areas.
§ 264-42. Credit for on-street parking.
All commercial properties located adjacent to a public right-of-way where
on-street parking is permitted may receive credit for one off-street parking
stall for each 20 linear feet of abutting right-of-way for parallel parking
and 13 linear feet of abutting right-of-way for diagonal parking, excluding
curb cuts. This provision shall be applied for on-street parking on the same
side of the street as the proposed land use or on the opposite side of the
street if the property on that side of the street does not have the potential
A. Whenever a use existing on the effective date of this amendment is
changed thereafter to a new use, parking facilities shall be provided as
required herein for such new use, except that when any such existing
use was deficient in required parking spaces on such effective date,
such new use may be established with a deficiency in required spaces
equal to the preexisting deficiency.
B. Whenever the intensity of use of any building, structure or use is
increased by at least 10%, through the addition of dwelling units, gross
floor area, seating capacity or other units of measurement specified for
parking requirements, such increase must provide additional parking
for the total aggregate increase.
C. Preexisting off-street parking areas and lots which are nonconforming
with respect to any of the design standards specified in § 264-43 may be
lawfully continued, provided that such nonconforming parking area is
not enlarged or altered in a way which increases its nonconformity.
Where the premises served by such nonconforming parking area are
substantially improved, the parking area shall also be improved in
compliance with the design standards specified herein.
§ 264-39 CHARTER AND RELATED LEGISLATION § 264-42
C:1153
for future development. In considering credit for on-street parking, all
fractional spaces are rounded down.

Parking Space and Aisle Dimensions. [Amended 3-23-2009 by Ord.
No. 2009-02; 9-12-2011 by Ord. No. 2011-15]
A. Location. Parking spaces and/or driveways in residential zones
permitted or required by this chapter shall be located on the same lot as
the principal use for all uses in the Residential Districts R-1, RH-1, R-2,
RH-2 and R-3.
(1) Parking in front yards. No driveway or parking area shall be
established in the area bounded by the extension of the side
building lines of a principal structure to the front property line of
that lot unless the driveway leads to a garage built into or attached
to the principal structure.
(2) Limits on paving in front yards. Paving using brick, asphalt,
concrete, gravel, shale, stone, or other similar materials in front
yards shall only be for the purposes of providing a driveway/
parking area [as permitted in Subsection A(1)] or walkways.
Walkways shall be limited to five feet in width and may connect a
driveway or sidewalk to a front door, porch or deck steps. No
walkway parallel to a public sidewalk shall be permitted unless the
distance between any structure and the public sidewalk exceeds 10
feet and the distance between the private walkway and the public
sidewalk exceeds five feet. Gravel, shale, stone or other similar
materials may be used only on level surfaces.
B. Access.
(1) Access to a parking area or space shall be via a driveway which has
a curb cut approved by the City Engineering Department. The
driveway shall be set back two feet (except as provided in
§ 264-43D below) from any abutting property line and must be at
least 8 1/2 feet wide, except as hereinafter provided. Where a
driveway was legally established prior to the effective date of this
amendment, it is grandfathered and may be repaired or replaced in
its present location, or where adjoining property owners have filed
the necessary legal easements of access with the Schenectady
County Clerk to establish a common or shared driveway, then the
required driveway setback of two feet from abutting property lines
shall be waived.
(2) For all residential uses with five or more parking spaces and all
parking areas for mixed uses (residential and nonresidential in the
same building) or nonresidential uses, unobstructed access to and
from a street, designed so as not to require the backing of any
vehicle across a sidewalk or into a street right-of-way, shall be
provided for all parking and loading spaces. Every parking garage
§ 264-42 SCHENECTADY CODE § 264-43
C:1154
or parking area containing 25 or more spaces shall be provided
with a two-way driveway at least 20 feet in width or two one-way
driveways, each at least 12 feet in width.
C. Parking space dimensions.

and to protect any plantings and landscaping.
H. Surface. In any district other than the M-1 and M-2 Districts, every offstreet
parking area and space shall be constructed in a manner so as to
provide an all-weather, durable and dustless surface and shall be
graded and drained to dispose of all surface water accumulation in the
area without shedding additional water on an adjoining property or
right-of-way. Individual parking spaces shall be clearly identified by
markings four inches to six inches in width.
A. For the uses listed in Schedule F, Minimum Parking Space
Requirements, located in this section, off-street parking shall be
provided as required and subject to the following rules and
requirements:
(1) When determination of the number of required parking spaces

and including 1/2 shall be disregarded, and fractions over 1/2 shall
require one parking space.
(2) When parking spaces are required on the basis of the number of
employees or staff, the maximum number present at any one time
shall govern.
(3) For uses not expressly listed in Schedule F, parking spaces shall be
provided on the same basis as required for the most similar use
listed or as determined by the Zoning Officer.
(4) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the collective
provision of off-street parking spaces for two or more
nonresidential uses, provided that in such case the total
requirements for off-street parking spaces shall meet the shared

B. General provisions.
(1) Authority. In order to eliminate multiple entrances and exits, to
reduce traffic hazards, to conserve space and to promote orderly
development, the Zoning Officer is authorized to group cooperative
parking facilities in such a manner as to obtain the maximum
efficiency in parking and vehicular circulation.
(2) Agreement. If authorized by the Zoning Officer, an agreement
establishing shared or combined use of a parking area, approved by
the Corporation Counsel, shall be recorded with the County Clerk.
Such agreements shall run with the land for all properties with
shared or combined parking and require City approval for any
change or termination.
(3) Termination of combined or shared use. Sufficient parking,
pursuant to Schedule F of § 264-44, must be provided for all
partners in a combined or shared agreement or that portion of the
use out of compliance with this chapter shall be terminated.
(4) Shared parking allocation. For land uses in close proximity of each
other that operate or are used at entirely different times of the day
or week, the Zoning Officer may allow shared parking facilities to
satisfy the parking requirements of such uses if the parking
facilities are within 500 feet of all primary entry areas to buildings
being served by such facilities.

reduction of no more than 50%.
(5) Combined parking allocation. Two or more uses which have similar
hours of operation and combine parking facilities may qualify to
decrease the number of parking spaces. The combined parking
facility must be cooperatively established and operated in
accordance with Subsection B above. The Zoning Officer may
require a parking demand study to ensure sufficient parking is
provided.
A. Loading spaces shall, as required herein, be provided for each
commercial or business use in sufficient location and size so that no
loading and unloading operations infringe upon any sidewalk or street,
unless a legal instrument, approved as to form and manner of execution
by the Corporation Counsel, is executed by the owners of two or more
uses requesting the joint use of off-street loading facilities and is filed
with the Zoning Officer with evidence that the joint use will provide
sufficient off-street loading facilities.
B. Required spaces. The number of loading spaces required is based on
the gross floor area of the building or use, as follows:

minimum requirements and standards for landscaping multifamily
residential, commercial and industrial sites, in order to maintain and
protect property values, enhance the general appearance of the City
and provide the residents of the City with a sense of place. In general,
these provisions ensure landscaping criteria that will curtail soil
erosion and water runoff, absorb carbon dioxide and supply oxygen;
reduce the effects of noise, glare, dust, heat, and other objectionable
activities generated by some land uses; buffer and screen adjacent
§ 264-49 SCHENECTADY CODE § 264-50
C:1172
properties; provide shade; and promote the pleasant appearance and
character of neighborhoods and the City. These standards are also
intended to be consistent with the standards of the Historic District
Commission and the design guidelines adopted by the Upper Union
Street Business Improvement District and the Downtown Schenectady
Improvement Corporation. In the event that the District Guidelines
differ from this section, the District Standards will prevail. [Amended
11-9-2009 by Ord. No. 2009-11]
B. General requirements.
(1) Proposed developments meeting the following conditions must
prepare a landscaping plan describing how the requirements of
this article will be met:
(a) Any proposed commercial or industrial development.
(b) Any proposed multifamily residential development consisting
of four or more dwelling units with a new building or building
expansion that amounts to or exceeds either 4,000 square feet
or 25% of the assessed valuation of the existing building within
any twelve-month period.

of this article. The City review shall be limited to compliance
with City standards. If the Zoning Officer believes a proposed
plan does not meet the requirements of this article, the
applicant shall be notified in writing of the Zoning Officer's
findings.
(d) For any change in tenancy of a property where the building is
set back from the sidewalk a minimum of 10 feet, the Planning
Commission may require the planting of up to one street tree
along the front of the property for every 25 feet of lot frontage,
with a minimum of one tree per property. [Added 9-12-2011
by Ord. No. 2011-15]
(2) Landscaping plans shall be drawn to scale and include existing and
proposed pavement and structures, irrigation, vehicular use areas,
significant trees and/or landscape features and topographic
elevations.

C:1173
(4) Natural vegetation or stands of trees existing prior to site
development may be used toward meeting all or part of the
landscaping requirements. Incorporation of native species which
have food or habitat value is encouraged.
(5) Required landscaping shall not incorporate trees which have the
potential of interfering with overhead power lines.
C. Minimum planting requirements.
(1) To provide a proper planting area, the minimum dimension of any
required planting area must be no less than four feet in both length
and width.
(2) At the time of planting, deciduous trees must be at least three
inches in diameter measured six inches above the base, and
coniferous trees must be at least six feet in height.

and according to the City of Schenectady Master Tree List. The use of
drought-tolerant species is recommended to reduce or eliminate the
need for irrigation. It is also recommended that any vegetation retained
or planted consist of noninvasive plant species to reduce future
maintenance requirements and encroachment on other property. An
"invasive plant species" is a nonnative plant species that escapes into
the wild and displaces native vegetation.

§ 264-50 CHARTER AND RELATED LEGISLATION § 264-50
C:1175
(c) Requirements. A landscape strip as described below shall be
provided on the property between the parking lot and the
right-of-way. The landscaped strip may not include any paved
area except pedestrian sidewalks or trails which cross the
landscaped strip. Shrubs must be maintained at a maximum
height of 36 inches. Any of the following landscaped strip
treatments may be used singularly or in combination:
[1] Provide a minimum four-foot-wide landscape strip
between the right-of-way and the parking lot to be planted
with a minimum of one shade tree and 10 shrubs per 35
linear feet of frontage, excluding driveway openings.
[2] Provide a berm, the top of which is at least 2.5 feet higher
than the elevation of the adjacent parking lot pavement.
The slope of the berm shall not exceed 33% for lawn areas.
Berms planted with ground covers and shrubs may be
steeper. However, no slope shall exceed 50%. Berms
should be graded to appear smooth, rounded, naturalistic
forms. Avoid narrow bumps which result from creating too
much height for width of the space. Plant with a minimum
of one shade tree and five shrubs per 35 linear feet of
frontage, excluding driveway openings.
[3] Provide a minimum four-foot-wide landscaped strip and a
minimum three-foot grade drop from the right-of-way line
to the adjacent parking lot pavement. Plant the resulting
embankment with a minimum of one shade tree and five
shrubs per 35 linear feet of frontage, excluding driveway
openings. Ground cover or low shrubs shall be planted to
attain seventy-five-percent coverage within four years.

between the right-of-way line and the parking lot, with a
minimum three-foot-high brick, stone or finished concrete
wall to screen the parking lot. The wall shall be located
adjacent to but entirely outside the four-foot landscaped
strip. Plant with a minimum of one shade tree per 35 linear
feet of frontage, excluding driveway openings.
[5] Provide a minimum twenty-foot-wide strip of existing
native vegetation, unless the creation of such a strip
creates a hazard to existing trees as determined by a
certified landscaper or nurseryman.
H. Parking area landscaping.
(1) Purpose: to provide visual relief and shade in parking areas.
(2) All parking lots are required to have a four-foot-wide landscaped
strip of shrubs and trees adjacent to any pedestrian walkway.
§ 264-50 SCHENECTADY CODE § 264-50
C:1176
(3) The requirements in this section apply to all parking areas with 10
or more parking spaces:
(a) Parking lots shall be planted with a low overhead canopy of
trees.
(b) Landscaped areas covering a minimum of 5% of the total paved
area of the lot shall be provided.
(c) The landscaped area must be provided via curbed islands
wholly contained within the paved areas. Each parking island
shall be a minimum of 10 feet by 40 feet in size and shall be
planted with at least one deciduous tree selected from the City
of Schenectady Master Tree List or as otherwise approved by
the Planning Commission. The use of a single tree species
throughout the parking area is not encouraged.
(4) Outdoor storage landscaping.
(a) Purpose: provide visual relief surrounding storage areas.
(b) Applicability. Any storage yard in connection with a permitted
commercial or industrial use shall require visual screening.
(c) Requirements. Visual screening shall consist of a continuous
fence, wall, evergreen hedge, landscape planting or
combination thereof so as to effectively screen the storage yard
which it encloses, and be maintained in good condition. In
cases where the physical characteristics of the parcel or
surrounding parcels make screening from adjacent properties
impossible or unreasonable, this requirement may be
completely or partially waived by the Board of Zoning Appeals
after public hearing and review as required by Article XVI.
I. Alternative landscaping plan. Alternative landscaping plans may be
proposed where strict application of the requirements in this chapter
would prohibit reasonable development of a property. The Planning
Commission may consider the topography, shape, size or other natural
features of the property or design features of the development when
considering the suitability of a proposed alternative landscaping plan.
Examples of situations where alternative landscaping plans are more
likely to receive favorable consideration are mixed-use buildings and

Historic District boundaries are described as follows:
(a) The RH-2 Stockade Historic Residential District, the RH-1
Historic Residential District area shown and bounded on the
City of Schenectady Zoning Map and the OH Overlay Historic
District shall be the area shown on the City of Schenectady
Zoning Map and all sites designated either by the City as
historic sites and structures or listed on the National Register
of Historic Places.
(b) All land within the RH-2, RH-1 and OH Districts, as amended to
date, shall be subject to the procedures, standards and
limitations set forth in this article. The term "historic district,"
when used in this article, shall be construed to include any lot
or parcel located within the RH-1, the RH-2 or the OH Districts
and all sites designated by the City as historic sites and
structures.
(2) Amendment, supplement, establishment or change of historic
boundaries. The Commission may recommend amendments to the
Historic District boundaries, or establishment of new historic
districts, in accordance with Article XIX of Chapter 264, Zoning, of
the City Code, which describes the process of notification and
review for amendment to the provisions of the ordinance. The
Commission recommendations for Historic District changes shall
be submitted to the City Planning Commission for its review and
recommendation to the City Council for action, The Commission
may recommend a group of properties as an Historic District if:
(a) It contains properties which meet one or more of the criteria
for designation of an historic site or structure; and
(b) By reason of possessing such qualities, it constitutes an
historic district section of the City.
§ 264-74 SCHENECTADY CODE § 264-75
C:1202
(3) Historic sites and structures. The Commission may recommend an
individual property for designation as an historic site or structure if
it:
(a) Possesses special character or historic or aesthetic interests or
value as part of the cultural, political, economic or social
history of the locality, region, state or nation;
(b) Is identified with historic personages or events;
(c) Embodies the distinguishing characteristics of an architectural
style;
(d) Is the work of a designer whose work has significantly
influenced an age; or
(e) Because of a unique location or singular physical
characteristic, represents an established and familiar visual
feature of the neighborhood.
B. Notice of designation.
(1) Designation proposals for property which has historic,
architectural or cultural significance may be initiated by the
owners of said property. Designation proposals may also be
initiated by the Commission. No action with regard to a Historic
District boundary, historic site or structure designation shall be
taken by the City without prior review and formal recommendation
by the Commission.
(2) When the Commission proposes to recommend changes to the
boundaries of an historic district, establish a new historic district
or designate an historic site or structure, notice of a proposed
designation shall be sent by registered mail to the owner of the
property proposed for designation, describing the property
proposed and announcing a public hearing by the Planning
Commission to consider the designation. Where the proposed
designation involves so many owners that individual notice is
infeasible, notice may instead be published at least once in a
newspaper of general circulation at least 10 days prior to the date
of the public hearing. Once the Commission has issued notice of a
proposed designation, no building permits shall be issued by the
Building Inspector until the Planning Commission has made its
recommendations to the City Council and the City Council has
made its decision. Such restriction on the issuance of building
permits may be waived by the City Council by supermajority vote
upon a recommendation from the Zoning Enforcement Officer that
the activity proposed does not impact historic features. Within 30
days of the public hearing, the Planning Commission shall make its
decision and submit recommendations to the City Council.

C:1203
§ 264-76. Application for alteration, demolition or new

No person shall carry out any exterior alteration, restoration, repair,
repainting, reconstruction, demolition, new construction or moving of an
historic site or structure or property that results in any physical change
to buildings, structures or historic resources within the districts, nor shall
any person make any material change in the appearance of such a property,
its light fixtures, signs, roofs, steps, railings, sidewalks, fences, paving,
installation of satellite dishes, or other exterior elements visible from a
public right-of-way which affect the appearance and cohesiveness of the
Historic District or historic site or structure without first obtaining a
certificate of approval from the Commission, whose decision shall be based
on the criteria set forth in Subsection C. Any and all such action shall
require the prior approval of the Commission, regardless of whether a
building permit is required.
(3) The Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing prior to
designation of any historic site or structure or historic district. The
Commission, owners and any interested parties may present
testimony or documentary evidence at the hearing which will

weeks prior to the next regularly scheduled meeting of the
Commission, the Building Inspector shall notify the Commission
Chairperson of the receipt of such application and shall transmit it,
together with accompanying plans and other information, to the
Commission.
(3) No building permit shall be issued for any proposed work until the
work plans and description have been approved by the

approved prints submitted to the Commission signifying its
approval.
(b) If the Commission does not approve such plans, it shall state its
reasons for doing so and shall transmit a record of such action
and reasons therefore in writing to the Building Inspector and
to the applicant. The Commission may advise what it thinks is
proper if it disapproved of the plans submitted. The applicant,
if he/she so desires, may make modifications to his/her plans
and shall have the right to resubmit his/her application at any
time after so doing.
(c) The failure of the Commission to approve or disapprove of such
plans within 62 days from the date of the Commission's
meeting to consider the completed application for a certificate
of approval shall be deemed to constitute approval, and the
Building Inspector shall proceed to process the application as
submitted to the Building Inspector, without regard to a
certificate of approval, except as provided below:
§ 264-76 CHARTER AND RELATED LEGISLATION § 264-76
C:1205
[1] The applicant has agreed, in writing, to an extension of
this sixty-two-day period; or
[2] The application is subject to the requirements of the State
Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA), and an
environmental assessment or environmental impact
statement review must be completed prior to action by the
Commission.
(2) Effect of approval. If the Commission approves the application, it
authorizes the Building Inspector to issue the building permit for
the work so specified in the application; provided, however, that the
applicant has obtained all other permits or approvals that may be
required by the codes and ordinances of the City, and provided that
a building permit is issued and work is actually begun within that
period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion.

C. Application review criteria.
(1) In considering an application to modify or demolish designated
structures or construct new structures within the Historic District,
the Commission shall not consider changes to interior spaces or to
architectural features that are not visible from a public right-ofway.
(2) The Commission's decision shall be based upon the Secretary of the
Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation and Guidelines for
Rehabilitating Historic Buildings (current revision), published by
the United States Department of the Interior, National Park
Service, Preservation Assistance Division, a copy of which is
available in the office of the City's Building Inspector, and upon the
following principles:
(a) Properties which contribute to the character of the Historic
District shall be retained, with their historic features altered as
little as possible.
(b) Alterations and additions to existing buildings shall either be
made consistent with the spirit of their architectural style or, if
this is deemed infeasible, shall alter the structure to an
appearance consistent with the architectural styles of historic
value existing in the Historic District where the subject
property is located. Alternatively, contemporary design for
alterations and additions to existing properties may be
permitted when such alterations and additions do not destroy
§ 264-76 SCHENECTADY CODE § 264-76
C:1206
significant historical, architectural or cultural material and/
or such design is compatible with the size, scale, material
and character of the property, neighborhood or environment.
Wherever possible, new additions or alterations to structures
shall be done in such a manner that, if such additions or
alterations were to be removed in the future, the essential form
and integrity of the structure would be unimpaired.
(c) Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather
than replaced, wherever possible. In the event that
replacement is necessary, the new material should match the
material being replaced in composition, design, texture and
other visual qualities. Repair or replacement of missing
architectural features should be based on accurate
duplications of features, substantiated by historical, physical
or pictorial evidence, rather than on conjectural designs or the
availability of different architectural elements from other
buildings or structures.
(d) New construction shall be consistent with the architectural
styles of historic value in the applicable historic district. On
sites of proposed new construction, where structures adjoining
the site are of significantly dissimilar periods or styles of
architecture, the Commission may approve such period or style
of architecture as it deems proper for the site and in the best
interests of the surrounding historic district.
(e) No structure may be demolished unless the Commission finds
that preservation of the structure is not warranted under the
general standards set forth in this section. Demolition may be
permitted only after the developer of the site has submitted
and obtained approval for such plans for new development,
including Commission approval for new construction, including
an acceptable timetable and guaranties which may include
performance bonds for demolition and completion of the
project. In no case shall the time between demolition and the
commencement of new construction exceed six months.
(f) Moving of structures or buildings may be permitted as an
alternative to demolition.
(g) Additional general standards.
[1] The distinguishing original qualities or character of any
significant building, structure or site and its environment
shall not be destroyed. The removal or alteration of any
historic material or distinctive architectural features
should be avoided when possible.
[2] All buildings, structures and sites shall be recognized as
products of their own time. Alterations that have no

C:1207
§ 264-77. Hardship relief.
historical basis and that seek to create an appearance of
different time period shall be discouraged.
[3] Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled
craftsmanship which characterize a building, structure or
site shall be treated with sensitivity.
[4] Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and
preserve archaeological resources affected by or adjacent
to any project.
(3) In making its decision, the Commission shall consider the following
factors:
(a) The scale of proposed alteration or new construction in
relation to the property itself, surrounding properties and the
neighborhood.
(b) Texture, materials and color and their relation to similar
features of other properties in the neighborhood.
(c) Visual compatibility with surrounding properties, including
proportion of the property's front facade, proportion and
arrangement of windows and other openings within the facade,
roof shape and the rhythm of spacing of properties on streets,
including setback.
(d) The importance of historic, architectural or other features to
the significance of the property.
A. An applicant who has been denied a certificate of approval from the
Commission to alter designated structures or build new structures
within an historic district may request a hearing before the Board of
Zoning Appeals on the grounds that the decision presents a hardship. In
order to prove the existence of hardship, the applicant shall establish
that:
(1) The property is incapable of earning a reasonable return,
regardless of whether that return represents the most profitable
return possible;
(2) The property cannot be adapted for any other use, whether by the
current owner or by a purchaser, which would result in a
reasonable return; and
(3) The applicant has made a good faith effort to sell the property and
has been unable to find a purchaser at the fair market value who
would agree to preserve the structure.
B. Appeals.
§ 264-76 SCHENECTADY CODE § 264-77
C:1208
§ 264-78. Maintenance and repair.
(1) Applicants who have been denied a certificate of approval to
demolish a designated site or structure may appeal the decision of
the Commission to the Board of Zoning Appeals, showing hardship
based upon the factors set forth in Subsection A(1), (2) and (3)
above, and the following:
(a) The structure is deteriorating and that the owner cannot
economically afford to preserve the structure.
(b) The applicant has sought financial assistance under
established programs for historic preservation and failed to
obtain sufficient assistance to enable the owner to
economically preserve the structure.
(2) Notwithstanding the finding of hardship, if the Commission finds
that the structure should be preserved, it may withhold approval to
demolish for a period not exceeding one year from the date of an
application for a demolition permit. If, during that period, the
owner, the Commission or other interested parties are able to
obtain sufficient financial assistance to preserve the structure or a
purchaser at the fair market value who will agree to preserve the
structure on the parcel, the Commission shall deny a permit to
demolish the structure.
(3) For purposes of this subsection, "economically afford" means, in
the case of a one-family or two-family owner-occupied house, an
inability to preserve the structure without financial hardship; in the
case of rental or commercial property, an inability to earn a
reasonable return on the property if the structure is preserved; and
in the case of property owned and used by a nonprofit organization,
an inability to preserve the structure without financial hardship.
Preservation of a structure includes such additions or other
alterations as are permissible in an historic district.
C. In any event, the relief granted in a finding of hardship shall be only the
minimum sufficient to relieve the hardship proved by the applicant.
D. Appeals must be filed in a manner set forth in Article XVI of this chapter
and must be filed within 30 days of the action of the Commission.
A. Nothing in this article shall be construed to prevent the ordinary
maintenance and repair of any exterior architectural feature of a
historic site or structure or property within an historic district which
does not involve a change in design, material, color or outward
appearance.
B. No owner or person with an interest in real property designated as an
historic site or structure or included within an historic district shall
permit the property to fall into a serious state of disrepair so as to
threaten to result in the deterioration of any exterior architectural

This article shall not apply in any case where the Building Inspector orders
or directs the construction, removal, alteration or demolition of any
improvement in an historic district for the purpose of remedying conditions
determined to be unsafe or dangerous to the life, health or property of any
person. However, prior to such order, the Building Inspector shall serve
written notice to the Commission Chairman describing the location and
particulars of the action to be taken.

feature which would, in the judgment of the Commission, produce a
detrimental effect upon the character of the historic district as a whole
or the life and character of the property itself.
C. Examples of such deterioration include:
(1) Deterioration of exterior walls or other vertical supports.
(2) Deterioration of roofs or other horizontal members.
(3) Deterioration of exterior chimneys.
(4) Deterioration or crumbling of exterior stucco or mortar.
(5) Ineffective waterproofing of exterior walls, roofs or foundations,
including broken windows or doors.
(6) Deterioration of any feature so as to create a hazardous condition
detrimental to the public safety. Such a building structure or part
thereof found to be in disrepair, in an unsafe or unusable condition
or in any condition that may threaten the perpetuation or integrity
of the same shall be in violation of this chapter.
A. Failure to comply with any of the provisions of this article shall be
deemed a violation, and the violator shall be liable to the fines and
penalties as set forth in Article XVIII of this chapter of the Code of the
City of Schenectady.
B. Any person who demolishes, alters, constructs or permits a designated
property to fall into a serious state of disrepair in violation of this article
shall be required to restore the property and its site to its appearance
prior to the violation. Any action to enforce this subsection shall be
brought by the City Attorney. This civil remedy shall be in addition to
and not in lieu of any criminal prosecution and penalty.

Except as hereinafter provided in this article, the lawful use of a building
or structure existing at the time of the effective date of this chapter may
be continued although such use does not conform to the provision hereof.
Each presently existing nonconforming use shall not be extended to occupy
a greater area of land, nor shall additional nonconforming buildings or
structures be erected on the land except as provided for in § 264-87.
§ 264-85. Nonconformity due to change in provisions.
Whenever the use of a building becomes nonconforming through a change

use of the same shall thereafter conform to a use permitted in the district in
which it is located.
§ 264-87. Alteration of premises.
A. Except as otherwise provided in § 264-86A, an existing legal
nonconforming building or premises lawfully devoted to a use not
permitted in an R-1, RH-1, R-2, RH-2 or R-3 District may only be
enlarged, extended, reconstructed or structurally altered by 10% of its
existing floor area when in a building or 15% of its existing area for

nonconforming use of a building may be changed to another
nonconforming use of an equally or more restricted district. Whenever
a nonconforming use has been changed to a more restricted use or to a
conforming use, the use shall not hereafter be changed to a less
restricted use. Each presently existing nonconforming use shall be
neither enlarged nor increased. Each presently existing nonconforming
use shall not be extended to occupy a greater area of land, nor shall
additional nonconforming buildings or structures be erected on the

Additional Regulations Relating to Specific Uses
§ 264-101. Regulation of adult bookstores, adult entertainment
establishments and sexually oriented businesses.
A. Purpose. In the development and execution of this chapter, it is
recognized that studies have been conducted by many cities which
document the adverse secondary effects associated with the
establishment and operation of adult bookstores, adult entertainment
establishments and sexually oriented businesses within a community.
(1) Among these adverse secondary impacts are a deterioration in the
local quality of life, an adverse effect upon local property values, an
adverse effect upon local economic viability, an imposition, whether
intentional or unintentional, of exposure to adult-oriented
expression undesired by neighbors, pedestrians and passersby, an
increase in traffic, noise, litter and nuisance, criminal and illicit
sexual behavior, a threat to the health and safety of children and
young adults and an undermining of the established sense of
community.
(2) These adverse secondary impacts of the establishment and
operation of adult bookstores, adult entertainment establishments
and sexually oriented businesses are a threat to the general health,
safety and economic viability of the community.
(3) The unregulated establishment and operation of adult bookstores,
adult entertainment establishments and sexually oriented
businesses would lead to the widespread imposition of adverse
secondary impacts upon the residents, businesses, economic
viability, property values and quality of life of the City and would,
therefore, be detrimental to the general health, safety and
economic viability of the community.
(4) It is the express intent of the City of Schenectady in adopting this
section to:
(a) Ameliorate, mitigate, reduce or prevent the widespread and
unregulated imposition of the adverse secondary impacts of
adult bookstores, adult entertainment establishments and
sexually oriented businesses upon the residents, businesses,
economic viability, property values, quality of life and general
health, safety and welfare of the community.
(b) To preserve and encourage the diversity of the community by
protecting, to the greatest degree possible, the interests of
consenting adults to enjoy the broadest freedom of private
sexual activity and behavior. [Amended 3-23-2009 by Ord.

wherein coin-operated or slug-operated or electronically, electrically,
or mechanically controlled still or motion-picture machines, projectors,
videos, or other image-producing devices are maintained to show
images to five or fewer persons per machine at any one time, and
where the images so displayed are distinguished or characterized by
the depicting or describing of specified sexual activities or specified
anatomical areas.
ADULT BOOKSTORE or ADULT VIDEO STORE 
ADULT CABARET  A nightclub, bar, restaurant, cafe or similar
commercial establishment that regularly, commonly, habitually, or
consistently features:
A commercial establishment that, as one of its principal business

more of total floor space. A commercial establishment may have
other principal business purposes that do not involve the offering
for sale or rental of material depicting or describing specified
sexual activities or specified anatomical areas and still be
categorized as an adult bookstore or adult video store. Such other
business purposes will not serve to exempt such commercial

security risks. The security plan must be on file with the

(11) The halfway house shall acquire and maintain a policy of insurance
with coverage of at least $500,000 to provide restitution to any
victim of a crime committed by one of the halfway house residents
while said resident was residing at the halfway house. Said

apply within one year for and acquire the special use permit specified
above. If there are provisions herein with which the applicant is unable
to comply without substantial expense or difficulty, the applicant will be
exempt from all such provisions except those in Subsection B(7), (8)
and (10) above.
