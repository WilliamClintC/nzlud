A contract may be awarded or negotiated without public advertising for

when an emergency affecting the public health, safety or welfare requires
the immediate delivery of goods or the performance of services, provided
the award of the contract is made in the manner established herein.
A. Procedure for authorizing emergency contracts. The department head
of the department wherein the emergency occurs shall notify the
§ 8-2 WOOLWICH CODE § 8-8
4:14
Township Administrator of the need for the performance of the
contract, the nature of the emergency, the time of its occurrence and
the need for invoking this emergency contract section of the Township
Code. The department head providing the notification of emergency
shall reduce the request to writing and file it with the Administrator
as soon as practicable. The Township Administrator shall advise the
Mayor, or, in the Mayor's absence, the Deputy Mayor, of the department
head's request for an emergency contract. The Mayor, or, in his
absence, the Deputy Mayor, will direct the Township Administrator
whether to proceed with the emergency purchase. The Township
Administrator shall then implement the procedures for undertaking the
emergency purchase and, upon doing so, shall also notify the committee
person who is liaison to the department wherein the emergency
occurred of the need to undertake the emergency purchase.
Notification of the committee person is for information purposes only;
the committee person shall not participate in the procedure for
determining whether to authorize an emergency contract.
B. Payment to contractor. Upon the furnishing of such goods and/or
services in accordance with the terms of the emergency contract
awarded by the Township Administrator, the contractor furnishing such
goods or services will be entitled to payment therefor upon
presentation of a duly executed voucher for the emergency services or
purchases rendered.
C. Requirement of emergency circumstances. An actual or imminent
emergency must exist requiring the immediate delivery of goods or the
performance of services in order for the emergency contract to be
awarded in accordance with this section.
D. Good faith or lack of foreseeability. This emergency purchase procedure
may be utilized only in the event the need for goods or services could
not have been reasonably foreseen or the need for such goods or
services arose notwithstanding a good faith effort on the part of the
governing body to plan for the purchase of any goods or services
required by it.
E. Duration of contract. The emergency contract shall be of such limited
duration as to meet only the immediate needs of the emergency. Under
no circumstances shall this emergency purchasing procedure be used
to enter into a multiyear contract.
F. Chain of command in Administrator's absence. In the event the
Township Administrator, due to illness, absence, or other incapacity, is
unavailable when emergency action may become necessary, then the
Superintendent of the Department of Public Works shall be consulted
by the department head regarding the emergency purchase. The
Superintendent of the Department of Public Works shall then comply
with the procedures established in this chapter for emergency
purchases and act in place of the Township Administrator.

§ 87-5. Map as evidence. [Added 6-6-2005 by Ord. No. 2005-2126]
The following additional matters are hereby determined, declared, recited
and stated:
A. It is understood that the map approved and adopted pursuant to § 87-1
of this article was prepared and is intended to be used as evidence in
prosecutions arising under the criminal laws of this state, and that
pursuant to state law, such map shall constitute prima facie evidence of
the following:
(1) The location of elementary and secondary schools within the
municipality;
(2) The boundaries of the real property which is owned or leased to
such schools or school board;
(3) That such school property is and continues to be used for school
purposes; and
(4) The location and boundaries of areas which are on or within 1,000
feet of such school property.
B. Except as is otherwise expressly noted on the face of the approved and
adopted map, all of the property depicted on the map approved and
adopted herein as school property was owned by (or leased to) a school
or school board and was being used for school purposes as of July 9,

adopted pursuant to § 87-1 of this article. The failure of the map
approved herein to depict the location and boundaries of any property
which is, in fact, used for school purposes and which is owned or leased
to any elementary or secondary school or school board, whether the
absence of such depiction is the result of inadvertent omission or the
result of any charges in the location and boundaries of such property
which have not been incorporated into an approved map, shall not be
deemed to be an official finding and record that such property is not
owned by or leased to a school or a school board or that such property
is not used for school purposes.
D. All of the requirements set forth in P.L. 1988, c. 44, concerning the

Application and Appeal Fees; Deposits; Guaranties; Contributions
[Adopted 4-16-2012 by Ord. No. 2012-1127]
§ 95-1. Escrow deposits.
In addition to the initial fees or charges, the Township of Woolwich shall
require escrow review deposits in accordance with the provisions of the
fee and deposit schedule set forth in § 95-8.4. The Chief Financial Officer
of the municipality shall make all of the payments to professionals for
services rendered to the municipality or approving authority for review
of applications for development, review and preparation of documents,
inspection of improvements or other purposes under the provisions of
N.J.S.A. 40:55D-1 et seq. The application review and inspection charges
shall be limited only to professional charges for review by outside
consultants when an application is of a nature beyond the scope of the
expertise of the professionals normally utilized by the municipality. The
only cost that shall be added to any such charges shall be actual outof-
pocket expenses of such professionals or consultants, including normal
and typical expenses incurred in processing applications and inspecting
improvements. No applicant shall be charged for any municipal, clerical or
administrative functions, overhead expenses, meeting room charges or any
of the municipal costs and expenses except as provided for specifically by
statute, nor shall a municipal professional add any such charge to his bill.
§ 95-2. Scope of reimbursed services.
The municipality shall be entitled to be reimbursed for the review of
applications, both as to completeness and as to content, and for the review
and preparation of documents such as, but not limited to, drafting
resolutions, developer's agreements, and necessary correspondence with
the applicant or applicant's professionals.
§ 95-3. Deposit of escrow funds; refunds.
Deposits received from any applicant in excess of $5,000 shall be held by
the Chief Financial Officer in a special interest-bearing deposit account;
and upon receipt of bills from professionals and approval of said bills as
hereinafter provided for, the Chief Financial Officer may use such funds to
pay the bills submitted by such professionals or experts. The municipality
shall not be required to refund an amount of interest paid on a deposit
which does not exceed $100 for the year. If the amount of interest exceeds
$100, the entire amount shall belong to the applicant and shall be refunded
to him by the municipality annually or at the time the deposit is repaid
or applied for the purposes for which it was deposited, as the case may
be, except that the municipality may retain for administrative expenses a
sum equivalent to no more than 33 1/3% of that entire amount, which shall

unpaid balances regarding a specific development application within 30
days of the identification of the escrow shortage.
§ 95-4. Payments; statement.

for development until all bills for reimbursable services have been received
A. Each payment charged to the deposit for review of applications, review
and preparation of documents and inspection of improvements shall be
pursuant to a voucher from the professional, which voucher shall
identify the personnel performing the service, and each date the
services were performed, the hours spent to one-quarter-hour
increments, the hourly rate and the expenses incurred. All professionals
shall submit vouchers to the Chief Financial Officer of the municipality
on a monthly basis in accordance with the schedules and procedures
established by the Chief Financial Officer. The professional shall send
an informational copy of all vouchers or statements submitted to the
Chief Financial Officer of the municipality simultaneously to the
applicant and to the municipal agency for which said service were
performed.
B. The Chief Financial Officer shall prepare and send to the applicant a
monthly statement which shall include an accounting of funds listing all
deposits, interest earnings, disbursements and the cumulative balance
of the escrow account. This information shall be provided as permitted
by the law. If an escrow account or deposit contains insufficient funds to
enable the municipality or approving authority to perform required
application reviews or improvement inspections, the Chief Financial
Officer shall provide the applicant with a notice of the insufficient
escrow or deposit balance, with a copy sent to the Township
professionals. In order for work to continue on the development or the
application, the applicant shall, within 14 business days, post a deposit
to the account in an amount to be agreed upon by the municipality or
approving authority and the applicant. In the interim, any required
health and safety inspections shall be made and charged back against

received by the Township from the applicant, the Board Secretary shall

state approvals on the subdivision or site plan.
§ 95-8. Limitation of inspection fees.
Inspection fees shall be charged only for actual work shown on a subdivision

application review escrows and deposits, or after the improvements
have been approved in accordance with N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53, in the case
of improvement inspection escrows and deposits.
B. The applicant shall send written notice by certified mail to the Chief
Financial Officer of the municipality and the approving authority that
the application or the improvements, as the case may be, are
completed. After receipt of the certified notice, the Board Secretary

shall render a written final accounting to the applicant on the uses to
which the deposit was put within 45 days of receipt of the final bill. Any

shall be responsible for all time and expenses of the new professional to
become familiar with the application or the project, and the municipality or
approving authority shall not bill the applicant or charge the deposit or the
escrow account for any such services.
§ 95-8.2. Estimate of cost of improvements.
The cost of the installation of improvements for the purposes of N.J.S.A.
40:55D-53 shall be estimated by the Municipal Engineer based on

established pursuant to N.J.S.A. 52:27D-127.
§ 95-8.3. Appeals.
A. An applicant shall notify, in writing, the governing body with copies of

improvements, or other charges made pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.2.

building permit is issued.
(3) Development fees shall be imposed and collected when an existing
structure undergoes a change to a more intense use, is demolished
and replaced, or is expanded, if the expansion is not otherwise
exempt from the development fee requirement. The development
fee shall be calculated on the increase in the equalized assessed
value of the improved structure.
(4) Developers of specific types of residential development, for
example developments with one or two owner-occupied dwelling
units, residential structures demolished and replaced as a result of

nonresidential development fees in accordance with the
exemptions required pursuant to P.L. 2008, c.46, as specified in the
Form N-RDF, State of New Jersey Non-Residential Development
Certification/Exemption form. Any exemption claimed by a
developer shall be substantiated by that developer.

nonresidential development fee thereafter ceases to be exempt
from property taxation, the owner of the property shall remit the
fees required pursuant to this section within 45 days of the
termination of the property tax exemption. Unpaid nonresidential

Statutory Authority; Findings; Purpose and Objectives
§ 103-1. Statutory authorization.
The Legislature of the State of New Jersey has in N.J.S.A. 40:48-1. et seq.
delegated the responsibility to local government units to adopt regulations
designed to promote public health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizenry. Therefore, the Township Committee of the Township of Woolwich,
Gloucester County, New Jersey does hereby ordain as follows.
§ 103-2. Findings of fact.
§ 103-3. Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare, and to minimize private and public losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
A. The flood hazard areas of the Township of Woolwich are subject to
periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief; and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public
health, safety and general welfare.
B. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in
areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and
velocities, and when inadequately anchored, causes damage in other
areas. Uses that are inadequately flood proofed, elevated or otherwise
protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss.
A. Protect human life and health;
B. Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood insurance control
projects;
C. Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding
and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
D. Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
E. Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas
mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
F. Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the second use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future
flood blight areas;
G. Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of
special flood hazard; and
§ 103-1 (RESERVED) § 103-3
90:201
§ 103-4. Methods of reducing flood losses.
In order to accomplish its purpose, this chapter includes methods and
provisions for:
H. Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions.
A. Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety
and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in
damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
B. Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve
such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
C. Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel
floodwaters;
D. Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which
may increase flood damage; and
E. Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.

community's Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map (DFIRM) with a one-percentannual-
or-greater chance of flooding to an average depth of one to three
feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of
flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such
flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD  Land in the floodplain within a
community subject to a one-percent-or-greater chance of flooding in any

water surface elevation resulting from a flood that has a one-percent or
greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. For Zones
VE and V1-30, the elevation represents the stillwater elevation (SWEL) plus
wave effect (BFE = SWEL + wave effect) resulting from a flood that has a
one-percent or greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given
year.[Added 8-15-2016 by Ord. No. 2016-13]
BASEMENT  Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all sides.

which the Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas
of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the
community.
ELEVATED BUILDING  A non-basement building built, in the case of a
building in an area of special flood hazard, to have the top of the elevated
floor elevated above the base flood elevation plus freeboard by means of
piling, columns (posts and piers), or shear walls parallel to the flow of the
water, and adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity
of the building during a flood up to the magnitude of the base flood. In an
area of special flood hazard, "elevated building" also includes a building
elevated by means of fill or solid foundation perimeter walls with openings
sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of floodwaters.[Amended
8-15-2016 by Ord. No. 2016-13]

B. Conditions for variances.
(1) Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of 1/2 acre or less
in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing
structures constructed below the base flood level, providing items
in § 103-15A(4)(a) through (k) have been fully considered. As the lot
size increases beyond the 1/2 acre, the technical justification
required for issuing the variance increases.
(2) Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued
designation as an historic structure and the variance is the
minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design
of the structure.
(3) Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would
result.
(4) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard,
to afford relief.
(5) Variances shall only be issued upon:
(a) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
(b) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
(c) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on
§ 103-15 WOOLWICH CODE § 103-15
90:214
or victimization of the public as identified in § 103-15A(4) or
conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
(6) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk
resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.

§ 109-1. Review and approval of grading plan required.
A building permit shall not be issued until a grading plan has been reviewed
and approved by the Township Engineer in accordance with the provisions
of this chapter.
§ 109-2. Applicability.
The requirements set forth herein shall apply for the development of all
lots within the Township of Woolwich, whether for residential or commercial
purposes, and when there is an application for development before a
development review board of the Township. Expressly excluded from the
requirements set forth herein is the construction of proposed additions and/
or buildings, having at grade or floor level, a total of 600 square feet or less.
§ 109-3. Grading plan requirements.
The developer of a tract of land in the Township must provide grading plans
for each lot proposed to be developed. The grading plans shall contain all
the information required below in the grading plan checklist, which shall
be made available to all applicants in the form that follows. The developer
must submit a completed grading plan checklist with the application for
development.
§ 109-4. Grading plan checklist.
The following shall be the grading plan checklist.33 The applicant must
complete this checklist and supply the required information.
§ 109-5. Grading standards.
The grading plan must conform to the following standards:
A. All grading shall be done in such a way as to not result in any adverse
effects to adjacent properties. The plan shall not increase the amount of
33.Editors Note: Said checklist is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 103-21 WOOLWICH CODE § 109-5
109:222
water which drains onto adjoining lots. For properties where a drainage
problem already exists, the drainage plan shall reduce the impact on
adjoining tracts to the greatest extent possible by causing the surface
water to drain to nearby streets, into approved drainage facilities or
into other accepted devices. All lots shall be graded to direct surface
water runoff away from structures and toward the frontage road or
other defined drainage paths.
B. Lawn areas shall be sloped away from the buildings and structures at a
minimum of 5% for the first 10 feet from a foundation wall. A minimum
slope of 1% should be maintained in all other lawn areas. A minimum
slope of 2% shall be maintained for all swales. Swales are normally
placed at the edge of both lots so that water will flow from the back of
the house to the curb. Water also may be directed to flow on
neighboring lots where easements are applicable to the curb or to the
source where the water will be discharged.
C. All slopes shall be no greater than 3:1.
D. Driveway grades shall not exceed 12%.
E. No grading shall occur within five feet of a property line unless
necessary to direct drainage off the site and into acceptable drainage
facilities in accordance with these standards. When an applicant
proposes to grade over an adjoining property line, written permission/
agreement from the adjoining property owner must be obtained and a
waiver from the minimum requirements must be obtained. Where an
applicant proposes to grade over an adjoining property line, written
permission in the form of an agreement for easement shall be recorded
in the Gloucester County Clerks Office, from the adjoining property or
developer, and a copy shall be filed with the Building Office of the
Township of Woolwich, and the Planning Board or Zoning Board of the
Township of Woolwich, where a subdivision or a variance shall have
been approved. The document between the parties must be notarized in
order to file and record. (The office of the County Clerk acts as a
registrar of deeds and all other recorded documents, and the right to
grade on an adjoining property becomes an easement or right against
the adjoining property).
F. The top of any excavation of slope shall be no closer than five feet to an
adjoining property and shall not provide for water runoff to the
adjoining property unless an agreement shall have been provided and
recorded as indicated under § 109-5E.
G. If a retaining wall is proposed, construction details must be provided. In
cases where a retaining wall is higher than 48 inches, calculations
prepared by a licensed professional engineer must be submitted
certifying the stability of the structure.

§ 109-6. Approval procedures.
Each person to whom this chapter applies must obtain approval of his/her
grading plan in the following manner.
A. The Township Planning Board or Zoning Board of Adjustment is
designated the Board to receive, review and determine site plans, for
purposes of establishing drainage and other issues relating to
applications for development. Grading is a part of a site plan
application. In the event any grading plan submitted under this chapter
shall not be approved by the Township Engineer, an application for site
plan with either the Planning Board or the Zoning Board of Adjustment,
wherever jurisdiction shall lie, shall be submitted for purposes of a final
determination.
B. The Township Engineer will oversee the grading operation during
normal site inspections, and shall inspect the final grade, with written
notice to the applicable board and to the developer. The final grade
inspection shall be 14 working days preceding the issuance of any
certificate of occupancy. Notification to the Township Engineer shall not
be less than 48 hours prior to rough grading by any applicant/
developer.
C. Following completion of all grading and drainage work, the applicant
must submit two copies of an as-built survey, prepared by a New Jersey
licensed surveyor or professional engineer, with final grades, and
request a final inspection. If any discrepancy exists between the
grading plan and actual construction, the developer will be required to
perform any necessary site work to correct the deficiency. All as-built
site work must be done in conformity with the approved grading plans.
Any significant deviations may be approved only by the relevant
approving agency.
D. Following completion of all work, the Township Engineer shall conduct
the final inspection and notify the Construction Official, in writing,
whether the final construction is in compliance with the approved
grading plan and that a certificate of occupancy may be issued. The
Construction Official shall issue the certificate of occupancy only if all
conditions for the approved grading plan have been satisfied.
E. All grading work shall be completed within 180 calendar days from the
issuance of the grading permit. The grading permit and building permit
shall be issued simultaneously. The 180 days shall be counted from
approval of the actual final grading plan.
(1) For lots separately handled for grading permits, an individual plan
shall be filed for each lot.
(2) Unless all lots are intended to be completed at one time, individual
lot permits shall be issued for each individual construction permit.

ARTICLE II
Athletic Fields and Recreational Use
[Adopted 10-4-2010 by Ord. No. 2010-22]
§ 135-6. Purpose.
This article embodies the policies and procedures which govern recreation
facility use and users in order to ensure proper care and maintenance
of athletic fields and other recreational facilities, owned by the Township
of Woolwich, and to assure fair and efficient access to those facilities.
The primary use of municipal recreation areas and facilities is for public
recreation and athletic activities. Municipal facilities may be made available
for such activities if not in conflict with repair, rehabilitation or maintenance
of the fields or facility. Factors to be considered in determining permission
for use, as well as permission for type of use, are current capital
improvements or rehabilitation, regular maintenance, extent of wear and
tear to be caused by current or proposed use, coordination of uses, efficient
scheduling, location of facility, and availability of services at a particular
facility. All facility users shall comply with all applicable federal, state and
local laws; such user shall pay all the costs, expenses, fines, penalties
and damages which may be imposed by the municipality by reason of, or
arising out of, the user's failure to fully and promptly comply with all legal
requirements, and observe all the provisions of this policy.
§ 135-7. List of facilities governed.
§ 135-8. Priority of use by category. [Amended 3-19-2018 by Ord.
No. 2018-02]
Permits for field/facility use are issued by category (and in priority order)
in which the organization or event is placed. Category 1 user/event has
priority over Categories II, III and IV user/event.
A. The outdoor athletic fields and outdoor recreational facilities within the
Township of Woolwich are listed as follows:
(1) Township recreation areas.
Location Field/Facility
Locke Avenue Park and High Hill
Park
Baseball fields
Athletic fields
Soccer fields
Basketball court
PMC property Practice fields
B. This policy also applies to other fields/facilities not listed above, now
and in the future.
§ 135-6 LITTERING § 135-8
125:251
§ 135-9. Allocation of fields and facilities.
A. Category I permit use.
(1) Swedesboro Woolwich Teams in established Leagues or Clubs.
These teams are independent organizations that have been
established to serve the recreational and/or athletic interest of the
participants. A minimum of 90% of the host team must be residents
of Swedesboro and/or Woolwich Township. Independent
organizations that have used the facility during a prior year shall
have priority over an applicant who has not used the facility in a
prior year.
B. Category II permit use.
(1) Swedesboro/Woolwich-based organizations. These groups are
made up of residents of Swedesboro and/or Woolwich Township, or
businesses located in Swedesboro and/or Woolwich Township who
request the use of facilities on an occasional basis when space is
available. A minimum of 90% of the group must reside or work fulltime
in Swedesboro and/or Woolwich Township.
C. Category III permit use.
(1) Organizations not affiliated with Swedesboro/Woolwich. These
groups are made up of persons consisting of a group that is less
than 90% of Swedesboro and/or Woolwich Township residents, or
who do not work full-time in Woolwich Township.
D. Category IV permit use.
(1) Camps and clinics. Camps and clinics attended by participants from
Swedesboro/Woolwich (at least 90%) may use the fields free of
charge if they do not charge a fee for attendance. Camps and
clinics that charge a fee for attendance and those without 90%
attendance from Swedesboro/Woolwich shall pay a fee as set forth
at § 135-12. Camp and clinic applications will be reviewed and
assessed based on availability as relative to rolling blackout dates.
Additionally, requests must be made in accordance with the
designated field use map.
E. Category V tournaments. Organized tournaments conducted for a
period of time up to three days.
F. Category VI use of pavilion. Swedesboro/Woolwich-based
organizations. A minimum of 90% of the group must reside or work fulltime
in Swedesboro and/or Woolwich Township.
G. Category VII use of pavilion (private). Private use of the pavilion for
birthday parties, private functions, and similar events.
A. The fields/facilities use a schedule created by the Director of Municipal
Services that will establish the opening and closing dates for field/
§ 135-8 WOOLWICH CODE § 135-9
125:252
§ 135-10. Facility use rules and regulations.
facilities use, as well as the period of time affected by that schedule.
The schedule will serve as a permit for use of the facility named.
Responsible officials within the Township (police, emergency services,
Public Works Department, and others) will receive a copy of the fields/
facilities schedule. [Amended 2-19-2019 by Ord. No. 2019-03]
B. Communication is the key to efficient maximization of use of scarce
recreational facilities. Consistent with that goal, any assigned user
must notify the Director of Municipal Services or the Director's
designee, of expected nonuse of a particular facility, at a particular
time. Every effort should be made to do so at least seven calendar days
in advance. This nonuse policy does not apply to weather cancellations.
[Amended 2-19-2019 by Ord. No. 2019-03]
C. Notes concerning scheduling.
(1) Priority of assignment is made based upon the categories
established above. Priority is given within a particular sport's
designated season. In-season sports have equal status to each
other; out-of-season sports have equal status to each other.
Recognizing that most sports have some program on more than an
in-season basis, consideration should be made to accommodate the
out-of-season sport's minimum necessary allocation for games as a
first priority and practices as a second priority. Assignment of
particular fields will be done with an effort towards accommodating
such use rather than simply on a preference basis; efficient,
coordinated use is the goal.
(2) Game delays. Youth sports activities are often subject to delays due
to late-arriving opponents and/or officials, or emergencies. In such
cases, use may extend beyond the normal time. Likewise, overtime
and extra innings can require additional time. Other users take
their starting time subject to previous team's right to complete
their games and with the knowledge that termination of the activity
is not solely within the control of the representative. However,
practices may not delay the start of the next user session.
(3) Field closings due to weather. Fields may be closed to all users for
an extended period time of more than one day by the Department of
Public Works and, at times, Director of Municipal Services. These
conditions include, but are not limited to, field under water, severe
damages that make it unsafe/unplayable, field reconstruction and
the need to rest fields. Information on field closings can be
accessed by the Director of Municipal Services. It is the
responsibility of league presidents and athletic directors to notify
their coaches and players. Destruction or damage done to any
playing field due to use in unsatisfactory conditions may be cause
for forfeiture of permit at the discretion of the Township of
Woolwich. [Amended 2-19-2019 by Ord. No. 2019-03]
§ 135-9 LITTERING § 135-10
125:253
§ 135-11. Field modifications. [Amended 2-19-2019 by Ord. No.
2019-03]
Any proposed changes to fields or parks should be submitted to the Director
of Municipal Services to consider impact upon facility use. Those requested
changes, along with a recommendation, will then be forwarded to the
Woolwich Township Committee for consideration. This would include the
development of active recreation areas from property not currently used
for that purpose. It may include the installation of fields, fences, structures,
scoreboards, permanent stands and permanent and temporary lighting. It
would not include the replacement of any current structure (an old backstop
with a new one of roughly the same size) or the repair or replacement
of existing fencing. These types of items will be the responsibility of the
Township Committee. The placement location of all movable items (portable
bases, soccer goals, batting cages, blocking sleds, temporary fencing, etc.)
will be the responsibility of the league, organization or club using the
facility.
§ 135-12. Permit costs.
A. Athletic fields/facilities may not be used before 8:00 a.m. or after dusk,
except where lights are utilized. The Township has a 10:00 p.m. lightsout
time for all outdoor facilities. Practices and games should be
scheduled to end before this time with the lights to be turned off as soon
as the players and spectators leave the field.
B. All trash must be placed in proper receptacles. Users are expected to
leave the facility in the same condition in which it was found, or better.
C. Warm-ups for the next scheduled event must be performed so as not to
interfere with existing events and so as not to endanger the welfare of
all participants, spectators and facilities.
D. All managers, coaches, or persons in charge of a group using the fields
will be responsible for the conduct of all participants, spectators and
others connected with the activity, including visiting teams and
opponents.
E. Picnics, birthday parties and other events. [Amended 3-19-2018 by
Ord. No. 2018-02]

ARTICLE II
Vacant, Abandoned and Foreclosed Properties
[Adopted 12-21-2015 by Ord. No. 2015-2546]
§ 143-5. Purpose.
A. The purpose of this article is to establish a program for identifying and
registering vacant, abandoned and foreclosed properties; to establish
the responsibilities of owners of vacant, abandoned or foreclosed
properties, and to ensure that vacant, abandoned and foreclosed
properties are maintained in compliance with applicable Township,
county, state and federal codes. It is the municipality's further intent to
participate in the county-wide registration program established by
Gloucester County and administered by Community Champions
Corporation as a mechanism to protect neighborhoods from becoming
blighted due to the lack of adequate maintenance and security of
vacant, abandoned and foreclosed properties.
B. The Township Committee finds, determines and declares that buildings
and property which remain vacant and unoccupied for any appreciable
period of time become a harborage for rodents, an invitation for illegal
occupancy and for illegal activities, as well as a fire hazard, and that
unkempt grounds surrounding the property invite dumping and rubbish
thereon, that such buildings become dilapidated, contribute to
commercial and residential blight, depress market values of
surrounding property, require additional government services,
endanger the public safety and health, and generally remain
detrimental to the public good. Unsupervised vacant/abandoned or
foreclosed properties have a negative impact on surrounding properties
and neighborhoods. Owners of such structures and property should be
held accountable for the physical condition of the property.
C. This article establishes responsibilities of owners of the vacant,
abandoned and or foreclosed properties and structures and provides for
administration and enforcement of standards related to such property
and structures. This article incorporates the International Property
Maintenance Code and all applicable federal, state and local building
and fire codes. This article shall apply to all vacant, abandoned or
foreclosed property and/or structure within Woolwich Township.
D. It is in the public interest for the Township to establish minimum
standards of accountability for the owners or other responsible parties
of vacant, abandoned and foreclosed properties in order to protect the
health, safety and welfare of the residents of the Township.
E. It is in the public interest for the Township to impose a reasonable
administrative fee in conjunction with registration of vacant,

Abandoned and Foreclosed Properties, adopted 9-3-2013 by Ord. No. 2013-06.

land use regulation therein in order to protect the streams, lakes, and other
surface water bodies of Woolwich Township and to comply with N.J.A.C.
7:15-5.25(g)3, which requires municipalities to adopt an ordinance that
prevents new disturbance for projects or activities in riparian zones as
described herein. Compliance with the riparian zone requirements of this
chapter does not constitute compliance with the riparian zone or buffer
requirements imposed under any other federal, state or local statute,
regulation or ordinance. Further, nothing contained in this chapter shall
supersede the protections afforded to landowners under the state's Right
to Farm Act (N.J.S.A. 4:1C-1 et seq.) and the Township's Right To Farm
Ordinance (§ 203-18 of the Woolwich Township Municipal Code).

ARTICLE I
Required Connection of Septic Systems to Sanitary Sewers in
Adopted Sewer Service Area
[Adopted 4-2-2012 by Ord. No. 2012-08]
§ 148-1. Purpose.
In areas where public sanitary sewers are not physically available and
operational, but are intended to be the means of wastewater management
according to the adopted Water Quality Management Plan (WMP)
applicable to an area, interim use of individual subsurface sewage disposal
systems (ISSDSs) by existing and proposed development is allowed.
However, at such time as the sanitary sewers are made available and
operational, connection of buildings or structures served by an ISSDS to the
sewers is required in accordance with this article.
§ 148-2. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
ADOPTED SEWER SERVICE AREA  The area designated in the applicable
adopted Water Quality Management Plan (WMP), as updated by
modifications adopted in accordance with the Water Quality Management
Planning Rules at N.J.A.C. 7:15, within which wastewater that is generated
is to be conveyed to the wastewater treatment facility associated with the
sewer service area.
INDIVIDUAL SUBSURFACE SEWAGE DISPOSAL SYSTEM or ISSDS  A
system for the disposal of less than or equal to 2,000 gallons per day of
sanitary sewage into the ground. Typically such systems are designed and
constructed to treat sanitary sewage in a manner that will retain most of
the settleable solids in a septic tank and discharge the liquid effluent to a
disposal field, but similar designs are also included (for example, those that
include seepage tanks or pits for effluent disposal and cesspools that may
have been constructed prior to current codes).
SANITARY SEWAGE  Any wastes, including wastes from humans,
households, commercial establishments and industries, that are discharged
to or otherwise enter a domestic treatment works.
§ 148-3. Connection required.
Except as otherwise provided in this article, an owner of a building or
structure equipped with an ISSDS located on a property abutting any street
or sewerage easement in which a gravity sanitary sewer line is operation
and available shall promptly connect thereto in a manner complying with
the applicable state regulations and Township ordinances, and cause all
sewage on such premises to be discharged into said sanitary sewer,
provided that the building or structure is located within the adopted sewer
§ 148-1 LITTERING § 148-3
125:301
service area of the wastewater treatment facility to which the sanitary
sewer line is connected and use of the ISSDS is discontinued.
§ 148-4. Exceptions.
This article shall not apply to buildings or structures for which a sanitary
sewer line is considered not to be available in accordance with N.J.A.C.
7:9A-1.6(e), as amended or supplemented, or is not operational in
accordance with a valid treatment works approval. Sanitary sewers which
are considered not available or not operational for the purposes of this
article include:
§ 148-5. Time limit for connection.
Such connection shall be accomplished on or before the expiration of 90
days following the date the sanitary sewer line becomes available and
operational or the effective date of this article, whichever should occur
later.
§ 148-6. Pumping and filling of septic tank upon connection to
sanitary sewer.
Upon connecting to the sanitary sewer, the ISSDS shall be pumped and
all its contents removed by a licensed septic cleaner. The lid of the septic
tank and/or cesspool shall then be broken or removed and the tank and/or
cesspool backfilled with clean fill.
§ 148-7. Violations and penalties.
In the event of noncompliance with the terms of this article, the Township
Health Official or Zoning Officer is authorized to order such connection by
written notice signed by the Zoning Officer or Health Official and served
A. Those connections to the sanitary sewer line that cannot be
accomplished without requiring the installation of a pumping station;
blasting of bedrock; the acquisition of an easement or right-of-way to
cross an adjoining property; or the crossing of a watercourse, railway,
major highway or other significant obstacle;
B. Where the sanitary sewer line is located 100 feet or more from the
building or structure to be served;
C. Where the sanitary sewer has received a Stage II "construction only"
treatment works approval in accordance with N.J.A.C. 7:14A-22.9 and
has not yet received a Stage III treatment works approval, which is an
approval to operate the treatment works in accordance with N.J.A.C.
7:14A-22.10, until such time as the Stage III treatment works approval
is approved; or
D. Where the sanitary sewer line or receiving sewage treatment plant is
subject to a sewer connection ban in accordance with N.J.A.C.
7:14A-22.17, until such time as the sewer connection ban is lifted.

ARTICLE II
Maintenance of Individual Subsurface Sewage Disposal Systems
[Adopted 4-2-2012 by Ord. No. 2012-09]
§ 148-8. Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to help protect public health and safety,
water quality and the general welfare by requiring the proper operation and
maintenance of individual subsurface sewage disposal systems (ISSDSs)
in Woolwich Township. Further, it is intended to comply with N.J.A.C.
7:15-5.25(e).
§ 148-9. Background.
ISSDSs that are not properly maintained can contaminate both
groundwater and surface water, creating health risks to humans and
impairing natural ecosystems. Regularly pumping out the accumulated
solids and liquids from an ISSDS before they interfere with proper function
is the single most-effective means to maintain an ISSDS in good working
order and to extend its effective life. Therefore, regular pumpouts are a key
means to protect the surrounding environment as well as public health and
welfare from the effects of a failed system.
§ 148-10. Applicability.
This article is applicable to all ISSDSs, both existing and newly installed,
within the Township of Woolwich.
§ 148-11. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
ACTING AUTHORITY  The office, agency, or other entity responsible for
the implementation of this article, namely the Township Health Official or
Zoning Officer.
INDIVIDUAL SUBSURFACE SEWAGE DISPOSAL SYSTEM or ISSDS  A
system for the disposal of less than or equal to 2,000 gallons per day of
sanitary sewage into the ground. Such systems are generally designed and
constructed to treat sanitary sewage in a manner that will retain most of
the settleable solids in a tank and discharge the liquid effluent to a disposal
field. Existing systems with other designs (some no longer permitted to be
used), such as cesspools or those that dispose of effluent through seepage
pits, are also included. This term refers to both systems that serve an
individual residence as well as on-site subsurface sewage disposal systems
serving a property other than a single-family home (such as commercial
buildings, food establishments, commercial/residential mixed uses, and
systems serving multiple units) with an engineering flow of less than or
equal to 2,000 gallons per day, including but not limited to those systems
identified in N.J.A.C. 7:9A-1.8(a)2.

LICENSED HEALTH OFFICER  An individual granted a license by the
Public Health Licensing and Examination Board of the New Jersey
Department of Health and Senior Services.
LICENSED ISSDS INSTALLER  An industry professional that meets a set
of established criteria and is deemed qualified to construct, install or alter
individual subsurface sewage disposal systems by the acting authority or its
designee.
LICENSED PROFESSIONAL ENGINEER  An engineer licensed by the
New Jersey State Board of Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors to
practice the profession of engineering.
MAINTENANCE  Pumping out by a qualified service provider, as
determined by the acting authority, the accumulated solids and liquids
retained in an ISSDS, as well as servicing as necessary to restore an ISSDS
to good working order.
NJDEP-REGISTERED ISSDS SERVICE PROVIDER  An industry
professional that has completed the on-site wastewater treatment system
professionals voluntary registration form and filed it with the Department's
Bureau of Nonpoint Pollution Control.
OWNER  Any person or other entity that has legal title to property.
PROPERTY  Either of the following that is served by an ISSDS:
REGISTERED ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SPECIALIST  An individual
granted a license by the Public Health Licensing and Examination Board of
the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services.
SANITARY SEWAGE  Any wastes, including wastes from humans,
households, commercial establishments, and/or equivalent water-carried
wastes of human origin from industries, that are discharged to an ISSDS.
§ 148-12. Inventory records.
The Woolwich Township Board of Health, or its designee, shall maintain a
database identifying each ISSDS in active use within Woolwich Township.
The database shall include for each ISSDS the parcel block and lot and
address of the property where the ISSDS is located, the name and address
of the property owner, a description of system size, type and location on
the property, and the pumpout status according to the required pumpout
schedule set forth in § 148-13. Owners of properties served by ISSDSs are
required to cooperate in the initial development and continuing update
of the database, which may be developed in phases, as set forth below
and in § 148-13. Property owners with an ISSDS are required to submit
A. A single lot as defined by municipal lot and block; or

a registration form with the required information to the Township and to
obtain a permit, with an associated fee of $3, for the ISSDS. The purpose
is to complete the initial database prior to the deadline for submitting the
six-year WMP update required at N.J.A.C. 7:15-5.23(a). A phased system
may consist of initially populating the database with those systems already
known pursuant to N.J.A.C. 7:9a-3.5, which requires a permit to construct,
install, or alter an individual or nonindividual subsurface sewage disposal
system. For the remaining existing systems, there shall be a presumption
that a property is served by an ISSDS unless demonstration is made by the
property owner that a sewer hookup exists.
§ 148-13. Routine ISSDS maintenance.
A. The owner of a property served by an ISSDS must cause the ISSDS to
be pumped out by an ISSDS service provider in accordance with the
applicable schedule. Documentation of compliance shall be submitted
within 60 days to Health Official or designee in the form of a receipt
from the ISSDS service provider for the service indicating the property
location, service type(s) provided and date of service.
(1) Except as provided in Subsection A(2), each ISSDS shall be
pumped out every three years following the initial scheduled
pumpout, as set forth in Subsection C, unless an alternative
schedule is identified by the acting authority, as set forth in
Subsection B.
(2) In lieu of a pumpout, the property owner may submit a septic
system inspection report to the Health Official or designee, on a
form provided by the acting authority, indicating that the system is
not in need of pumping and is in good working order. In this case,
the pumpout schedule will be shifted forward by one year. Said
form shall be prepared, completed and certified by one of the
following:
(a) Licensed ISSDS installer;
(b) NJDEP - registered ISSDS service provider;
(c) Licensed professional engineer;
(d) Licensed health officer or registered environmental health
specialist; or
(e) Other person acceptable to the acting authority.
B. Modifications to term of scheduled maintenance. The acting authority
may, on its own motion, upon notice and opportunity to the property
owner for a hearing, or upon application for a modified schedule by a
property owner, alter the time period for scheduled maintenance. The
acting authority may consider the factors, including but not limited to
those listed below, in determining that a different pumping schedule
applies:

maintenance of on-tract improvements:
(1) Performance guaranty; review of improvements by Municipal
Engineer.
(a) The furnishing of a performance guaranty in favor of the
municipality in an amount not to exceed 120% of the cost of
installation for improvements it may deem necessary or
appropriate, including streets, grading, pavement, gutters,
curbs, sidewalks, streetlighting, shade trees, surveyor's
monuments, as shown on the final map and required by the
Map Filing Law, P.L. 1960, c. 141 (N.J.S.A. 46:23-9.9 et seq.),
water mains, culverts, storm sewers, sanitary sewers or other
means of sewage disposal, drainage structures, erosion control
and sedimentation control devices, public improvements of
open space and other on-site improvements and landscaping,
provided that no more than 10% of the total performance
guaranty shall be required to be in cash, and the balance may
be in the form of a bond from a bonding company or other
security approved by the Township Committee.
(b) The Municipal Engineer shall review the improvements
required by the reviewing board which are to be bonded and
itemize their cost. Said itemization shall be the basis for
determining the amount of the performance guaranty and
§ 149-23 WOOLWICH CODE § 149-25
125:330
maintenance guaranty required by the reviewing board. The
Municipal Engineer shall forward his estimate of the cost of
improvements to the applicant within 30 days of the date of
receipt of a request sent by certified mail for said estimate.
(2) The furnishing of a maintenance guaranty to be posted with the
governing body for a period not to exceed two years after final
acceptance of the improvement, in an amount not to exceed 15% of
the cost of the improvement. In the event that other governmental
agencies or public utilities automatically will own the utilities to be
installed or the improvements are covered by performance or
maintenance guaranty to another governmental agency, no
performance or maintenance guaranty, as the case may be, shall be
required for such utilities or improvements.
B. The amount of any performance guaranty may be reduced by the
Township Committee, by resolution, when portions of the improvements
have been certified by the Municipal Engineer to have been completed.
The time allowed for installation of the improvements for which the
performance guaranty has been provided may be extended by the
Township Committee by resolution.
C. If the required improvements are not completed or corrected in
accordance with the performance guaranty, the obligor and surety, if
any, shall be liable thereon to the municipality for the reasonable cost of
the improvements not completed or corrected, and the municipality
may, either prior to or after the receipt of the proceeds thereof,
complete such improvement.
D. When all of the required improvements have been completed, the
obligor shall notify the Township Committee in writing, by certified mail
addressed in care of the Municipal Clerk, of the completion of said
improvements and shall send a copy thereof to the Municipal Engineer.
Thereupon the Municipal Engineer shall inspect all of the
improvements and shall file a detailed report, in writing, with the
Township Committee, indicating either approval, partial approval or
rejection of the improvements with a statement of reasons for any
rejection. If partial approval is indicated, the cost of the improvements
rejected shall be set forth.
E. The governing body shall either approve, partially approve or reject the
improvements, on the basis of the report of the Municipal Engineer and
shall notify the obligor in writing, by certified mail, of the contents of
said report and the action of said reviewing board with relation thereto,
not later than 65 days after receipt of the notice from the obligor of the
completion of the improvements. Where partial approval is granted, the
obligor shall be released from all liability pursuant to its performance
guaranty, except for that portion adequately sufficient to secure
provision of the improvements not yet approved. Failure of the
Township Committee to send or provide such notification to the obligor
within 65 days shall be deemed to constitute approval of the

improvements, and the obligor and surety, if any, shall be released from
all liability, pursuant to such performance guaranty.
F. If any portion of the required improvements is rejected, the reviewing
board may require the obligor to complete such improvements, and,
upon completion, the same procedure of notification, as set forth in this
section shall be followed.
G. Nothing herein, however, shall be construed to limit the right of the
obligor to contest by legal proceeding any determination of the
governing body or the Municipal Engineer.
H. The obligor shall reimburse the municipality for all reasonable
inspection fees paid to the Municipal Engineer for the foregoing
inspection of improvements.
A. Final approval for site plan approval involving residential housing shall
be conditioned upon the applicant furnishing final development plans to
both the Swedesboro-Woolwich School District and the Kingsway
Regional School District. Said plans shall include the following:
(1) Plot plan showing all lots and number of lots contained therein.

agreement between the Township Committee and the developer. Said
cost shall be charged to the developer pro rata as the percentage of his
land developed and so served. In the absence of such an agreement the
provisions of Article VII of this chapter shall apply.
O. Railroad rights-of-way and limited access highways where so located as
to affect the subdivision or development of adjoining lands shall be
treated as follows:
(1) In residential districts, a buffer strip at least 25 feet in depth, in
addition to the normal depth of the lot required in the district, shall
be provided adjacent to the railroad right-of-way or limited access
highway. This strip shall be part of the development and shall be
designated on the plan: "This strip is reserved for screening. The
placement of a structure hereon is prohibited."

nearest street extending parallel or approximately parallel to the
railroad shall, wherever practicable, be at a sufficient distance
therefrom to ensure suitable depth for commercial or industrial
sites.
(3) Streets parallel to the railroad when intersecting a street which
crosses the railroad at grade shall, to the extent practicable, be at a
distance of at least 150 feet from the railroad right-of-way. Such

deceleration lanes shall be subject to approval by the Municipal
Engineer.
J. Arterial streets shall be directly intersected only by other arterial
streets or by collector streets.
K. Where any arterial or collector street intersects an arterial or collector
street, the right-of-way requirements shall be adequate to
accommodate deceleration lanes as approved by the Municipal
Engineer.

125:344
§ 149-44. Sight distance at intersections.
In addition to the right-of-way widths required in accordance with this
chapter, clear-sight triangle easements shall be dedicated as follows:
§ 149-45. Access.
A. The area bounded by the right-of-way lines and a straight line
connecting sight points on street center lines shall be as follows:
(1) From a point on the minor (stop control) road center line at least 20

D. No earth bank, hedge, fence, shrub or wall higher than 2.5 feet above
(proposed or existing) curb level, nor any obstruction to vision, other
than a post or tree not exceeding one square foot in cross-sectional
area, shall be permitted to remain within the clear-sight triangle.
A. When developments result in lots abutting a primary or secondary
arterial street, a service road shall be provided, or the frontage shall be
reversed so that the lots contiguous to such arterial street will front on
an internal street with no direct access to the arterial.
B. Screening through the use of appropriate plant materials, fences or
walls subject to site plan review shall be provided in a strip of land
along the rear property line of lots with reverse frontage to buffer lots
from the arterial street.

development shall be provided by the developer.
D. Where developments abut an arterial street and service roads or
reverse frontage is provided, the improvements to the arterial shall be
limited to the following: The additional right-of-way or easement for the
arterial street shall be uniformly graded to a minimum slope of 1/4 inch
to the foot toward the pavement of the arterial. Topsoil at a minimum
depth of four inches shall be uniformly distributed over the graded area
and the area seeded with a perennial grass seed or other suitable
vegetation approved by the Planning Board.
§ 149-44 LITTERING § 149-45
125:345
§ 149-46. Cul-de-sac streets.
E. Curbs shall be provided for a distance of 200 feet from the curb return
on each side of any new street which connects with an arterial street.
F. Where a development results in lots with frontage on a primary or
secondary arterial street that, due to its size, shape or other peculiar or
unusual circumstances, makes the provision of a service road or
reverse frontage impractical or unnecessary, the lot or lots in said
development shall have driveways so laid out that it is possible to turn
passenger vehicles on the lot, and it is not necessary to back any
passenger vehicle into the street.
G. No development containing reserve strips controlling access to streets
shall be approved, except where the control and disposal of land
comprising such strips has been placed in the township under
conditions approved by the Planning Board.
H. The creation of reserve strips shall not be permitted adjacent to a
proposed street in such a manner as to deny access from adjacent
property to such street.
I. Private driveways on corner lots shall be located at least 40 feet from
the point of intersection of the nearest street right-of-way lines.
J. In order to provide a safe and convenient means of access from the
street, grades on private driveways located within a street right-of-way
should not exceed 10%.

A. The maximum length of a cul-de-sac shall be 600 feet to the turning
circle, except that this distance shall be increased to 800 feet if an
emergency vehicular access and pedestrian walkway at least 10 feet
wide is provided from the head of a cul-de-sac giving direct access to an
adjacent street, and provided that the cul-de-sac serves no more than
25 dwelling units or an equivalent traffic-generating use.
B. Culs-de-sac shall have a turnaround at a radius of 40 feet to the outside
edge of the paved cartway, exclusive of any parking area, and 50 feet to
the outside edge of the right-of-way. The length of the cul-de-sac shall
be measured along its center line from the center section with the
intersecting street center line to the center of the radius of the cul-desac.
C. Culs-de-sac shall be readily identifiable as such by traffic moving on the
collector street to which it is connected, such as by Court or Circle
names. Culs-de-sac shall not be located so as to appear to terminate
collector streets.

the turnaround or with a minimum radius to the outer pavement edge
of 50 feet if parking is permitted on the turnaround.
C. Service street intersections and sharp changes in alignment shall be
avoided, but if necessary, then corners shall be rounded or cut back
sufficiently to permit safe vehicular circulation.
A. Sidewalks shall be included within the dedicated nonpavement right-ofway
of all streets as shown in the following table:
Nature of Road Residential
Nonresidential,
Business or
Industrial
Local road Both sides 4 feet wide Both sides 5 feet wide
Collector road Both sides 4 feet wide Both sides 5 feet wide
Secondary arterial Both sides 4 feet wide Both sides 5 feet wide
Primary arterial Both sides 4 feet wide Both sides 5 feet wide
B. Sidewalk requirements may be revised or waived by the Planning Board
during site plan review if demonstrated as creating reasonable
alternative sidewalk configurations. Imaginative and innovative
configurations are to be encouraged by the Planning Board.
C. Concrete curbs are required for all roads. They shall be of a design
acceptable to the Planning Board upon recommendation of the
Municipal Engineer.
D. Sidewalks constructed of four-inch thick concrete or equivalent shall be
improved as required in § 149-29 of this chapter. A median strip of
grassed or landscaped areas shall separate all sidewalks from adjacent

from the roads to schools, parks, playgrounds or other nearby roads,
perpetual unobstructed easements at least 10 feet in width. Easements
shall be indicated on the site plan.
A. Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two tiers of lots of
appropriate depths. Exceptions to this prescribed block width shall be
permitted in blocks adjacent to major streets, railroads or waterways.
B. The lengths, widths and shapes of blocks shall be such as are
appropriate for the locality and the type of development contemplated.
C. Wherever practicable, blocks along major arterials shall be not less
than 1,000 feet in length.
§ 149-48 WOOLWICH CODE § 149-50
125:348
§ 149-51. Lots.
D. In long blocks, the Planning Board may require the reservation of an
easement through the block to accommodate utilities, drainage
facilities or pedestrian traffic.
E. Pedestrianways or crosswalks, not less than 10 feet wide, may be
required by the Planning Board through the center of blocks more than
800 feet long where deemed essential to provide circulation or access
to schools, playgrounds, shopping centers, transportation or other
community facilities.
F. Blocks designed for industrial uses shall be of such length and width as
may be determined suitable by the Planning Board for the prospective
use.
A. The size, shape and orientation of lots shall conform with Chapter 203,
Zoning, and shall be appropriate for the type of development and use
contemplated.
B. Where lots are more than double the minimum required areas for the
zoning district, the Planning Board may require that such lots be
arranged so as to allow further development and the opening of future
streets where they would be necessary to serve such potential lots, all
in compliance with Chapter 203, Zoning, and these regulations.
C. If feasible, side lot lines shall be at right angles to straight street lines
or radial to curved street lines.
D. If feasible, lot lines shall follow municipal boundaries rather than cross
them in order to avoid interjurisdictional problems.
E. Generally, the depth of a residential lot for a single-family detached
home shall not be less than one nor more than 2 1/2 times its width.
F. Depth and width of parcels intended for nonresidential uses shall be
adequate for the use proposed and sufficient to provide satisfactory
space for on-site parking, loading and unloading, setbacks and
landscaping.
G. Such lot must front upon a public or private street approved in
accordance with the requirements and standards of this chapter.
Private streets shall have direct access to public streets.
H. Double frontage and reverse frontage lots shall be avoided, except
where necessary to provide separation of residential development from
traffic arterials or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography
and orientation.
I. Lots shall not, in general, derive access exclusively from an arterial
street. Where driveway access from an arterial street may be necessary
for several adjoining lots, the Planning Board may require that such lots
§ 149-50 LITTERING § 149-51
125:349
§ 149-52. Buffer areas.
In the instance where the Planning Board determines that buffer planting
or fencing is necessary to protect the general welfare of the public, planted
buffer areas shall be installed to provide a year-round visual screen of such
width, height and location as approved by the Planning Board. The size,
variety and planting design of the buffer area shall be as approved by the
Township Planning Board. Fencing shall be installed to provide a physical
barrier, as approved by the Planning Board.
§ 149-53. Storm drainage.
be served by a combined access drive in order to limit possible traffic
hazard on such street.
J. Where there is a question as to the suitability of a lot or lots for their
intended use due to factors such as rock formations, flood conditions or
similar circumstances, the Planning Board may, after adequate
investigation, withhold approval of such lots.
A. Storm sewers, culverts, natural and man-made drainage channels and
retention basins and related installations shall be provided as necessary
to permit unimpeded flow of natural watercourses, to ensure adequate
drainage of all low points along streets, to intercept stormwater runoff
along streets at intervals related to the extent and grade of the area
drained and to provide positive drainage away from on-site sewage
disposal facilities where such facilities are permitted.
B. Where existing storm sewers are reasonably accessible, proposed
developments shall be required, if necessary, to connect therewith.
C. In developments containing lots less than 15,000 square feet in area
and in business and industrial districts, underground storm sewer
systems shall be constructed throughout the development and be
conducted to an approved outfall.
D. Permanent natural and/or man-made drainage channels and detention
basins shall be provided to control the increased storm runoff that may
result from increasing the impervious area within the development. In
all instances the detention shall be such as to reduce the rate of runoff
from the ten-percent (so-called ten-year) storm in the developed
condition to that which would have occurred in the undeveloped
condition. In instances where there is no provision for conducting the
water to natural streams, the detention shall be adequate for all of the
runoff from a two-percent (so-called fifty-year) storm. Spillways or
emergency spillways of any detention facility shall be capable of
passing the runoff from at least the one-percent (so-called one-hundredyear)
storm. In the design of storm drainage facilities, special
consideration shall be given to avoidance of problems that may arise
from the concentration of stormwater runoff onto adjacent developed or
undeveloped properties.
§ 149-51 WOOLWICH CODE § 149-53
125:350
E. A culvert or other drainage facility shall in each case be large enough to
accommodate potential runoff from its entire upstream drainage area,
whether inside or outside the development. The Municipal Engineer
shall review the necessary size of the facility, based on the provisions of
construction standards and specifications assuming conditions of
maximum potential watershed development permitted by Chapter 203,
Zoning.
F. The developer shall study the effect of each development on existing
downstream drainage facilities outside the area of the development.
These studies, together with such other studies as shall be appropriate,
shall serve as a guide to needed improvements.
G. Where it is anticipated that the additional runoff incident to the
development will overload an existing downstream drainage facility, the
Planning Board may withhold approval of the development until
provision has been made for the improvement of said potential
conditions by the contribution from the developer in such sum as the
Planning Board shall determine adequate.
H. No development shall be approved unless adequate drainage will be
provided to an adequate drainage watercourse or facility.
I. Where a development is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway,
channel or stream, there shall be provided a drainage easement
conforming substantially with the line of such watercourse,
drainageway, channel or stream at least 15 feet wide or of such width as
will be adequate to preserve the unimpeded flow of natural drainage, or
for the purpose of widening, deepening, relocating, maintaining,
improving or protecting such drainage facilities.
J. Any changes in an existing drainageway shall be subject to the approval
of the Township Planning Board and the Gloucester County Planning
Board, as applicable, as well as meeting the requirements for any state
permits.
K. The applicant shall be required by the Planning Board to carry away by
pipe or open ditch any spring or surface water that may exist either
previous to or as a result of the development. Such drainage facilities
shall be located in the road right-of-way where feasible or in perpetual
unobstructed easements of appropriate width and shall be constructed
in accordance with appropriate construction standards and
specifications and shall be approved by the Municipal Engineer.
L. Trash bars shall be installed on all pipes equal to or greater than 30
inches in diameter.
M. Pipeline design.
(1) Storm sewer pipelines shall be designed by either of the following
two methods. Both shall be based on the Manning equation and
shall utilize the following friction factors:
§ 149-53 LITTERING § 149-53
125:351
n = 0.015 concrete pipe
n = 0.021 corrugated metal pipe
(2) The n value for other materials may be approved by the Planning
Board after recommendation by the Municipal Engineer.
(3) The minimum allowable pipe size is 15 inches.
(4) The minimum allowable velocity is 2.5 feet per second when
flowing 1/4 full.
(5) The maximum velocity is 10 feet per second with the pipe flowing
full.
N. Pipeline submerged.
(1) This method is based on the assumption that when the storm sewer
system is under maximum load the hydraulic gradient will be at or
above the crown of the pipe and that flow in the lines will be
controlled by head differentials between structures or other
locations where the system is open to the ground surface, such as
inlets or outlets, manholes and stream inlets or outlets. The head of
water above the crown of any pipe can range from zero feet to a
point which will not cause surface flooding.
(2) The slope of the hydraulic gradient in any section of storm sewer
between opening to the surface shall be calculated on the
assumption that the pipe is flowing full at a constant velocity and at
the required capacity.
(3) The elevation of the hydraulic gradient at any point in the pipe shall
be no lower than the crown of the pipe and no higher than the
surface of the ground.
(4) At all structures such as manholes, inlets, etc., where the pipe size
does not change, the elevation of the hydraulic gradient shall be
dropped 0.2 feet to allow for losses therein. Where the inlet and
outlet pipe sizes are not the same, the elevation of the hydraulic
gradient shall be dropped an amount based on the following
formula:
H = 0.21 feet + 0.8 (D2-D1) feet
D1 = Diameter of inlet pipe
D2 = Diameter of outlet pipe
If D1 is larger than D2, head loss = 0.2 feet
O. Pipeline flowing full.
(1) This method is based on the assumption that the hydraulic gradient
will match the inside top of the pipe when the system is under
maximum hydraulic load.
§ 149-53 WOOLWICH CODE § 149-53
125:352
(2) For this method, head losses through manholes, inlets, etc., shall be
ignored.
(3) When the pipe sizes change, the inside tops of the pipes shall be
matched.
(4) Continuous profiles for each reach of pipe shall be plotted along
with the location of the hydraulic gradient and the hydraulic
information pertinent to each reach within the system. This
information shall include the pipe size and type, the "n" factor, the
slope of the hydraulic gradient, slope of the pipe, the design
capacity and the velocity at the design capacity.
P. Inlet design.
(1) Stormwater inlets shall be equal to New Jersey State Highway
Department inlet Type B. The maximum collecting capacities of the
inlets shall be considered to be:
(a) When installed on streets where the grade is 1.00%: five cubic
foot per second.
(b) When installed on streets where the grade is 2.00%: 4.8 cubic
foot per second.
(c) When installed on streets where the grade is 3.00%: 4.6 cubic
foot per second.
(d) When installed on streets where the grade is 4.00%: 4.4 cubic
foot per second.
(e) When installed on streets where the grade is 5.00%: 4.2 cubic
foot per second.
(f) When installed on streets where the grade is 6.00%: 4 cubic
foot per second.
(2) Sufficient inlets shall be located and constructed so that the length
of surface runoff will not contribute a runoff to the inlet exceeding
the preceding designated collecting capacities.
(3) The gutter grate of all inlets shall be set not less than two inches
nor more than four inches below the gutter grade. The surface of
the paving adjacent to the inlets shall be constructed to blend into
the lowered gutter grade at the inlet in such a manner that a
sudden drop-off or dip at the inlet will not be created. At such
locations where drainage is entirely dependent on inlets, the
collecting capacities of the inlets shall be designed for 1/2 of the
preceding considered capacities.
(4) Where surface water is collected from two directions at one street
corner, inlets shall be placed at or near the tangent points of both
§ 149-53 LITTERING § 149-53
125:353
ends of the radius. The use of one inlet in the radius will not be
allowed.
(5) Access manholes shall be spaced at five-hundred-foot intervals
(maximum) through rights-of-way and at sewer junctions where
there are no catch basins.
Q. Open channel design. Open channel design should be based on the
following hydraulic considerations:
(1) Manning's equation:
(a) Friction factor.
n = .015 - best concrete-lined ditch
n = .025 - best unlined ditch
n = .03 to .15 - fair to poor natural streams and watercourses
(b) Velocity range.
Excavation Material
Velocity
(feet per second)
Fine sand and firm loam 2.50 to 3.5
Stiff clay and hardpan 3.75 to 6.0
Concrete lined ditch 15
(2) Ample freeboard should be provided on all channels.
(3) The channel should be designed to conform, wherever possible, to
the adjacent ground conditions. This means that it should not be
projecting excessively above the surrounding ground or placed
excessively below the surrounding ground.
(4) Continuous profiles for each reach of open channel shall be plotted,
along with the adjacent average ground and the hydraulic
information pertinent to each reach within the system. This
information shall include the type of channel lining, the "n" factor,
the width of the channel bottom, the side slopes and methods of
their stabilization, the water depth, the design capacity and the
velocity at the design capacity.
(5) Open channels shall have a maximum side slope of 3 to 1 and shall

downstream, provisions of the following Subsection Q(8) through
(14) will apply and will be required.
(8) Determination of project area runoff:
(a) Use natural runoff coefficient.
(b) Use ultimate developed runoff coefficient.
(9) Storage is required for a five-and-five-tenths-inch maximum rainfall
(twenty-four-hour rainfall occurring in 1960) to reduce the runoff in
the developed condition to that which occurred in the undeveloped
condition, or as required by New Jersey Water Policy and Supply
Council.
(10) Indicate flooded area if an additional two-inch rainfall occurred
during the 24 hours following the design storm.
(11) Allowance for percolation and evaporation out of basins during and

rules and regulations established by the Department of Environmental
Protection of the State of New Jersey and Woolwich Township, as
amended and revised.
B. Necessary action shall be taken by the applicant to extend or create a
water supply district for the purpose of providing a water supply system
capable of providing domestic water and fire protection.
C. Where a public water main is accessible, the developer shall install
adequate water facilities (including fire hydrants) subject to the
specifications of the state or township and the National Board of Fire
Underwriters. All water mains shall be at least six inches in diameter.
Fire hydrants must be compatible with local fire company equipment
and be approved by the Township Fire Marshal.
D. Water main extensions shall be approved by the officially designated
agency of the state and township.
E. To facilitate the above, the location of all fire hydrants, all water supply
improvements and the boundary lines of proposed districts, indicating
all improvements proposed to be served, shall be shown on the site
plan, and the cost of installing same shall be included in the
performance guaranty to be furnished by the developer.

if a public water system is not available, individual wells may be used or
a central water system provided in such a manner that an adequate
supply of potable water will be available to every lot in the
development. Water samples shall be submitted to the Health
Department for its approval, and individual wells and central water
systems shall be approved by the appropriate health authorities. Orders
of approval shall be submitted to the Planning Board.
G. If the Planning Board requires that a connection to a public water main
be eventually provided as a condition to approval of an individual well
or central water system, the developer shall make arrangements for
future water service at the time the plan receives final approval.
Performance guaranties or cash bonds may be required to insure
compliance.
H. Fire hydrants shall be required for all developments serviced by a
public water system.

125:362
§ 149-57. Public open space and community facilities.
shall be limited to approximately 25. The Fire Department must be
notified of shut downs during improvements or connections to the
system.
K. A copy of the approval of such fire hydrant installations by the
appropriate public agency and utility company shall be submitted with
the site plan, along with a suitable agreement (in a form determined by
the Township Attorney) establishing that the ownership of the fire
hydrants shall be conveyed to the township at no cost to the township at
the time the fire hydrants are first available for their intended use.
L. To eliminate future street openings, all underground utilities for fire
hydrants, together with the fire hydrants themselves and all other
supply improvements, shall be installed before any final paving of a
street shown on the site plan.
A. In reviewing developments, the Planning Board shall consider whether
community facilities in the area, especially schools, are adequate to
serve the needs of the additional dwellings proposed by the developer
and shall make such report thereon as it deems necessary in the public
interest. The applicant should provide a brief impact statement for
review by the Board.
B. Developers shall reserve land for both public and quasi-public
community facilities and will reserve areas for facilities normally
required in residential neighborhoods, including churches, libraries,
schools and other public buildings and parks, playgrounds and
playfields.
C. Areas provided or reserved for such community facilities should be
suitably prepared to provide for such use. Prior to the preparation of
plans, developers of large tracts should review with the Planning Board
the minimum standards for various community facilities applicable to
the tract being developed.
D. In developments that are intended to contain more than 50 dwelling
units, the Planning Board shall consider the need for suitable open
areas for recreation and shall make a recommendation thereon.
Standards to be used by the Planning Board in determining space for
recreation shall be as follows: [Amended 3-15-1999 by Ord. No.
99-6]
Dwelling Units
Minimum Playground and
Neighborhood Park Acreage to
be Recommended
50 to 100 2.5 to 3.5
101 to 200 3.5 to 5.0
201 to 400 5.0 to 7.0
§ 149-56 LITTERING § 149-57
125:363
Dwelling Units
Minimum Playground and
Neighborhood Park Acreage to
be Recommended
For each additional 100 units 1.0 to 2.0
E. An individual area of less than two acres shall not be reserved for
recreation purposes if it will be impractical or impossible to secure
additional lands in order to increase its area unless such smaller area is
approved by the Planning Board, as for example, to provide a tot-lot.
F. Land reserved for recreation purposes shall be of a character and
location suitable for use as a playground, playfield or for other
recreation purposes and shall be relatively level and dry and shall be
improved by the developer to the standards required by the Planning
Board, which improvements shall be included in the performance
guaranty.
G. Reservation of public areas.
(1) If the Master Plan or the Official Map provides for the reservation
of designated streets, public drainageways, flood-control basins or
public areas within the proposed development, before approving a
subdivision or site plan, the Planning Board may further require
that such streets, ways, basins or areas be shown on the plat in
locations and sizes suitable to their intended uses. The Planning
Board may reserve the location and extent of such streets, ways,
basins or areas shown on the plat for a period of one year after the
approval of the final plat or within such further time as may be
agreed to by the developer. Unless during such period or extension
thereof the municipality shall have entered into a contract to
purchase or institute condemnation proceedings according to law
for the fee or a lesser interest in the land comprising such streets,
ways, basins or areas, the developer shall not be bound by such
reservations shown on the plat and may proceed to use such land
for private use in accordance with applicable development
regulations. The provisions of this section shall not apply to streets
and roads, flood-control basins or public drainageways
necessitated by the subdivision or land development and required
for final approval.
(2) The developer shall be entitled to just compensation for actual loss
found to be caused by such temporary reservation and deprivation
of use. In such instance, unless a lesser amount has previously been
mutually agreed upon, just compensation shall be deemed to be the
fair market value of an option to purchase the land reserved for the
period of reservation, provided that determination of such fair
market value shall include but not be limited to consideration of the
real property taxes apportioned to the land reserved and prorated
for the period of reservation. The developer shall be compensated
for the reasonable increased cost of legal, engineering or other
§ 149-57 WOOLWICH CODE § 149-57
125:364
professional services incurred in connection with obtaining
subdivision approval or site plan approval, as the case may be,
caused by the reservation. The procedure for the payment of all
compensation payable under this section shall be as follows:
(a) After the termination of a period of one year after the approval
of the site plan or after such further time as may be agreed to
between the developer and the Planning Board, and no later
than 90 days thereafter, the developer shall file in triplicate
with the Township Clerk a verified petition requesting
compensation payable under this section and setting forth a
detailed, itemized list with separate dollar amounts for each
item for which he seeks compensation.
(b) The governing body, after receipt of such petition, shall fix a
time, place and date for a public hearing on the petition, which
date shall be no later than 60 days from the date of receipt of
the petition by the Municipal Clerk.
(c) Notice of such hearing shall be delivered or mailed by certified
mail to the developer at least 20 days in advance of the hearing
date.
(d) The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the
provisions for hearing by N.J.S.A. 40:55D-10.
(e) At the hearing the developer shall have the burden of
establishing by good and sufficient evidence his entitlement to
compensation and the amounts of such compensation.
(f) Such hearings may be continued by the governing body from
time to time but must be completed within 90 days from the
first hearing date.
(g) Within 90 days after the date of conclusion of hearing, the
Township Committee shall, by resolution, set forth its findings
and determination as to what amount, if any, shall be paid to
the developer. A certified copy of said resolution shall be
delivered or mailed by certified mail to the developer within 10
days of its adoption.
(h) Any payments to be made pursuant to such resolution shall be
made to the developer within 120 days from the date of
adoption of such resolution.
H. Recreational facilities for future residential population. [Added
9-16-1996 by Ord. No. 96-13]
(1) All lands set aside for open space shall be developed with active
and passive recreational facilities to service the needs of the future
residential population. The Planning Board shall have complete and
final determination as to the adequacy, usefulness and
§ 149-57 LITTERING § 149-57
125:365
functionalism of the lands set aside for open spaces. Active and
passive recreational facilities shall include but not be limited to
the following: ball fields, multipurpose fields, tennis courts,
multipurpose court areas, children's playground equipment,
passive picnic or sitting areas, swimming pools, bicycle baths and
jogging trails.
(2) The following shall be used as the basis for determining the
recreation need. Population shall be calculated using 3.6 persons
per single-family detached unit, 2.6 persons per single-family
attached or two-family unit and 2.5 persons per multifamily unit.
Recreational Facilities Number/Unit of Population
Basketball 1 per 1,000
Tennis 1 per 2,000
Baseball/softball
Youth 1 per 5,000
Adult 1 per 5,000
Football/soccer 1 per 5,000
Multicourt 1 per 2,000
Tot-lot 1 per 200 (15% of total
population)
Advanced play 1 per 400 (30% of total
population)
Picnic areas 1 per 5,000
(3) The Board may require a developer to make certain site
preparation improvements to the open spaces. These may include
the following:
(a) Removal of dead trees or diseased trees.
(b) Thinning of trees or other growth to encourage more desirable
growth.
(c) Grading and seeding.
(d) Improvements of protection of the natural drainage system by
the use of protective structures, stabilization measures and
similar improvements.
(4) Development of open space and recreational facilities shall proceed
at the same rate as development of the dwelling units. To assure
compliance with this subsection, the Planing Board shall require
the approval of an open space and recreational amenity phasing
map which shall become part of an overall phasing plan and
approval for any subdivision, planned and/or clustered
development.
§ 149-57 WOOLWICH CODE § 149-57
125:366
§ 149-58. Certain easements.
(5) The requirements of this subsection relating to the construction of
active and passive recreation facilities and the total percentage of
open space required within a development may be modified and/or
waived by the Planning Board, if requested by the developer, upon
the Planning Board's determination that both the area local to the
development and Woolwich Township's park and recreation needs
would be better served by an agreed cash request to the designated
parks and recreation budget, which sums shall be added to the
current year municipal budget when received as a dedication by
rider in accordance with the provisions of N.J.S.A. 40A:4-39.
(6) The amount of the contribution required pursuant hereto shall be
determined by the estimated cost of the passive and active
recreation facilities and equipment that would otherwise be
required by the proposed development, which shall also take into
consideration the value of the additional lots that the developer will
have for sale, and shall be prorated over the total number of
building lots, as shown on the preliminary plans submitted by the
applicant and approved by the Planning Board, in order to
determine a per lot amount.
(7) Payment of the contribution required pursuant hereto shall be
made prior to the signing of the final plans by the Planning Board
Chairman, Planning Board Secretary and Township Clerk and shall
be equal to the per-lot amount times the number of building lots
shown on the final plans to be signed and filed and shall be made
payable to the designated Parks and Recreation Fund. For good
cause shown, the Planning Board may enter into an agreement to
provide that the payment or payments shall be made at some later
time, subject to the posting of adequate performance guaranties in
an amount of 120% of the agreed contribution subject, however,
that the delayed period of time shall in no event be later than the
issuance of the first certificate of occupancy.
(8) The cash bequest shall be used exclusively for park and recreation
purposes and shall be placed in the current budget line item
designated "parks and playgrounds, other expenses." Woolwich
Township reserves the right to use said funds for proper purposes
anywhere within the Township of Woolwich.

§ 149-59. Definitions.
For the purposes of this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
OFF TRACT  Not located on the property which is the subject of a site
plan application nor on a contiguous portion of a street or right-of-way.
ON TRACT  Located on the property which is the subject of a site plan
application or on a contiguous portion of a street or right-of-way.
§ 149-60. Responsibility of developer for certain off-site
improvements.
Preliminary approval shall contain a condition that the developer pay his
pro rata share of the cost of providing reasonable and necessary street
improvements and water, sewerage, and drainage facilities, and easements
therefor, located outside the property limits of the site plan but necessitated
or required by construction or improvements within such site plan or
development. Before consideration of a final site plan plat, such off-tract
improvements shall be built and completed by the developer or their
construction shall have been guaranteed in accordance with the following
provisions which shall apply to such off-tract improvements.
§ 149-61. Cost estimates.
A. At the time application for preliminary approval for a site plan is made
and again upon application for final approval, the applicant shall
provide the Township Committee with an estimate of the types and
costs of such off-tract improvements and the amount by which
properties including the site plan benefit thereby.
B. Such estimate at the time of application for final approval shall include
detailed supporting data which shall include but not necessarily be
limited to:
(1) The total cost of the improvement.
(2) The estimated value of the benefit to the applicant.
(3) The estimated value of the benefits conferred upon others in terms
of reasonable likelihood of the use.
(4) The time when such benefits are likely to be conferred.
(5) The reasonable, useful life of the off-tract improvements.

125:369
§ 149-62. Construction of improvements by municipality or
developer; partial reimbursement to developer.
The Township Committee shall decide whether the off-tract improvements
or any combinations of them are to be constructed by the municipality as
a general improvement, as a local improvement, or whether construction
is to be done by the developer with a formula providing for partial
reimbursement to the developer by other property owners, where the
improvements specially benefit properties other than property subject to
the site plan.
§ 149-63. Cash deposit or performance guaranty required; specially
benefited properties.
C. Such estimate at the time of application for preliminary approval shall
be the applicant's best estimates for each of the six above factors,

provide the township with a cash deposit or a performance guaranty as
provided in § 149-2 of this chapter to insure payment to the township in
the following amounts:
(1) An amount equal to the difference between the estimated cost of
the improvement and the estimated total amount by which all
property to be served thereby, including the site plan property, will
be specially benefited by the improvement, if the improvement is to
be constructed by the municipality as a general improvement.
(2) The estimated amount by which the site plan specially benefits
from the improvement, in addition to the amount required for a
general improvement, if the improvement is to be constructed by
the municipality as a local improvement.
(3) An amount equal to the estimated cost of the improvement, if the
improvement is to be constructed by the applicant.
B. If such off-tract improvements or any combination of them are to be
constructed by the applicant, the applicant shall bear the cost of all
such improvements and shall be reimbursed by such specially benefited
property owners, if and when any such off-tract improvements are used
in the development of off-tract parcels. The Township Committee may
assess or lien the pro rata cost of such off-tract improvement upon other
specially benefited property owners at such time as such other specially
benefited owner or owners use the off-tract improvements in the
development of off-tract parcels.
C. Actual cost figures, rather than estimated costs, shall be used for
making such allocations once the improvements are constructed. The
cost figures shall be supplied by the applicant and certified by a New
Jersey certified public accountant, after audit. Approval of planned unit

ARTICLE VIII
Fees; Penalties
§ 149-64. Application fees and escrow deposits. [Amended 7-6-1987
by Ord. No. 87-2; 3-20-1989 by Ord. No. 89-5; 4-5-1993 by Ord. No.
93-2]
A. Application fees and escrow deposits for site plan applications shall be
paid as required in Chapter 95, Fees, Article I, Application Fees and
Escrow Accounts.
B. Procedure. [Added 9-6-1996 by Ord. No. 96-11]
(1) The application fees and escrow fees recited hereinabove as
minimums which must accompany the application. An application
shall not be deemed complete until the application fee and escrow
fee required have been paid. The Planning Board shall exercise its
discretion in establishing the figure required for the escrow fund in
the event the project will require more time for review than has
been provided for by the figures recited hereinabove or the project
is of a nature that is not expressly included in one of the
aforementioned categories.
(2) Application fees and escrow fees must be submitted in separate
checks payable to "Woolwich Township." The escrow fee shall be
forwarded to the Chief Financial Officer of Woolwich Township for
deposit into a developer's escrow account. The application fee shall
be deposited into the Planning Board account until the end of the
month, at which time the moneys in said account shall be submitted
to the Treasurer of Woolwich Township for deposit into the general
account of Woolwich Township.
(3) The escrow fee shall be retained in order to cover the cost of any
professional services rendered to Woolwich Township, the
Woolwich Township Planning Board or the Woolwich Township
Board of Adjustment for review of applications for development,
review and preparation of documents, inspection of improvements
or other purposes permitted pursuant to the provisions of N.J.S.A.
40:55D-1 et seq. All professional charges for review of an
application for development, review and preparation of documents
or inspection of improvements shall be reasonable and necessary,
given the status and progress of the application of construction.
Review fees shall be charged only in connection with an application
for development presently pending before the Planning Board or
Board of Adjustment or upon review of compliance with conditions
of approval or review of requests for modification or amendment
made by the applicant. A professional shall not review items which
are subject to approval by any state governmental agency and not
under municipal jurisdiction except to the extent consultation with
a state agency is necessary due to the effect of state approvals in
the subdivision or site plan. If Woolwich Township, the Woolwich
§ 149-64 LITTERING § 149-64
125:373
Township Planning Board or the Woolwich Township Board of
Adjustment retains a different professional or consultant in the
place of the professional originally responsible for development,
application review or inspection of improvements, the township or
the Planning Board or the Board of Adjustment shall be responsible
for all time and expenses of the new professional to become
familiar with the application or the project, and the township,
Planning Board or Board of Adjustment shall not bill the applicant
or charge the deposit or the escrow account for any such services.
(4) The township shall be reimbursed for all payments to independent
consultants in accordance with N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.2. If the salary,
staff support and overhead for a municipal professional are
provided by the township, the charge shall be the maximum
permitted pursuant to the provisions of N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.2. For
other professionals, the charge shall be at the same rate as all
other work of the same nature by the professional for the township
when fees are not reimbursed or otherwise imposed on applicants
or developers.
(5) All escrow funds shall be utilized by the appropriate Board to pay
the cost of any professional fees incurred by the Board for review
and/or testimony. The term "professional," as used herein, shall
include the services of a duly licensed engineer, surveyor, planner,
attorney, appraiser or other expert who would provide professional
services to ensure that an application complies with the standards
set forth in township ordinances and experts whose testimony may
be solicited to give further information to the approving Board in
any area addressed by any of applicant's experts.
(6) The following closeout procedure shall apply to all deposits and
escrow accounts established under the provisions of P.L. 1975, c.
291 (N.J.S.A. 40:55D-1 et seq.), and shall commence after the
appropriate Board has granted final approval and signed the
subdivision plat or site plan, in the case of application review
escrows and deposits, or after the improvements have been
approved as provided in Section 41 of P.L. 1975, c. 291 (N.J.S.A.
40:55D-53), in the case of improvement inspection escrows and
deposits. The applicant shall send written notice by certified mail to
the Chief Financial Officer of the township, to the approving Board
and to the relevant township professional that the application or
the improvements, as the case may be, are completed. After receipt
of such notice, the professional shall render a final bill to the Chief
Financial Officer within 30 days and shall send a copy
simultaneously to the applicant. The Chief Financial Officer shall
render a written final accounting to the applicant on the uses to
which the deposit was put within 45 days of receipt of the final bill.
Any balances remaining in the deposit or escrow account, including
interest in accordance with Section 1 of P.L. 1985, c. 315 (N.J.S.A.
40:55D-53.1), shall be refunded to the developer along with the
§ 149-64 WOOLWICH CODE § 149-64
125:374
final accounting. To facilitate the release of escrow, an applicant
shall submit a signed escrow release voucher with the development
application.
(7) The Chief Financial Officer shall make all of the payments to
professionals for services rendered to the municipality or
approving Board for review of applications for development, review
and preparation of documents, inspection of improvements or other
purposes under the provisions of P.L. 1975, c. 291 (N.J.S.A.
40:55D-1 et seq.). Each payment charged to the deposit for review
of applications, review and preparation of documents and
inspection of improvements shall be pursuant to a voucher from the
professional, which voucher shall identify the personnel
performing the service and, for each date the services performed,
the hours spent to one-fourth-hour increments, the hourly rate and
the expenses incurred. All professionals shall submit vouchers to
the Chief Financial Officer on a monthly basis in accordance with
schedules and procedures established by the Chief Financial
Officer. If the services are provided by a township employee, the
township employee shall prepare and submit to the Chief Financial
Officer a statement containing the same information as required on
a voucher on a monthly basis. The professional shall send an
informational copy of all vouchers or statements submitted to the
Chief Financial Officer simultaneously to the applicant. The Chief
Financial Officer shall prepare and send to the applicant a
statement which shall include an accounting of funds listing all
deposits, interest earnings, disbursements and the cumulative
balance of the escrow account. This information shall be provided
on a quarterly basis, if monthly charges are $1,000 or less, or on a
monthly basis, if monthly charges exceed $1,000. If an escrow
account or deposit contains insufficient funds to enable the
township or approving authority to perform required application
reviews or improvement inspections, the Chief Financial Officer
shall provide the applicant with a notice of the insufficient escrow
or deposit balance. In order for work to continue on the
development or the application, the applicant shall, within a
reasonable time period, post a deposit to the account in an amount
to be agreed upon by the township or approving authority and the
applicant. In the interim, any required health and safety
inspections shall be made and charged back against the
replenishment of funds.
(8) An applicant shall notify, in writing, the governing body, with copies
to the Chief Financial Officer, the approving authority and the
professional, whenever the applicant disputes the charges made by
a professional for service rendered to the township in reviewing
applications for development, review and preparation of
documents, inspection of improvements or other charges made
pursuant to the provisions of P.L. 1975, c. 291 (N.J.S.A. 40:55D-1 et
seq.). The governing body or its designee shall, within a reasonable

have refused to abate said violation within five days after written notice
shall have been served upon him either by mail or by personal service, shall
for each and every violation be fined as provided in Chapter 1, General
Provisions, Article I.
§ 149-66. Additional remedies.
In addition to the remedy or remedies hereinbefore provided, any person,
persons, company or corporation violating this chapter or any provision or

time period, attempt to remediate any disputed charges. If the
matter is not resolved to the satisfaction of the applicant, the
applicant may appeal to the County Construction Board of Appeals
established under Section 9 of P.L. 1975, c. 217 (N.J.S.A.
52:27D-127), any charge to an escrow account or a deposit by any
township professional or consultant or the cost of the installation
of improvements estimated by the Municipal Engineer pursuant to
Section 15 of P.L. 1991, c. 256 (N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.4). An applicant
or his authorized agent shall submit the appeal in writing to the
County Construction Board of Appeals. The applicant or his
authorized agent shall simultaneously send a copy of the appeal to
the township, the approving authority and any professional whose
charge is the subject of the appeal. An applicant shall file an
appeal within 45 days from receipt of the informational copy of
the professional's voucher required by Subsection c of Section
13 of P.L. 1991, c. 256 (N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.2), except that, if the
professional has not supplied the applicant with an informational
copy of the professional's voucher, the applicant shall file his appeal
within 60 days from receipt of the township statement of activity
against the deposit or escrow account required by Subsection c. of
Section 13 of P.L. 1991, c. 256 (N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.2). An applicant
may file an appeal for an ongoing series of charges by a
professional during a period not exceeding six months to
demonstrate that they represent a pattern of excessive or
inaccurate charges. An applicant making use of this provision need
not appeal each charge individually.

§ 156-1. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to regulate the intensity of use in areas
of steeply sloping terrain in order to limit soil loss, erosion, excessive
stormwater runoff, and the degradation of surface water and to maintain
the natural topography and drainage patterns of land.
§ 156-2. Background.
Disturbance of steep slopes results in accelerated erosion processes from
stormwater runoff and the subsequent sedimentation of water bodies with
the associated degradation of water quality and loss of aquatic life support.
Related effects include soil loss, changes in natural topography and
drainage patterns, increased flooding potential, further fragmentation of
forest and habitat areas, and compromised aesthetic values. It has become
widely recognized that disturbance of steep slopes should be restricted or
prevented based on the impact that disturbance of steep slopes can have on
water quality and quantity and the environmental integrity of landscapes.
§ 156-3. Applicability.
This chapter shall be applicable to new development or land disturbance on
a steep slope within the Township of Woolwich.
§ 156-4. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
DISTURBANCE  The placement of impervious surface, the exposure or
movement of soil or bedrock, or the clearing, cutting, or removing of
vegetation.
IMPERVIOUS SURFACE  Any structure, surface, or improvement that
reduces or prevents absorption of stormwater into land, and includes
§ 155-37 WOOLWICH CODE § 156-4
153:418
porous paving, paver blocks, gravel, crushed stone, decks, patios, elevated
structures, and other similar structures, surfaces, or improvements.
REDEVELOPMENT  The construction of structures or improvements on
areas which previously contained structures or other improvements.
STEEP SLOPES  Any slope equal to or greater than 20% as measured over
any minimum run of 10 feet. Steep slopes are determined based on contour
intervals of two feet or less.
§ 156-5. Designation of areas.
The percent of slope (rise in feet per horizontal distance) shall be
established by measurement of distance perpendicular to the contour of the
slope. The percent of slope shall be calculated for each two-foot contour
interval. For example, any location on the site where there is a one-foot rise
over a ten-foot horizontal run constitutes a ten-percent slope; a 1.5-foot rise
over a ten-foot horizontal run constitutes a fifteen-percent slope; a two-foot
rise over a ten-foot horizontal run constitutes a twenty-percent slope.
§ 156-6. Steep slope limits.
For steep slopes, any disturbance shall be prohibited except as provided
below:
§ 156-7. Conflicts with other provisions; construal of provisions;
severability.
A. Redevelopment within the limits of existing impervious surfaces; and
B. New disturbance necessary to protect public health, safety or welfare,
such as necessary linear development with no feasible alternative; to
provide an environmental benefit, such as remediation of a
contaminated site; to prevent extraordinary hardship on the property
owner peculiar to the property; or to prevent extraordinary hardship,
provided that the hardship was not created by the property owner, that
would not permit a minimum economically viable use of the property
based upon reasonable investment. For example, redevelopment,
within the footprint of existing impervious cover, should be allowed to
support efforts to revitalize development that has fallen into disrepair.
The applicant shall demonstrate through site plans depicting proposed
development and topography that new disturbance is not located in
areas with a twenty-percent or greater slope.
A. Conflicts. All other ordinances, parts of ordinances, or other local
requirements that are inconsistent or in conflict with this chapter are
hereby superseded to the extent of any inconsistency or conflict, and
the provisions of this chapter apply.
B. Severability.
§ 156-4 SOIL REMOVAL § 156-7

§ 156-8. Enforcement; violations and penalties.
A prompt investigation shall be made by the appropriate personnel of the
Township of Woolwich of any person or entity believed to be in violation
hereof. If, upon inspection, a condition which is in violation of this chapter
is discovered, a civil action in the Special Part of the Superior Court, or in
the Superior Court, if the primary relief sought is injunctive or if penalties
may exceed the jurisdictional limit of the Special Civil Part, by the filing and
serving of appropriate process. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed
to preclude the right of the Township of Woolwich, pursuant to N.J.S.A.
26:3A2-25, to initiate legal proceedings hereunder in Municipal Court. The
violation of any section or subsection of this chapter shall constitute a
separate and distinct offense independent of the violation of any other
section or subsection or of any order issued pursuant to this chapter. Each
day a violation continues shall be considered a separate offense.

ARTICLE II
Stormwater Control
[Adopted 7-17-2006 by Ord. No. 2006-18; amended in its entirety
12-27-2006 by Ord. No. 2006-29]
§ 157-4. Scope and purpose.
A. Purpose.
(1) It is hereby determined that:
(a) Land development projects and associated disturbance of
vegetation and soil and changes in land cover, including
increases in impervious cover, alter the hydrologic response of
local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and
volumes. If inadequately or improperly managed, this
stormwater runoff can deplete groundwater resources and
increase flooding, stream channel erosion, and sediment
transport and deposition.
(b) This stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of
waterborne pollutants.
(c) Increases of stormwater runoff, soil erosion and nonpointsource
pollutants have occurred in the past as a result of land
development, and contribute to the degradation of the water
resources of Woolwich and downstream municipalities.
(d) Woolwich Township's natural resources are to be protected in
accordance with New Jersey's Stormwater Management Rules
at N.J.A.C. 7:8-1.1 et seq., and New Jersey's surface water
quality antidegradation policies contained in the New Jersey
Surface Water Quality Standards at N.J.A.C. 7:9B-1.1 et seq.
Permitted uses shall maintain the ecological character and
quality of Woolwich Township, including good water quality
and natural rates and volumes of flow.
(e) Increased stormwater rates and volumes and the sediments
and pollutants associated with stormwater runoff from future
development projects within Woolwich Township have the
potential to adversely affect Woolwich Township's streams and
water resources and the streams and water resources of
downstream municipalities.
(f) Stormwater runoff, soil erosion and nonpoint-source pollution
can be controlled and minimized through the regulation of
stormwater runoff from development sites.
(g) It is in the public interest to regulate the discharge of
stormwater runoff from "major development" projects, as
defined in § 157-10 of this article, conducted within Woolwich
Township, as provided in this article, in order to control and
§ 157-4 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT § 157-4
157:423
minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes, to
maintain groundwater recharge, and to control and minimize
soil erosion, stream channel erosion and nonpoint-source
pollution associated with stormwater runoff.
(2) Therefore, it is the purpose of this article to establish minimum
stormwater management requirements and controls for major
development consistent with the statewide stormwater
requirements at N.J.A.C. 7:8 and the provisions of the adopted
Master Plan and land use ordinances of Woolwich Township.
B. Goals and techniques.
(1) Through this article, Woolwich Township has established the
following goals for stormwater control:
(a) To reduce flood damage, including damage to life and property;
(b) To minimize any increase in stormwater runoff from new
development;
(c) To reduce soil erosion from any development or construction
project;
(d) To assure the adequacy of existing and proposed culverts and
bridges, and other instream structures;
(e) To maintain groundwater recharge;
(f) To minimize any increase in nonpoint pollution;
(g) To maintain the integrity of stream channels for their biological
functions, as well as for drainage;
(h) To restore, protect, maintain and enhance the quality of the
streams and water resources and the ecological character and
quality of Woolwich Township;
(i) To minimize pollutants in stormwater runoff from new and
existing development in order to restore, protect, enhance and
maintain the chemical, physical and biological integrity of the
surface and ground waters of Woolwich Township, to protect
public health and to enhance the domestic, municipal,
recreational, industrial and other uses of water; and
(j) To protect public safety through the proper design and
operation of stormwater management basins.
(2) In order to achieve the goals for stormwater control set forth in this
article, Woolwich Township has identified the following
management techniques:
(a) Implementation of multiple stormwater management best
management practices (BMPs) may be necessary to achieve
§ 157-4 WOOLWICH CODE § 157-4
157:424
the performance standards for stormwater runoff quantity and
rate, groundwater recharge, erosion control, and stormwater
runoff quality established through this article.
(b) Compliance with the stormwater runoff quantity and rate,
groundwater recharge, erosion control, and stormwater runoff
quality standards established through N.J.A.C. 7:8-1.1 et seq.,
and this article, shall be accomplished to the maximum extent
practicable through the use of nonstructural BMPs, before
relying on structural BMPs. Nonstructural BMPs are also
known as low-impact development (LID) techniques.
(c) Nonstructural BMPs shall include both environmentally
sensitive site design and source controls that prevent
pollutants from being placed on the site or from being exposed
to stormwater.
(d) Source control plans shall be developed based upon physical
site conditions and the origin, nature and the anticipated
quantity or amount of potential pollutants.
(e) Structural BMPs, where necessary, shall be integrated with
nonstructural stormwater management strategies and proper
maintenance plans.
(f) When using structural BMPs, multiple stormwater
management measures, smaller in size and distributed
spatially throughout the land development site, shall be used
wherever possible to achieve the performance standards for
water quality, quantity and groundwater recharge established
through this article before relying on a single, larger
stormwater management measure to achieve these
performance standards.
C. Applicability.
(1) This article shall be applicable to all site plans and subdivisions for
the following major developments that require preliminary or final
site plan or subdivision review:
(a) Nonresidential major developments; and
(b) Aspects of residential major developments that are not
preempted by the Residential Site Improvement Standards at
N.J.A.C. 5:21.
(2) This article shall also be applicable to all major developments
undertaken by Woolwich Township.
D. Procedures. In addition to other development review procedures set
forth in the Code of Woolwich Township, major developments located
within Woolwich Township shall comply with the stormwater
management requirements and specifications set forth in this article.
§ 157-4 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT § 157-4
157:425
§ 157-5. Requirements for a site development stormwater plan.
New agricultural development that meets the definition of major
development in § 157-10 of this article shall be submitted to the
appropriate soil conservation district for review and approval in
accordance with the requirements of N.J.A.C. 5.4(b) 7:8.
E. Compatibility with other permit and ordinance requirements.
(1) Development approvals issued for subdivisions and site plans
pursuant to this article are to be considered an integral part of
development approvals under the subdivision and site plan review
process and do not relieve the applicant of the responsibility to
secure required permits or approvals for activities regulated by any
other applicable ordinance, code, rule, regulation, statute, act or
other provision of law.
(2) In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this article
shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of
the public health, safety, and general welfare. This article is not
intended to interfere with, abrogate, or annul any other ordinance,
rule or regulation, stature, or other provision of law except that,
where any provision of this article imposes restrictions different
from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule or regulation, or
other provision of law, the more restrictive or stringent provisions
or higher standards shall control.
(3) In the event that a regional stormwater management plan(s) is
prepared and formally adopted pursuant to N.J.A.C. 7:8-1.1 et seq.
for any drainage area(s) or watershed(s) of which Woolwich
Township is a part, the stormwater provisions of such a plan(s)
shall be adopted by Woolwich Township within one year of the
adoption of a regional stormwater management plan (RSWMP) as
an amendment to an areawide water quality management plan.
A. Submission of site development stormwater plan.
(1) Whenever an applicant seeks municipal approval of a site
development that is subject to this article, the applicant shall
submit all of the required components of the checklist for the site
development stormwater plan at § 157-5C below as part of the
applicant's application for subdivision or site plan approval. Any

157:430
§ 157-6. Methodologies for the calculation of stormwater runoff
rate and volume, stormwater runoff quality and groundwater
recharge.
A. Method of calculating stormwater runoff rate and volume.
(1) In complying with the stormwater runoff quantity and rate
standards in § 157-7B, the design engineer shall calculate the
stormwater runoff rate and volume using the USDA Natural
Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Runoff Equation, Runoff
Curve Numbers, and Dimensionless Unit Hydrograph, as described
in the NRCS National Engineering Handbook Part 630 - Hydrology
and Technical Release 55 - Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds,
as amended and supplemented, or the Rational Method for peak
flow and the Modified Rational Method for hydrograph
computations.
(2) In calculating stormwater runoff using the NRCS methodology, the
design engineer shall separately calculate and then combine the
runoff volumes from pervious and directly connected impervious
surfaces within each drainage area within the parcel.
(3) Calculation of stormwater runoff from unconnected impervious
surfaces shall be based, as applicable, upon the two-step method
described in the current New Jersey Stormwater Best Management
Practices Manual or the NRCS methodology.
(4) In calculating stormwater runoff using the NRCS methodology, the
design engineer shall use appropriate twenty-four-hour rainfall
depths as developed for the project site by the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration, available online at
http://hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/pfds/index.html.
(5) When calculating stormwater runoff for predeveloped site
conditions, the design engineer shall use the following criteria:
(a) When selecting or calculating runoff curve numbers (CNs) for
predeveloped project site conditions, the project site's land
cover shall be assumed to be woods in good condition.
However, another land cover may be used to calculate runoff
coefficients if:
[1] Such land cover has existed at the site or portion thereof
without interruption for at least five years immediately
prior to the time of application; and
[2] The design engineer can document the character and
extent of such land cover through the use of photographs,
affidavits, and/or other acceptable land use records.
(b) If more than one land cover has existed on the site during the
five years immediately prior to the time of application, the land
§ 157-6 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT § 157-6
157:431
cover with the lowest runoff potential shall be used for the
computations.
(c) All predeveloped land covers shall be assumed to be in good
hydrologic condition and, if cultivated, shall be assumed to
have conservation treatment.
(d) In calculating predevelopment site stormwater runoff, the
design engineer shall include the effects of all land features
and structures, such as ponds, wetlands, depressions,
hedgerows and culverts, which affect predeveloped site
stormwater runoff rates and/or volumes.
(e) Where tailwater will affect the hydraulic performance of a
stormwater management measure, the design engineer shall
include such effects in the measure's design.
B. Method of calculating stormwater runoff quality.
(1) In complying with the stormwater runoff quality standards in
§ 157-7F(1), the design engineer shall calculate the stormwater
runoff rate and volume using the USDA Natural Resources
Conservation Service (NRCS) Runoff Equation, Runoff Curve
Numbers, and Dimensionless Unit Hydrograph, as described in the
NRCS National Engineering Handbook Part 630 - Hydrology and
Technical Release 55 - Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds, as
amended and supplemented, or the Rational Method for peak flow
and the Modified Rational Method for hydrograph computations, so
long as the Delmarva hydrograph is employed.
(2) The design engineer shall also use the NJDEP water quality design
storm, which is 1.25 inches of rainfall falling in a nonlinear pattern
in two hours. Details of the water quality design storm are shown in
Table 1.
(3) Calculation of runoff volumes, peak rates, and hydrographs for the
water quality design storm may take into account the
implementation of nonstructural and structural stormwater
management measures.

(4) Total suspended solids (TSS) reduction calculations.
(a) If more than one stormwater BMP in series is necessary to
achieve the required eighty-percent TSS reduction for a site,
the applicant shall utilize the following formula to calculate
TSS reduction:
R = A + B - (A x B)/100
Where:
R = total TSS percent load removal from application of both
BMPs
A = the TSS percent removal rate applicable to the first BMP
B = the TSS percent removal rate applicable to the second
BMP
(b) If there is more than one on-site drainage area, the eightypercent
TSS removal rate shall apply to each drainage area,
unless the runoff from the subareas converge on site, in which
case the removal rate can be demonstrated through a
calculation using a weighted average.
(5) TSS removal rates for stormwater BMPs.
(a) For purposes of TSS reduction calculations, Table 2 presents
the presumed removal rates for certain BMPs designed in
accordance with the New Jersey BMP Manual. The BMP
Manual may be obtained from the address identified in
§ 157-15A or found on the NJDEP's Web site at
§ 157-6 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT § 157-6
157:433
www.njstormwater.org. TSS reduction shall be calculated
based on the removal rates for the BMPs in Table 2.
(b) Alternative stormwater management measures, removal rates
and methods of calculating removal rates may be used if the
design engineer provides documentation demonstrating the
capability of these alternative rates and methods to Woolwich
Township. Any alternative stormwater management measure,
removal rate or method of calculating the removal rate shall be
subject to approval by Woolwich Township and a copy shall be

required in § 157-7F.
C. Methods of calculating groundwater recharge.
(1) If complying with the groundwater recharge standards contained
in § 157-7C(1)(a), design engineer may calculate groundwater
recharge in accordance with the New Jersey Groundwater
Recharge Spreadsheet (NJGRS) computer program incorporated
§ 157-6 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT § 157-6
157:435
herein by reference, as amended and supplemented. Information
regarding the methodology is available in § 157-14A or from the
New Jersey BMP Manual.
(2) Alternative groundwater recharge calculation methods to meet
these requirements may be used upon approval by the Municipal
Engineer.
(3) If complying with the groundwater recharge standards contained
in § 157-7C(1)(b), the design engineer shall:
(a) Calculate stormwater runoff volumes in accordance with the
USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS)
methodology, including the NRCS Runoff Equation and Runoff
Curve Numbers, as described in the NRCS National
Engineering Handbook Part 630 - Hydrology and Technical
Release 55 - Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds, as
amended and supplemented; and
(b) Use appropriate two-year, twenty-four-hour rainfall depths as
developed for the project site by the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration, available online at
http://hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/pfds/index.html.
(4) When calculating groundwater recharge or stormwater runoff for
predeveloped site conditions, the design engineer shall use the
following criteria:
(a) When selecting land covers or calculating runoff curve
numbers (CNs) for predeveloped project site conditions, the
project site's land cover shall be assumed to be woods.
However, another land cover may be used to calculate runoff
coefficients if:
[1] Such land cover has existed at the site or portion thereof
without interruption for at least five years immediately
prior to the time of application; and
[2] The design engineer can document the character and
extent of such land cover through the use of photographs,
affidavits, and/or other acceptable land use records.
(b) If more than one land cover, other than woods, has existed on
the site during the five years immediately prior to the time of
application, the land cover with the lowest runoff potential
(including woods) shall be used for the computations.
(c) All predeveloped land covers shall be assumed to be in good
hydrologic condition and, if cultivated, shall be assumed to
have conservation treatment.
§ 157-6 WOOLWICH CODE § 157-7

§ 157-7. Stormwater management performance standards for major
development.
A. Nonstructural stormwater management strategies.
(1) To the maximum extent practicable, the performance standards in
§ 157-7 for major development shall be met by incorporating the
nine nonstructural strategies identified in Subchapter 5 of the NJ
Stormwater Management Rules (N.J.A.C. 7:8-5), and set forth in
§ 157-5C(4)(a), into the design. The applicant shall identify within
the land use planning and source control plan required by
§ 157-5C(4) of this article how each of the nine nonstructural
measures will be incorporated into the design of the project to the
maximum extent practicable.
(2) If the applicant contends that it is not practical for engineering,
environmental or safety reasons to incorporate any of the nine
nonstructural strategies into the design of a particular project, the
applicant shall provide a detailed rationale establishing a basis for
the contention that use of the strategy is not practical on the site.
This rationale shall be submitted in accordance with the checklist
requirements established by § 157-5 to Woolwich Township. A
determination by Woolwich Township that this rationale is
inadequate or without merit shall result in a denial of the
application unless one of the following conditions is met:
(a) The land use planning and source control plan is amended to
include a description of how all nine nonstructural measures
will be implemented on the development site, and the amended
plan is approved by Woolwich Township;
(b) The land use planning and source control plan is amended to
provide an alternative nonstructural strategy or measure that
is not included in the list of nine nonstructural measures but
still meets the performance standards in § 157-7, and the
amended plan is approved by Woolwich Township; or
(c) The land use planning and source control plan is amended to
provide an adequate rationale for the contention that use of the
particular strategy is not practical on the site, and the
amended plan is approved by Woolwich Township.
(3) In addition to all other requirements of this section, each applicant
shall demonstrate that, at a minimum, existing trees and vegetation
on the development site will be preserved, protected and
maintained according to the minimum standards established by
provisions of the Woolwich Township Land Use Ordinance, Zoning
Ordinance or by conditions of zoning or variance approval. Existing
trees and vegetation shall be protected during construction
activities in accordance with the standard for tree protection
during construction provided in the New Jersey State Soil
Conservation Committee Standards for Soil Erosion and Sediment
§ 157-7 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT § 157-7
157:437
Control in New Jersey, which is incorporated herein by reference,
as amended and supplemented.
(4) In addition to all other requirements of this section, each
application for major development, and any other application
where Woolwich Township otherwise requires a landscaping plan,
shall contain a landscaping or revegetation plan.
(5) Any land area used as a nonstructural stormwater management
measure to meet the performance standards in § 157-7 shall be
dedicated to a government entity; shall be subjected to a
conservation easement filed with the appropriate County Clerk's
office; or shall be subjected to an equivalent form of restriction
approved by Woolwich Township that ensures that that measure, or
equivalent stormwater management measure, is maintained in
perpetuity, as detailed in § 157-9 of this article.
(6) Guidance for nonstructural stormwater management strategies is
available in the New Jersey BMP Manual, which may be obtained
from the address identified in § 157-15A or found on the NJDEP's
Web site at www.njstormwater.org.
(7) Exception for major development sites creating less than one acre
of disturbance. The use of nonstructural strategies to meet the
performance standards in § 157-7 of this article is not required for
major development creating less than one acre of disturbance.
However, the following requirements shall be met:
(a) Each application for major development and any other
application where Woolwich Township otherwise requires a
landscaping plan shall contain a landscaping or revegetation
plan;
(b) Each applicant shall demonstrate that, at a minimum, existing
trees and vegetation on the development site will be preserved
and protected according to the minimum standards established
by provisions of the Woolwich Township Land Use Ordinance,
Zoning Ordinance or by conditions of zoning or variance
approval; and
(c) Existing trees and vegetation shall be protected during
construction activities in accordance with the standard for tree
protection during construction provided in the New Jersey
State Soil Conservation Committee Standards for Soil Erosion
and Sediment Control in New Jersey, which is incorporated
herein by reference, as amended and supplemented.
B. Stormwater runoff quantity and rate standards.
(1) The design engineer, using the assumptions and factors for
stormwater runoff and groundwater recharge calculations
contained in § 157-6, shall either:
§ 157-7 WOOLWICH CODE § 157-7
157:438
(a) Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis that
the postdeveloped stormwater runoff hydrographs from the
project site for the two-, ten-, and one-hundred-year storms do
not exceed, at any point in time, the site's predeveloped runoff
hydrographs for the same storms.
(b) Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis that
under postdeveloped site conditions:
[1] There is no increase in predeveloped stormwater runoff
rates from the project site for the two-, ten-, and onehundred-
year storms; and
[2] Any increased stormwater runoff volume or change in
stormwater runoff timing for the two-, ten-, and onehundred-
year storms will not increase flood damage at or
downstream of the project site. When performing this
analysis for predeveloped site conditions, all off-site
development levels shall reflect existing conditions. When
performing this analysis for postdeveloped site conditions,
all off-site development levels shall reflect full
development in accordance with current zoning and land
use ordinances.
(c) Demonstrate that the peak postdeveloped stormwater runoff
rates from the project site for the two-, ten-, and one-hundredyear
storms are 50%, 75% and 80%, respectively, of the site's
peak predeveloped stormwater runoff rates for the same
storms. Peak outflow rates from on-site stormwater measures
for these storms shall be adjusted where necessary to account
for the discharge of increased stormwater runoff rates and/or
volumes from project site areas not controlled by the on-site
measures. These percentages do not have to be applied to
those portions of the project site that are not proposed for
development at the time of application, provided that such
areas are:
[1] Protected from future development by imposition of a
conservation easement, deed restriction, or other
acceptable legal measures; or
[2] Would be subject to review under these standards if they
are proposed for any degree of development in the future.
(2) In tidal flood hazard areas, a stormwater runoff quantity analysis in
accordance with Subsections B(1)(a), B(1)(b) and B(1)(c) above
shall only be applied if the increased volume of stormwater runoff
could increase flood damages below the point of discharge.
(3) The standards for stormwater runoff quantity and rate required by
this section shall be met using the methods, calculations and
assumptions provided in § 157-6.
§ 157-7 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT § 157-7
157:439
C. Groundwater recharge standards.
(1) For all major developments, with the exception of those described
in § 157-7C(4), below, the design engineer, using the assumptions
and factors for stormwater runoff and groundwater recharge
calculations contained in Section III, shall either:
(a) Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis that
the postdeveloped project site maintains 100% of the site's
predeveloped average annual groundwater recharge volume;
or
(b) Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis that
any increase in the project site's stormwater runoff volume for
the two-year, twenty-four-hour storm from predeveloped to
postdeveloped conditions is infiltrated onsite.
(2) The design engineer shall assess the hydraulic impact on the
groundwater table and design the project site and all site
groundwater recharge measures so as to avoid adverse hydraulic
impacts. Adverse hydraulic impacts include, but are not limited to:
raising the groundwater table so as to cause surface ponding;
flooding of basements and other subsurface structures and areas;
preventing a stormwater infiltration basin from completely
draining via infiltration within 72 hours of a design storm event;
and interference with the proper operation of subsurface sewage
disposal systems and other surface and subsurface facilities in the
vicinity of the groundwater recharge measure.
(3) The standards for groundwater recharge required by this section
shall be met using the methods, calculations and assumptions
provided in § 157-6.
(4) Exceptions.
(a) The preceding groundwater recharge standards shall not apply
to sites that create less than one acre of disturbance.
(b) The preceding groundwater recharge standards shall not apply
to projects within the urban redevelopment area, or to projects
subject to Subsection C(4)(c) below.
(c) The following types of stormwater shall not be recharged:
[1] Stormwater from areas of high pollutant loading. High
pollutant loading areas are areas in industrial and
commercial developments where solvents and/or
petroleum products are loaded/unloaded, stored, or
applied; areas where pesticides are loaded/unloaded or
stored; areas where hazardous materials are expected to
be present in grater than "reportable quantities" as
defined by the United States Environmental Protection
§ 157-7 WOOLWICH CODE § 157-7
157:440
Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR 302.4; areas where recharge
would be inconsistent with department-approved remedial
action work plan or landfill closure plan and areas with
high risks for spills of toxic materials, such as gas stations
and vehicle maintenance facilities; and
[2] Industrial stormwater exposed to source material. "Source
material" means any material(s) or machinery, located at
an industrial facility, that is directly or indirectly related to
process, manufacturing or other industrial activities,
which could be a source of pollutants in any industrial
stormwater discharge to groundwater. Source materials
include, but are not limited to, raw materials; intermediate
products; final products; waste materials; by-products;
industrial machinery and fuels, and lubricants, solvents,
and detergents that are related to process, manufacturing,
or other industrial activities that are exposed to
stormwater.
D. Erosion control standards. The minimum design and performance
standards for erosion control are those established under the Soil
Erosion and Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq., and its
implementing regulations, N.J.A.C. 2:90-1.1 through 1.4.
E. Stormwater runoff quality standards.
(1) Stormwater management measures shall be designed to reduce the
total suspended solids (TSS) load in the stormwater runoff from the
postdeveloped site by 80% expressed as an annual average.
(2) Stormwater management measures shall also be designed to
reduce the nutrient load in the stormwater runoff from the
postdeveloped site by the maximum extent practicable. In
achieving this reduction, the design of the development site shall
include nonstructural and structural stormwater management
measures that optimize nutrient removal while still achieving the
groundwater recharge, runoff quantity and rate, and TSS removal
standards in this section.
(3) The standards for stormwater runoff quality required by this
section shall be met using the methods, calculations, assumptions
and pollutant removal rates provided in § 157-6.
(4) Exceptions.
(a) The preceding stormwater runoff quality standards shall not
apply to the following major development sites:
[1] Major development sites where less than 0.25 acre of
additional impervious surface is proposed; or
§ 157-7 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT § 157-7
157:441
[2] Major residential development sites that create less than
one acre of disturbance.
(b) The TSS reduction requirement in § 157-7F(2) shall not apply
to any stormwater runoff in a discharge regulated under a
numeric effluent limitation for TSS imposed under the NJPDES
rules (N.J.A.C. 7:14A) or in a discharge specifically exempt
under a NJPDES permit from this requirement.
(c) The stormwater runoff quantity and rate standards in § 157-7B
shall still be met for all major development sites.
F. Threatened and endangered species and associated habitat standards.

§ 157-7H(1)(c)[3] of this article shall be void, and
Woolwich Township shall be prohibited from collecting
in-lieu contributions.
A. General design and construction standards.
(1) Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed to
meet the standards established in this section. These standards
have been developed to protect public safety, conserve natural
features, create an aesthetically pleasing site and promote proper
on-site stormwater management. (Though not required by N.J.A.C.
7:8, pursuant to their authority, municipalities may have the option
to require existing basins that pose a public health or safety hazard
to be retrofitted to comply with the standards in this subsection.)
(2) The following structural stormwater management measures may
be utilized as part of a stormwater management system at a major
land development in Woolwich Township, provided that the
applicant demonstrates that they are designed, constructed and
maintained so as to meet the standards and requirements
established by this article. If alternative stormwater management
§ 157-7 WOOLWICH CODE § 157-8
157:444
measures are proposed, the applicant shall demonstrate that the
selected measures will achieve the standards established by this
article.
(a) Bioretention systems;
(b) Constructed stormwater wetlands;
(c) Extended detention basins;
(d) Infiltration basins;
(e) Vegetated filter strips;
(f) Infiltration basins and trenches;
(g) Wet ponds with suitable liners;
(h) Pervious paving systems; and
(i) Manufactured treatment devices, provided their pollutant
removal rates are verified by the New Jersey Corporation for
Advanced Technology and certified by the NJDEP.
(3) Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed to
take into account the existing site conditions, including
environmentally critical areas, wetlands, flood-prone areas, slopes,
depth to seasonal high water table, soil type, permeability and
texture, and drainage area and drainage patterns.
(4) Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed
and constructed to be strong, durable, and corrosion-resistant
(measures that are consistent with the relevant portions of the
Residential Site Improvement Standards at N.J.A.C. 5:21-7.3, 7.4,
and 7.8 shall be deemed to meet this requirement); to minimize and
facilitate maintenance and repairs; and to ensure proper
functioning.
(5) For all stormwater management measures at a development site,
each applicant shall submit a detailed inspection, maintenance and
repair plan consistent with the requirements of § 157-8 of this
article.
(6) To the maximum extent practicable, the design engineer shall
design structural stormwater management measures on the
development site in a manner that:
(a) Limits site disturbance, maximizes stormwater management
efficiencies, and maintains or improves aesthetic conditions;
(b) Utilizes multiple stormwater management measures, smaller
in size and distributed spatially throughout the land
development site, instead of a single larger structural
stormwater management measures;
§ 157-8 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT § 157-8
157:445
(c) Incorporates pretreatment measures. Pretreatment can extend
the functional life and increase the pollutant removal capability
of a structural stormwater management measure.
Pretreatment measures may be designed in accordance with
the New Jersey BMP Manual or other sources approved by the
Municipal Engineer.
(7) Stormwater management basins shall be designed in a manner that
complements and mimics the existing natural landscape, including
but not limited to the following design strategies:
(a) Use of natural, nonwetland wooded depressions for
stormwater runoff storage; and
(b) Establishment of attractive landscaping in and around the
basin that mimics the existing vegetation and incorporates
native plants.
(8) Stormwater management basins shall be designed with gently
sloping sides. The maximum allowable basin side slope shall be
three horizontal to one vertical (3:1).
(9) Guidance on the design and construction of structural stormwater
management measures may be found in the New Jersey BMP
Manual. Other guidance sources may also be used upon approval
by the Municipal Engineer.
(10) After all construction activities and required field testing have been
completed on the development site, as-built plans depicting design
and as-built elevations of all stormwater management measures
shall be prepared by a licensed land surveyor and submitted to the
Municipal Engineer. Based upon the Municipal Engineer's review
of the as-built plans, all corrections or remedial actions deemed by
the Municipal Engineer to be necessary due to the failure to comply
with the standards established by this article and/or any reasons of
public health or safety, shall be completed by the applicant. In lieu
of review by the Municipal Engineer, Woolwich Township reserves
the right to engage a professional engineer to review the as-built
plans. The applicant shall pay all costs associated with such review.
B. Design and construction standards for stormwater infiltration BMPs.
(1) Stormwater infiltration BMPs, such as bioretention systems with
infiltration, dry wells, infiltration basins, pervious paving systems
with storage beds, and sand filters with infiltration, shall be
designed, constructed and maintained to completely drain the total
runoff volume generated by the basin's maximum design storm
within 72 hours after a storm event. Runoff storage for greater
times can render the BMP ineffective and may result in anaerobic
conditions, odor and both water quality and mosquito breeding
problems.
§ 157-8 WOOLWICH CODE § 157-8
157:446
(2) Stormwater infiltration BMPs shall be designed, constructed and
maintained to provide a minimum separation of at least two feet
between the elevation of the lowest point of the bottom of the
infiltration BMP and the seasonal high water table.
(3) The minimum design permeability rate for the soil within a BMP
that relies on infiltration shall be 0.5 inch per hour. A factor of
safety of two shall be applied to the soil's field-tested permeability
rate to determine the soil's design permeability rate. For example,
if the field-tested permeability rate of the soil is four inches per
hour, its design permeability rate would be two inches per hour.
The minimum design permeability rate for the soil within a
stormwater infiltration basin shall also be sufficient to achieve the
minimum seventy-two-hour drain time described in Subsection B(1)
above. The maximum design permeability shall be 10 inches per
hour.
(4) A soil's field-tested permeability rate shall be determined in
accordance with the following:
(a) The predevelopment field test permeability rate shall be
determined according to the methodologies provided in
§ 157-14C(3) of this article;
(b) The results of the required field permeability tests shall
demonstrate a minimum tested infiltration rate of one inch per
hour;
(c) After all construction activities have been completed on the
site and the finished grade has been established in the
infiltration BMP, postdevelopment field permeability tests shall
also be conducted according to the methodologies provided in
§ 157-14C(3) of this article;
(d) If the results of the postdevelopment field permeability tests
fail to achieve the minimum required design permeability rates
in Subsection B(4) above utilizing a factor of safety of two, the
stormwater infiltration BMP shall be renovated and re-tested
until such minimum required design permeability rates are
achieved; and
(e) The results of all field permeability tests shall be certified by a
professional engineer and transmitted to the Municipal
Engineer.
(5) To help ensure maintenance of the design permeability rate over
time, a six-inch layer of K5 soil shall be placed on the bottom of a
stormwater infiltration BMP. This soil layer shall meet the textural
and permeability specifications of a K5 soil as provided at N.J.A.C.
7:9A, Appendix A, Figure 6, and be certified to meet these
specifications by a professional engineer licensed in the State of
§ 157-8 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT § 157-8
157:447
New Jersey. The depth to the seasonal high water table shall be
measured from the bottom of the K5 sand layer.
(6) The design engineer shall assess the hydraulic impact on the
groundwater table and design the project site and all stormwater
infiltration basins so as to avoid adverse hydraulic impacts.
Adverse hydraulic impacts include, but are not limited to: raising
the groundwater table so as to cause surface ponding; flooding of
basements and other subsurface structures and areas; preventing a
stormwater infiltration basin from completely draining via
infiltration within 72 hours of a design storm event; and
interference with the proper operation of subsurface sewage
disposal systems and other surface and subsurface structures in
the vicinity of the stormwater infiltration basin.
(7) The design engineer shall conduct a mounding analysis, as defined
in § 157-10, of all stormwater infiltration basins. The mounding
analysis shall be conducted in accordance with the requirements in
§ 157-14C(1). Where the mounding analysis identifies adverse
impacts, the stormwater infiltration basin shall be redesigned or
relocated, as appropriate.
(8) Stormwater infiltration BMPs shall be constructed in accordance
with the following:
(a) To avoid sedimentation that may result in clogging and reduce
the basin's permeability rate: All other infiltration BMP
construction in this section shall be followed when the
drainage area is completely stabilized, all accumulated
sediment shall be removed from the infiltration BMP, which
shall then be excavated to its final design elevation in
accordance with the construction requirements of this section
and the performance standards in § 157-7.
(b) To avoid compaction of subgrade soils of BMPs that rely on
infiltration, no heavy equipment such as backhoes, dump
trucks or bulldozers shall be permitted to operate within the
footprint of the BMP. All excavation required to construct a
stormwater infiltration BMP shall be performed by equipment
placed outside the BMP. If this is not possible, the soils within
the excavated area shall be renovated and tilled after
construction is completed to reverse the effects of compaction.
In addition, postdevelopment soil permeability testing shall be
performed in accordance with Subsection B(4) of this section.
(c) Earthwork associated with stormwater infiltration BMP
construction, including excavation, grading, cutting or filling,
shall not be performed when soil moisture content is above the
lower plastic limit.
C. Safety standards for structural stormwater management measures.
§ 157-8 WOOLWICH CODE § 157-8
157:448
(1) If a structural stormwater management measure has an outlet
structure, escape provisions shall be incorporated in or on the
structure. "Escape provisions" means the permanent installation of
ladders, steps, rungs, or other features that provide readily
accessible means of ingress and egress from the outlet structure.
(2) A trash rack is a device intended to intercept runoff-borne trash
and debris that might otherwise block the hydraulic openings in an
outlet structure of a structural stormwater management measure.
Trash racks shall be installed upstream of such outlet structure
openings as necessary to ensure proper functioning of the
structural stormwater management measures in accordance with
the following:
(a) The trash rack should be constructed primarily of bars aligned
in the direction of flow with one-inch spacing between the bars
to the elevation of the water quality design storm. For
elevations higher than the water quality design storm, the bars
shall be spaced no greater than 1/3 the width of the hydraulic
opening it is protecting or six inches, whichever is less.
Transverse bars aligned perpendicular to flow should be sized
and spaced as necessary for rack stability and strength.
(b) The trash rack shall not adversely affect the hydraulic
performance of either the outlet structure opening it is
protecting or the overall outlet structure.
(c) The trash rack shall have sufficient net open area under clean
conditions to limit the peak design storm velocity through it to
a maximum of 2.5 feet per second.
(d) The trash rack shall be constructed and installed to be rigid,
durable, and corrosion-resistant, and shall be designed to
withstand a perpendicular live loading of 300 pounds per
square foot.
(3) An overflow grate is a device intended to protect the opening in the
top of a stormwater management measure outlet structure. If an
outlet structure has an overflow grate, such grate shall meet the
following requirements:
(a) The overflow grate shall be secured to the outlet structure but
removable for emergencies and maintenance;
(b) The overflow grate spacing shall be no more than two inches
across the smallest dimension; and
(c) The overflow grate shall be constructed and installed to be
rigid, durable, and corrosion-resistant, and shall be designed
to withstand a perpendicular live loading of 300 pounds per
square foot.

§ 157-9. Inspection, maintenance and repair of stormwater
management measures.
(4) The maximum side slope for an earthen dam, embankment, or berm
shall not be steeper than three horizontal to one vertical (3:1).
(5) Safety ledges shall be constructed on the slopes of all new
structural stormwater management measures having a permanent
pool of water deeper than 2 1/2 feet. Such safety ledges shall be
comprised of two steps. Each step shall be four to six feet in width.
One step shall be located approximately 2 1/2 feet below the
permanent water surface, and the second step shall be located one
to 1 1/2 feet above the permanent water surface. See below, for an
illustration of safety ledges in a stormwater management basin.

the inspection, maintenance and repair plan. Said records and
inspection reports shall be retained for a minimum of five years.
(4) If the inspection, maintenance and repair plan identifies a person
other than the developer (for example, a public agency or
homeowners' association) as having the responsibility for
inspection and maintenance, the plan shall include documentation
of such person's agreement to assume this responsibility, or of the
developer's obligation to dedicate a stormwater management
measure to such person under an applicable ordinance or
regulation.
(5) If the person responsible for inspection, maintenance and repair
identified under § 157-9B(2) above is not a public agency, the
maintenance plan and any future revisions based on § 157-9B(6)
below shall be recorded upon the deed of record for each property
on which the maintenance described in the maintenance plan shall
be undertaken.
§ 157-9 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT § 157-9
157:451
(6) The person responsible for inspection, maintenance and repair
identified under § 157-9B(2) above shall evaluate the effectiveness
of the inspection, maintenance and repair plan at least once per
year and update the plan and the deed as needed.
(7) The person responsible for inspection, maintenance and repair

E. Stormwater management measure easements shall be provided by the
property owner as necessary for facility inspections and maintenance
and preservation of stormwater runoff conveyance, infiltration, and
detention areas and facilities. The purpose of the easement shall be
specified in the maintenance agreement.
F. In the event that the stormwater management measure becomes a
public health nuisance or danger to public safety or public health, or if
it is in need of maintenance or repair, Woolwich Township shall so notify
the responsible person in writing. Upon receipt of that notice, the
responsible person shall have 14 days to effect maintenance and repair
of the facility in a manner that is approved by the Municipal Engineer or
the municipal engineer's designee. Woolwich Township, at its
discretion, may extend the time allowed for effecting maintenance and

Woolwich Township may immediately proceed to do so with its own
forces and equipment and/or through contractors. The costs and
expenses of such maintenance and repair by Woolwich Township shall
be entered on the tax roll as a special charge against the property and
§ 157-9 WOOLWICH CODE § 157-9
157:452
collected with any other taxes levied for the year in which the
maintenance and repair was performed.
G. Requirements for inspection, maintenance and repair of stormwater
BMPs that rely on infiltration. If a stormwater infiltration BMP is
incorporated into the design of a major development, the applicant shall
include the following requirements in its inspection, maintenance and
repair plan:
(1) Once per month (if needed); Mow side slopes, remove litter and
debris, stabilize eroded banks, repair erosion at inflow structure(s);
(2) After every storm exceeding one inch of rainfall: Ensure that
infiltration BMPs drain completely within 72 hours after the storm
event. If stored water fails to infiltrate 72 hours after the end of the
storm, corrective measures shall be taken. Raking or tilling by light
equipment can assist in maintaining infiltration capacity and break
up clogged surfaces;
(3) Four times per year (quarterly): Inspect stormwater infiltration
BMPs for clogging and excessive debris and sediment
accumulation within the BMP, remove sediment (if needed) when
completely dry;
(4) Two times per year: Inspect for signs of damage to structures,
repair eroded areas, check for signs of petroleum contamination
and remediate;
(5) Once per year: Inspect BMPs for unwanted tree growth and remove
if necessary, disc or otherwise aerate bottom of infiltration basin to
a minimum depth of six inches; and
(6) After every storm exceeding one inch of rainfall, inspect and, if
necessary, remove and replace K5 sand layer and accumulated
sediment to restore original infiltration rate.
(7) Additional guidance for the inspection, maintenance and repair of
stormwater infiltration BMPs can be found in the New Jersey BMP
Manual.
H. Maintenance guarantee.
(1) The applicant shall provide a maintenance guarantee in accordance
with N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53 to ensure that all stormwater management
measures required under the provisions of this article will be
maintained in accordance with the specifications established
herein.
(2) Additionally, for those stormwater management measures that are
to be inspected, maintained and repaired by a public agency,
Woolwich Township shall collect an upfront fee from the applicant
in the amount Woolwich Township determines is needed to provide
long-term inspection, maintenance and repair of all stormwater
§ 157-9 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT § 157-9
157:453
management measures. This upfront fee shall be placed in a
dedicated cash management account and expended by Woolwich
Township for the sole purpose of conducting inspection,
maintenance and repair activities for all stormwater management
measures required under the applicant's major development
application approval. The calculation of the fee shall be based upon
the inspection, maintenance and repair plan (plan) required to be
prepared by the applicant and approved by Woolwich Township.
The plan shall include an estimate of the present value of the
cost to inspect, maintain and repair the stormwater management
measure(s) in accordance with the plan for the useful life of those
measure(s). The Woolwich Township shall furnish the applicant
their published hourly rates as prescribed by their salary ordinance
for public works' and other personnel having responsibilities
associated with stormwater management. Added to this fee shall
be an amount mutually determined by WOOLWICH TOWNSHIP
and the applicant to account for the reconstruction of stormwater
management measures that are reasonably anticipated to be
subject to long-term failure. After an agreed number of years,
depending on the type of measure(s), the measure(s) will need
to be reconstructed. The amount shall be based on the future
value of the measure(s) being reconstructed. Both inflation rates
and bank interest rates shall be based on the ten-year average
published in the Wall Street Journal or other approved publication.
Interest accruing in the account must also be accounted for at an
agreed upon interest rate to arrive at an amount. The costs for
reconstructing the measure(s) shall be taken from the engineer's
probable cost estimate that is utilized to determine the amount of
the required performance guarantee. It is acceptable to attach a
percentage of failure to certain line items in the estimate.
(3) Additionally, for those stormwater management measures that are
to be inspected, maintained and repaired by a homeowners'
association, condominium association or some other form of
nonpublic ownership, no fee shall be collected by Woolwich
Township. Instead, the ownership entity shall establish and
maintain a fund for the annual inspection and testing program,
annual maintenance and repair program and annual contribution to
a contingency fund for long-term reconstruction.
(a) The initial costs agreed to for the annual inspection and testing
program and annual maintenance and repair program shall be
based upon actual itemized proposals offered to the applicant
by prospective vendors. The annual cost expended on
inspection, testing and maintenance shall be reported to
Woolwich Township to verify that maintenance is not being
deferred and to inform Woolwich Township on the magnitude
of those service.

(3) Methods for assessing soil suitability for infiltration stormwater
management BMPs. The results of a subsurface investigation shall
serve as the basis for the site selection and design of stormwater
infiltration BMPs. The subsurface investigation shall include, but
not be limited to, a series of soil test pits and soil permeability tests
conducted in accordance with the following:
(a) All soil test pits and soil permeability results shall be
performed under the direct supervision of a professional
engineer. All soil logs and permeability test data shall be
accompanied by a certification by a professional engineer. The
results and location (horizontal and vertical) of all soil test pits
§ 157-14 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT § 157-14
157:469
and soil permeability tests, both passing and failing, shall be
reported to Woolwich Township.
(b) During all subsurface investigations and soil test procedures,
adequate safety measures shall be taken to prohibit
unauthorized access to the excavations at all times. It is the
responsibility of persons performing or witnessing subsurface
investigations and soil permeability tests to comply with all
applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations
governing occupational safety.
(c) A minimum of two soil test pits shall be excavated within the
footprint of any proposed infiltration BMP to determine the
suitability and distribution of soil types present at the site.
Placement of the test pits shall be within 20 feet of the basin
perimeter, located along the longest axis bisecting the BMP.
For BMPs larger than 10,000 square feet in area, a minimum of
one additional soil test pit shall be conducted within each
additional area of 10,000 square feet. The additional test pit(s)
shall be placed approximately equidistant to other test pits, so
as to provide adequate characterization of the subsurface
material. In all cases, where soil and or groundwater
properties vary significantly, additional test pits shall be
excavated in order to accurately characterize the subsurface
conditions below the proposed infiltration BMP. Soil test pits
shall extend to a minimum depth of eight feet below the lowest
elevation of the basin bottom or to a depth that is at least two
times the maximum potential water depth in the proposed
infiltration BMP, whichever is greater.
(d) A soil test pit log shall be prepared for each soil test pit. The
test pit log shall, at a minimum, provide the elevation of the
existing ground surface, the depth and thickness (in inches) of
each soil horizon or substratum, the dominant matrix or
background and mottle colors using the Munsell system of
classification for hue, value and chroma, the appropriate
textural class as shown on the USDA textural triangle, the
volume percentage of coarse fragments (larger than two
millimeters in diameter), the abundance, size, and contrast of
mottles, the soil structure, soil consistence, and soil moisture
condition, using standard USDA classification terminology for
each of these soil properties. Soil test pit logs shall identify the
presence of any soil horizon, substratum or other feature that
exhibits an in-place permeability rate less than one inch per
hour.
(e) Each soil test pit log shall report the depth to seasonally high
water level, either perched or regional, and the static water
level based upon the presence of soil mottles or other
redoximorphic features, and observed seepage or saturation.
Where redoxomorphic features including soil mottles resulting
§ 157-14 WOOLWICH CODE § 157-14
157:470
from soil saturation are present, they shall be interpreted to
represent the depth to the seasonal high water table unless
soil saturation or seepage is observed at a higher level. When
the determination of the seasonally high water table shall be
made in ground previously disturbed by excavation, direct
observation of the static water table during the months of
January through April shall be the only method permitted.
(f) Any soil horizon or substratum which exists immediately below
a perched zone of saturation shall be deemed by rule to exhibit
unacceptable permeability (less than one inch per hour). The
perched zone of saturation may be observed directly, inferred
based upon soil morphology, or confirmed by performance of a
hydraulic head test as defined at N.J.A.C. 7:9A-5.9.
(g) Stormwater infiltration BMPs shall not be installed in soils that
exhibit artesian groundwater conditions. A permeability test
shall be conducted in all soils that immediately underlie a
perched zone of saturation. Any zone of saturation which is
present below a soil horizon which exhibits an in-place
permeability of less than 0.2 inches per hour shall be
considered an artesian zone of saturation unless a minimum
one-foot-thick zone of unsaturated soil, free of mottling or
other redoximorphic features and possessing a chroma of four
or higher, exists immediately below the unsuitable soil.
(h) A minimum of one permeability test shall be performed at each
soil test pit location. The soil permeability rate shall be
determined using test methodology as prescribed in N.J.A.C.
7:9A-6.2 (tube permeameter test), 6.5 (pit bailing test) or 6.6
(piezometer test). When the tube permeameter test is used, a
minimum of two replicate samples shall be taken and tested.
Alternative permeability test procedures may be accepted by
the approving authority, provided the test procedure attains
saturation of surrounding soils, accounts for hydraulic head
effects on infiltration rates, provides a permeability rate with
units expressed in inches per hour and is accompanied by a
published source reference. Examples of suitable sources
include hydrogeology, geotechnical or engineering text and
design manuals, proceedings of American Society for Testing
and Materials (ASTM) symposia, or peer-review journals.
Neither a soil permeability class rating test, as described in
N.J.A.C. 7:9A-6.3, nor a percolation test, as described in
N.J.A.C. 7:9A-6.4, are acceptable tests for establishing
permeability values for the purpose of complying with this
article.
(i) Soil permeability tests shall be conducted on the most
hydraulically restrictive horizon or substratum to be left in
place below the basin as follows. Where no soil replacement is
proposed, the permeability tests shall be conducted on the
§ 157-14 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT § 157-14
157:471
most hydraulically restrictive horizon or substratum within
four feet of the lowest elevation of the basin bottom or to a
depth equal to two times the maximum potential water depth
within the basin, whichever is greater. Where soil replacement
is proposed, the permeability tests shall be conducted within
the soil immediately below the depth of proposed soil
replacement or within the most hydraulically restrictive
horizon or substratum to a depth equal to two times the
maximum potential water depth within the basin, whichever
is greater. Permeability tests may be performed on the most
hydraulically restrictive soil horizons or substrata at depths
greater than those identified above based upon the discretion
of the design or testing engineer. The tested infiltration rate
should then be divided by two to establish the soil's design
permeability rate. Such division will provide a one-hundredpercent
safety factor to the tested rate.
(j) The minimum acceptable "tested permeability rate" of any soil
horizon or substratum shall be one inch per hour. Soil
materials that exhibit tested permeability rates slower than
one inch per hour shall be considered unsuitable for
stormwater infiltration. The maximum reportable "tested
permeability rate" of any soil horizon or substratum shall be no
greater than 20 inches per hour regardless of the rate attained
in the test procedure.
(k) After all construction activities have been completed on the
development site and the finished grade has been established
in the infiltration BMP, a minimum of one permeability test
shall be conducted within the most hydraulically restrictive soil
horizon or substratum below the as-built BMP to ensure the
performance of the infiltration BMP is as designed. Hand tools
and manual permeability test procedures shall be used for the
purpose of confirming BMP performance. In addition, the
infiltration BMP shall be flooded with water sufficient to
demonstrate the performance of the BMP. Test results shall be
certified to the Municipal Engineer.
(l) A groundwater mounding analysis shall be provided for each
stormwater infiltration BMP. The groundwater mounding
analysis shall calculate the maximum height of the
groundwater mound based upon the volume of the maximum
design storm. The professional engineer conducting the
analysis shall provide the Municipal Engineer with the
methodology and supporting documentation for the mounding
analysis used and shall certify to Woolwich Township, based
upon the analysis, that the groundwater mound will not cause
stormwater or groundwater to break out to the land surface or
cause adverse impact to adjacent surface water bodies,
wetlands or subsurface structures, including but not limited to
§ 157-14 WOOLWICH CODE § 157-14
157:472
basements and septic systems. If there is more than one
infiltration BMP proposed, the model shall indicate if and how
the mounds will interact. The mounding analysis shall be
calculated using the most restrictive soil horizon that will
remain in place within the explored aquifer thickness unless
alternative analyses is authorized by the Municipal Engineer.
The mounding analysis shall be accompanied by a cross section
of the infiltration BMP and surrounding topography and the
mound analysis shall extend out to the point(s) at which the
mound intersects with the preexisting maximum water table
elevation.
(m) The applicant shall demonstrate that stormwater infiltration
BMPs meet the seventy-two-hour drain time requirement
established in § 157-8B(1) of this article.
D. Pretreatment measures for infiltration BMPs. By reducing incoming
velocities and capturing coarser sediments, pretreatment can extend
the functional life and increase the pollutant removal capability of
infiltration measures. Therefore, the installation of pretreatment
measures is recommended for all development sites. Pretreatment
measures may include, but are not limited to, the following:
(1) Vegetative filter strips;
(2) Bioretention systems. Used in conjunction with a bioretention
system, the infiltration basin takes the place of the standard
underdrain;
(3) Sand filters;
(4) Grassed swales; and
(5) Detention basins.
E. Collection and conveyance.
(1) Bicycle-safe inlet grates. Site development plans that incorporate
site design features that help to prevent discharge to trash and
debris from drainage systems shall comply with the following
standard to control passage of solid and floatable materials through
storm drain inlets. For purposes of this paragraph, "solid and
floatable materials" means sediment, debris, trash, and other
floating, suspended or settleable solids.
(a) Design engineers shall use either of the following grates
whenever they use a grate in pavement or another ground
surface to collect stormwater from that surface into a storm
drain or surface water body under that grate:
[1] The New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT)
bicycle-safe grate, which is described in Chapter 2.4 of the
§ 157-14 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT § 157-14
157:473
NJDOT Bicycle Compatible Roadways and Bikeways
Planning and Design Guidelines (April 1996); or
[2] A different grate, if each individual clear space in that
grate has an area of no more than seven square inches, or
is no greater than 0.5 inch across the smallest dimension.
Examples of grates subject to this standard include grates
in grate inlets, the grate portion (non-curb-opening
portion) of combination inlets, grates on storm sewer
manholes, ditch grates, trench grates, and grates of spacer
bars in slotted drains. Examples of ground surfaces
include surfaces of roads (including bridges), driveways,
parking areas, bikeways, plazas, sidewalks, lawns, fields,
open channels, and stormwater basin floors.
(b) Whenever design engineers use a curb-opening inlet, the clear
space in that curb opening (or each individual clear space, if
the curb opening has two or more clear spaces) shall have an
area of no more than seven square inches, or be no greater
than two inches across the smallest dimension.
(c) This standard does not apply:
[1] Where the review agency determines that this standard
would cause inadequate hydraulic performance that could
not practicably be overcome by using additional or larger
storm drain inlets that meet these standards;
[2] Where flows from the water quality design storm as
specified in § 157-6 are conveyed through any device (e.g.,
end-of-pipe netting facility, manufactured treatment
device, or a catch basin hood) that is designed, at a
minimum, to prevent delivery of all solid and floatable
materials that could not pass through one of the following:
[a] A rectangular space 4 5/8 inches long and 1 1/2 inches
wide (this option does not apply for outfall netting
facilities); or
[b] A bar screen having a bar spacing of 0.5 inch.
[3] Where flows are conveyed through a trash rack that has
parallel bars with one-inch spacing between the bars, to
the elevation of the water quality design storm as specified
in § 157-6 of this article; or
[4] Where the NJDEP determines, pursuant to the New Jersey
Register of Historic Places Rules at N.J.A.C. 7:4-7.2(c), that
action to meet this standard is an undertaking that
constitutes an encroachment or will damage or destroy the
New Jersey Register-listed historic property.
§ 157-14 WOOLWICH CODE § 157-14
157:474
§ 157-15. Additional sources for technical guidance.
(2) Catch basins. Catch basins are storm drain inlets with or without
sumps. Catch basins may provide pretreatment for other
stormwater BMPs by capturing large sediments. The sediment and
pollutant removal efficiency of catch basins depends on the size of
the sump and the performance of routine maintenance to retain the
available sediment storage space in the sump. Where catch basins
with sumps are proposed, the minimum two feet separation
between the bottom of the sump and seasonally high water table
shall be provided.
(3) Open or perforated conveyance piping. Where adequate separation
to the seasonal high water table exists, stormwater from the
development site may be conveyed to a stormwater basin via a
system of perforated pipes. These pipes may be made of PVC or
corrugated metal and are available with perforations of varying
size and spacing. Perforated pipe specifications shall be certified by
a professional engineer. A professional engineer shall certify that
perforated conveyance piping will not act to intercept the seasonal
high water table and convey groundwater to the stormwater basin.
All open or perforated stormwater conveyance systems shall be
installed with a minimum separation of two feet from the seasonal
high water table.

for out of the municipal funds available for that purpose, that the cost of
such work shall be certified by the Township Engineer to the Tax Collector
within the township; that upon filing said certificate, the amount of the cost

shall be considered in approval of subdivision plats.
B. The subdivision plat shall be planned, designed, constructed and
maintained to preserve the natural environment and scenic beauty of
Woolwich Township. In reviewing a major subdivision consisting of
more than five lots counting any retained parcels, the reviewing
authority shall take into consideration the effect of the development
upon all aspects of the environment as outlined in the environmental
impact statement requirements, as well as the sufficiency of the
applicant's proposal in his environmental impact statement for dealing
with any immediate or projected adverse environmental effects. The
reviewing authority may require, as a condition of approval of the
application, that steps be taken to minimize the adverse environmental
impact during and after construction, and no final approval shall be
issued until all such requirements shall have been complied with or
compliance is guaranteed by a performance guaranty meeting the
requirements of § 163-10 of this chapter. [Amended 8-21-1989 by
Ord. No. 89-17]
C. Existing features which would add value to residential development or
to the Township as a whole, such as trees and other vegetation,
watercourses and falls, beaches, historic spots and similar
irreplaceable assets, shall be preserved in the design of the subdivision.
D. No trees shall be removed from any subdivision nor any change of
grade of the land effected until approval of the preliminary plat has
been granted.
E. The preliminary plat shall show the number and location of existing
trees as required by these regulations and shall further indicate all
those marked for retention and the location of all proposed shade trees
required along the street side of each lot as required by these

factor in determining the location of open space, buildings,
underground services, walks, paved areas, playgrounds, parking areas
and finished grade levels.
G. All trees on the plat required to be retained shall be preserved, and all
trees where required shall be welled and protected against change of
grade.
H. Every effort should be made to avoid removal of trees having a caliper
of five inches or greater from the property in the process of subdividing,
grading or installing improvements. Where, in the judgment of the
Planning Board, such removal is unavoidable, a plan and a statement of
material to be removed, replaced and/or demolished shall be submitted
for approval.

specified by § 163-32 or as much thereof as is possible within his
property, along all existing streets that traverse or abut his property.
D. Where subdivision borders an existing narrow road or when the Master
Plan or Official Map (if any) or zoning setback regulations indicate
plans for realignment or widening a road that would require use of
some of the land in the subdivision, the applicant shall be required to
improve and dedicate such areas for widening or realignment of such
roads. Such frontage roads and streets shall be improved and dedicated
by the applicant to the full width as required by these subdivision
regulations for acquisition. Provision for cost allocation of such
improvements shall be in accordance with Article VI.
E. Land reserved for any road purposes may not be counted in satisfying
yard or area requirements of Chapter 203, Zoning, whether the land is

E. Curbs shall be provided for a distance of 200 feet from the curb return
on each side of any new street which connects with an arterial street.
F. Where a subdivision results in lots with frontage on a primary or
secondary arterial street that, due to its size, shape or other peculiar or
unusual circumstances, makes the provision of a service road or
reverse frontage impractical or unnecessary, the lot or lots in said
subdivision shall have driveways so laid out that it is possible to turn
passenger vehicles on the lot and it is not necessary to back any
passenger vehicle into the street.
G. No subdivision containing reserve strips controlling access to streets
shall be approved except where the control and disposal of land
comprising such strips has been placed in the Township under
conditions approved by the Planning Board.
H. The creation of reserve strips shall not be permitted adjacent to a
proposed street in such a manner as to deny access from adjacent
property to such street.

with state and local standards, and in conformity with the existing signs
already established in the Township (if any).
A. Service streets are prohibited in subdivisions for single-family detached
residences, except where required to avoid direct driveway access to
arterial or collector streets.
B. Dead-end service streets shall be avoided, but if necessary, service

grassed or landscaped areas shall separate all sidewalks from adjacent
curbs.
E. The Planning Board may require, in order to facilitate pedestrian access
from the roads to schools, parks, playgrounds or other nearby roads,
perpetual unobstructed easements at least 10 feet in width. Easements
shall be indicated on the preliminary plat.
§ 163-37 WOOLWICH CODE § 163-40
159:530
§ 163-40. Blocks.
§ 163-41. Lots.
A. Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two tiers of lots of
appropriate depths. Exceptions to this prescribed block width shall be
permitted in blocks adjacent to major streets, railroads or waterways.
B. The lengths, widths and shapes of blocks shall be such as are
appropriate for the locality and the type of development contemplated.
C. Wherever practicable, blocks along major arterials shall be not less
than 1,000 feet in length.
D. In long blocks, the Planning Board may require the reservation of an
easement through the block to accommodate utilities, drainage
facilities or pedestrian traffic.
E. Pedestrianways or crosswalks, not less than 10 feet wide, may be
required by the Planning Board through the center of blocks more than
800 feet long where deemed essential to provide circulation or access
to schools, playgrounds, shopping centers, transportation or other
community facilities.
F. Blocks designed for industrial uses shall be of such length and width as
may be determined suitable by the Planning Board for the prospective
use.
A. Size, shape and orientation of lots shall conform with Chapter 203,
Zoning, and shall be appropriate for the type of development and use
contemplated.
B. Where lots are more than double the minimum required areas for the
zoning district, the Planning Board may require that such lots be
arranged so as to allow further subdivision and the opening of future
streets where they would be necessary to serve such potential lots, all
in compliance with Chapter 203, Zoning, and these regulations.
C. If feasible, side lot lines shall be at right angles to straight street lines
or radial to curved street lines.
D. If feasible, lot lines shall follow municipal boundaries rather than cross
them in order to avoid jurisdictional problems.
E. The depth of a residential lot for a single-family detached home shall
not be less than one nor more than 2 1/2 times its width. [Amended
3-15-1999 by Ord. No. 99-6]
F. Depth and width of parcels intended for nonresidential uses shall be
adequate for the use proposed and sufficient to provide satisfactory
space for on-site parking, loading and unloading, setbacks and
landscaping.
§ 163-40 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS § 163-41
159:531
§ 163-42. Buffer areas.
In the instance where the Planning Board determines that buffer planting
or fencing is necessary to protect the general welfare of the public, planted
buffer areas shall be installed to provide a year-round visual screen of such
width, height and location as approved by the Planning Board. The size,
variety and planting design of the buffer area shall be as approved by the
Township Planning Board. Fencing shall be installed to provide a physical
barrier as approved by the Planning Board.
§ 163-43. Storm drainage.
G. Each lot must front upon a public or private street approved in
accordance with the requirements and standards of this chapter.
Private streets shall have direct access to public streets.
H. Double frontage and reversed frontage lots shall be avoided except
where necessary to provide separation of residential development from
traffic arterials or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography
and orientation.
I. Lots shall not, in general, derive access exclusively from an arterial
street. Where driveway access from an arterial street may be necessary
for several adjoining lots, the Planning Board may require that such lots
be served by a combined access drive in order to limit possible traffic
hazards on such street.
J. Where there is a question as to the suitability of a lot or lots for their
intended use due to factors such as rock formations, flood conditions or
similar circumstances, the Planning Board may, after adequate
investigation, withhold approval of such lots.
A. Storm sewers, culverts, natural and man-made drainage channels and
retention basins and related installations shall be provided as necessary
to permit unimpeded flow of natural watercourses, to ensure adequate
drainage of all low points along streets, to intercept stormwater runoff
along streets at intervals related to the extent and grade of the area
drained and to provide positive drainage away from on-site sewage
disposal facilities where such facilities are permitted.
B. Where existing storm sewers are reasonably accessible, proposed
subdivisions shall be required, if necessary, to connect therewith.
C. In subdivisions containing lots less than 15,000 square feet in area and
in business and industrial districts, underground storm sewer systems
shall be constructed throughout the subdivisions and be conducted to
an approved outfall.
D. Permanent natural and/or man-made drainage channels and detention
basins shall be provided to control the increased storm runoff that may
result from increasing the impervious area within the subdivision. In all
instances the detention shall be such as to reduce the rate of runoff
§ 163-41 WOOLWICH CODE § 163-43
159:532
from the ten-percent (so-called ten-year) storm in the developed
condition to that which would have occurred the undeveloped
condition. In instances where there is no provision for conducting the
water to natural streams, the detention shall be adequate for all of
the runoff from a two-percent (so-called fifty-year) storm. Spillways
or emergency spillways of any detention facility shall be capable of
passing the runoff from at least the one-percent (so-called one-hundredyear)
storm. In the design of storm drainage facilities, special
consideration shall be given to avoidance of problems that may arise
from the concentration of stormwater runoff onto adjacent developed
or undeveloped properties.
E. A culvert or other drainage facility shall in each case be large enough to
accommodate potential runoff from entire upstream drainage area,
whether inside or outside the subdivision. The Municipal Engineer shall
review the necessary size of the facility, based on the provisions of
construction standards and specifications assuming conditions of
maximum potential watershed development permitted by Chapter 203,
Zoning.
F. The developer shall study the effect of each subdivision on existing
downstream drainage facilities outside the area of the subdivision.
These studies, together with such other studies as shall be appropriate,
shall serve as a guide to needed improvements.
G. Where it is anticipated that the additional runoff incident to the
development of the subdivision will overload an existing downstream
drainage facility, the Planning Board may withhold approval of the
subdivision until provision has been made for the improvement of said
potential conditions by a contribution from the developer in such sum
as the Planning Board shall determine adequate.
H. No subdivision shall be approved unless adequate drainage will be
provided to an adequate drainage watercourse or facility.
I. Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, there shall be
provided a drainage easement conforming substantially with the line of
such watercourse, drainageway, channel or stream at least 15 feet wide
or of such width as will be adequate to preserve the unimpeded flow of
natural drainage or for the purpose of widening, deepening, relocating,
maintaining, improving or protecting such drainage facilities.
J. Any changes in an existing drainageway shall be subject to the approval
of the Township Planning Board and the Gloucester County Planning
Board as applicable, as well as meeting the requirements for any state
permits.
K. The applicant shall be required by the Planning Board to carry away by
pipe or open ditch any spring or surface water that may exist either
previous to or as a result of the subdivision. Such drainage facilities
shall be located in the road right-of-way where feasible or in perpetual
unobstructed easements of appropriate width and shall be constructed
§ 163-43 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS § 163-43
159:533
in accordance with appropriate construction standards and
specifications and shall be approved by the Municipal Engineer.
L. Trash bars shall be installed on all pipes equal to or greater than 30
inches in diameter.
M. Pipeline design:
(1) Storm sewer pipelines shall be designed by either of the following
two methods. Both shall be based on the Manning equation and
shall utilize the following friction factors:
n = 0.015 concrete pipe
n = 0.021 corrugated metal pipe
(2) The minimum allowable pipe size is 15 inches.
N. Pipeline submerged.
(1) This method is based on the assumption that when the storm sewer
system is under maximum load the hydraulic gradient will be at or
above the crown of the pipe and that flow in the lines will be
controlled by head differentials between structures or other
locations where the system is open to the ground surface, such as
inlets or outlets manholes and stream inlets or outlets. The head of
water above the crown of any pipe can range from zero feet to a
point which will not cause surface flooding.
(2) The slope of the hydraulic gradient in any section of storm sewer
between opening to the surface shall be calculated on the
assumption that the pipe is flowing full at a constant velocity and at
the required capacity.
(3) The elevation of the hydraulic gradient at any point in the pipe shall
be no lower than the crown of the pipe and no higher than the
surface of the ground.
(4) At all structures such as manholes, inlets, etc., where the pipe size
does not change, the elevation of the hydraulic gradient shall be
dropped 0.2 feet to allow for losses therein. Where the inlet and
outlet pipe sizes are not the same, the elevation of the hydraulic
gradient shall be dropped an amount based on the following
formula:
H = 0.2 feet + 0.8 (D2-DI) feet
D1 = Diameter of inlet pipe
D2 = Diameter of outlet pipe
If D1 is larger than D2, head loss = 0.2 feet
§ 163-43 WOOLWICH CODE § 163-43
159:534
(5) The minimum slope of any pipe shall be such that a minimum
velocity of 2.5 feet per second shall be maintained when the pipe is
flowing 1/4 full.
O. Pipeline flowing full.
(1) This method is based on the assumption that the hydraulic gradient
will match the inside top of the pipe when the system is under
maximum hydraulic load.
(2) For this method, head losses through manholes, inlets, etc., shall be
ignored.
(3) The minimum slope of any pipe shall be such that a minimum
velocity of 2.5 feet per second shall be maintained when the pipe is
flowing 1/4 full.
(4) When the pipe sizes change, the inside tops of the pipes shall be
matched.
(5) Continuous profiles for each reach of pipe shall be plotted along
with the location of the hydraulic gradient and the hydraulic
information pertinent to each reach within the system. This
information shall include the pipe size and type, the "n" factor, the
slope of the hydraulic gradient, slope of the pipe, the design
capacity and the velocity at the design capacity.
P. Inlet design:
(1) Stormwater inlets shall be equal to New Jersey State Highway
Department inlet Type B. The maximum collecting capacities of the
inlets shall be considered to be:
(a) When installed on the streets where the grade is 1.00%: 5
cubic feet per second.
(b) When installed on streets where the grade is 2.00%: 4.8 cubic
feet per second.
(c) When installed on streets where the grade is 3.00%: 4.6 cubic
feet per second.
(d) When installed on streets where the grade is 4.00%: 4.4 cubic
feet per second.
(e) When installed on streets where the grade is 5.00%: 4.2 cubic
feet per second.
(f) When installed on streets where the grade is 6.00%: 4 cubic
feet per second.
(2) Sufficient inlets shall be located and that the length of surface
runoff will not contribute a runoff to the inlet exceeding the
preceding designated collecting capacities.
§ 163-43 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS § 163-43
159:535
(3) The gutter grate of all inlets shall be set not less than two inches,
nor more than four inches, below the gutter grade. The surface of
the paving adjacent to the inlets shall be constructed to blend into
the lowered gutter grade at the inlet in such a manner that a
sudden dropoff or dip at the inlet will not be created. At such
locations where drainage is entirely dependent on inlets, the
collecting capacities of the inlets shall be designed for 1/2 of the
preceding consider capacities.
(4) Where surface water is collected from two directions at one street
corner, inlets shall be placed at or near the tangent points of both
ends of the radius. The use of one inlet in the radius will not be
allowed.
(5) Access manholes shall be spaced at five-hundred-foot intervals
(maximum) through rights-of-way and at sewer junctions where
there are no catch basins.
Q. Open channel design. Open channel design should be based on the
following hydraulic considerations:
(1) Manning's equation
(a) Friction factor.
n = .015 - best concrete-lined ditch
n = .025 - best unlined ditch
n = .03 to .05 - fair to poor natural streams and watercourses
(b) Velocity range.
Excavation Material Velocity
(feet per second)
Fine sand and firm loam 2.50 to 3.5
Stiff clay and hardpan 3.75 to 6.0
Concrete lined ditch 15
(2) Ample freeboard should be provided on all channels.
(3) The channel should be designed to conform, wherever possible, to
the adjacent ground conditions. This means that it should not be
projecting excessively above the surrounding ground or placed
excessively below the surrounding ground.
(4) Continuous profiles for each reach of open channel shall be plotted,
along with the adjacent average ground and the hydraulic
information pertinent to each reach within the system. This
information shall include the type of channel lining, the "n" factor,
the width of the channel bottom, the side slopes, the water depth,
the design capacity and the velocity at the design capacity.
§ 163-43 WOOLWICH CODE § 163-43
159:536
(5) Open channels shall have a maximum side slope of three to one and
shall have adequate slope protection.
(6) Culverts. All culverts shall be limited to a single opening; multiple
pipes will not be permitted. The design of culverts shall be such as
to minimize the probability of debris accumulation.
(7) Retention basin design. Retention basins shall be required on all
major subdivisions unless deemed unnecessary by the Municipal
Engineer.
(8) Determination of project area runoff:
(a) Using natural ground coefficient.
(b) Using ultimate developed ground coefficient.
(9) Require storage for 5.5 inches maximum rainfall (twenty-four-hour
rainfall occurring in 1960), or as required by the New Jersey Water
Policy and Supply Council.
(10) Indicate flooded area if additional 2 inches of rainfall occurred
during 24 hours following the design storm.
(11) Allowance for percolation and evaporation out of basins during and
after the storm will not be considered in the calculations.
(12) 86Basin storage capacities shall be calculated as follows:
Storage volume (in cubic feet) =
Project area (in square feet) x difference
in coefficients x total rainfall (in inches)
12
- outflow (in cubic feet)
(13) The outlet structure shall be capable of discharging water at a rate
equal to or less than the contribution calculated for the drainage
basin area in its natural state before development for a ten-year
storm period.
(14) If required, profiles and sections indicating downstream capacities
and proposals and/or easements for reconstruction or cleaning of

Engineer.
C. All other areas which will not be covered by a permanent hard or
impervious surface within one month of commencement of earthmoving
must be stabilized immediately upon completion of the disturbance.
Stabilization, either temporary or permanent, is to be done by
mulching, seeding, sodding, macadam, crushed stone or gravel,
bituminous or any other appropriate stabilizing method. A minimum top
dressing of three inches shall be required when mulching, crushed
stone or gravel is to be used as a stabilizing medium.
D. No cut trees, timber, debris, earth, rocks, stones soil, junk, rubbish or
other waste materials of any kind shall be buried in any land or left or
deposited on any lot or street at the time of the issuance of a certificate
of occupancy, and removal of same shall be required prior to issuance of
any certificate of occupancy on a subdivision, nor shall any be left or
deposited in any area of the subdivision at the time of expiration of the
performance guaranty or dedication of public improvements, whichever
is sooner.
E. Where lawn is to be provided by the subdivider or developer, lawn-grass
seed shall be sown at not less than four pounds to each 1,000 square
feet of land area. In the spring, the seed shall be sown between March 1
and May 15, and in the fall, the seed shall be sown between August 15
and October 15. The seed shall consist of a maximum of 10% rye grass
by weight and a minimum of 90% of permanent bluegrass and/or fescue
grass by weight. All seed shall have been tested for germination within
one year of the date of seeding, and the date of testing shall be on the
label containing the seed analyses. Sod of an appropriate grass may be

graded to required elevations, then applied with a permanent subbase
and/or base course which should be brought to final grade and the
permanent surface applied.
G. At a point where runoff leaves each site a sediment basin or basins shall
be constructed. The sediment basin(s) shall be designed in a manner
approved by the Municipal Engineer and the Gloucester County Soil
Conservation District. Following permanent stabilization of the site, the
basin may be removed or retained. If retained, silt must be removed
within one year after completion of development.
H. Sediment basins designed for watershed areas less than 70 acres that
include provisions for periodic cleanout shall be designed to contain 0.6
inches of runoff or 0.05 acre-feet per acre of contributing runoff water
and sediment.
I. Sediment basin cleanout shall be required when the storage capacity is
reduced by sediment accumulation to 0.02 acre-feet per acre of
drainage area or within one year after completion of development.
J. Sediment basins serving watershed areas larger than 70 acres, and
those for which periodic cleanout is not anticipated, shall be designed
to contain sediment capacities appropriate for the size of the
watershed.
K. In general the average sediment basin length should be at least twice
the average width.
L. The performance guaranty shall include an amount to guarantee
completion of all requirements contained in Article V of these
regulations and will also include but not be limited to soil preservation,
final grading, lot drainage, lawn-grass seeding where appropriate,
removal of debris and waste, fencing and all other lot improvements
required by the Planning Board.
M. Whether or not a certificate of occupancy has been issued, at the
expiration of the performance guaranty, the Township Committee may
enforce the provisions of the guaranty where the provisions of this
section or any other applicable law, guaranty, ordinance or regulation
have not been met.
A. Regulations for sewerage facilities.

sewers accessible to each lot in the subdivision.
(b) Where public sanitary sewerage systems are not reasonably
accessible but will become available within a reasonable time
(not to exceed 10 years), the applicant may choose one of the
following alternatives:
[1] Central sewerage system, the maintenance cost to be
assessed against each property benefited. Where plans for
future public sanitary sewerage systems exist, the
applicant shall install the sewer lines, laterals and mains to
be in permanent conformance with such plans and ready
for connection to such public sewer mains; or
[2] Individual disposal systems, provided that the applicant
shall install sanitary sewer lines, laterals and mains from
the street curb to a point in the subdivision boundary
where a future connection with the public sewer main
shall be made.
(6) Sewer lines shall be laid from the house to the street line, and a
connection shall be available in the home to connect from the
individual disposal system to the sewer system when the public
sewers become available. Such sewer systems shall be capped until

(28) The difference in elevation between any incoming sewer and the
manhole invert shall not exceed 12 inches, except where required
to match crowns.
(29) The use of drop manholes will require approval by the Municipal
Engineer. The minimum inside diameter of the manholes shall
conform to those approved by the Municipal Engineer.
(30) When a smaller sewer joins a larger one, the crown of the smaller
sewer shall not be lower than that of the larger one. The minimum
drop through manholes shall be 0.2 feet.

K. A copy of the approval of such fire hydrant installations by the
appropriate public agency and utility company shall be submitted with
the final plat, along with suitable agreement (in a form determined by
the Township Attorney) establishing that the ownership of the fire
hydrants shall be conveyed to the Township at no cost to the Township
at the time the fire hydrants are first available for their intended use.
L. To eliminate future street openings, all underground utilities for fire
hydrants, together with the fire hydrants themselves, and all other
supply improvements shall be installed before any final paving of a
street shown on the subdivision plat.
A. In reviewing subdivision plans, the Planning Board shall consider
whether community facilities in the area, especially schools, are
adequate to serve the needs of the additional dwellings proposed by the
subdivision and shall make such report thereon as it deems necessary
in the public interest. The applicant should provide a brief impact
statement for review by the Board.
B. Subdividers shall reserve land for both public and quasi-public
community facilities and will reserve areas for facilities normally
required in residential neighborhoods, including churches, libraries,
schools and other public buildings and parks, playgrounds and
playfields.
C. Areas provided or reserved for such community facilities should be
suitably prepared to provide for such use. Prior to the preparation of
plans, subdividers of large tracts should review with the Planning Board
the minimum standards for various community facilities applicable to
the tract being subdivided.
D. In subdivisions that are intended to contain five or more dwelling units,
the Planning Board shall consider the need for suitable open areas for
recreation and shall make a recommendation thereon. Standards to be
used by the Planning Board in determining space for recreation shall be
as follows: [Amended 3-15-1999 by Ord. No. 99-6; 4-7-2003 by

E. An individual area of less than two acres shall not be reserved for
recreation purposes if it will be impractical or impossible to secure
additional lands in order to increase its area unless such smaller area is
approved by the Planning Board, as for example, to provide a tot-lot.
F. Land reserved for recreation purposes shall be of a character and
location suitable for use as a playground, playfield or for other
recreation purposes, shall be relatively level and dry and shall be
improved by the developer to the standards required by the Planning
Board, which improvements shall be included in the performance
guaranty.
G. Reservation of public areas.
(1) If the Master Plan or the Official Map provides for the reservation
of designated streets, public drainageways, flood control basins or
public areas within the proposed development, before approving a
subdivision or site plan, the Planning Board may further require
that such streets, ways, basins or areas be shown on the plat in
locations and sizes suitable to their intended uses. The Planning
Board may reserve the location and extent of such streets, ways,
basins or areas shown on the plat for a period of one year after the
approval of the final plat or within such further time as may be
agreed to by the developer. Unless during such period or extension
thereof the municipality shall have entered into a contract to
purchase or institute condemnation proceedings according to law
for the fee or a lesser interest in the land comprising such streets,
ways, basins or areas, the developer shall not be bound by such
reservations shown on the plat and may proceed to use such land
for private use in accordance with applicable development
regulations. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to
streets and roads, flood control basins or public drainageways
necessitated by the subdivision or land development and required
for final approval.
(2) The developer shall be entitled to just compensation for actual loss
found to be caused by such temporary reservation and deprivation
§ 163-47 WOOLWICH CODE § 163-47
159:546
of use. In such instance, unless a lesser amount has previously been
mutually agreed upon, just compensation shall be deemed to be the
fair market value of an option to purchase the land reserved for
the period of reservation, provided that determination of such fair
market value shall include but not be limited to consideration of the
real property taxes apportioned to the land reserved and prorated
for the period of reservation. The developer shall be compensated
for the reasonable increased cost of legal, engineering or other
professional services incurred in connection with obtaining
subdivision approval or site plan approval, as the case may be,
caused by the reservation. The procedure for the payment of all
compensation payable under this subsection shall be as follows:
(a) After the termination of a period of one year after the approval
of the final plat or after such further time as may be agreed to
between the developer and the Planning Board, and no later
than 90 days thereafter, the developer shall file in triplicate
with the Township Clerk a verified petition requesting
compensation payable under this subsection and setting forth
a detailed, itemized list with separate dollar amounts for each
item for which he seeks compensation.
(b) The governing body, after receipt of such petition, shall fix a
time, place and date for a public hearing on the petition, which
date shall be no later than 60 days from the date of receipt of
the petition by the Municipal Clerk.
(c) Notice of such hearing shall be delivered or mailed by certified
mail to the developer at least 20 days in advance of the
hearings date.
(d) The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the
provisions for hearings by N.J.S.A. 40:55D-10.
(e) At the hearing the developer shall have the burden of
establishing by good and sufficient evidence his entitlement to
compensation and the amounts of such compensation.
(f) Such hearings may be continued by the governing body from
time to time but must be completed within 90 days from the
first hearing date.
(g) Within 90 days after the date of conclusion of hearing, the
Township Committee shall, by resolution, set forth its findings
and determination as to what amount, if any, shall be paid to
the developer. A certified copy of said resolution shall be
delivered or mailed by certified mail to the developer within 10
days of its adoption.
(h) Any payments to be made pursuant to such resolution shall be
made to the developer within 120 days from the date of
adoption of such resolution.

H. Recreational facilities for future residential population. [Added
9-16-1996 by Ord. No. 96-13; amended 2-7-2000 by Ord. No.
00-2; 11-20-2006 by Ord. No. 2006-26]
(1) All lands set aside for open space shall be developed with active
recreational facilities to service the needs of the future residential
population. The Planning Board shall have complete and final
determination as to the adequacy, usefulness and functionalism of
the lands set aside for open space. Active recreational facilities
shall include but not be limited to the following: ball fields,
multipurpose fields, tennis courts, basketball courts, multipurpose
court areas, childrens playground equipment, and swimming
pools. In all developments restricted to the elderly or which are
marketed primarily for single adults, additional facility geared to
the recreational interests of the specific target population of the
development may be chosen by the developer with the approval of
the Planning Board to replace the tot-lot requirements described
herein. In all other residential developments, the developer shall
install, as a minimum, the following recreational facilities upon the
land which has been identified as recreational and/or play areas:
Minimal Recreation Facilities
Dwelling
units Tot-Lot
Multipurpose
Field
Other Recreational
Facilities
5 to 30 1  
31 to 100 1  1
101 to 150 1  2

351 to 400 4 2 4
401 to 450 4 2 5
451 to 500 5 2 5
(2) In order to promote public health and safety, a primary design
criterion shall be the separation of pedestrian traffic and vehicular
traffic. To this end, subdivisions shall be required to provide for
pedestrian multipurpose paths separated from vehicular use
streets. The location and construction of such multipurpose paths
shall be subject to the approval of the Planning Board and the
Township Engineer. Multipurpose paths shall be a minimum of 10
feet wide and construction and lighting shall be installed prior to
occupancy. Prior to final approval for any section, the responsibility
for the construction, operation, maintenance and liability for these
multipurpose paths shall be clearly established. Grade-separated
§ 163-47 WOOLWICH CODE § 163-47
159:548
pedestrian crossings shall be provided across primary roads at
points required by the Planning Board.
(3) (Reserved)87
(4) The Board may require a developer to make certain site
preparation improvements to the open spaces. These may include
the following:
(a) Removal of dead trees or diseased trees.
(b) Thinning of trees or other growth to encourage more desirable
growth.
(c) Grading and seeding.
(d) Improvements of protection of the natural drainage system by
the use of protective structures, stabilization measures and
similar improvements.
(5) Development of open space and recreational facilities shall proceed
at the same rate as development of the dwelling units. To assure
compliance with this subsection, the Planning Board shall require
the approval of an open space and recreational amenity phasing
map which shall become part of an overall phasing plan and
approval for any subdivision, planned and/or clustered
development.
(6) Recreational fee contribution in lieu of on-site recreational
facilities. The requirements of this subsection relating to the
construction of active and passive recreation facilities and the total
percentage of open space required within a development may be
modified and/or waived by the Planning Board, if requested by the
developer, upon the Planning Boards determination that both the
area local to the development and Woolwich Townships park and
recreation needs would be better served by an agreed cash request
based on the cost of the proposed recreational amenities as listed
below, which sums shall be added to the current year municipal
budget when received as a dedication by rider in accordance with
the provisions of N.J.S.A. 40A:4-39.
(7) Amount of contribution. The amount of the contribution required
pursuant to this provision shall be determined by the Planning
Board based upon an evaluation of the cost of the additional impact
upon the existing recreational facilities which service the
community and the need for additional or increased recreational
facilities that will occur as a result of the planned development. The
Board shall also consider the market value of the building lots
which will be achieved by making this payment instead of reserving
87.Editor's Note: Subsection H(3), pertaining to estimated construction costs, was deleted
11-20-2006 by Ord. No. 2006-26.
§ 163-47 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS § 163-47
159:549
the land to recreation facilities. The Board shall assess the
estimated cost of the construction and equipment associated with
the recreational facilities which would be required pursuant to this
section and other costs associated with the provision of adequate
recreational facilities as a community resource to address the
increased population caused by the development and the added
demand for recreational facilities, as well as the added cost to the
Township to maintain the already existing recreational facilities
within the Township which will be subject to a more intensive use
as a result of the increase in population. This assessment may
be made through the testimony of professionals or other such
evidence as may be required by the Board. The cost of this
assessment by professionals shall be borne by the developer. The
total amount of the contribution once so calculated shall be
prorated over the total number of dwelling units as shown on the
preliminary plan for the development or the site plan submitted
by the developer and approved by the Planning Board in order
to determine the actual dwelling unit amount. The Township of
Woolwich has given consideration to these cost factors and has
determined that the amount of the contribution shall in no case
be less than $3,500 per dwelling unit based on the following
methodology:
(a) Calculated cost for recreational amenities (Costs provided
below are based on private contracts. Municipal contracts may
receive lower quotes.):
[1] Tennis court: $50,000.
[2] Basketball court: $50,000.
[3] Tot-lot (2,000 square feet): $40,000.
[4] Ball field: $25,000.
[5] Multipurpose field: $20,000.
(b) Calculated land value (based on a one-hundred-acre site):
100 acres x 60% typical yield = 60 units
100 acres x 10% required open space = 10 acres
10 acres x 60% typical yield = 6 additional units
6 additional units x $100,000 lot value = $600,000
$600,000 x 75% per ordinance = $450,000
$450,000/66 units = $6,818 per unit for required open space
(c) Required recreational facilities for a sixty-six-unit development
is one tot-lot plus one additional recreation facility:
§ 163-47 WOOLWICH CODE § 163-47
159:550
§ 163-48. Certain easements.
1 Tot-lot + 1 tennis court = $40,000 + $50,000 = $90,000
$90,000/66 units = $1,364
(d) Total recreation and open space value: $1,364 plus $6,818
equals $8,182 per unit.
(8) Payment of contribution. Payment of the prorated contribution
required pursuant thereto shall be made prior to the signing of the
final plans by the Planning Board Chairman, Planning Board
Secretary and Township Clerk and shall be made payable to the
designated parks and recreation fund. For good cause shown, the
Planning Board may enter into an agreement to provide that the
payment or payments shall be made at some later time, subject to
the posting of adequate performance guaranties in an amount of
120% of the agreed contribution; subject, however, that the
delayed period of time shall in no event be later than the issuance
of the first certificate of occupancy.
(9) The cash bequest shall be used exclusively for park and recreation
purposes and shall be placed in the current budget line item
designated parks and playgrounds, other expenses. Woolwich
Township reserves the right to use said funds for proper purposes
anywhere within the Township of Woolwich.
A. All utility facilities existing and proposed throughout the subdivision
shall be shown on the preliminary plat.
B. Underground service connections to the street property line of each
platted lot shall be installed at the subdivider's expense.
C. At the discretion of the Planning Board, the requirement for service
connections to each lot may be waived in the case of adjoining lots to be
retained in single ownership and intended to be developed for the same
primary use.
D. All utility facilities, constructed or installed after the effective date of
this chapter, including but not limited to wires, cables, pipes, conduits
and appurtenant equipment, carrying or used in connection with the
furnishing of electric, telephone, telegraph, cable television or similar
service, shall be placed below the surface of the ground, provided that
the following utility facilities shall be permitted above ground:
(1) Electric transmission lines and facilities in excess of 50 kilovolts.
(2) Equipment, such as electric distribution transformers, switchgear,
meter pedestals, telephone pedestals, outdoor lighting poles or
standards, radio antennae and associated equipment, which is,
under accepted utility practices, normally installed above ground.
§ 163-47 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS § 163-48
159:551
(3) Meters, service connections and similar equipment normally
attached to the outside wall of the customer's premises.
E. To the fullest extent possible, easements shall be centered on or
adjacent to rear or side lot lines.
F. No dwelling units or any portion thereof shall be located within 25 feet
of any petroleum, petroleum products or natural gas transmission line
that traverses the subdivision.

§ 163-49. Definitions.
For the purposes of this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
OFF TRACT  Not located on the property which is the subject of a
subdivision application nor on a contiguous portion of a street or right-ofway.
ON TRACT  Located on the property is the subject for a subdivision
application or on a contiguous portion of a street or right-of-way.
§ 163-50. Responsibility of developer for certain off-site
improvements.
Preliminary approval shall contain a condition that the developer pay his
pro rata share of the cost of providing reasonable and necessary street
improvements and water, sewerage and drainage facilities, and easements
therefor, located outside the property limits of the subdivision but
necessitated or required by construction or improvements within such
subdivision or development. Before consideration of a final subdivision plat,
such off-tract improvements shall be built and completed by the developer
or their construction shall have been guaranteed in accordance with the
following provisions which shall apply to such off-tract improvements:
A. Off-tract improvements. At the time application for preliminary
approval for a subdivision is made and again upon application for final
approval, the applicant shall provide the Township Committee with an
estimate of the types and costs of such off-tract improvements and the
amount by which properties, including the subdivision, benefit thereby.
B. Such estimate at the time of application for final approval shall include
detailed supporting data which shall include, but not necessarily be
limited to:
(1) The total cost of the improvement.
(2) The estimated value of the benefit to the applicant.
(3) The estimated value of the benefits conferred upon others in terms
of reasonable likelihood of the use.
(4) The time when such benefits are likely to be conferred.
(5) The reasonable, useful life of the off-tract improvements.
(6) The inflation, deflation or all significant changes in the cost of
construction.
§ 163-49 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS § 163-50
159:553
C. Such estimate at the time of application for preliminary approval shall
be the applicant's best estimates for each of the six above factors
together with his basis therefor.
D. The Township Committee shall decide whether the off-tract
improvements or any combinations of them are to be constructed by the
municipality as a general improvement or as a local improvement, or
whether construction is to be done by the developer with a formula
providing for partial reimbursement to the developer by other property
owners, where the improvements specially benefit properties other
than the subdivision.
E. As a condition for final approval of any stage of a subdivision, the
applicant shall provide the Township with a cash deposit or a
performance guaranty as provided in § 163-10 of this chapter to insure
payment to the Township in the following amounts:
(1) An amount equal to the difference between the estimated cost of
the improvement and the estimated total amount by which all
property to be served hereby, including the subdivision property,
will be specially benefited by the improvement, if the improvement
is to be constructed by the municipality as a general improvement.
(2) The estimated amount by which the subdivision specially benefits
from the improvement, in addition to the amount required for a
general improvement, if the improvement is to be constructed by
the municipality as a local improvement.
(3) An amount equal to the estimated cost of the improvement, if the
improvement is to be constructed by the applicant.
F. If such off-tract improvements or any combination of them are to be
constructed by the applicant, the applicant shall bear the cost of all
such improvements and shall be reimbursed by such specially benefited
property owners if and when any such off-tract improvements are used
in the development of off-tract parcels. The Township Committee may
assess or lien the pro rata cost of such off tract-improvement upon
other specially benefited property owners at such time as such other
specially benefited owner or owners use the off-tract improvements in
the development of off-tract parcels.
G. Actual cost figures, rather than estimated costs, shall be and for making
such allocations once the improvements are constructed. The cost
figures shall be supplied by the applicant and certified by a New Jersey
certified public accountant, after audit. Approval of planned unit
developments, major subdivision or site development plans involving
the use of such off-tract improvements by other specially benefited
property owners outside this subdivision shall be conditioned upon
payment of the pro rata share of the value as so determined, to the
applicant, in the same manner as above.

§ 163-51. Application fees and escrow deposits.
A. Application fees and escrow deposits for subdivisions shall be paid as
required by Chapter 95, Fees, Article I, Application Fees and Escrow
Accounts.
B. Procedure. [Added 9-6-1996 by Ord. No. 96-11]
(1) The application fees and escrow fees recited hereinabove as
minimums must accompany the application. An application shall
not be deemed complete until the application fee and escrow fee
required have been paid. The Planning Board shall exercise its
discretion in establishing the figure required for the escrow fund in
the event that the project will require more time for review than
has been provided for by the figures recited hereinabove or the
project is of a nature that is not expressly included in one of the
aforementioned categories.
(2) Application fees and escrow fees must be submitted in separate
checks payable to "Woolwich Township." The escrow fee shall be
forwarded to the Chief Financial Officer of Woolwich Township for
deposit into a developer's escrow account. The application fee shall
be deposited into the Planning Board account until the end of the
month, at which time the moneys in said account shall be submitted
to the Treasurer of Woolwich Township for deposit into the general
account of Woolwich Township.
(3) The escrow fee shall be retained in order to cover the cost of any
professional services rendered to Woolwich Township, the
Woolwich Township Planning Board or the Woolwich Township
Board of Adjustment for review of applications for development,
review and preparation of documents, inspection of improvements
or other purposes permitted pursuant to the provisions of N.J.S.A.
40:55D-1 et seq. All professional charges for review of an
application for development, review and preparation of documents
or inspection of improvements shall be reasonable and necessary,
given the status and progress of the application of construction.
Review fees shall be charged only in connection with an application
for development presently pending before the Planning Board or
Board of Adjustment or upon review of compliance with conditions
of approval or review of requests for modification or amendment
made by the applicant. A professional shall not review items which
are subject to approval by any state governmental agency and not
under municipal jurisdiction except to the extent consultation with
a state agency is necessary due to the effect of state approvals in
§ 163-51 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS § 163-51
159:555
the subdivision or site plan. If Woolwich Township, the Woolwich
Township Planning Board or the Woolwich Township Board of
Adjustment retains a different professional or consultant in the
place of the professional originally responsible for development,
application review or inspection of improvements, the Township or
the Planning Board or the Board of Adjustment shall be responsible
for all time and expenses of the new professional to become
familiar with the application or the project, and the Township,
Planning Board or Board of Adjustment shall not bill the applicant
or charge the deposit or the escrow account for any such services.
(4) The Township shall be reimbursed for all payments to independent
consultants in accordance with N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.2. If the salary,
staff support and overhead for a municipal professional are
provided by the Township, the charge shall be the maximum
permitted pursuant to the provisions of N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.2. For
other professionals, the charge shall be at the same rate as all
other work of the same nature by the professional for the Township
when fees are not reimbursed or otherwise imposed on applicants
or developers.
(5) All escrow funds shall be utilized by the appropriate Board to pay
the cost of any professional fees incurred by the Board for review
and/or testimony. The term "professional," as used herein, shall
include the services of a duly licensed engineer, surveyor, planner,
attorney, appraiser or other expert who would provide professional
services to ensure that an application complies with the standards
set forth in Township ordinances and experts whose testimony may
be solicited to give further information to the approving Board in
any area addressed by any of applicant's experts.
(6) The following closeout procedure shall apply to all deposits and
escrow accounts established under the provisions of P.L. 1975, c.
291 (N.J.S.A. 40:55D-1 et seq.), and shall commence after the
appropriate Board has granted final approval and signed the
subdivision plat or site plan, in the case of application review
escrows and deposits, or after the improvements have been
approved as provided in Section 41 of P.L. 1975, c. 291 (N.J.S.A.
40:55D-53), in the case of improvement inspection escrows and
deposits. The applicant shall send written notice by certified mail to
the Chief Financial Officer of the Township, to the approving Board
and to the relevant Township professional that the application or
the improvements, as the case may be, are completed. After receipt
of such notice, the professional shall render a final bill to the Chief
Financial Officer within 30 days and shall send a copy
simultaneously to the applicant. The Chief Financial officer shall
render a written final accounting to the applicant on the uses to
which the deposit was put within 45 days of receipt of the final bill.
Any balances remaining in the deposit or escrow account, including
interest in accordance with Section 1 of P.L. 1985, c. 315 (N.J.S.A.
§ 163-51 WOOLWICH CODE § 163-51
159:556
40:55D-53.1), shall be refunded to the developer along with the
final accounting. To facilitate the release of escrow, an applicant
shall submit a signed escrow release voucher with the development
application.
(7) The Chief Financial Officer shall make all of the payments to
professionals for services rendered to the municipality or
approving Board for review of applications for development, review
and preparation of documents, inspection of improvements or other
purposes under the provisions of P.L. 1975, c. 291 (N.J.S.A.
40:55D-1 et seq). Each payment charged to the deposit for review
of applications, review and preparation of documents and
inspection of improvements shall be pursuant to a voucher from the
professional, which voucher shall identify the personnel
performing the service and, for each date the services performed,
the hours spent to one-fourth-hour increments, the hourly rate and
the expenses incurred. All professionals shall submit vouchers to
the Chief Financial Officer on a monthly basis in accordance with
schedules and procedures established by the Chief Financial
Officer. If the services are provided by a Township employee, the
Township employee shall prepare and submit to the Chief Financial
Officer a statement containing the same information as required on
a voucher on a monthly basis. The professional shall send an
informational copy of all vouchers or statements submitted to the
Chief Financial Officer simultaneously to the applicant. The Chief
Financial Officer shall prepare and send to the applicant a
statement which shall include an accounting of funds listing all
deposits, interest earnings, disbursements and the cumulative
balance of the escrow account. This information shall be provided
on a quarterly basis, if monthly charges are $1,000 or less, or on a
monthly basis, if monthly charges exceed $1,000. If an escrow
account or deposit contains insufficient funds to enable the
Township or approving authority to perform required application
reviews or improvement inspections, the Chief Financial Officer
shall provide the applicant with a notice of the insufficient escrow
or deposit balance. In order for work to continue on the
development or the application, the applicant shall, within a
reasonable time period, post a deposit to the account in an amount
to be agreed upon by the Township or approving authority and the
applicant. In the interim, any required health and safety
inspections shall be made and charged back against the
replenishment of funds.
(8) An applicant shall notify, in writing, the governing body, with copies
to the Chief Financial Officer, the approving authority and the
professional, whenever the applicant disputes the charges made by
a professional for service rendered to the Township in reviewing
applications for development, review and preparation of
documents, inspection of improvements or other charges made
pursuant to the provisions of P.L. 1975, c. 291 (N.J.S.A. 40:55D-1 et
§ 163-51 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS § 163-51
159:557
seq.). The governing body or its designee shall, within a reasonable
time period, attempt to remediate any disputed charges. If the
matter is not resolved to the satisfaction of the applicant, the
applicant may appeal to the County Construction Board of Appeals
established under Section 9 of P.L. 1975, c. 217 (N.J.S.A.
52:27D-127), any charge to an escrow account or a deposit by any
Township professional or consultant or the cost of the installation
of improvements estimated by the Municipal Engineer pursuant to
Section 15 of P.L. 1991, c. 256 (N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.4). An applicant
or his authorized agent shall submit the appeal in writing to the
County Construction Board of Appeals. The applicant or his
authorized agent shall simultaneously send a copy of the appeal
to the Township, the approving authority and any professional
whose charge is the subject of the appeal. An applicant shall file
an appeal within 45 days from receipt of the informational copy
of the professional's voucher required by Subsection c of Section
13 of P.L. 1991, c. 256 (N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.2), except that, if the
professional has not supplied the applicant with an informational
copy of the professional's voucher, the applicant shall file his appeal
within 60 days from receipt of the Township statement of activity
against the deposit or escrow account required by Subsection c of
Section 13 of P.L. 1991, c. 256 (N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.2). An applicant
may file an appeal for an ongoing series of charges by a
professional during a period not exceeding six months to
demonstrate that they represent a pattern of excessive or
inaccurate charges. An applicant making use of this provision need
not appeal each charge individually.88

towing services. There shall be no additional charges other than those
provided herein, including but not limited to flatbedding, waiting time,

TREES
§ 177-1. Intent and purposes.
E. Failure to surrender the license upon revocation shall constitute a
violation of this chapter.
F. Nothing contained herein shall prevent or limit the right of any person
to commence or maintain an action for damages or any other relief
directly against an official tower in a court of competent jurisdiction.
A. Any person who shall violate any of the provisions of this chapter shall,
upon conviction, be punished by a fine not to exceed $1,000, and each
violation of any of the provisions of this chapter and each day the same
is violated shall be deemed and taken to be a separate and distinct
offense.
B. In addition to the fine imposed above, a violation of any of the
provisions of this chapter shall be cause for revocation of the official
tower's license.
A. Indiscriminate, uncontrolled and excess destruction, removal and
cutting of trees upon lots and tracts of land within Woolwich Township
may cause increased drainage control costs, increased soil erosion and
sedimentation, decreased fertility of the soil, degradation of water
resources, decreased groundwater recharge, increased buildup of
atmospheric carbon dioxide, the establishment of a heat island effect
and increased dust and pollution. The singular or cumulative effect of
any of the foregoing could adversely impact the character of Woolwich
Township, decrease property values, render the land unfit and
unsuitable for its most appropriate use and negatively affect the health,
safety and general welfare of Woolwich's residents. Thus, the Township
governing body desires to regulate and control indiscriminate and
excessive cutting of trees within the Township and to require
appropriate tree replacement. This environmental regulation is enacted
pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:48-2.
B. It is recognized that there is a strong interrelationship between the
integrity of the Township's water resources, development on steep
slopes, tree removal, soil disturbance, storm water management and
the general use of the land resources. Fewer trees throughout the
Township also correlates with increased air pollution as trees are an
important ecological resource. Therefore, the governing body finds that
the appropriate management of these resources is an important health,
safety and general welfare concern. Managing the Township's tree
resources are consistent with the state-approved Community Forestry
§ 175-13 TOPSOIL § 177-1
173:581
Management Plan. The appropriate management guidelines for tree
preservation to be utilized are:
(1) The American National Standard, ANSI A300 (Part 5) -
Management;
(2) Trees and Development: A Technical Guide to Preservation of Trees
During Land Development, Nelda Matheny and James R. Clark; and
(3) Protection and Care of the Urban Forest, NJDEP Division of Parks
and Forestry.
C. Trees are declared to be an important cultural, ecological, scenic and
economic resource. Proper management of this resource will ensure its
maintenance and result in economic returns. A forestry management
program is intended to meet the objectives of preserving, protecting,
enhancing and maintaining trees and providing opportunities for the
continued use of forest resources which are compatible with the
maintenance of the environment. This will be accomplished by ensuring
proper management of forest and trees through the application of
sound management practices. To that end, it shall be unlawful to cut
down, damage, poison or in any other manner destroy or cause to be
destroyed any trees covered by this chapter, except in accordance
herewith.
D. The enforcement of this chapter shall be the duty of the Shade Tree
Commission of Woolwich Township and/or its agents, such as the Tree
Specialist, through the regulation, planting, care and control of shade,
ornamental and evergreen trees and shrubs in the streets, highways,
public places of the Township and tree removal on all lands within the
Township.
E. The Township of Woolwich is not responsible for compliance or
enforcement of the Freshwater Protection Act, Flood Hazard Area
Control Act92 and associated transition areas or buffer zones. The
actions of the Tree Specialist in granting or denying an application to
remove or harvest tress shall not be construed as a confirmation of the
presence or absence of freshwater wetlands or transition areas on the
site of the proposed activity, or any portion thereof or a confirmation of
compliance with the FWPA.
F. If there is any question whether the site of the proposed activity is
located in a freshwater wetland, transition area, flood hazard area, or
other areas regulated by NJAC 7:7A and NJAC 7:13 on a site, the
Township of Woolwich strongly recommends that the person proposing
to engage in such activity apply for a letter of interpretation (LOI) line
verification from NJDEP Division of Land Use Regulation (DLURP)
confirming the presence, absence and boundaries of such regulated
areas. Questions regarding compliance should be referred to NJDEP or

§ 177-2. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
CALIPER: ANSI Z60 FOR NURSERY STOCK  Caliper is a type of diameter
measurement used in the nursery industry. The height measurement shall
be taken from ground level for field grown stock and from the soil line
for container grown stock, which should be at or near the top of the root
flare. Caliper measurement of the trunk shall be taken six inches above the
top of root flare up to and including four-inch caliper size. If the caliper
at six inches above the ground exceeds four inches, the caliper should be
measured at 12 inches above the top of root flare. Seldom are tree trunks
perfectly round. The most accurate measurement will result from the use
of a diameter tape. Caliper measurements taken with manual or electronic
"slot" or "pincer" type caliper tools should be the average of the smallest
and largest measurements.
DIAMETER BREAST HEIGHT (DBH)  The diameter of a tree measured
4 1/2 feet above the ground level.
EROSION  The detachment and movement of soil or rock fragments by
water, ice, wind and gravity.
EXEMPT AREA  The lot area as provided in this chapter for which tree
replacement shall not be required.
FLOOD HAZARD AREA  Commonly referred to as floodplains and riparian
zones, are regulated under the Flood Hazard Area Control Act Rule at
N.J.A.C. 7:13. A flood hazard area includes the floodway and the flood
fringe area. The flood hazard area includes any land, and any space above
that land, which lies below the flood hazard area design flood elevation
(DFE), which is equal to the Federal Emergency Management Agency's
(FEMA) 100-year floodplain in coastal areas and at least one foot higher
than FEMA's floodplain in fluvial (noncoastal) areas. Structures, fill, and
vegetation that are situated on land that lies below the flood hazard area
design flood elevation are described as being "in" or "within" the flood
hazard area.
FORESTRY MANAGEMENT PLAN  A plan for the management of
timbered or forested lands approved by the New Jersey Department of
Environmental Protection, New Jersey Forest Service, or similar state or
federal agency.
HISTORIC TREE  A tree that has been found to be of notable historic
interest to Woolwich Township because of its age, type, size or historic
association and which has been so designated and that designation has
been officially made and promulgated as part of the official records of
the Township and accompanied by a resolution of the governing body so
designating said tree.

OPEN SPACE  Any parcel or area of land or water essentially unimproved
and set aside, dedicated, designated or reserved for public or private use
and enjoyment or for the use and enjoyment of owners and occupants of
land adjoining or neighboring such open spaces, provided that such areas
may be improved with only those buildings, structures, streets and off-street
parking and other improvements that are designated to be incidental to the
natural openness of the land.
SELECTIVE LOGGING  The cutting out of certain trees in a stand as
defined by specific criteria (species, diameter at breast height, or height
and form), that are mature or defective, or of inferior kinds to encourage
the growth of the remaining trees in a forest or wood. Selective logging will
leave some trees standing, which allows for natural regrowth, less impact
on the wildlife, and less ugly patches in the landscape.
SPECIMEN TREE  Any tree in fair or better condition which is so
designated by the Shade Tree Commission based on considerations of
whether the tree is a rare species of specimen thereof: is abnormal in
height, trunk diameter or drip line circumference for a tree of its species;
has foliage of an unusual quality for a tree of its species; occupies a
location which confers special shade tree, erosion control, aesthetic, scenic
enhancement, historic, preservation or cultural values to the community.
For purposes of this definition, "in fair or better condition" shall mean
that a tree has a relatively sound and solid trunk with no evidence of
extensive decay or visual evidence of being hollow and with no major insect
or pathological problem.
STATE RECORD TREE  The largest tree of each species found in New
Jersey as listed on the NJ State Big Tree Register.
STEEP SLOPES  Any slope equal to or greater than 11%, as measured
over a minimum run of 10 feet. Figure 9 of the Woolwich Township
Environmental Resource Inventory demonstrates how slope is calculated.

right-of-way, whether in improved (between the sidewalk and the curb) or
unimproved (no sidewalk and/or curb) right-of-way.
TREE  Any deciduous or coniferous species which has a DBH of five inches
or greater.
TREE ESCROW FUND  A fund established by the governing body for the

This individual shall be responsible for the inspection of sites for which
applications are filed under this chapter. This individual will be responsible
for the administration and protection requirements of this chapter and
enforcement of the ordinance. This individual shall also have the
responsibility of reviewing an approved forest management plan and
inspecting the forested site for plan compliance if requested by the tax
assessor.
WETLANDS  Are those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface
or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and

calculated amount for the true cost replacement value. The value of
the proposed landscape material shall be calculated based upon
average local material costs for planting.
B. The applicant will receive a one-for-one replacement tree credit should
stands of 10 or more trees greater than six inches in diameter be
preserved within the limit of the disturbance line (exempt area).
C. All replacement trees shall be planted on site in accordance with the
foregoing. However, if one or more of the following conditions exist,
some or all of the replacement trees may be planted off site:
(1) The site in question cannot physically accommodate the total
number of replacement trees, and the applicant contributes an
amount equal to the calculated monetary value of non-replaced
trees to the Tree Escrow Fund; or

owned property pursuant to the municipal tree planting plan. This
option shall require Township Committee approval.
A. Barriers.
(1) Prior to construction and any tree removals, suitable tree
protective barriers shall be erected and this protection, where
required, shall remain until such time as the protection is
authorized to be removed by the Tree Specialist or after issuance of
a final certificate of occupancy. In addition, during construction no
attachments or wires shall be attached to any of said trees so
protected. Where some grading must take place within the drip line
of trees, or 15 feet from the trunk diameter, whichever is less, in
the protection zone (outside the exempt area), appropriate
measures shall be taken to minimize impact to the trees. Any trees
seriously damaged during construction must be professionally
treated by a New Jersey-certified tree expert or replaced if the
damage is beyond treatment.
(2) A detail of the existing tree self-supported protective barrier shall
be provided on all applications. The protective barrier shall be a
minimum of four feet high.

the limit of clearing and around the entire drip line for trees to
remain undisturbed within the limit of clearing (exempt area).
(4) It shall be unlawful for any person in the construction of any
structure or other improvement to place solvents, material,
construction machinery or temporary soil deposits within the drip
line.

§ 177-11. Tree replacement.
Any tree removed in connection with an application that requires Joint
Land Use Board approval, construction of a building or other improvement
shall be replaced as provided under other provisions of this chapter, unless
said tree is located in an exempt area or is dead or fatally diseased as
determined by the Tree Specialist or certified tree expert. Tree replacement
shall be in accordance with either Subsection A, B, C or D below or a
combination of Subsections A, B, C and D.
A. Standard replacement. For each tree six inches in DBH or greater that
is removed, the applicant shall prepare a replanting plan for other areas
of the property. The replacement plan or landscape plan shall generally
reflect a one-to-one tree replacement for each tree six inches or greater
to be removed. All proposed replacement trees shall be in accordance
with selections from Trees For New Jersey Streets, published by the
New Jersey Shade Tree Federation, and Street Tree Factsheets, a
publication of the Municipal Tree Restoration Program, and submitted
for review and approval prior to the issuance of a tree removal permit.
Please see table in § 177-9.
B. Tree area replacement/reforestation: For each square foot of tree area
to be removed, the applicant shall prepare a reforestation scheme on
other treeless open space areas of the property to compensate for the
tree removals. The reforestation plan shall be based on a twenty-footby-
twenty-foot grid. Of this number of trees, 10% shall be balled and
burlapped, two-inch to two-and-one-half-inch caliper, 20% shall be
balled and burlapped, one-and-three-quarter-inch to two-inch caliper,
30% shall be bare root one-and-one-quarter- to one-and-one-half-inch
caliper, and 40% shall be bare root six-foot- to eight-foot-tall whips. A
mixture of trees, indigenous to the area and site, shall be utilized.
Proposed trees shall be planted in natural groves and may be spaced
five feet to 20 feet on center. The ground shall be seeded with a grass
mixture approved by the Shade Tree Commission. The reforestation
formula shall follow the guidelines as set forth in the New Jersey No Net
Loss Reforestation Act.96
C. Credits. The permit applicant will receive a one-to-one replacement
tree credit:
(1) For stands of 10 or more trees within a DBH of six inches or greater
preserved within the limit of the disturbance line (exempt area); or
(2) Forested areas of one acre or greater, which are left natural and
conveyed to the Township with a deed restriction, will remain
forested and undeveloped. This conveyance excludes all previous
dedicated easements.

I. To help parties resolve conflicts involving the operation of commercial
farms, the State Agriculture Development Committee has also
established an Agricultural Mediation Program. Mediation is a
voluntary process in which a trained, impartial mediator helps
disputing parties examine their mutual problems, identify and consider
options and determine if they can agree on a solution. A mediator has
no decision-making authority. Successful mediation is based on the
voluntary cooperation and participation of all the parties.
J. An additional purpose of this section is to promote a good neighbor
policy by advising purchasers and users of property adjacent to or near
commercial farms of accepted activities or practices associated with
those neighboring farms. It is intended that, through mandatory
disclosures, purchasers and users will better understand the impacts of
living near agricultural operations and be prepared to accept attendant
conditions as the natural result of living in or near land actively devoted
to commercial agriculture or in an agricultural development area,
meaning an area identified by a county agriculture development board
pursuant to the provisions of N.J.S.A. 4:1C-18 and certified by the State
Agriculture Development Committee. [Added 8-17-2015 by Ord. No.

Ord. No. 2010-11; amended 12-19-2011 by Ord. No. 2011-12]
Standards for site improvements are as follows:
B. The standards and regulations in this chapter are intended to be the
minimum provisions necessary to achieve the purposes and objectives
of this chapter. In the event of a conflict between any provisions, the
stricter provision shall apply.
A. Applicable in all zones.
(1) Solar energy collection panels shall be accessory uses to the
permitted principal and other accessory uses on a lot and shall not
involve the production of power for off-premises consumption, nor
shall such a use constitute a principal use on any lot. This
prohibition shall not be interpreted to preclude the occasional sale
of excess power from solar energy collection panels back to the
public electric utility provider. For solar energy systems intended
for uses other than the aforementioned ones stated, or for any
commercial projects, site plan approval and a use variance is
required.
(2) Installation of rooftop (building-mounted) or freestanding (groundmounted)
solar energy collection panels shall require a zoning
permit from the Zoning Officer and a building permit and/or
electrical permit from the Construction Code Office prior to said
installation. The Zoning Officer shall require a plan of survey
§ 203-29 YOUTH SPORTS § 203-32.1
198:679
depicting the location, setbacks, size, buffer, and other related
appropriate information for accessory structures. In addition, any
interconnection to the public utility grid must be inspected by the
appropriate public utility.
(3) All solar energy collection panel installations must be performed by
a qualified solar installer; examples of qualified installers include,
but are not limited to: employees working for a federally licensed or
state-licensed company or utility within the solar energy industry,
professional electricians, or electrical engineers. Installation must
comply with the National Electric Code as adopted by the New
Jersey Department of Community Affairs. All electric/utility lines or
wires shall be buried underground and the panel structures must
be securely affixed to the earth. There may be a need for structural
engineering information and data for rooftop or ground-mounted
arrays from a licensed New Jersey engineer on a case-by-case basis
depending on unique attributes of system or site.
(4) All visible parts of the solar energy collection panels, including the
frames, hardware, pipes and support structures, shall be
nonreflective black surfaces.
(5) All solar energy collection panels shall not be used for the
displaying of any signage or advertising, except for reasonable
identification of the manufacturer/operator of the system or
appropriate "warning" signs. In no case shall any identification be
visible from a property line, nor should any signage be visible from
any public road.
B. Residential requirements.
(1) Roofline. Installation of solar energy collection panels shall be
permitted on the roofs of single-family residential units so long as
said units are within 10° of flush with the roofline of the residence.
Said installation shall not extend beyond the front or side rooflines.
Said panels should be architecturally compatible with color scheme
of roof to the extent possible. No site plan shall be required for said
installations and a zoning permit is required prior to the
installation of the panels on a roof. In no event shall the placement
of the solar panels result in a larger total height, including building
and panels, than what is permitted in the zoning district in which
they are located for the principal building.
(2) Ground.
(a) Installation of solar energy collection panels on a lot for
residential purposes shall be prohibited in the front yard.
Installation in the rear yard and side yards of said lots shall be
located on properties of one acre or greater.
(b) All ground-mounted solar energy collection panels shall be
completely screened from view at ground level from adjacent
§ 203-32.1 WOOLWICH CODE § 203-32.1
198:680
properties and streets with year-round vegetative screen,
buildings and/or solid fencing. No site plan shall be required
unless the Zoning Officer finds that the installation does not
meet the standards herein.
(c) All ground arrays shall be set back a distance of 25 feet from
all property lines in a residential zoning district. Any deviation
from this twenty-five-foot requirement can only be given by the
Township's Joint Land Use Board based upon the unique
physical characteristics of the parcel.
(d) Ground arrays shall be located so that any glare is directed
away from an adjoining property.
(e) The total surface area of all ground-mounted solar energy
collection panels on the lot shall not exceed 800 square feet on
each lot.
(f) Ground arrays shall not exceed a height of 10 feet.
C. Nonresidential requirements.
(1) Roofline. Installation of solar energy collection panels shall be
permitted on the roofs of nonresidential structures. Where said
solar energy collection panels, support structures, frames,
hardware and piping are visible to residential properties,
appropriate screening materials shall be installed on the roof in an
architectural design compatible with the building. Said panels
should be architecturally compatible with color scheme of roof to
the extent possible. Said solar energy collection system shall not
extend beyond the roofline of the structure. In no event shall the
placement of the solar panels result in a total height, including
building and panels, than what is permitted in the zoning district in
which they are located for the principal building.
(2) Ground. Installation of solar energy collection panels on
nonresidential lots shall be permitted in the side and rear yards of
said lots; provided, however, that if said solar energy collection
panels are visible to residential lots or zones, the lot owner shall
provide appropriate effective natural buffering material that will
completely block the view of said panels from abutting residential
zone or properties. Ground arrays shall be located so that any glare
is directed away from an adjoining property. All ground-mounted
solar energy collection panels shall be screened from view at
ground level from adjacent properties and streets with year-round
vegetative screen, buildings and/or solid fencing. No site plan shall
be required unless the Zoning Officer finds that the installation
does not meet the standards herein. Installation of ground array
solar energy collection panels shall be subject to the issuance of a
zoning permit. The Zoning Officer shall make a finding as to
whether or not the ground installation meets the standards
contained herein. All ground arrays shall be set back in
§ 203-32.1 YOUTH SPORTS § 203-32.1
198:681
conformance with the bulk standards for accessory structures in
commercial districts as provided elsewhere in the zoning code. The
total surface area of all ground-mounted solar energy collection
panels on the lot shall not exceed 1,200 square feet on each lot.
Ground arrays shall not exceed a height of 10 feet.
D. Agricultural requirements. Nothing in this section shall be taken to
supercede the New Jersey Statutes specifically pertaining to
Agriculture and biomass, solar, and wind energy (N.J.S.A. 4:1C-32.4).
(1) Roofline. Installation of solar energy collection systems on
agricultural structures, including but not limited to barns and
sheds, shall be permitted on the rooflines of single-family
residential units in the same manner as contained in Subsection B
hereinbefore.
(2) Ground.
(a) Installation of solar energy collection systems shall be
permitted in a manner consistent with single-family residential
units on agricultural lots as indicated in Subsection B above
and in accordance with standards promulgated by the state on
agricultural land.
(b) Installation of solar energy collection systems on agricultural
lots other than on farm structures shall be permitted. The lot
owner shall provide appropriate effective natural buffering
material that will completely block the view of said panels from
abutting residential zone or properties. Ground arrays shall be
located so that any glare is directed away from an adjoining
property. All ground-mounted solar energy collection panels
shall be screened from view at ground level from adjacent
properties and streets with year-round vegetative screen,
buildings and/or solid fencing. No site plan shall be required
unless the Zoning Officer finds that the installation does not
meet the standards herein. All such installations shall be
subject to the issuance of a zoning permit.
E. Additional regulations and requirements.
(1) If, in the opinion of the Zoning Officer, the installation of the solar
energy collection systems does not satisfy the provisions of this
section, he shall refer said application for a minor site plan
application before the appropriate board of the Township of
Woolwich.
(2) Wind energy systems shall not be used for displaying any
advertising except for reasonable identification of the
manufacturer or operator of the system. In no case shall any
identification be visible from a property line.
§ 203-32.1 WOOLWICH CODE § 203-32.1
198:682
(3) The design of wind energy systems shall, to the extent reasonably
possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening and landscaping
that will blend the facility into the natural setting and existing
environment.
(4) All applications for a wind or solar energy system shall conform to
the provisions of Ordinance 2009-17 as codified with respect to
tree removal.105 Any trees to be removed in excess of that
permitted under the exemptions of the tree removal and protection
ordinance shall be accompanied by a plan demonstrating the need
to remove the trees and replacement of the trees in accordance
with the provisions of said ordinance. An applicant shall locate a
wind or solar energy system so that tree removal is not required to
the extent practical.
(5) The installation of a wind energy system shall conform to the
National Electric Code as adopted by the New Jersey Department
of Community Affairs.
(6) The installation of a wind energy system is subject to all Atlantic
City Electric Company requirements for interconnection.
(7) Wind energy systems shall conform to the height restrictions
provided in the zoning code and any deviation with regard to a
height taller than what is expressly permitted in the zoning code
requires the owner/operator to make application for relief to the
Township's Joint Land Use Board.
F. Abandonment.
(1) A small wind energy system or solar energy system that is out of
service for a continuous twelve-month period will be deemed to
have been abandoned and decommissioned.
(2) The Zoning Officer may issue a notice of abandonment to the
owner. The notice shall be sent via regular and certified mail,
return receipt requested, to the owner of record.
(3) Any abandoned system shall be removed at the owner's sole
expense within six months after the owner receives the notice of
abandonment from the municipality. If the system is not removed
within six months of receipt of notice from the Township notifying
the owner of such abandonment, the Township may remove the
system as set forth below.
(4) When an owner of a wind or solar energy system has been notified
to remove same and has not done so six months after receiving said
notice, then the Township may remove such system and place a lien
upon the property for the cost of the removal, including expenses,
costs, and reasonable attorneys' fees. If removed by the owner, a

§ 203-33. Floodplain management. [Added 3-21-1994 by Ord. No.
94-2]
The following controls shall apply to all portions of the Township and
shall regulate encroachment in floodplains and surface water areas in the
Township:
demolition permit shall be obtained and the facility shall be
removed. Upon removal, the site shall be cleaned, restored and
revegetated to blend with the existing surrounding vegetation at
the time of abandonment.
A. Purpose and policy. It is hereby found that various streams and
waterways in the Township of Woolwich related to the Delaware River
tributaries are subject to recurring flooding, that such flooding
damages and endangers life and public and private property and
facilities, that this condition is aggravated by developments and
encroachments in the floodplain and that the most appropriate method
of alleviating such condition is through regulation of such
developments and encroachments on floodplains and surface water
areas. It is further acknowledged that surface water areas, including
streams, ponds, lakes and wetlands, associated recreation or
immediately adjacent land areas, constitute sources of groundwater
recharge, stormwater storage, fish and wildlife habitat and aesthetic
value to the community as a whole. It is therefore determined that the
special and paramount public interest in the floodplains and surface
water areas justifies the regulation of property located therein as
provided in this chapter, which is in the exercise of the police power of
the municipality, for the protection of the persons and property of its
inhabitants and for the preservation of the public health, safety and
general welfare.
B. Definitions. As used herein, the following terms have the meanings
indicated:
CHANNEL  The bed and banks of a stream or waterway which convey
the normal flow of the stream or waterway that occurs most of the time.
DESIGN FLOOD  The relative size or magnitude of a flood, expressed
as a design discharge in cubic feet per second, which is developed from
hydrologic criteria, represents a major flood with a one-percent chance
in any given year of occurrence, reflects both flood experience and flood
potential, and is the basis of the delineation of the floodway and the
floodplain and of the water surface elevations thereof.
FLOODPLAIN  The relatively flat area adjoining the channel which
is required to accommodate flows from storms having a one-percent
chance of occurrence in any given year and have been or may be
hereafter covered by floodwater of the stream or creek. This area is
indicated on the current FIA Flood Hazard Boundary Maps as filed in
the Township.
§ 203-32.1 WOOLWICH CODE § 203-33
198:684
FLOODWAY  The channel and portions of the adjacent floodplain
that carry the greater part of the flood flow at greater depths and
velocities than do the other parts of the floodplain, that constitute
the minimum area required for the passage of flood flows without
aggravating flood conditions upstream and downstream and that are
necessary to preserve the natural regimen of the stream for the
reasonable passage of the floodway design flood.
SURFACE WATER AREAS  The surface area of any stream, pond, lake
or wetland, whether natural or created by a man-made impoundment,
and including for the terms of this chapter the area of adjacent land
within 50 feet of the edge of such stream, pond, lake or wetland.
C. Applicability. The regulations shall govern encroachments and
developments in the floodway and floodplain area:
(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, no building or
structure shall be erected or constructed, either above or below
ground level, within any floodway or floodplain in the Township of
Woolwich. Nothing herein contained, however, shall be construed
to prohibit the use of any floodplain for farming, grazing, plant
nurseries, horticulture, truck farming, livestock and poultry
raising, forestry, wild crop harvesting, open recreation uses, such
as parks, playgrounds, sports fields, golf courses, boat landings,
bathing beaches, picnic areas, hunting, fishing or the like, provided
that any such use is permitted in the district in which the premises
are located, their activities do not conflict with riparian rights of
other property owners and that they are permitted by the state of
federal agency with jurisdiction.
(2) No building or structure shall be moved or externally altered or
added to or enlarged in the floodplain outside the floodway, except
as permitted by the state or federal agency with jurisdiction.
(3) Areas to be regulated under this section shall be indicated
generally on the current FIA Flood Hazard Boundary Maps
prepared for the Township indicating the stream corridors, surface
water bodies and flood lines to be protected. If the proposed
building site is located in a questionable area, then the applicant's
engineer must certify that said site is not subject to flooding upon
evidence submitted by the applicant. Every application for a zoning
permit shall state the use to be made of any area subject to
floodplain controls. Structures or uses or both which meet the
requirements of this chapter as to use and bulk and the flood area
regulations of the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection (or its successor agency) shall be permitted. The
Township may grant such permits or approvals subject to
compliance with the statutes of the New Jersey Department of
Environmental Protection or its successor agency.
§ 203-33 YOUTH SPORTS § 203-33
198:685
(4) In cases of doubt or uncertainty as to the exact limit of the
floodplain or floodway in a proposed parcel or development, the
applicant shall retain a New Jersey licensed engineer and shall
obtain the written consent of the landowner to determine the
precise location of a floodway or floodplain limit by close
inspection, field survey or from such other appropriate information
as is available to him, notifying the landowner, the Building
Inspector and the Planning Board of the results thereof.
(5) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, no building or
structure shall be erected or constructed either above or below
ground level, within 50 feet from the bank of any stream or from
the edge of any wetland, pond or lake in the Township of Woolwich.
Neither shall any facility for the subsurface disposal of effluent be
permitted within the fifty-foot distance described above. Nothing
herein contained, however, shall be construed to prohibit the
construction and maintenance of bridges or dams or other
structures for the impoundment or retention of water in any such
stream, wetland, pond or lake or of dug ponds or reservoirs,
provided that all applicable requirements and approvals of any
public authority having jurisdiction over such matters are met and
obtained.
(6) The setback requirement set forth in Subsection C of this section
may be waived in planned developments (Article VI of this chapter)
and cluster developments (§ 203-73 of this chapter), for man-made
lakes or impoundments that are designed in such a way that
buildings, plazas or promenades are constructed integrally with the
water's edge. The intent of this provision is to encourage the
creation of water bodies as community design amenities. The
appropriateness of such design shall be considered in the final plan
review stage of a planned unit development or in the site plan
review of a cluster development, whichever is applicable.
(7) No land area within the fifty-foot distance described above shall be
disturbed by any person, partnership, corporation, municipal
corporation or other public agency within this municipality, unless
the applicant has submitted to the Municipal Engineer a plan to
provide for soil erosion and sediment control for such land areas in
accordance with the provisions set forth in the New Jersey Soil
Erosion and Sediment Control Act, P.L. 1975, c. 251, as
amended.106
D. Data required for land disturbance permit. The applicant shall submit a
separate soil erosion and sediment control plan for each noncontiguous
site. The applicant shall file an application and plan with the Gloucester
County Soil Conservation District in the selection of appropriate
erosion and sediment control measures and the development of the
plan. Such plan shall contain:

§ 203-33 WOOLWICH CODE § 203-33
198:686
(1) Location and description of existing natural and man-made
features on and surrounding the site, including general topography
and soil characteristics and a copy of the soil conservation district
soil survey (where available).
(2) Location and description of proposed changes to the site.
(3) Measures for soil erosion and sediment control which meet or
exceed Standards for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control, adopted
by the State Soil Conservation Committee. Standards shall be on
file at the offices of the local soil conservation district and the
Township Clerk.
(4) A schedule of the sequence of installation of planned erosion and
sediment control measures as related to the progress of the
project, including anticipated starting and completion dates.
(5) All proposed revisions of data required shall be submitted for
approval.
E. Review and approval. Soil erosion and sediment control plans shall be
reviewed by the Gloucester County Soil Conservation District and
approved when in conformance with this chapter, the New Jersey Soil
Erosion and Sediment Control Act (P.L. 1975, c. 251), as amended, and
the Standards for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control as adopted by the
State Soil Conservation Committee.

A. Intent.
(1) The intent of the R-1 Residential District is to provide appropriate
regulations for the preservation of agriculture, natural resources,
scenic vistas and the rural landscape of Woolwich Township, along
with the development of single-family detached dwellings and other
permitted uses in portions of the Township characterized as rural,
regardless of the presence or absence of public sewer or water
service. The Township is offering two development options in the
R-1 District. Option 1 is strongly encouraged as the means to best
maintain the rural character while preserving open space and
natural resources in the R-1 District. In conformance with the
MLUL, the purposes of Options 1 and 2 are as follows:
(a) To conserve farmland and open space, including those areas
containing active farmland, unique and sensitive natural
features such as woodlands, steep slopes, streams, floodplains
and wetlands, by setting them aside from development;
(b) To provide greater design flexibility and efficiency in the
design of services and infrastructure, including the
opportunity to reduce length of roads, utility runs, and the
amount of paving required for residential development;
(c) To reduce erosion and sedimentation by the retention of
existing vegetation, and minimization of development on steep
slopes;
(d) To provide for a diversity of lot sizes and housing choices to
accommodate a variety of age and income groups and
§ 203-39 YOUTH SPORTS § 203-40
198:695
residential preferences, so that the community's population
diversity will be maintained;
(e) To implement adopted municipal policies to conserve a variety
of irreplaceable and environmentally sensitive resource lands
as set forth in the Township's Open Space Plan, including
provisions for reasonable incentives to create a greenway
system for the benefit of present and future residents;
(f) To implement adopted land use, transportation, and
community policies, as identified in the Township's Master
Plan;
(g) To protect areas of the Township with productive agricultural
soils for continued or future agricultural use by conserving
blocks of land large enough to allow for efficient farm
operations;
(h) To create neighborhoods with direct visual access to open
space, with amenities in the form of neighborhood open space,
and with a strong neighborhood identity;
(i) To provide for the conservation and maintenance of open space
within the Township to achieve the above-mentioned purposes
and for active and/or passive recreational use by residents;
(j) To provide options for landowners in order to minimize impacts
on farming and environmental resources (sensitive lands such
as wetlands, floodplains, and steep slopes) and disturbance of
natural or cultural features such as mature woodlands,
hedgerows and tree lines, critical wildlife habitats, historic
buildings, and fieldstone walls;
(k) To provide standards reflecting the varying circumstances and
interests of individual landowners, and the individual
characteristics of their properties; and
(l) To conserve scenic views and elements of the Township's rural
character, and to minimize perceived density, by minimizing
views of new development from existing roads.
(2) In order to achieve these purposes, this section provides for
flexibility in designing new residential subdivisions in the R-1
Residential District by allowing one form of conservation zoning
based upon the maximum number of DUs (dwelling units) as
determined by a conventional zoning "by-right" development.
(a) Option 1: neutral density and basic conservation, providing for
residential uses at the density permitted by the underlying R-1
Zoning District. Greenway lands shall comprise at least half
the tract.
§ 203-40 WOOLWICH CODE § 203-40
198:696
(b) Option 2: conventional lotting. In addition to the above option
for subdivision, Option 2, conventional lotting, at a minimum
lot size of two acres, is permitted.
B. Use regulations.
(1) Principal uses. In the R-1 District, no building or premises shall be
used and no building shall be erected or altered which is arranged,
intended or designed to be used, except for one or more of the
following uses; all principal and accessory uses permitted in the 5A
District.
(2) Conditional uses. In the R-1 District, the following uses may be
permitted as conditional uses:
(a) Home occupations as part of a continued existing residential
use may occur, subject to the criteria governing such home
occupations as contained in § 203-60.
(b) Breweries, distilleries, and wineries subject to the criteria
governing such uses as contained in § 203-76.3.
(c) Public and private elementary, middle and high schools subject

(1) Option 1: neutral density and basic conservation, providing for
residential uses at the density permitted by the underlying R-1
Zoning District and the following:
(a) A neutral density/basic conservation development must consist
of at least one tract of land without intervening roads, with
each tract of land containing not less than 10 acres. When a
tract of land less than 10 acres in area is contiguous to existing
open space and would contribute to the fulfillment of the
Township's Open Space Plan, the Joint Land Use Board may
consider a variance to this provision.
§ 203-40 YOUTH SPORTS § 203-40
198:699
(b) Density: as determined through the yield plan described in
Subsection C(1)(m) below.
(c) Minimum required greenway land. The subdivision must
include at least 50% of the gross tract area as greenway land.
Greenway land shall not be used for residential lots.
(d) Greenway land shall be devoted to farming conservation, open
space, municipal and/or recreational purposes. In no case shall
less than 50% of the greenway land area be devoted to upland
area.
(e) Active recreational facilities shall be provided, subject to the
review and approval of the Joint Land Use Board. Such
recreational facilities may be jointly provided by two or more
developers within the R-1 Zone with convenient access to all
users, provided that the facility and/or recreational area shall
equal the recreational requirements of the participating
properties. The location of such recreational facilities shall be
carefully planned to provide privacy for the users and to avoid
problems of noise, lighting and similar nuisances which might
interfere with the use and enjoyment by residents of the
development.
(f) The Joint Land Use Board shall require such grading, drainage,
planting, walkways, fencing, roadways, lighting and such other
improvements in the greenway land as shall be necessary to
enhance the intended open space and recreational uses or
accept a contribution in lieu of making such improvements.
(g) Minimum lot area: 21,780 square feet.
(h) Minimum lot width at building line: 70 feet.
(i) Minimum street frontage: 25 feet.
(j) Yard regulations: The builder or developer is urged to consider
variations in the principal building position and orientation,
but shall observe the following minimum standards:
[1] Front: 30 feet; garage door must be set back at a minimum
of 40 feet from the street line.
[2] Rear: 35 feet.
[3] Side: thirty-foot separation for principal buildings, with no
side yard less than 10 feet from property line.
(k) Maximum impervious coverage: 30% limit on each lot.
(l) Maximum height regulations: 35 feet.
(m) Density determination for Option 1: yield plan approach. The
determination of density or maximum number of permitted
§ 203-40 WOOLWICH CODE § 203-40
198:700
dwelling units shall be based upon a yield plan. Yield plans
shall meet the following requirements:
[1] Yield plans must be prepared as conceptual layout plans in
accordance with the standards of the Subdivision of Land
Ordinance,108 containing proposed lots, streets, rights-ofway,
and other pertinent site features. Yield plans must be
a realistic layout, based upon a field survey, that meets all
zoning district regulations and all bulk and area
regulations for the underlying residential district(s) in
which the tract is located. The yield plan must reflect a
development pattern that could actually be built,
delineating the presence of wetlands, floodplains, steep
slopes, existing easements or encumbrances and, if
unsewered, the suitability of soils for subsurface sewage
disposal. When a tract of land has two (or more)
underlying zoning designations, according to the Zoning
Map of the Township, the yield plan must be designed to
the requirements of the underlying zoning for each zone.
The yield plan must reflect the developer's plan should the
Township choose not to grant the option of conservation
zoning and instead require the developer to design the
subdivision based upon the conventional zoning in place as
reflected in Option 2.
[2] The dimensional standard of Option 2, conventional
zoning, shall be used in the development of a yield plan for
Option 1 subdivisions. The yield plan must identify the
sites' primary and secondary resources, as identified in the
existing resources/site analysis plan (required in the Site
Plan Review and Subdivision of Land Ordinances,109), and
demonstrate that the primary resources could be
successfully absorbed in the development process without
disturbance.
[3] On sites not served by central sewage disposal, density
shall be further determined by evaluating the number of
homes that could be supported by septic systems on
conventional lots. Based on the primary and secondary
resources, identified as part of the inventory and analysis,
and observations made during an on-site visit of the
property, the Joint Land Use Board shall select a tenpercent
sample of the lots considered to be marginal for
on-lot sewage disposal. The applicant shall be required to
provide evidence that these lots meet the standards for an
individual septic system. Should any of the lots in a sample
fail to meet the standard for individual septic system
108. Editor's Note: See Ch. 163, Subdivision of Land.
109. Editor's Note: See Chs. 149, Site Plan Review, and 163, Subdivision of Land.
§ 203-40 YOUTH SPORTS § 203-40
198:701
design, those lots shall be deducted from the yield plan
and a second ten-percent sample shall be selected by the
Joint Land Use Board and tested for compliance. This
process shall be repeated until all lots in a given sample
meet the standard for an individual septic system design.
[4] Stormwater management facilities, including, but not
limited to, detention and retention basins, shall be
included on the yield plan. In no case shall the total area
and volume for stormwater management facilities shown
on the yield plan be less than that shown at the cluster
plan.
(n) Design standards for Option 1.
[1] House lots shall not encroach upon primary conservation
areas as identified in § 203-72, and their layout shall
respect secondary conservation areas as described in both
the Zoning Ordinance and in the Site Plan and Subdivision
Review Ordinances.
[2] All new dwelling units shall meet the following
requirements:
[a] Minimum setback from all external road rights-of-way:
100 feet.
[b] Minimum setback from all other tract boundaries: 50
feet.
[c] Minimum setback from cropland or pasture land: 150
feet.
[d] Minimum setback from preserved farms (preserved
farms through the SADC program. the county
program, or through the Township's TDR program):
300 feet.
[e] Minimum setback from buildings or barnyards
housing livestock: 300 feet.
[f] Minimum setback from active recreation areas such
as courts or playing fields (not including tot-lots): 150
feet.
[3] Views of house lots from exterior roads and abutting
properties shall be minimized by the use of change in
topography, existing vegetation, or additional landscaping
which meets the landscaping requirements in Chapters
149, 163 and 203 of the Woolwich Code.
[4] House lots shall be accessed from interior streets, rather
than from roads bordering the tract.

A. Intent.
(1) The intent of the R-2 Residential District is to provide appropriate
regulations for the preservation of agriculture, natural resources,
scenic vistas and the rural landscape of Woolwich Township, along
with the development of single-family detached dwellings and other
permitted uses in portions of the Township characterized as rural,
regardless of the presence or absence of public sewer or water
service. The Township is offering two development options in the
R-2 District. Option 1 is encouraged as the means to best maintain
the rural character while preserving open space and natural
resources in the R-2 District. In conformance with the MLUL, the
purposes of Options 1 and 2 are as follows:
§ 203-40 YOUTH SPORTS § 203-41
198:703
(a) To conserve farmland and open space, including those areas
containing farmland, unique and sensitive natural features
such as woodlands, steep slopes, streams, floodplains and
wetlands, by setting them aside from development;
(b) To provide greater design flexibility and efficiency in the
design of services and infrastructure, including the
opportunity to reduce length of roads, utility runs, and the
amount of paving required for residential development;
(c) To reduce erosion and sedimentation by the retention of
existing vegetation, and the minimization of development on
steep slopes;
(d) To provide for a diversity of lot sizes and housing choices to
accommodate a variety of age and income groups, and
residential preferences, so that the community's population
diversity will be maintained;
(e) To implement adopted municipal policies to conserve a variety
of irreplaceable and environmentally sensitive resource lands
as set forth in the Township's Open Space Plan, including
provisions for reasonable incentives to create a greenway
system for the benefit of present and future residents;
(f) To implement adopted land use, transportation and community
policies, as identified in the Township's Master Plan;
(g) To protect areas of the Township's with productive agricultural
soils for continued or future agricultural use by conserving
blocks of land large enough to allow for efficient farm
operations;
(h) To create neighborhoods with direct visual access to open
space, with amenities in the form of neighborhood open space,
and with a strong neighborhood identity;
(i) To provide for the conservation and maintenance of open space
within the Township to achieve the above-mentioned purposes
and for active and/or passive recreational use by residents;
(j) To provide options for landowners in order to minimize impacts
on farming and environmental resources (sensitive lands such
as wetlands, floodplain and step slopes) and disturbance of
natural or cultural features such as mature woodlands,
hedgerows and tree lines, critical wildlife habitats, historic
buildings and fieldstone walls;
(k) To provide standards reflecting the varying circumstances and
interests of individual landowners, and the individual
characteristics of their properties; and
§ 203-41 WOOLWICH CODE § 203-41
198:704
(l) To conserve scenic views and elements of the Township's rural
character, and to minimize perceived density, by minimizing
views of new development from existing roads.
(2) In order to achieve these purposes, this section provides for
flexibility in designing new residential subdivisions in the R-2
Residential District by allowing one form of conservation zoning
based upon the maximum number of DUs (dwelling units) as
determined by a conventional zoning "by-right" development:
(a) Option 1: neutral density and basic conservation, providing for
residential uses at the density permitted by the underlying R-2
Zoning District. Greenway lands shall comprise at least half
the tract.
(b) Option 2: conventional lotting. In addition to the above
preferred option for subdivision, Option 2, conventional
lotting, at a minimum lot size of 1.5 acres, is permitted.
B. Use regulations.
(1) Principal uses. In the R-2 District, no building or premises shall be
used and no building shall be erected or altered which is arranged,
intended or designed to be used, except for one or more of the
following uses: all principal and accessory uses permitted in the 5A
District.
(2) Conditional uses. In the R-2 District, the following uses may be
permitted as conditional uses:
(a) Home occupations as part of a continued existing residential
use may occur subject to the criteria governing such home

other outbuildings, shall be subject to the following regulations,
which shall supersede the requirements of § 203-59A in this
district:
(a) For lots less than three acres in size, the gross floor area of any
individual building shall not exceed 1,500 square feet, and the
total size of all accessory buildings shall not exceed 2% of the
lot area.
(b) For lots of three acres or greater in size, the gross floor area of
any individual building shall not exceed 2% of the lot area, and

(1) Option 1: neutral density and basic conservation, providing for
residential uses at the density permitted by the underlying R-2
Zoning District and the following:
(a) A neutral density/basic conservation development must consist
of at least one tract of land without any intervening roads, with
each tract containing not less than 10 acres. When a tract of
land, less than 10 acres, is contiguous to existing open space
and would contribute to the fulfillment of the Township's Open
Space Plan, the approving Joint Land Use Board may consider
a variance to this provision.
(b) Density: as determined through the yield plan described in
Subsection C(1)(m).
(c) Minimum required greenway land. The subdivision must
include at least 50% of the gross tract area as greenway land.
Greenway land shall not be used for residential lots.
(d) Greenway land shall be devoted to farming conservation, open
space, municipal and/or recreational purposes. In no case shall
less than 50% of the greenway land area be devoted to upland
area.
(e) Active recreational facilities shall be provided, subject to the
review and approval of the Joint Land Use Board. Such
recreational facilities may be jointly provided by two or more
developers within the R-2 Zone with convenient access to all
users, provided that the facility and/or recreational area shall
equal the recreational requirements of the participating
properties. The location of such recreational facilities shall be
carefully planned to provide privacy for the users and to avoid
problems of noise, lighting and similar nuisances which might
interfere with the use and enjoyment by residents of the
development.
(f) The Joint Land Use Board shall require such grading, drainage,
planting, walkways, fencing, roadways, lighting and such other
improvements in the greenway land as shall be necessary to
enhance the intended open space and recreational uses or
accept a contribution in lieu of making such improvements.
§ 203-41 WOOLWICH CODE § 203-41
198:708
(g) Minimum lot area: 21,780 square feet.
(h) Minimum lot width at building line: 70 feet.
(i) Minimum street/frontage: 25 feet.
(j) Yard regulations. The builder or developer is urged to consider
variations in the principal building position and orientation,
but shall observe the following minimum standards:
[1] Front: 30 feet; garage door must be set back a minimum of
40 feet from the street line.
[2] Rear: 30 feet.
[3] Side: thirty-foot separation for principal buildings, with no
side yard less than 10 feet from the property line.
(k) Maximum impervious coverage: 30% limit on each lot.
(l) Maximum height regulations: 35 feet.
(m) Density determination for Option 1: yield plan approach. The
determination of density or maximum number of permitted
dwelling units shall be based upon a yield plan. Yield plans
shall meet the following requirements:
[1] Yield plans must be prepared as conceptual layout plans in
accordance with the standards of the Subdivision of Land
Ordinance,110 containing proposed lots, streets, rights-ofway
and other pertinent site features. Yield plans must be
a realistic layout, based upon a field survey, that meets all
zoning district regulations and all bulk and area
regulations for the underlying residential district(s) in
which the tract is located. The yield plan must reflect a
development pattern that could actually be built,
delineating the presence of wetlands, floodplains, steep
slopes, existing easements or encumbrances and, if
unsewered, the suitability of soils for subsurface sewage
disposal. When a tract of land has two (or more)
underlying zoning designations according to the Zoning
Map of the Township, the yield plan must be designed to
the requirements of the underlying zoning for each zone.
The yield plan must reflect the developer's plan should the
Township choose not to grant the option of conservation
zoning and instead require the developer to design the
subdivision based upon the conventional zoning in place as
reflected in Option 2.
[2] The dimensional standards of Option 2, conventional
zoning, shall be used in the development of yield plan for
110. Editor's Note: See Ch. 163, Subdivision of Land.
§ 203-41 YOUTH SPORTS § 203-41
198:709
Option 1 subdivisions. The yield plan must identify the
site's primary and secondary resources, as identified in
the existing resources/site analysis plan (required in the
Site Plan Review and Subdivision of Land Ordinances111),
and demonstrate that the primary resources could be
successfully absorbed in the development process without
disturbance.
[3] On sites not served by central sewage disposal, density
shall be further determined by evaluating the number of
homes that could be supported by septic systems on
conventional lots. Based on the primary and secondary
resources, identified as part of the inventory and analysis,
and observations made during an on-site visit of the
property, the Joint Land Use Board shall select a 10%
sample of the lots considered to be marginal for on-lot
sewage disposal. The applicant shall be required to
provide evidence that these lots meet the standards for an
individual septic system. Should any of the lots in a sample
fail to meet the standard for individual septic system
design, those lots shall be deducted from the yield plan
and a second 10% sample shall be selected by the Joint
Land Use Board and tested for compliance. This process
shall be repeated until all lots in a given sample meet the
standard for an individual septic system design.
[4] Stormwater management facilities, including, but not
limited to, detention and retention basins, shall be
included on the yield plan. In no case shall the total area
and volume for stormwater management facilities shown
on the yield plan be less than that shown on the cluster
plan.
(n) Design standards for Option 1.
[1] House lots shall not encroach upon primary conservation
areas as identified in § 203-72, and their layout shall
respect secondary conservation areas as described in both
the Zoning Ordinance and in the Site Plan and Subdivision
Review Ordinances.
[2] All new dwelling units shall meet the following
requirements:
[a] Minimum setback from all external road rights-of-way:
100 feet.
[b] Minimum setback from all other tract boundaries: 50
feet.

[c] Minimum setback from cropland or pasture land: 150
feet.
[d] Minimum setback from preserved farms (preserved
farms through the SADC program, the county
program, or through the Township's TDR program):
300 feet.
[e] Minimum setback from buildings or barnyards
housing livestock: 300 feet.
[f] Minimum setback from active recreation areas such
as courts or playing fields (not including tot-lots): 150

[5] From buildings or barnyards housing livestock: 300 feet.
[6] From active recreation areas such as courts or playing
fields (not including tot-lots): 150 feet.
A. Intent.
(1) The intent of the R-3 Residential District is to provide appropriate
regulations for the preservation of agriculture, natural resources,
scenic vistas and the rural landscape of Woolwich Township, along
with the development of moderate-density single-family detached
dwellings and other permitted uses in portions of the Township
which are located within the existing public sewer service area, as
of 2004, but which are not part of any planned unit development.
Where public sewer is unavailable, the regulations of the R-2
Residential District shall apply. The Township is offering three
development options in the R-3 District. Option 1 is encouraged as
the means to best maintain the rural character while preserving
open space and natural resources in the R-3 District. In
conformance with the MLUL, the purposes of Options 1, 2 and 3 are
as follows: [Amended 5-21-2018 by Ord. No. 2018-07]
(a) To conserve farmland and open space, including those areas
containing unique and sensitive natural features such as
woodlands, steep slopes, streams, floodplains and wetlands, by
setting them aside from development;
(b) To provide greater design flexibility and efficiency in the
design of services and infrastructure, including the
opportunity to reduce length of roads, utility runs, and the
amount of paving required for residential development;
(c) To reduce erosion and sedimentation by the retention of
existing vegetation and the minimization of development on
steep slopes;
(d) To provide for a diversity of lot sizes and housing choices to
accommodate a variety of age and income groups, and
residential preferences, so that the community's population
diversity will be maintained;
(e) To implement adopted municipal policies to conserve a variety
of irreplaceable and environmentally sensitive resource lands
as set forth in the Township's Open Space Plan, including
provisions for reasonable incentives to create a greenway
system for the benefit of present and future residents;
§ 203-41 WOOLWICH CODE § 203-42
198:712
(f) To implement adopted land use, transportation, and
community polices, as identified in the Township's Master
Plan;
(g) To protect areas of the Township with productive agricultural
soils for continued or future agricultural use, by conserving
blocks of land large enough to allow for efficient farm
operations;
(h) To create neighborhoods with direct visual access to open
space, with amenities in the form of neighborhood open space,
and with a strong neighborhood identity;
(i) To provide for the conservation and maintenance of open space
within the Township to achieve the above-mentioned purposes
and for active and/or passive recreational use by residents;
(j) To provide options for landowners in order to minimize impacts
on farming and environmental resources (sensitive lands such
as wetlands, floodplains, and steep slopes) and disturbance of
natural or cultural features such as mature woodlands,
hedgerows and tree lines, critical wildlife habitats, historic
buildings, and fieldstone walls;
(k) To provide standards reflecting the varying circumstances and
interests of individual landowners, and the individual
characteristics of their properties; and
(l) To conserve scenic views and elements of the Township's rural
character, and to minimized perceived density, by minimizing
views of new development from existing roads.
(2) In order to achieve these purposes, this section provides for
flexibility in designing new residential subdivisions in the R-3
Residential District by allowing one form of conservation zoning
based upon the maximum number of DUs (dwelling units) as
determined by a conventional zoning "by-right" development:
(a) Option 1: neutral density and basic conservation: providing for
residential uses at the density permitted by the underlying R-3
Zoning District. Greenway lands shall comprise at least half
the tract.
(b) Option 2: conventional lotting. In addition to the above
preferred options for subdivision, Option 2, conventional
lotting, at a minimum lot size of 20,000 square feet, is also
permitted.
(c) Option 3: The underlying density of the parcel would be
eliminated and the parcel would serve as a receiving area for a
density transfer from the PUD Planned Unit Development
District. [Added 5-21-2018 by Ord. No. 2018-07]
§ 203-42 YOUTH SPORTS § 203-42
198:713
B. Use regulations.
(1) Principal uses. In the R-3 District, no building or premises shall be
used and no building shall be erected or altered which is arranged,
intended or designed to be used, except for one or more of the
following uses: all principal and accessory uses permitted in the 5A
District.
(2) Conditional uses. In the R-3 District, the conditional uses as
permitted in the R-1 District are allowed.
(3) Accessory buildings, including storage sheds, greenhouses, and
other outbuildings, shall be subject to the following regulations,
which shall supersede the requirements of § 203-59A in this
district:
(a) The gross floor area of any individual building shall not exceed
400 square feet, and the total size of all accessory buildings
shall not exceed 2% of the lot area.
(b) No accessory building shall be located within 10 feet of any
side or rear property line.
(c) No accessory building shall be permitted between the front of
the building and the street line.
(d) No construction permit shall be issued for the construction of
an accessory building prior to the issuance of a construction
permit for the construction of the principal buildings or
structure upon the same premises.
(e) An accessory building shall not be located in any required
buffer area (see § 163-42), certain easements (see § 145-58)
and/or drainage right-of-way.
(f) The height of an accessory building shall not exceed 20 feet or
the height of the principal building, whichever is less.
C. Bulk and area regulations. In order to achieve these purposes, this
section provides for flexibility in designing new residential subdivisions
in the R-3 Residential District by allowing one form of conservation
zoning based upon the number of DUs (dwelling units) as determined
by the conventional zoning "by-right" development: [Amended

(1) Option 1: neutral density and basic conservation, providing for
residential uses at the density permitted by the underlying R-1
Zoning District and the following:
(a) A neutral density/basic conservation development must consist
of at least one tract of land without intervening roads with each
tract of land containing not less than 10 acres. When a tract of
land, less than 10 acres in area, is contiguous to existing open
space and would contribute to the fulfillment of the Township's
Open Space Plan, the approving Joint Land Use Board may
consider a variance to this provision.
(b) Minimum required greenway land. The subdivision must
include at least 40% of the gross tract area as greenway land.
§ 203-42 YOUTH SPORTS § 203-42
198:715
(c) Density: as determined through the yield plan described in
Subsection C(1)(m) below.
(d) Greenway land shall be devoted to farming conservation, open
space, municipal and/or recreational purposes. In no case shall
less than 50% of the greenway land area shall be provided to
upland area.
(e) Active recreational facilities shall be provided, subject to the
review and approval of the Joint Land Use Board. Such
recreational facilities may be jointly provided by two or more
developers within the R-3 Zone with convenient access to all
users, provided that the facility and/or recreational area shall
equal the recreational requirements of the participating
properties. The location of such recreational facilities shall be
carefully planned to provide privacy for the users and to avoid
problems of noise, lighting and similar nuisances which might
interfere with their use and enjoyment by residents of the
development.
(f) The Joint Land Use Board shall require such grading, drainage,
planting, walkways, fencing, roadways, lighting and such other
improvements in the greenway land as shall be necessary to
enhance the intended open space and recreational uses or
accept a contribution in lieu of making such improvements.
(g) Minimum lot area: 8,000 square feet.
(h) Minimum lot width at building line: 60 feet.
(i) Minimum street frontage: 25 feet.
(j) Yard regulations. The builder or developer is urged to consider
variations in the principal building position and orientation,
but shall observe the following minimum standards:
[1] Front: 30 feet; garage door must be set back a minimum of
40 feet from the street line.
[2] Rear: 35 feet.
[3] Side: twenty-foot separation for principal buildings, with
no side yard less than 10 feet.
(k) Maximum impervious coverage: 40% limit on each lot.
(l) Maximum height regulations: 35 feet.
(m) Density determination for Option 1: yield plan approach. The
determination of density or maximum number of permitted
dwelling units shall be based upon a yield plan. Yield plans
shall meet the following requirements:
§ 203-42 WOOLWICH CODE § 203-42
198:716
[1] Yield plans must be prepared as conceptual layout plans in
accordance with the standards of the Subdivision of Land
Ordinance,112 containing proposed lots, streets, rights-ofway,
and other pertinent site features. Yield plans must be
a realistic layout, based upon a field survey, that meets all
zoning district regulations and bulk and area regulations
for the underlying residential district(s) in which the tract
is located. The yield plan must reflect a development
pattern that could actually be built, delineating the
presence of wetlands, floodplains, steep slopes, existing
easements or encumbrances and, if unsewered, the
suitability of soils for subsurface sewage disposal. When a
tract of land has two (or more) underlying zoning
designations according to the Zoning Map of the
Township, the yield plan must be designed to the
requirements of the underlying zoning for each zone. The
yield plan must reflect the developer's plan should the
Township choose not to grant the option of conservation
zoning and instead require the developer to design the
subdivision based upon the conventional zoning in place as
reflected in Option 2.
[2] The dimensional standards of Option 2, conventional
zoning, shall be used in the development of yield plans for
Option 1 subdivisions. The yield plan must identify the
site's primary and secondary resources, as identified in the
existing resources/site analysis plan (required in the Site
Plan Review and Subdivision of Land Ordinances113), and
demonstrate that the primary resources could be
successfully absorbed in the development process without
disturbance.
[3] On sites not served by central sewage disposal, as stated
above, R-2 zoning applies.
[4] Stormwater management facilities, including, but not
limited to, detention and retention basins, shall be
included on the yield plan. In no case shall the total area
and volume for stormwater management facilities shown
on the yield plan be less than that shown on the cluster
plan.
(n) Design standards for Option 1.
[1] House lots shall not encroach upon primary conservation
areas as identified in § 203-72, and their layout shall
respect secondary conservation areas as described in both
112. Editor's Note: See Ch. 163, Subdivision of Land.
113. Editor's Note: See Chs. 149, Site Plan Review, and 163, Subdivision of Land.

[f] Minimum setback from active recreation areas such
as courts or playing fields (not including tot-lots): 150
feet.
[3] Views of house lots from exterior roads and abutting
properties shall be minimized by the use of changes in
topography, existing vegetation, or additional landscaping
which meets the landscaping requirements in Chapters
149, 163 and 203 of the Woolwich Code.
[4] House lots shall be accessed from interior streets, rather
than from roads bordering the tract.
[5] Standards pertaining to the use, quantity, quality,
configuration, ownership and maintenance of the
greenway land created under this section are contained in
§ 203-72 of this chapter.
(2) Option 2: conventional lotting. In addition to the above preferred
option for subdivision, Option 2, conventional lotting, at a minimum
lot size of 20,000 square feet, is also permitted.

acreage of 25 acres bounded on three sides by portions of the
Weatherby PUD Planned Unit Development District and not within
the Weatherby General Development Plan shall be eligible for the
density transfer option (eligible parcel). Under this option, singlefamily
detached dwellings shall be the permitted use subject to the
bulk and area regulations of § 203-45C.
(a) The density transfer required to enable this development
option shall be achieved by shifting a portion of the units
permitted by the Weatherby PUD to an eligible parcel outside
the boundaries of the PUD.
(b) The combined development of the parcel receiving the density
transfer and the Weatherby PUD shall not exceed the 4,500
residential units authorized by the existing Weatherby General

§ 203-44. PAC Planned Adult Community.
The intent of this section is to implement the terms of the settlement of a
case entitled Woolwich Adult LLC v Woolwich Township, et al., Docket No.
413-01. The PAC District will provide an opportunity to develop integrated
residential communities on large tracts of land that are situated at locations
convenient to shopping. Planned adult communities are intended for
occupancy by households in which at least one member of the household
is age 55 or older, and no permanent member of the resident household is
age 18 or less. Said developments are also intended to offer a full range of
recreational opportunities consistent with the lifestyle of its residents and
developed as part of a well-planned development. It is the further intent of
this article to promote the long-term health, safety and welfare of the public
by promoting greater variety and flexibility in the uses permitted within
a planned development than would otherwise be permitted, and likewise
it will advance the principles of smart growth. The Township Committee
finds that such variety and flexibility will accomplish comparatively greater
benefits to residents, will protect the natural environment and enhance the
provision of public services and facilities. A planned adult community will
provide opportunities for senior citizen housing construction, which is a
specific purpose of zoning. The planned adult community is intended to
permit the development of a balanced community with a range of densities,
recreational facilities and related uses, while preserving a significant
amount of public and common open space.
(a) The gross floor area of any building shall not exceed 2% of the
lot area, and the total size of all accessory buildings shall not
exceed 4% of the lot area.
(b) No accessory building shall be located within 15 feet of any
side or rear property line.
(c) No accessory building shall be permitted between the building
line and the street line.
(d) The height of an accessory building shall not exceed 25 feet or
the height of the principal building, whichever is less.
A. Use regulations.
(1) Principal and accessory uses. In the PAC District, no building or
premises shall be used and no building shall be erected or altered
which is arranged, intended or designed to be used, except for one
or more of the following uses: all principal and accessory uses
permitted in the 5A District. In addition, townhouses or multifamily
apartment buildings affordable to low- and moderate-income
households, as defined by the Council on Affordable Housing, shall
be permitted, as well as the following accessory uses:
(a) Golf courses.
§ 203-43 YOUTH SPORTS § 203-44

use. Resident open space shall be free from environmental
constraints and shall be distributed through each section of the
PAC development.
(11) All development in the PAC District shall be connected to public
sewer and water systems, and said connection shall be mandatory
if public sewer and water lines exist within 500 linear feet of the
closest lot line. In the event that public sewer and water is
unavailable within a distance of 500 feet from the tract boundary,
or if the property in question does not meet the minimum tract
requirement for this district, the development regulations of the
R-2 Residence District shall apply.
(12) An essential and nonseverable condition of any right to develop in
the PAC zone shall be complete compliance with the settlement
agreement for Woolwich Adult LLC v Woolwich Township, et al.,

A. Intent.
(1) The PUD Planned Unit Development District is specifically
designed to implement the intent and purpose of the general
development plan as approved in 1998 by the Planning Board for
the Weatherby Planned Unit Development. It provides for a mixture
of dwelling types as well as nonresidential uses, which are defined
within the Weatherby Commercial Zoning Overlay. This overlay is
intended to apply to the area designated as "town center" within
the Weatherby General Development Plan. This area is expected to
provide opportunities for community-level rather than regional
commercial uses, serving the needs of Weatherby and nearby
neighborhoods. It is also intended to apply to certain out-parcels
that are adjacent to, but not part of, the Weatherby Planned Unit
Development. It is recognized that the exact location of the
commercial overlay may be adjusted, with the approval of the
Planning Board, and the applicability of the overlay to out-parcels
§ 203-44 WOOLWICH CODE § 203-45
198:724
is intended to be flexible as the boundaries of the commercial
overlay within Weatherby are adjusted.
(2) It is the further intent of this article to promote the long-term
health, safety and welfare of the public by promoting greater
variety and flexibility in the uses permitted within a development
than would otherwise be permitted under any one designation
permitted under this chapter and to advance the principles of
smart growth. The Township Committee finds that such variety and
flexibility will accomplish comparatively greater benefits to
residential and nonresidential users, the natural environment and
public services and facilities. A planned development is intended to
permit the development of a balanced community comprised of
residential uses and, under certain circumstances, nonresidential
uses, with a range of densities, recreational facilities and related
uses, while preserving a significant amount of public and common
open space. It is intended that planned developments will
encourage the consolidation of residential and nonresidential
development in sectors of the Township where existing or
anticipated roads and utility services can best accommodate
development and will offer increased design flexibility in order that
entire parcels of land may be developed in a comprehensive
manner and sequence throughout the life of the development. This
district is intended to achieve the following public objectives:
(a) To offer a variety of housing types.
(b) To preserve and enhance open space and natural resources of
all types, for both passive and active recreation purposes.
(c) To permit a greater mixture of compatible residential and
nonresidential land uses in areas designated by the Weatherby
General Development Plan approval.
(d) To promote creativity and innovation in the design process.
(e) To create opportunities for efficient creation of infrastructure
and utilities by means of clustering of development, careful site
planning and construction phasing, and attaining market
economies of scale in project size.
(f) To minimize traffic impacts through the implementation and
development of appropriate design standards as required by
specific on-site conditions.
(g) To insure permanent buffering from other land uses and
development abutting the site.
(3) Due consideration shall be given in the design of all planned unit
developments to each constituent element of an open space system,
including environmentally and ecologically sensitive areas, usable
open space, other common areas, special scenic amenities and
§ 203-45 YOUTH SPORTS § 203-45
198:725
views from the road. To the greatest extent possible, dwellings and
other buildings and structures should be placed in tight clusters
set in the distance beyond expanses of open fields and visually
softened by surrounding trees and plantings.
B. Use regulations.
(1) Residential uses.
(a) A maximum of 4,500 dwelling units shall be permitted, as
specified in the Weatherby General Development Plan. These
uses may include single-family detached dwellings, duplex,
triplex and zero-lot line dwellings, multifamily dwellings and
townhouses (patio homes).

development, it is required that, at a minimum, sidewalks and
§ 203-46 YOUTH SPORTS § 203-46
198:735
street trees be installed in accordance with municipal
specifications and of an appropriate and acceptable nature to the
Planning Board. In the event that such facilities are already present
or are otherwise to be provided, the Planning Board may require
provision of other reasonable amenities related to the
establishment or improvement of a streetscape environment. In
all cases, provision of streetscape amenities that are beyond and
in addition to sidewalks and street trees (such as benches, grass
strips, planters, statues and other street furniture) shall be
encouraged, subject to Planning Board approval.
(4) Where a development in the FOC District abuts any residential
district, special buffering improvements shall be mandatory within
required rear and/or side setbacks on the site. Said improvements
shall be designed so as to significantly reduce visibility, noise, litter
and (unlimited) pedestrian access and shall consist of combinations
of any of the following, at the discretion of the Planning Board, as
needed: dense plantings, including hedges, coniferous or broadleaf
evergreens; oversized earth berms; visually impermeable
fences or walls; retention of natural vegetation; and retention of
natural topographic features and watercourses. Buffers shall be in
accordance with §§ 203-68 and 203-69. Buffers may occur in
required yard areas, but the applicant's desire to place parking or
drive aisles within the required buffer area shall not constitute
grounds for zoning relief from this requirement.
(5) All development in the FOC District shall be connected to public
sewer and water systems when practical, and said connection shall
be mandatory if public sewer and water lines exist within 500 linear
feet of the closest lot line. In the event that public sewer and water
is unavailable within a distance of 500 feet from the edge of the
tract boundary closest to the available utility in question, a
maximum lot coverage of 50% of the amount otherwise authorized
by § 203-46B(5) shall be permitted.

designated as site service drives and may be exempted from the
preceding requirements, unless they are judged to carry volumes
sufficient for the Planning Board to request their designation as
public streets in accordance with Article VII, § 203-65. Curbing
shall be required and curb cuts shall be designed so as to limit
vehicular access in accordance with proper traffic engineering
principles and the New Jersey Highway Access Code and, in doing
so, promote traffic safety and efficiency of flow.
(7) All parking areas and walkways shall be adequately illuminated for
security and safety purposes. The lighting plan in and around the
parking areas shall provide for non-glare lights focused downward.
All lighting shall be shown on the lighting plan in sufficient detail to
§ 203-46 WOOLWICH CODE § 203-46
198:736

traffic safety and overhead sky glow. The objective is to minimize
undesirable off-premises effects.
(8) All rights-of-way as required by the Woolwich Township Master
Plan, by the County of Gloucester, or by the New Jersey
Department of Transportation (as applicable) shall be offered for
dedication at the time of site plan application.
(9) Parking and loading. Parking and loading spaces shall be provided
in accordance with the regulations set forth in Article IX of this
chapter provided, however, that no parking shall be permitted in
any required front yard. When adjacent to any residential use,
loading areas shall be screened with walls to obscure their view
from the adjacent lot.
D. Kingsway Town Center and Commercial Overlay Districts. [Added
12-20-2004 by Ord. No. 2004-02]
(1) Intent.
(a) It is the intent of this subsection to establish an area within the
FOC Zoning District where the most intensive commercial
shopping centers and office campuses can be concentrated, so
that the resulting potential for congestion can be more
effectively controlled by limiting their location to a carefully
regulated area in close proximity to the interchange of U.S.
Highway 322 and Interchange 2 of the New Jersey Turnpike.
Two such areas are identified on the Zoning Map as the
Kingsway Commercial Overlay and the Kingsway Town Center
Overlay.
(b) The Kingsway Town Center is subject to special regulations
designed to encourage the creation of a pedestrian-oriented
central area within the Township that contains an integrated
mix of retail, office, and entertainment uses that can serve as a
community focal point. The Kingsway Town Center will
encourage innovative planning techniques, which will facilitate
higher quality development that is consistent with the
recommendations in the Woolwich Township Master Plan.
(c) The Kingsway Commercial Overlay is intended for higherintensity
retail, commercial and office uses that are more
oriented to customers, clients and employees who will arrive
by automobile and who are not expected to walk to a
significant number of other destinations within the
development.
(d) It is the goal of both component overlay areas to provide
incentives in the form of increased building coverage,
increased impervious coverage and increased floor area ratio
to encourage the implementation of the Township Master Plan
§ 203-46 YOUTH SPORTS § 203-46
198:737
and a conceptual "bubble diagram-style" site plan submitted
for the Kingsway Town Center and Commercial Overlays as
part of a settlement agreement between Woolwich Township
and Woolwich Adult LLC.
(e) Kingsway Commercial and Town Center Overlays will
encourage a unified architectural and building scheme within
each section of the development, pedestrian-oriented
walkways connecting buildings within each section of the
development, unified landscaping and signage, coordinated
storm drainage, and common open space areas. Special
regulations shall be mandated to create the desired visual and
practical results.
(f) The provisions of the Kingsway Commercial and Town Center
Overlays shall apply only to those areas that are designated as
such on the Zoning Map which meet the minimum tract area
standard of this subsection.
(2) Use regulations.
(a) Principal uses. In the Kingsway Commercial Overlay and the
Kingsway Town Center Overlay, no building or premises shall
be used and no building shall be erected or altered which is

(5) In locations where permitted but not fully compatible uses abut one
another, such as residences adjoining commercial or office
development, adequate screening and buffering shall be provided,
consisting of buffer strips, visually impermeable fences or walks,
earth berms, trees and shrubs, or combinations of the preceding, in
accordance with planned development design standards, as well as
§ 203-65 of this chapter.
A. Design review purpose. The purpose of this architectural design section
is to safeguard the heritage, environment, and living quality of
Woolwich Township, for present and future generations. It shall ensure
that among other things, general design, arrangement, and use of
materials for proposed buildings and structures is complimentary and
harmonious to the character and environment of Woolwich Township,
fosters civic pride among its residents, and contributes to the overall
economic development of the Township. Overall design character of
buildings shall be controlled to ensure that the appearance and quality
of Township communities is not eroded by poor design that is either
monotonous or cluttered. The architecture, project layout (site design),
landscaping, and signage shall contribute to a harmonious and diverse
character, while maintaining a strong sense of unity. Monotony shall be
avoided. Interest and diversity shall be implemented, while avoiding
chaotic or discordant design schemes.
§ 203-48 WOOLWICH CODE § 203-49
198:754
B. Applicability. Evaluation on such factors described above shall apply to
all nonresidential structures, regardless of zone, and will be reviewed
and approved by the Woolwich Township Planning Board in the best
interest of the residents of Woolwich Township.
C. Architectural styles. Existing primary architectural styles within the
Township generally include vernacular, colonial revival, Georgian
revival, and Queen Anne victorian. The design of new buildings should
be representative of the current era, yet incorporated with design
elements of existing primary architectural styles of the Township.
(1) Vernacular. Floor plans are square, T or L in shape. Exterior
features include raised front porches, wood siding, or masonry
walls, various pitched gable roofs, and symmetrical fenestration on
the front facade.
(2) Colonial revival. Wood frame rectangular structures having wood
or brick exteriors. Most buildings have symmetrical floor plans with
flanking wings, roof forms such as hipped, double-pitched, and
mansard. Other features include double-hung multipaned windows,
pediment dormers, raised porticos, and fan lighting entries.
(3) Georgian revival. The overall features may be described as
symmetrical composition enriched with classical detail. Common
features include wood siding on wood frame construction, or red
brick siding. Roofs can be hipped, or gambrel shaped, and eaves
are generally detailed as a classical cornice. The central portion of
the facade may project and have a pediment, with or without
pilasters.
(4) Queen Anne victorian. Queen Anne styles have asymmetrical
shapes characterized by bays, and prominent, varied rooflines.
Common characteristics are rich yet simple ornament, a variety of
materials including wood, terra cotta, stone, and pressed metal,
expansive porches, bays, and irregular roof lines with many
dormers and chimneys.
D. Building and structure design. Critical attention shall be given to
building materials, use of color and texture, building or structure
massing and height as they relate to site conditions, and harmonious
integration with similar existing elements in neighboring buildings or
structures. Buildings or structures shall be designed to be part of
individual communities or streetscapes that are appropriate to
Woolwich Township. Prototype or formula buildings and color schemes
are undesirable unless they conform to the standards of this section.
(1) Facades.
(a) Building facades shall emphasize the architectural philosophy
of relief and rhythm. Rhythm should be used in the design to
provide interest and variety, and avoid monotony. Details that
create shade, and cast shadows can be used to provide visual
§ 203-49 YOUTH SPORTS § 203-49
198:755
relief to the building. Buildings shall be broken into a series of
volumes that lessen the overall mass.
(b) Building facades shall be segmented with architectural details
such as recesses, projections, overhangs, canopies or porticos,
arcades, raised parapets, peaked roof forms, integral planters,
and other similar features. Building facades greater than 60
feet in length (including separate buildings that are attached),
shall incorporate a minimum of three architecture elements as
described above. Recesses or projections shall extend a
minimum of three feet from the primary building wall plane.
(c) There shall be no uninterrupted walls greater than 40 feet in
length. The length of the building shall visually appear to be
proportional to the height, using a rate of 2.5 times the height
of the building equal to the length. Architectural details may be
utilized to create the appearance of segmented buildings
where several smaller freestanding buildings are not feasible.
(2) Roofs. Variation of building rooflines is encouraged. Use of gable,
mansard, hipped, saltbox, gambrel, pyramidal, and shed roof styles
are recommended. Use of flat roofs should be avoided unless
hidden by parapet walls.
(3) Windows. Window proportions shall be balanced against the overall
building size. Consideration shall be given to cohesive fenestration.
(4) Exterior materials. The building exterior shall be composed of one
primary or dominant material and not more than two additional
materials. The dominant material shall be utilized on all exterior
sides of the building. Dominant exterior materials may include
brick, stone, stucco (including exterior insulation and finish
systems, EIFS), wood, and split-face concrete masonry units.
Dominant exterior materials may not include smooth-face concrete
masonry units, unarticulated tilt-up concrete panels, aluminum
siding, vinyl siding, or glass that is highly reflective or mirrored.
The texture of the building materials should enhance the design
appearance.
(5) Exterior colors. The building exterior color shall be composed of
nonreflective, subtle, neutral earth tones. The use of high-intensity
colors such as bright reds, oranges or yellows shall not be
permitted. Metallic colors and black shall also be prohibited.
Building trim and/or accents may feature complimentary brighter
colors that are compatible with the primary building color. Color
schemes shall be harmonious and complimentary with adjacent
structures and developments. Neon tube lighting shall not be used
for building trim or accent.
E. Site design.
§ 203-49 WOOLWICH CODE § 203-49
198:756
(1) Complexes. Where the development is a complex of buildings, such
as a shopping center or an office or industrial park with its own
design guidelines, the complex should have a strong sense of place
and unity of design. The complex should not be out of keeping with
the surrounding buildings, but may clearly establish its own
identity. The following shall be used in evaluating the complex. The
complex shall have a sense of place. This should be accomplished
by several elements:
(a) Commonality of materials and style.
(b) A uniform sign package that limits style of letters, colors, and
has rules for size, location and height, based on building
importance in the complex.
(c) An element or elements that provide a strong identifying
image. The strength of the image should be related and
proportional to the scale of the development. A small project
should have an image that is more closely related to neighbors,
while a large regional facility should have greater
differentiation from its neighbors. Features such as a clock
tower, fountain, sculpture, or corner building that has a strong
image are ways in which a strong identity may be created.
(2) Orientation and siting. In the case of freestanding buildings or
structures, and depending on individual site characteristics,
consideration shall be given to site design that provides a desirable
visual composition, avoids blocking natural vistas, and provides
desirable and pleasing space enclosures.
(3) Screening. Careful screening of undesirable design elements such
as storage areas, loading areas, trash bins, mechanical equipment
(ground level or roof-mounted) is critical. These areas and items
shall be screened from any adjacent residential district or use,
highway, road, street or accessway. Trash and storage bins shall be
located in the rear yards of the building or structure, or as
recommended by the Planning Board, and screened. Screening
shall be accomplished and render instant effect by either
architectural design or landscaped buffer or combination thereof,
or as otherwise deemed acceptable by the Planning Board. Earthtone
colors shall be used to maintain the theme established by the
primary building colors.
F. Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms shall have the
meanings indicated:
ARCADE  A covered passageway, often between streets with shops or
stalls. A structure composed of a series of arches supported by columns.
CANOPY  An ornamental projection over a door, window, niche, etc.
Also a roof-like covering supported by columns or other device.

DORMER  A roof projection, normally with a window that is built out
from the slope of a roof. The dormer has its own roof, which may be flat,
arched, or pointed.
EAVE  The edge of a roof. Eaves usually project beyond the side of the
building.
EIFS  Exterior insulation finish system, or EIFS, is a synthetic stuccocladding
used on exterior walls in both commercial and residential
construction. EIFS uses a stucco-like polymer-based outer coating

roof.
GAMBREL ROOF  A roof with its slope broken by an obtuse angle,
the lower slope being steeper, and the upper slope gentler. Many farms
have gambrel roofs.
HIP ROOF  A roof sloping directly in from the walls on every side, and
thus having no gable ends.
MANSARD  A roof divided into a steep lower part and a less steep
upper part on all four sides.
PARAPET  A low wall projecting from the edge of a platform, terrace,
or roof.
PEDIMENT  The gable over the front of a building with a two-pitched
roof, triangular in classical architecture, later arched or broken at the
peak.
PILASTER  A rectangular column engaged in a wall. The pilaster
projects only slightly from the wall, and often has a base, a shaft, and a
capital. Greek revival homes often have pilasters.
PORTICO  A colonnade or covered passageway in classical
architecture.
PYRAMIDAL  A hipped roof that forms a pyramid shape.
RELIEF  The projection of a figure above the ground or plane on
which it is formed.

198:758
§ 203-50. Telecommunications towers, antennas, and related
facilities.
SALTBOX  Similar to a gable roof, but the two sides are not
symmetrical.
SHED  A sloped roof, usually a single plane.
G. Design review process.
(1) The subsections above are set forth as design guidelines.
Additional architectural elements sought to be applied to any new
construction or rehabilitation to existing buildings shall be
submitted to the Woolwich Township Planning Board for approval.

an Architectural Design Advisory Board from which the Planning
Board may request advice and recommendations. The advice and
recommendations from the Architectural Design Advisory Board
shall be made in writing and submitted to the Planning Board.
H. Submittal requirements. Colored renderings of the proposed new
structure, renovation or rehabilitation shall be submitted for review.
Renderings shall depict all building elevations, including a roof plan,
and shall be drawn at a scale of one-fourth inch equals one foot, or as
appropriate to adequately and accurately convey the details and overall
appearance of the proposed structure(s). Rendering colors shall
represent the true color of the proposed building materials, and where
appropriate or requested, actual building material samples shall be
submitted to clearly show the colors and textures of the proposed
materials of construction.
A. Telecommunications towers, antenna, and related facilities shall be
permitted as conditional uses in the nonresidential districts where they
are authorized by this chapter, subject to the following:
(1) Location on an existing telecommunications tower, building, water
tower, or similar facility shall be utilized prior to consideration of
any new sites for towers.
(a) Said facilities shall be painted the same color as the structure
on which it is located.
(b) Welding on a water tower shall be done in such a manner that
no peeling of paint shall occur on either the interior or external
sides of the tank.
(c) When new masts or antennas are added to preexisting towers,
they shall be spaced so as to create the minimal possible signal
interference with other carriers and to promote the maximum
colocation of masts and antennas from other carriers.
§ 203-49 YOUTH SPORTS § 203-50
198:759
(2) Where existing structures are infeasible or unavailable to provide a
reasonable level of service to the carrier, they shall be permitted
only when on a monopole-style tower that does not exceed a height
of 150 feet. Permission to construct such a tower, or to add
antennas to an existing tower, shall be granted only upon
presentation of the following information, to the satisfaction of the
Planning Board:
(a) Municipally owned land shall be considered first as a site for
telecommunications facilities if existing facilities are
unavailable or unsuitable.
(b) A radio frequency coverage map shall be presented and
explained, showing the coverage area of the specific applicant
carrier, before and after installation of the new facilities.
(c) Photo simulations of the facility, taken from the surrounding
area, showing views of the site after installation is complete.
(d) Certifications must be provided that the carrier has a valid
license from the Federal Communications Commission and that
it meets all applicable federal and state safety regulations and/
or guidelines, relating to RF emissions and the structural
stability of the facility, taking into account 110% of the
maximum wind load that can be anticipated in this area.
(e) Base areas, including equipment shelters, shall be surrounded
with a six-foot chain link fence. The use of barbed wire is
prohibited.
(f) The fenced base area shall be surrounded by an opaque
evergreen landscape screen with a height at time of
installation equal to six feet.
(g) Any company proposing to erect a new tower shall design it to
accommodate a minimum of five total carriers and shall submit
a letter of intent to the Township, pledging their willingness to
grant space on the tower to other carriers.
(h) Any tower which is unused for a period of six consecutive
months following commencement of operations shall be
considered to have been abandoned, and shall be removed at
the expense of the companies affected.
(i) Freestanding telecommunications facilities shall be considered
principal uses and shall be required to be located on a separate
lot consisting of not less than 1/2 half acre. The Board may
waive street frontage requirements provided that vehicular
access is provided by means of an easement.
(j) No telecommunications facilities shall be permitted when a
one-hundred-fifty-foot radius, drawn around the base of the
§ 203-50 WOOLWICH CODE § 203-50
198:760
telecommunications tower falls within or adjacent to a park,
playground, or school facility. Telecommunications facilities
may be located on vacant park, playground or school land

ARTICLE VI
Voluntary TDR Program115
[Added 10-27-2008 by Ord. No. 2008-20; amended 8-4-2014 by Ord.
No. 2014-09; 8-20-2018 by Ord. No. 2018-13]
§ 203-51. Allocation and transfer of development rights.
A. The Voluntary TDR Program is intended as a method of preserving land
within certain designated zoning districts by allowing landowners the
voluntary option of transferring their right to develop land to a
receiving zone or district or any other area so designated in this article
and thereby restricting the subject property in perpetuity to agriculture
use, farmland, conservation land, open space or public areas, except as
modified herein. This voluntary land use option will preserve land in
locations where there is limited infrastructure while directing
development to areas most suited for housing and other development
within the Township.
B. Agricultural land involved in an approved development transfer shall be
provided the right to farm benefits under the New Jersey Right to Farm
Act and other benefits that may be provided pursuant to the New Jersey
Agriculture Retention and Development Act.
C. Property from which and to which development potential has been
transferred shall be assessed at its fair market value reflecting the
development transfer. Development potential that has been removed
from a sending zone but has not yet been employed in a receiving zone
shall not be assessed for real property taxation. Property in a sending
zone or receiving zone that has been subject to a development potential
transfer shall be newly valued, assessed, and taxed as of October 1 next
following the development potential transfer.
D. A parcel's eligibility for inclusion under the Voluntary TDR program is
described in the allocation plan which is attached to this article and is
made part of it by reference.116
E. The following minimum eligibility requirements shall be met in order
for an applicant or developer to participate in the Voluntary TDR
Program:
(1) A sending zone parcel shall be designated on the TDR Plan of the
Township Master Plan, and/or on the Acquisition/Preservation Plan
developed in accordance with criteria established by ordinance, as
it may be last amended or superseded. The TDR Plan shall be a subplan
element of the Master Plan of the Township of Woolwich and
shall be amended or superseded pursuant to the provisions of any
applicable law.
115. Editor's Note: Former Art. VI, Planned Developments, as amended, which consisted of
§§ 203-50 through 203-57, was repealed 12-15-2003 by Ord. No. 2003-24.
116. Editor's Note: The allocation plan is on file in the Township offices.
§ 203-51 YOUTH SPORTS § 203-51
198:763
(2) A sending zone parcel must be at least 10 acres in size on the date
that the ordinance is adopted, except as indicated on the parcel list
and map attached hereto.
(3) Sending zone parcels identified on the TDR Plan Map may be
increased in size to support agricultural use of the property without
eliminating the parcels eligibility for credits. Additional credits for
the lands added which have not been enrolled prior to their
addition to an existing lot may be obtained by following the credit
allocation appeal process outlined in § 203-53 below.
(4) A parcel located within a sending zone shall not be subject to
existing deed restrictions or other prohibitions on further
development or subdivision, with the exception of those
participating in the eight-year farmland preservation program or
has had its rights to sewer allocation purchased and/or retired.
(5) No transferable development rights are available for lots or
properties from which all of the development rights have already
been sold or transferred; on which an easement or other restriction
in a deed or other document has been granted to a farmland
preservation program, with the exception of those participating in
the eight-year farmland preservation program, any utility company,
to any other program or agency, or to any person, partnership,
corporation, or other legal entity; lots or properties which have
been restricted from development by the terms or conditions of a
development plan, subdivision approval, or other agreement that
restricts the property from further development; land within the
ultimate right-of-way of existing roads; and lots or properties or
portions of lots or properties which have been designated and used
to meet the open space or resource protection requirements of a
subdivision or site plan.
(6) A sending zone parcel or development right shall not be owned by a
government, government agency, or other political subdivision, a
public utility as defined in N.J.S.A. 48:2-13; or an interstate energy
transmission company regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission.
(7) The property which shall become the subject of the deed of
easement, restriction and enrollment shall contain general
reservation or dedication language for rights-of-way and easement
areas that may be needed for state, county and Township
infrastructure improvements, such as road and drainage
improvements, so long as the public improvements individually or
collectively have no more than a diminimis impact on the actual or
potential use of the premises for agricultural production. The rightof-
way dedication shall be submitted to the state, county or
Township prior to filing the deed language. Impacted properties
shall receive full credit value for public dedications. If the
government entity chooses to purchase right-of-way or easement
§ 203-51 WOOLWICH CODE § 203-51
198:764
areas after the filing of the TDR deed of easement, the purchase
price will be based on the residual value of the property.
(8) Except for uses expressly authorized herein, any site which has
been developed for uses inconsistent with agricultural use and
farmland, open space or public areas shall be deemed ineligible to
participate in the TDR program.
(9) The only criterion for participating in the receiving zone is that the
parcel is located within the boundaries of a receiving zone as
amended and as identified on the TDR Plan Map of the Township
Master Plan.
(10) The locations within the Township of the sending and receiving
zones are attached to this article and made a part of it by
reference.117
F. The applicable base zoning in the sending area shall be a minimum one
single-family detached dwelling unit per 15 gross acres, if the owner of
a sending zone parcel chooses not to participate in the TDR program.
However, if the owner of a vacant sending zone lot smaller than 15
acres existing as of the date of this chapter chooses not to participate in
the TDR program, the owner of that vacant lot shall be entitled to
develop one single-family detached dwelling on that lot provided that
the lot size conforms to the minimum lot size of the underlying zoning.
G. In the Route 322 Corridor receiving area, properties participating in
TDR and subject to residential development under TDR shall be
assigned by-right credits based on one dwelling unit per 1.5 acres in the
RR-2 to RR-6 Zoning Districts. The underlying development rights in
the RR-1 Zoning District is 385,000 square feet of hotel and/or office
space per the Woolwich Adult Settlement Agreement. The applicable
base zoning in the Route 322 Corridor receiving area shall be a
minimum one single-family detached dwelling unit per 15 gross acres
with a mandatory clustering of that gross density to a two-acre lot size
for a single-family detached dwelling unit, if the owner of a receiving
zone parcel which is subject to residential development under TDR
chooses not to participate in the TDR program. Properties participating
in TDR and subject to the Woolwich Adult Settlement Agreement shall
be assigned by-right credits based on 3.5 dwelling units per acre
totaling 797 units in RR-BD-1 (extension to five smaller parcels) and
261 units in RR-BD-2. The base zoning in all other portions of the Route
322 Corridor receiving area shall remain as that which were in effect on
the date Ordinance No. 2008-20 was adopted on October 27, 2008.
H. In the Route 322 Corridor receiving area, properties zoned MU-1
bounded by Route 322, Kings Highway and Pancoast Road shall not be
permitted by-right residential development. If developers choose to
develop housing units in mixed use retail/residential buildings,
117. Editor's Note: The locations are on file in the Township offices.
§ 203-51 YOUTH SPORTS § 203-51
198:765
participation in TDR will be required to support those units. [Amended
9-3-2019 by Ord. No. 2019-12]
I. In the Auburn Road receiving area, by-right credits are calculated
based on zoning in effect on the date Ordinance No. 2008-20 was
adopted on October 27, 2008. However, no more than 130 single-family
houses may be constructed using these by-right credits. All remaining
by-right credits shall be used to construct twin dwelling units on the
basis of 1.6 twins being the equivalent of one single-family unit.
Nonparticipation in TDR results in permitted densities based on the
zoning in effect on October 27, 2008.
J. No density increases may be achieved in a receiving area without the
use of appropriate instruments of transfer.
K. Increasing the development potential of a parcel of property not located
in a designated receiving zone for which a variance has been granted by
more than 5% shall constitute a receiving zone and the receiving zone
provisions of this article shall apply with respect to the amount of
development potential required to implement the variance. This shall
not apply to any development that fulfills the definition of a minor site
plan or minor subdivision plan.
L. This Voluntary TDR Program shall no longer be reasonable if state plan
endorsement or regulations adopted pursuant thereto are no longer in
effect or a sufficient percentage of the development potential has not
been transferred as provided in N.J.S.A. 40:55D-156.
M. This Voluntary TDR Program, including the real estate market analysis,
shall be reviewed by the Joint Land Use Board and the Township
Committee at the end of three years subsequent to its adoption. This
review shall include an analysis of development potential transactions
in both the private and public market, an update of current conditions
in comparison to the development transfer plan element of the
Township's Master Plan and Capital Improvement Program, and an
assessment of the performance goals of the development transfer
program, including an evaluation of the units constructed with and
without the utilization of the development transfer ordinance. A report
of findings from this review shall be submitted to the County Planning
Board, the State Office for Planning Advocacy and the County
Agricultural Development Board (CADB), for review and
recommendations. Based on this review, the Township shall act to
maintain and enhance the value of development transfer potential not
yet utilized and, if necessary, amend the Capital Improvement Program,
the Development Transfer Plan Element of the Master Plan, and this
TDR article.
N. This Voluntary TDR Program, including the real estate market analysis,
shall also be reviewed by the Joint Land Use Board and Township
Committee at the end of five years subsequent to its adoption. This
review shall provide for the examination of the development transfer
§ 203-51 WOOLWICH CODE § 203-51
198:766
ordinance and the real estate market analysis to determine whether
the program for development transfer and the permitted uses in the
sending zone continue to remain economically viable, and, if not, an
update of the Development Transfer Plan Element of the Master Plan
and Capital Improvement Program shall be required. If at least 25% of
the development potential has not transferred at the end of this fiveyear
period, the development transfer ordinance shall be presumed to
be no longer reasonable, including any zoning changes adopted as part
of the development transfer program, within 90 days after the end of
the five-year period unless one of the following is met:
(1) The Township immediately takes action to acquire or provide for
the private purchase of the difference between the development
potential already transferred and 25% of the total development
transfer potential created in the sending zone under the
development transfer ordinance;
(2) A majority of the property owners in a sending zone who own land
from which the development potential has not yet been transferred
agree that the TDR ordinance should remain in effect;
(3) The Township can demonstrate either future success or can
demonstrate that low levels of development potential transfer
activity are due, not to ordinance failure, but to low levels of
development demand in general. This demonstration shall require
the concurrence of the County Planning Board and the State Office
for Planning Advocacy and shall be the subject of a Township public
hearing conducted prior to a final determination regarding the
future viability of the TDR program;
(4) The Township can demonstrate that less than 25% of the remaining
development potential in the sending zone has been available for
sale at market value during the five-year period.
O. The Joint Land Use Board and the Township Committee shall review the
TDR ordinance and the real estate market analysis at least every five
years with every second review occurring in conjunction with the
review and update of the Township Master Plan. This review shall
provide for the examination of the ordinance and the real estate market
analysis to determine whether the program and uses permitted in the
sending zone continue to be economically viable and, if not, an update
of the Development Transfer Plan Element of the Master Plan and
Capital Improvement Program shall be required. If 25% of the
remaining development transfer potential at the start of each five-year
review period in the sending zone under the TDR ordinance has not
been transferred during the five-year period, the Township Committee
shall repeal the development transfer ordinance, including any zoning
changes adopted as part of the development transfer program, within
90 days after the end of that five-year period unless the Township meets
one of the standards established pursuant to § 20 of P.L. 2003, c. 2
(N.J.S.A. 40:55D-156).
§ 203-51 YOUTH SPORTS § 203-51
198:767
§ 203-52. Credit allocation.
P. The county shall not be permitted to sell development rights to
receiving zone buyers, in accordance with N.J.S.A. 40:55D-160, from
already preserved lands under the provisions of the Agriculture
Retention and Development Act, P.L. 1983, c. 32 (N.J.S.A. 4:1C-11 et
seq.).
Q. The number of credits from one sending parcel may be allocated to
more than one receiving parcel and one receiving parcel may accept
credits from more than one sending parcel.
A. Pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-137, a transfer of development rights
program must seek to transfer the development potential from areas
where preservation is most appropriate to areas where growth can be
better accommodated and maximized.
B. Pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-115, "development potential" is defined as
"the maximum number of dwelling units or square feet of nonresidential
floor area that could be constructed on a specified lot or in a specified
zone under the Township Master Plan and land use regulations in effect
on the date of the adoption of the development transfer ordinance and
in accordance with recognized environmental constraints."
C. The Township TDR credit allocation formula seeks to closely estimate
the number of dwelling units which could have been built on each
eligible parcel given the base zoning density as set forth in the district,
which zoning is replaced by the adoption of this article and the
environmental constraints present on the site. As referenced above,
base zoning density shall be based on the zoning in place as of October
27, 2008, per Ordinance No. 2005-25 (and further amended per
Ordinance No. 2008-19) which stipulates the zoning densities for the
R-1 Zone District, R-2 Zone District, R-3 Zone District and 5A Zone
District respectively.
D. The underlying zoning district requires the use of individual septic
tanks for sewage disposal. Accordingly, it has been determined that it is
the suitability of soil for septic tank permitting which most directly
indicates the development rights or credits that are allocated.
E. The standard source of information related to the septic suitability of
soils located in Gloucester County is the USDA Soil Conservation
Service (SCS) soil survey (survey). The SCS survey characteristics soil
based on numerous factors, one of which is the disposal of septic
effluent. The combination of the soils' characteristics results in a septic
suitability rating of slight, moderate or severe.
F. In order to allocate credits in a manner consistent with the preexisting
zoning but within the context of environmental constraints, the formula
set forth below was developed and applied to the computerized soils
data generated for each parcel. Prior to applying the formula, each
§ 203-51 WOOLWICH CODE § 203-52
198:768
§ 203-53. Credit allocation appeal process.
parcel had an infrastructure factor assigned to it to reflect acreage
needs accordingly. From that, the net acreage was calculated, to which
the formula set forth below was then applied.
G. All sending zone parcels are assigned a minimum of one full credit. Any
allocation above one credit is rounded down to the nearest 1/4 credit.
H. Credit allocation formula:

* Note: Parcels in the R-3 Zoning District that are sending zone
parcels are outside of the existing sewer service area and are
therefore subject by ordinance to R-2 regulations as per § 203-42,
amended 8-1-2005.
I. All parcels eligible for participation in the TDR program as set forth in
the Master Plan have been identified and a computation of the TDR
credits allocated pursuant to the credit allocation plan, which is
incorporated within this section by reference.
J. Upon the adoption of this section the Township Clerk shall file with the
County Recording Office a copy of the allocation plan and Zoning Map
showing graphically the location of the Township's sending and
receiving areas. A change in the credit allocation made by the allocation
plan by appeal, assignment or transfer to be effective must similarly be
recorded in the County Recording Office.
A. Any landowner eligible for participation in a TDR program who is
dissatisfied with their credit allocation may appeal their allocation in
accordance with the procedures set forth below.
B. Any appeal of a credit allocation must occur prior to the recording of a
TDR deed of easement. Once a property is restricted through the
§ 203-52 YOUTH SPORTS § 203-53
198:769
recording of the easement, the opportunity for an allocation appeal
is lost and the parcel's owner shall be irrefutably presumed to have
elected to accept the allocation given as an appropriate measure of the
development potential of the parcel.
C. The landowner shall submit a properly completed and required TDR
credit appeal application and applicable review fees to the
Administrative Officer. Review fees shall be the same as TDR fees in
effect at the time of appeal. The TDR credit appeal application shall
include the following information:
(1) Date of appeal.
(2) Name(s), mailing address(es) and telephone number(s) of all
property owners, of record.
(3) Copy of the latest legal description and deed to the property.
(4) Title report if so requested by the Administrative Officer if the
Administrative Officer or other Township Officials have reason to
believe that the property is the subject of a development
restriction.
(5) Block and lot number(s) of the tract parcel(s).
(6) Acreage of parcel(s) pursuant to Tax Map or property survey.
(7) Number of credits assigned to the parcel pursuant to the Allocation
Table and number requested by the applicant.
(8) Supporting documentation which fulfills the requirements of the
appeal process.
(9) Signature of applicant(s) and landowner(s), if different from the
applicant.
(10) The appeal shall be publicly noticed in the same manner as notices
for other applications for development in accordance with N.J.S.A.
40:55D-12.
D. In order to appeal the allocation of credits, the landowner must include
the following submissions:
(1) A NJ-Geoweb map, GIS map or equivalent showing the premises
boundary and mapped wetlands, streams, and waterbodies.
(2) A soils map, based on current Natural Resources Conservation
Service (NRCS) Web Soil Survey data, depicting all mapped soil
types with name, symbol, and sewage disposal suitability rating
[not limited, somewhat limited, or very limited based on the sewage
disposal (NJ) rating] on the premises.
(3) Soil borings or test pits shall be performed. A minimum of two soil
borings/test pits shall be performed within each separate soil map
§ 203-53 WOOLWICH CODE § 203-53
198:770
unit containing at least one acre and at least one soil boring/test pit
shall be performed within each separate soil map unit containing
less than one acre. Additional soil borings or test pits shall be
performed so that that the total is at least one per two acres of the
total tract. Soil boring/test pit locations shall be distributed evenly
throughout the premises. An explanation of any areas avoided shall
be submitted. Where necessary to determine the soil suitability
rating, permeability testing shall be performed at each boring/
test pit location in accordance with the soil testing procedures
as required in NJAC 7:9A, Standards for Individual Subsurface
Sewage Disposal Systems. A soil boring/test pit location map, soil
logs, and permeability results shall be submitted. If necessary
to accurately map the sewage disposal suitability of soils on the
premises, the Joint Land Use Board Planner may request additional
soil tests be performed.
(4) A report and map to summarize the findings of the soil testing and
categorize the disposal suitability throughout the premises. The
report and map shall include areas (acreage) of each alternatively
proposed sewage disposal rating and an explanation of the
rationale for the change in rating.
(5) A calculation of the credit allocation pursuant to the credit
allocation formula contained in § 203-52H for the proposed revised
areas of sewage disposal suitability of soils based on the sewage
disposal (NJ) rating. The terminology of sewage disposal suitability
of soils based on the sewage disposal (NJ) rating has modified the
terminology used in § 203-52H so that "slight limitation" is now
"not limited," "moderate limitation" is now "somewhat limited," and
"severe limitation" is now "very limited." For purposes of the
calculations, soils that are not limited for sewage disposal pursuant
to the sewage disposal (NJ) rating shall be treated as equivalent to
"slight soils" as set forth in § 203-52H, soils that are somewhat
limited for sewage disposal pursuant to the sewage disposal (NJ)
rating shall be treated as being equivalent to "moderate soils" and
soils that are very limited for sewage disposal pursuant to the
sewage disposal (NJ) rating shall be treated as equivalent to
"severe soils."
(6) The Joint Land Use Board Planner shall review the soil tests,
report, map and credit allocation calculation to determine what
adjustments, if any, should be made to the credit allocation that
was assigned to the premises pursuant to § 203-52.
E. If the Joint Land Use Board determines based on the information
submitted that the credit allocation made pursuant to § 203-52 should
be adjusted, then the adjusted credit allocation for the premises shall
be recorded in the Allocation Table.
§ 203-53 YOUTH SPORTS § 203-53

§ 203-54. TDR bank, creation, transfer and use.
F. The landowner shall receive an additional one-time 1/4 credit if the
appeal process as described above results in showing that the Township
credit allocation was off by 20% or more.
G. Appeal of a Joint Land Use Board decision in the determination of the
allocation of credits shall be made to a New Jersey Court of competent
jurisdiction as provided for by law.

(a) The Board of Directors shall appoint an Executive Director as
the chief administrative officer of the TDR Bank. The Executive
Director shall serve at the pleasure of the Board.
(4) Powers of TDR Bank.
(a) The TDR Bank is established for the purchase, sale or
exchange of the development potential that is available for
transfer from a sending zone. In accordance with N.J.S.A.
40:55D-159, the TDR Bank shall have the following powers:
[1] Purchase property in a sending zone if adequate funds
have been provided for these purposes and the person
from whom the development potential is to be purchased
demonstrates possession of marketable title to the
property, is legally empowered to restrict the use of the
property in conformance with P.L. 2004, c.2 (N.J.S.A.
40:55D-137 et seq.), and certifies that the property is not
otherwise encumbered or transferred.
§ 203-53 WOOLWICH CODE § 203-54
198:772
[2] For the purposes of its own development potential
transactions, establish a municipal average of the value of
the development potential of all property in a sending
zone, which value shall generally reflect market value
prior to the effective date of the development transfer
ordinance. The establishment of this municipal average
shall not prohibit the purchase of development potential
for any price by private sale or transfer, but shall be only
taken into consideration when the development transfer
bank itself is purchasing the development potential of
property in the sending zone. Several average values in
any sending zone may be established for greater accuracy
of valuation.
[3] Sell, exchange or otherwise convey the development
potential of property that it has purchased or otherwise
acquired pursuant to the provisions of P.L. 2004, c.2
(N.J.S.A. 40:55D-137 et seq.), but only in a manner that
does not substantially impair the private sale or transfer of
development potential.
[4] When a sending zone includes agricultural land, the TDR
Bank shall, when considering the purchase of development
potential based upon values established by the municipal
average, submit the municipal average arrived at pursuant

through 42 of P.L. 1999, c.152 (N.J.S.A. 13:8C-1 et seq.) to
the maximum extent practicable and feasible.
[5] Apply for funds for the purchase of development potential
under the provisions of Sections 1 through 42 of P.L. 1999,
c.152 (N.J.S.A. 13:8C-1 et seq.), or any other act providing
funds for the purpose of acquiring and developing land for
recreation and conservation purposes consistent with the
provisions and conditions of those acts.
[6] Apply for matching funds for the purchase of development
potential under the provisions of the Garden State
Preservation Trust Act, sections 1 through 42 of P.L. 1999,
c.152 (N.J.S.A. 13:8C-1 et seq.) for the purpose of farmland
preservation and agricultural development consistent with
the provisions and conditions of that act and the
Agriculture Retention and Development Act, P.L. 1983,
c.32 (N.J.S.A. 4:1C-11 et seq.). In addition, the TDR Bank
may apply to the State Transfer of Development Rights
§ 203-54 YOUTH SPORTS § 203-54
198:773
Bank established pursuant to Section 3 of P.L. 1993, c.339
(N.J.S.A. 4:1C-51) for either planning or development
potential purchasing funds, or both, as provided pursuant
to Section 4 of P.L. 1993, c.339 (N.J.S.A. 4:1C-52).
[7] Undertake any and all other functions granted to

has agreed in writing to subordinate their interest in the parcel
to the public interests set forth in the deed of credit use and
extinguishment; or
(c) The developer owns the credits to be used and extinguished.
(6) Upon determining the facts set forth above, the Joint Land Use
Board Solicitor shall certify to these facts by:
(a) Signing the deed of credit use and extinguishment at a space
provided.
(b) Returning the original deed of credit use and extinguishment
to the Administrative Officer for further processing.
(7) If the Administrative Officer determines that the request and
supporting documentation establishes the criteria set forth above,
the Administrative Officer shall sign the deed of credit use and
extinguishment, certifying that upon recording the deed of credit
use and extinguishment will permanently transfer the number of
credits contained within it to the parcel of land cited, provided that
if the deed of credit use and extinguishment is not recorded within
90 days of the date that the certification is signed, unless this time
period is extended by the applicant, the deed of credit use and
extinguishment shall be null and void.
(8) If the Administrative Officer shall fail to act within the time periods
provided, the application shall be deemed approved.
(9) Upon signing, the deed of credit use and extinguishment shall be
returned to the landowner for recording.
(10) The owner or developer of the land using the credits shall, upon
filing of the deed of credit use and extinguishment, file proof of
recording with the Administrative Officer prior to the issuance of

credible evidence of the transfer to the Township Clerk or other
designee within 30 days of the transaction. Each and every day in
which the transaction record has not been so transmitted to the

separate violation of the provisions of this article and is enforceable
by fine, imprisonment, and/or community service as otherwise
provided herein. The Township Clerk shall so record the
transaction in the Record of Transfer and annually in January
provide a copy of the Record of Transfer to the Administrative
Officer and the Tax Assessor's Office to be kept on file.
(16) The Township shall annually prepare and submit a report on
activity undertaken pursuant to this article to the County Planning
Board which in turn is expected to submit copies of the Township
report along with an analysis of the effectiveness of the article to
the Office for Planning Advocacy, the County Agriculture
Development Board, and the State TDR Bank on July 1 of the third
year next following enactment and annually thereafter.

H. Subdivision for new or existing single-family house or farmstead.
(1) Landowners desiring to subdivide a lot for a new or an existing
single-family detached house or farmstead on land proposed for
transfer of credits shall meet the following requirements:
§ 203-54 WOOLWICH CODE § 203-54
198:786
§ 203-55. Disenrollment.
(a) The applicant may simultaneously file an application for minor
subdivision approval to create a lot for the new or existing
residence or farmstead. The minor subdivision application
shall not be subject to the creeping subdivision provisions of
the definition of "minor subdivision" whereby any second
subdivision of land subsequent to involving the same tract shall
be deemed a major subdivision.
(b) The lot proposed for subdivision containing the new or existing
single-family detached house or farmstead shall meet the
minimum standards for lots within the zoning district, but shall
not exceed two acres in area.
(c) The newly created lot for the new or existing residence or
farmstead shall be deed restricted from further subdivision.
(d) One full credit shall be subtracted from the total credits to be
transferred from the tract, and so recorded in the Record of
Transfers.
(e) The remaining vacant lot shall contain at least 15 acres. No
new single-family detached dwelling can be developed on the
vacant lot pursuant to Subsection G(1)(d)[3] above if the
vacant lot contains less than 50 acres. A new single-family
detached dwelling can be developed pursuant to Subsection
G(1)(d)[7] above on any vacant lot containing at least 50 acres.
(2) Any lots created by the division of property by testamentary or
intestate provisions without approval of the Joint Land Use Board
shall be entitled to only those benefits under this Chapter 203 the
property would have been entitled to if the lot had not been so
subdivided.
I. One full credit shall be subtracted from the total credits to be
transferred from the tract, and so recorded in the Record of Transfers,
if a subdivision of lots occurs between at least 15 acres but less than 50
acres in size for one new lot created for an existing or proposed singlefamily
detached dwelling unit. The land owner must decide whether to
utilize a credit at the time of easement dedication. Subdivision of the
premises resulting in parcels of at least 50 acres is permitted without
the use of a TDR credit.
J. Should the Township acquire ownership of a sending parcel, the land
may be used for recreation coincidental with the definition of "public
areas" while continuing to promote farmland preservation,
conservation of open space, and preservation of view sheds.
A. It is understood that the TDR Program is voluntary. The Master Plan
and Zoning Ordinance provide a reasonable balance between the
number of credits which are allocated to the sending area(s) and the
§ 203-54 YOUTH SPORTS § 203-55
198:787
capacity of the acreage within the receiving area(s) to accommodate
transferred credits; however, if a number of landowners/developers
within the receiving area elect to subdivide their land without the
use of credits, it is conceivable that more credits capable of being
transferred will have been created than available locations for their
receipt. Recognizing the inherent unfairness which may be visited upon
a property owner in the sending zone or his assignee should property
be enrolled within the program without there being in existence an
adequate area within the receiving zone to utilize the credits so
created, this subsection has been created to provide relief. Section C,
40:55D-154 of the Municipal Land Use Law establishes standards for
the rebuttable presumption that the development transfer ordinance is
no longer reasonable and as such a land owner may seek disenrollment
if the ordinance is deemed to be no longer reasonable by the Township.
B. If a rebuttable presumption exists pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-154 and
the Township has failed to demonstrate that any of the criteria in
N.J.S.A. 40:55D-156a-d have been met or if the Township has repealed
this Article VI, a landowner owning a parcel of land enrolled within a
TDR program and having imposed the required TDR deed of easement
on the land may apply to the Joint Land Use Board for disenrollment of
the procedures set forth below.
C. Procedure for disenrollment.
(1) A landowner who desires to disenroll his land from involvement
with the TDR program shall follow the following procedures:
(a) The landowner, on forms authorized by the Board and obtained
from the Township Clerk, shall submit to the Administrative
Officer:
[1] The original and two copies of a fully completed
application for TDR disenrollment form.
[2] Review fees.
[3] The original and two copies of the disenrollment document
designed to terminate the restrictions imposed upon the
landowner's property.
[4] Clear proof of title provided by the landowner.
[5] Proof that none of the credits created for the property by
enrollment have been used by another property owner or
developer through the filing of a deed of credit transfer or
assigned to a third party who does not consent to the
disenrollment application.
(b) The Administrative Officer shall, within 45 days of receipt,
determine that the application is complete.
§ 203-55 WOOLWICH CODE § 203-55
198:788
(c) Upon determination that the application is complete, the
Administrative Officer shall schedule a public hearing before
the Joint Land Use Board on notice to the public unless the
Township has repealed this Article VI. At this hearing, the Joint
Land Use Board shall determine whether a rebuttable
presumption exists pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-154 and if so
whether any of the criteria specified in N.J.S.A. 40:55D-156a-d
exist. In reaching these conclusions, the Joint Land Use Board
shall take into consideration all evidence, both submitted in
favor of and in opposition to the relief required, in accordance
with the procedures normally available for development
applications before the Board. After this review, the Board
shall reduce its findings to a written resolution recommending
to the Township Committee whether to grant or deny the
application proposed. If the Board fails to act within 90 days of
the date the application is submitted, unless this time period is
extended by the applicant, the application shall be deemed
denied and the applicant shall be required to reapply if relief is
to be obtained.
(d) If the application is approved, the record before the Board,
including its findings, shall be submitted to the Township
Committee, to the applicant and to all persons who
participated in the public hearing. The Township Committee
shall review the proceedings before the Joint Land Use Board
and determine whether good cause exists for the relief
specified. If they agree that the relief should be granted or if
the Township has repealed this Article VI, they shall direct the
Mayor and Township Clerk to execute the disenrollment
document. Upon execution by the Mayor and Clerk, approval to
disenroll shall be recorded in the County Clerk's Office.
(e) The landowner shall request approval of the release of the
restrictions imposed upon the landowner's property from the
Commissioner of Environmental Protection in accordance with
the requirements of the New Jersey Conservation Restriction
and Historic Preservation Restriction Act, N.J.S.A. 13:8B-1 et
seq. Proof of the release, which is evidenced by a certificate of
the Commissioner of Environmental Protection, shall be
recorded in the same manner as the restriction and the
disenrollment document.
(f) Upon receipt of proof of recording of the disenrollment
document and the release certificate issued by the
Commissioner of Environmental Protection, the Administrative
Officer shall:
[1] Record the fact that the disenrollment document has been
recorded on the Township records, including the Clerk's
assigned book and page of recording, if known.
§ 203-55 YOUTH SPORTS § 203-55
198:789
§ 203-56. Building regulating plan.
[2] Forward a copy of the recorded disenrollment document to
the Joint Land Use Board and TDR Bank for their
information.
D. The landowner seeking disenrollment shall be responsible for all costs
associated with the review of the disenrollment, including professional
fees authorized by this article.
E. The landowner may extend the time limits for administrative action by
the Administrative Officer or by the Planning Board. This right to
extend shall not apply to any time period set forth in this article for
recording of a document.
A. The use of development credits shall occur as indicated on an approved
plan for the receiving area lots that have been specified for
development. Receiving area lots have "by-right" densities as
established in the TDR real estate market analysis as base zoning that
may be exercised as part of the TDR development process.
B. Each of the permitted housing types shall be equal to the following
development credits for units transferred from the sending zone(s):
US 322 Corridor Receiving Zone:
1.3 Single-family
detached
= 1 credit
2.25 Duplex or twin unit = 1 credit
2.95 Townhouse = 1 credit
3.3 Urban apartment/
flat
= 1 credit
C. (Reserved)118
D. The TDR development option may be exercised only for parcels located
within receiving zones or districts. Applicants exercising the TDR
development option shall submit an application that includes land
within both the areas or districts in accordance with their respective
requirements. Application for receiving zone development may only be
made after the layout for that portion of the receiving districts intended
for importation of credits from the sending zone(s) has received
preliminary subdivision approval from the Planning Board. The
applicant shall have secured through an equity interest all necessary
credits for increasing the permitted density in the receiving area(s)
prior to final action being taken by the Planning Board.
E. Prior to any approval of a receiving area development plan, the Joint
Land Use Board shall find the following facts and conclusions:

9-3-2019 by Ord. No. 2019-12.
§ 203-55 WOOLWICH CODE § 203-56
198:790
§ 203-57. (Reserved)
(1) That departures by the proposed development from zoning
regulations otherwise applicable to the subject properties conform
to the zoning ordinance standards pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-65c;
(2) That the proposals for the maintenance and conservation of
common open space are reliable, and the amount, location and
purpose of the common open space are adequate;
(3) That provisions through the physical design of the proposed
development for public services, control over vehicular and
pedestrian traffic, and the amenities of light and air, recreation and
visual enjoyment are adequate;
(4) That the proposed development will not have an unreasonably
adverse impact upon the area in which it is proposed to be
established;
(5) In the case of a proposed development which contemplates
construction over a period of years, that the terms and conditions
intended to protect the interests of the public and the residents,
occupants and owners of the proposed development in the total
completion of the development are adequate;
(6) That the proposed development will have adequate public water
and public sanitary sewer capacity for the intensity of development
requested.
F. The Joint Land Use Board shall act upon an application for a
development within the receiving area in the same time and manner as
for a preliminary major subdivision application pursuant to N.J.S.A.
40:55D-48. No action shall be taken upon the development application
unless a complete submission has been made in accordance with the
applicable checklist.
G. Affordable housing requirements.
(1) For nonresidential uses, compliance with the Statewide Non-
Residential Development Fee Act,119 or other relevant statute, is
required subject to all applicable affordable housing requirements
as contained in Article XII.
(2) For residential uses in the RR-BD and MU Zoning Districts, a
minimum of 204 units shall be affordable, subject to all applicable
housing requirements as contained in Article XII.
(3) For residential units in the RR Zoning District, a development fee of
1.5% of the equalized assessed value of the residential construction
shall be paid into the Township's Housing Trust Fund.

landscape plan. They may be placed anywhere on the site, but are
in addition to other required trees.
(7) In the event that the applicant establishes to the satisfaction of the
Planning Board that constraints incident to the land itself
(including, without limitation, extreme topography, unsuitable
soils, rock outcrops and existing uninterrupted dense canopy)
render it impractical to locate on the lot the required number of
compensatory trees, then, at the election of the Planning Board, the
applicant shall: install a portion of the required compensatory trees
on other public lands within the Township; contribute to the
Township the estimated cost of those trees which cannot practically
be installed on the property for later installation of trees on public
lands; and/or install fewer, larger or more valuable compensatory
trees on the lot with an aggregate cost as installed and guaranteed
not less than the estimated aggregate cost of the required number
of compensatory trees. Whichever alternative is elected by the
Board shall serve as the basis for calculating the required financial
security in conformance with Subsection E(7)(f) above.
H. Street trees.
§ 203-68 WOOLWICH CODE § 203-68
198:808
(1) Street trees shall be required along all existing or proposed public
or private streets when they abut or lie within the proposed
subdivision or site plan, and are in addition to other required
plantings.
(2) Street trees shall be placed in a planting strip located between the
proposed sidewalk and curb, within the right-of-way line. Where no
sidewalks are proposed and are not planned in the future, the trees
shall be placed five feet behind the curb or edge of pavement.
Street trees shall not be planted within clear sight triangles, as
defined in this chapter.
(3) Street trees shall comply with the size and spacing requirements
below. A minimum of 50% of the proposed street trees shall be
native to the region.
Tree Size
(feet)
Planting Interval
(feet)
Large trees (40+) 40
Medium-sized trees (30-40) 30
Small trees (to 30) 20
(4) The linear footage of right-of-way or pavement frontage shall be
divided by the planting interval, without deducting the areas of
driveway cuts or crosswalks. Fractions shall be rounded up. Trees
shall be distributed along the entire planting strip, although they
need not be evenly spaced.
(5) To prevent the total obliteration of sections of trees by disease or
insect infestation, a variety of trees shall be used in each street tree
planting. Species mix shall conform to Subsection E(4) above.
Street tree species should not be alternated, but should be grouped
at the designers discretion. This does not preclude the limited use
of a singular species of tree to create a strong design statement. In
general, no more than 20 trees in a row or in a cluster should be of
the same species, unless otherwise approved.
(6) In certain rural sections of the Township, the planting of groves or
clusters of street trees may be more appropriate to replicate the
naturally occurring patterns of succession. In these cases, the
following additional guidelines shall apply:
(a) Two street trees with a minimum one-and-one-half-inch to twoinch
caliper may be substituted for each one required street
tree.
(b) Clusters shall contain from two to seven trees. The number of
trees in each sequential cluster should be varied.
§ 203-68 YOUTH SPORTS § 203-68
198:809
(c) The trees within the clusters shall be spaced from 15 feet to 30
feet on center.
(d) The maximum distance between clusters shall be no greater
than 75 feet.
(e) The width of the tree planting strip may extend up to 15 feet
onto the lot from the right-of-way line.
(7) Alternate arrangements to create a special effect (i.e., columnar
trees spaced 15 feet on center at a development entry) may be
permitted on a case-by-case basis, when approved by the Planning
Board.
(8) Trees shall be planted so as not to interfere with the installation
and maintenance of sidewalks and utilities, in accordance with the
following guidelines.
(9) Plantings shall not block, impede or interfere with the installation,
safe use, operation or maintenance of roadways, sidewalks, sight
easements, utilities, and lighting in accordance with the following
guidelines. Plantings shall not be of an invasive nature, weedy or
brittle character, easily susceptible to pest infestations and/or
diseases, or possess hazardous characteristics (bee-attracting,
poisonous, thorny) when used in areas designated for sitting or
play.
(a) Five feet from curbs and sidewalks. If trees are located closer
than 10 feet to a sidewalk, root barriers shall be placed along
the tree side of the sidewalk for a distance of 12 feet, centered
on the trunk. Root barriers are not required along the curb;
(b) Ten feet from underground utilities;
(c) Fifteen feet from overhead utilities, unless the use of small
shade or ornamental trees is approved; and
(d) Trees planted adjacent to sidewalks shall be limbed to a
minimum of seven feet.
(10) The street tree requirement may be waived where existing
preserved vegetation is considered sufficient to meet these
requirements, and is reasonably assured of continued survival.
(11) If tree pits are used within paved areas, they may be covered with
tree grates and/or a variety of porous materials; however, the
minimum surface area for gas exchange must be 15 square feet per
tree, unless otherwise approved by the Planning Board.
I. Landscaping for parking lots, loading and vehicle storage areas.
(1) Except for detached single-family and two-family dwelling units, a
screen planting, berm, fence, wall or combination thereof, no less
§ 203-68 WOOLWICH CODE § 203-68
198:810
than four feet in height, measured from the center line of the
adjacent street, shall be provided between the off-street parking
areas and any lot line or street line except where a building
intervenes or where the distance between such areas and the lot
line or street line is greater than 150 feet.
(2) All site plans/subdivisions that contain parking lots, access lanes
and service drives shall be designed to include planting islands,
divider strips and/or building foundation plantings. Such
landscaped areas shall be distributed throughout the vehicular use
area, or along their perimeter, in order to break the view of parked
vehicles in a manner not impairing visibility.
(3) Planting islands shall conform to the following standards:
(a) Planting islands shall be distributed throughout the parking
lot, according to one of these two formulas:
[1] One planting island, a minimum of nine feet wide by 18
feet long, spaced not more than 180 feet apart, or every 20
parking stalls, in single or double bays; or
[2] One diamond tree pit, a minimum of four feet square,
spaced not more than 45 feet apart, or every five parking
stalls in double bays. These are to be placed at an angle of
45° to the stalls, at the conjunction of four adjacent stalls.
In addition, islands 18 feet in width shall be provided at
the ends of rows in which diamond tree pits are used.
(b) Islands should be placed opposite each other in adjacent rows
of parking, to reduce the number of raised islands, and to
increase the area available for tree roots.
(c) The last parking stall in a row shall be separated from drive
aisles by a planting island, a minimum of nine feet in width.
(d) Each planting island shall contain one shade tree plus three
shrubs, ground cover, perennials and/or mulch to cover the
entire area at maturity. At least 50% of the proposed shade
trees shall be native to the region. Shrubs located at the ends
of the islands shall be maintained at a maximum height of 2 1/2
feet for sight line and safety purposes.
(4) Divider strips shall conform to the following standards:
(a) Divider strips shall be placed at every other bay of parking,
running the length of the rows of parking, and be landscaped
with plantings of shade, ornamental, and/or flowering trees,
plus shrubs, ground cover and/or mulch to cover the entire
area at maturity. A bay of parking is the width of pavement
needed to accommodate either one or two rows of parking
stalls plus one access lane.
§ 203-68 YOUTH SPORTS § 203-68
198:811
(b) Divider strips shall be a minimum of 10 feet wide, unless a
sidewalk is proposed within the divider strip, then the divider
strip shall be increased in width by six feet. An approved root
barrier shall be placed along the tree side of the sidewalk for a
distance of 12 feet, centered on the trunk.
[1] The quantity of shade trees required shall be calculated at
one tree per 40 feet of divider-strip length, exclusive of
end islands. Two ornamental trees may be substituted for
one shade tree, for up to 50% of the requirement. The
trees need not be spaced evenly apart; however, the
maximum spacing shall be 50 feet.
[2] The quantity of shrubs shall be calculated at one shrub per
10 feet of divider strip, exclusive of end islands. Shrubs
shall be spaced according to size, but not more than five
feet apart. Gaps may be placed between the shrub
plantings to provide areas for ground covers, decorative
mulch beds, artwork, crosswalks, or flowering plants.
Shrubs within 10 feet of the ends of the strips shall not
exceed 2 1/2 feet in height, so as not to block visibility. This
shall not preclude the use of taller shrubs elsewhere
within the divider island.
(5) All loading areas shall be landscaped and screened sufficiently to
obscure the view of the parked vehicles and loading platforms from
any public street throughout the year. Such screening shall be by
an extension of the building, a fence, berm, wall, planting or
combination thereof and shall not be less than five feet in height at
the time of planting, and eight feet in height at maturity.
(6) To prevent conflicts with the opening and closing of automobile
doors, and to reduce damage from automobile overhangs, all shrub
plantings in parking lot islands and divider strips located adjacent
to or abutting parking stalls shall be set back a minimum of two
feet from the curb or edge of pavement.
(7) Plantings required within the parking areas are exclusive of other
planting requirements such as street trees, buffer and
compensatory plantings.
(8) See § 203-69 for further requirements for buffers.
J. Facade plantings. To break up long stretches of facade and provide a
more comfortable pedestrian environment, plantings shall be placed
along the sides of buildings facing parking lots and street rights-of-way,
according to the following standards:
(1) Plantings are required for all sides of a non-single-family
residential building facing parking lots or areas intended primarily
for pedestrian use. Plantings are not required along the sides of
buildings containing service or loading areas, unless they also face
§ 203-68 WOOLWICH CODE § 203-68
198:812
parking areas. If part of a side of the building faces parking, only
that portion is subject to these requirements.
(2) Plantings are required for all sides of a non-single-family
residential building facing a street right-of-way.
(3) Plantings shall front a minimum of 50% of the length of the building
and any outdoor retail, cafe or occupied areas. Screen plantings
are not required in front of outdoor sales or cafe areas; however,
consideration should be given to placing some of the required trees
in front of these areas.
(4) Facade plantings should consist of a minimum of 50% evergreen
material to ensure that landscaping is present during the late fall to
early spring seasons.
(5) The minimum planting requirement shall be one shade tree per 40
feet of building facade, plus six shrubs (including ornamental
grasses with a minimum height of three feet) per 20 feet of building
facade, outdoor retail, cafe or other occupied areas. To allow for
design flexibility, the following substitutions may be made:
(a) Up to 50% of the required quantity of shade trees may be
substituted with two ornamental or evergreen trees, or six
shrubs, per shade tree.
(b) Up to 25% of the required quantity of shrubs may be
substituted with two ground cover shrubs or perennials per
shrub.
(6) Plantings may be placed in a lawn area, tree pits, and/or planters as
appropriate to the character of the development, using the
following guidelines as to placement:
(a) Shade trees shall be placed at least 15 feet from a building
wall. Ornamental and evergreen trees shall be placed at least
10 feet from a building wall.
(b) If any tree is located closer than 10 feet to a sidewalk,
approved root barriers shall be placed along the tree side of
the sidewalk for a distance of 12 feet, centered on the trunk.
(c) Planters shall be at least 30 inches high, but no higher than 42
inches, and contain drainage holes.
K. Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms shall have the
meanings indicated:
DEVELOPMENT ZONE  The area where the majority of development
on a site will take place. This area is located outside of the tree
protection zone, and is typically where buildings, parking lots and
stormwater basins are proposed. Only specimen trees (24 inches and
greater) are to be compensated for within the development zone.
§ 203-68 YOUTH SPORTS § 203-68
198:813
§ 203-69. Buffer and screen standards. [Amended 12-15-2003 by
Ord. No. 2003-24]
TREE PROTECTION ZONE  An area bounded by the parameters
outlined in Subsection C(2)(c) where trees are to be preserved as much
as possible. All trees five inches or greater that are removed from this
area must be compensated for.
A. Purpose and applicability.
(1) Buffers and screens shall be submitted with all site plan and
subdivision applications.
(2) The primary purpose of buffers is to eliminate views and reduce
noise perception beyond the lot.
(3) The primary purpose of screens is to reduce view into lots.
B. Type, location and width.
(1) Buffers are required in the following locations:
(a) Along all lots and streets separating residential and industrial
uses from arterial and collector streets;
(b) Separating all nonresidential uses from residential uses or
zoning districts;
(c) On reverse-frontage lots, adjacent to the higher-classified
street right-of-way; and
(d) Along all state highways and railroad rights-of-way.
(2) Screens are required in the following locations:
(a) Along all street lines where loading and storage areas can be
seen from the street;
(b) Along all nonaccessible sides of trash enclosures, equipment or
storage buildings and yard and utility boxes;
(c) Along the entire perimeter of stormwater management basins;
and
(d) Around the perimeter of all parking lots or other similar
vehicle use areas (i.e., service stations and bank/fast-food
drive-through lanes).
(3) Width of buffers and screens.
(a) Where a nonresidential district or use is proposed to be
developed contiguous to a residential district or use, the
nonresidential user shall provide a planted buffer 75 feet in
width within the nonresidential district.
§ 203-68 WOOLWICH CODE § 203-69
198:814
(b) Where an industrial or manufacturing district or use is
contiguous to an office or commercial district or use, a buffer
25 feet in width shall be located within the district where the
development is taking place.
(c) Where a residential district or use is proposed to be developed
contiguous to a commercial or office district or use, a twentyfive-
foot buffer shall be provided within the residential district.
(d) Where a residential district or use is proposed to be developed
contiguous to an industrial district or use, a fifty-foot buffer
shall be provided within the residential district.
(e) Where a residential district or use is proposed to be developed
contiguous to a manufacturing district or use, a buffer 75 feet
in width shall be provided within the residential district.
(f) Where a residential district or use, other than single-family or
two-family residential, is proposed to be developed contiguous
to a residential district or use, a fifteen-foot buffer shall be
provided.
(g) Where a single-family or two-family residential use is proposed
to be developed contiguous to a non-single-family residential
district or use, a fifteen-foot buffer shall be provided in the
district where the development is taking place.
(h) Where a single-family residential use is proposed to be
developed contiguous to another single-family residential
district or use, no buffer is required.
(i) If a road should separate two districts or uses, a buffer 15 feet
in width shall be provided within the district where the
development is taking place.
(4) Buffer and screen widths shall be measured horizontally. If a
reduction in buffer width is granted by the approving authority,
then the minimum shrub planting requirements shall be doubled.
(5) Buffer and screen widths shall be in addition to the normal depth
and/or width of the lot required in a residential district. The area
included in the buffer or screen strip shall not be included in
calculating the minimum lot area as required by the specific
residential district in which the lot is located. This strip shall be
part of the development and shall be designated on the plan: This
strip is reserved for buffering and/or screening. The placement of
any structure hereon is prohibited.
C. General buffer and screen composition and planting standards.
(1) Buffer may be comprised of existing vegetation and natural
features, proposed new or transplanted vegetation, fences, walls
and/or berms. When berms are included in a buffer, a curvilinear or
§ 203-69 YOUTH SPORTS § 203-69
198:815
naturalistic arrangement is encouraged. Existing vegetation and
natural features may be used as a buffer or screen only at the
discretion of the Board, and only if such features meet the intent of
this section.
(2) No structure, activity, storage of materials or parking of vehicles
shall be permitted within a buffer or screen area.
(3) The location and design of buffers and screens shall consider the
use being screened, the distance between the use and the property
line, differences in elevations, the types of buffers or screens and
other combinations of man-made and natural features. The buffer
or screen shall be designed, planted, graded, landscaped and
developed with the general guidelines that the closer a use or
activity is to the property line, or the more intense the use, the
more effective the buffer or screen must be in obscuring light and
vision, and reducing noise beyond the lot.
(4) The following methods shall be used for the purpose of calculating
the amount of plant material required within a buffer or screen.
(a) A buffer length shall be measured at the property line or rightof-
way line and shall include all existing or proposed driveway
openings or easements.
(b) Where buffer areas overlap, as in the case of side and rear
tract boundaries, only the more stringent buffer shall apply in
the area of overlap. However, care shall be taken to avoid
unplanted gaps in what would be the area of overlap.
(c) The length of the perimeter of stormwater management basins
shall be measured along the center of the basins rim.
(5) All buffer and/or screen plantings along state highways shall
require a berm as an integral part of the landscaping.
(6) All plantings shall conform to the size and standards prescribed in
§ 203-68E(3).
(7) At least 50% of all shade trees and 25% of all shrubs shall be native
to the region.
(8) At least 50% of the shrubs shall be evergreen.
(9) Up to 50% of the required shade trees may be substituted with
ornamental trees at a ratio of two ornamental trees for each shade
tree.
(10)Up to 50% of the required shrubs may be substituted with
ornamental grasses, which will attain a minimum height of three
feet.
§ 203-69 WOOLWICH CODE § 203-69
198:816
(11) A minimum of 50% of the required buffer width must contain
required plantings.
(12) Plants shall be distributed throughout the entire length of buffers
and screens, but need not be evenly spaced. However, there shall
be no more than 100 feet between shade trees, 50 feet between
evergreen trees, and 50 feet between shrub clusters.
(13) Buffer and screen plantings shall be broken at points of vehicular
and pedestrian access, outside of clear sight triangles.
(14) The remainder of the buffer area shall be planted with ground
covers, including lawn grasses or meadow plantings, as
appropriate to the character of the site and adjacent lands.
D. Specific buffer and screen requirements.
(1) Buffers shall contain the following type and quantity of plant
material per 100 feet of buffer length and achieve 80% opacity
after five years' growth.
(a) Twenty-five- to fifty-foot wide buffers: two shade trees, four
evergreen trees, and 20 shrubs.
(b) Buffers up to 25 feet wide: two shade trees, two evergreen
trees, and 20 shrubs.

screen may be used consisting of, at a minimum,
evergreen and/or deciduous shrubs a minimum of three
feet in height at time of planting.
[2] If no wall or fence is proposed and vegetation will act as
the only screen, then a high screen consisting of large
evergreen shrubs, spaced no more than four feet on center
or as needed to form a continuous screen of eight feet in
height after five years growth, or evergreen trees spaced
12 feet on center, with evergreen shrubs placed between
the evergreen trees, shall be planted.
(b) Stormwater management basins shall be screened based on
the following quantities of plant material and shall achieve
50% opacity after five years growth.

Ord. No. 2008-19]
A. Intent. Protected farmland, open space and greenway lands (referred to
herein as "greenway lands") in all subdivisions shall meet the standards
below.
B. Uses permitted on greenway lands. The following uses are permitted on
greenway land areas:
(1) Conservation of open space in its natural state (for example,
woodland, fallow field, or managed meadow);
(2) Agricultural and horticultural uses. Such uses may include raising
crops or livestock; wholesale nurseries; associated buildings that
are specifically needed to support an active, viable agricultural or
horticultural operation;
(3) Pastureland for horses based on best management practices;
(4) Forestry, in keeping with established best management practices
for selective harvesting and sustained yield forestry;
(5) Neighborhood open spaces uses such as village greens, commons,
picnic areas, community gardens, trails, and similar low-impact
passive recreational uses, specifically excluding motorized off-road
vehicles, shooting ranges, and other uses similar in character and
potential impact as determined by the Joint Land Use Board;
(6) If greenway land becomes a public park; active noncommercial
recreation areas, such as playing fields, playgrounds, courts, and
bikeways, provided such areas do not consume more than half of
the minimum required greenway land. Playing fields, playgrounds,
and courts shall also be permitted, and they shall generally be
gravel-surfaced, properly drained, and provide safe ingress and
egress;
(7) Water supply systems and stormwater detention areas designed,
landscaped, and available for use as an integral part of the
greenway;
(8) Easements for drainage, access, sewer, or water lines, or other
public purposes; and
(9) Underground utility rights-of-way. Aboveground utility and street
rights-of-way may traverse conservation areas but shall not count
toward the minimum required greenway land.
C. Greenway design standards.
(1) Greenway lands shall, whenever possible, be laid out in general
accordance with the Township's greenways system and farmland
§ 203-72 WOOLWICH CODE § 203-72
198:822
preservation designed maps as included in the Woolwich Township
Open Space and Recreation Plan of 2004 to encourage the
development of an interconnected network of open space. The
required greenway land may consist of a mixture of primary
conservation areas (SCAs), which shall be included in the greenway
lands to the greatest extent possible. PCAs comprise floodplains,
wetlands, and slopes over 10%. SCAs include mapped areas
showing high groundwater recharge (11 inches to 14 inches per
year), natural heritage priority areas, and critical habitat areas
as designed by the landscape project, as well as other scenic,
natural and historic features such as viewsheds, natural swales,
and historic structures that may be unmapped but should be
incorporated into site plans or subdivisions during the site visit.
(2) In Option 1 subdivisions (as per §§ 203-40, 203-41, and 203-42), the
greenway land comprises a minimum of 50% of the gross tract
area. This land shall generally remain undivided and may be owned
and maintained by a homeowners' association, land trust, another
conservation organization reorganized by the Township, or by a
private individual (typically as part of the original farmhouse).
These ownership options may be combined so that different parts
of the greenway land may be owned by different entities.
D. Other requirements.
(1) No portion of any building lot may be used for meeting the
minimum required greenway land. Greenway land may be located
so as to meet any potential needs of the neighborhood. Active
agricultural land with farm buildings, excluding areas used for
residences, may be used to meet the minimum required greenway
land.
(2) Pedestrian and maintenance access, excluding those lands used for
agricultural or horticultural purposes in accordance with
Subsection B(2) herein, shall be provided to public greenway land
in accordance with the following requirements:
(a) Each neighborhood shall provide one centrally located access
point per 15 lots, a minimum of 35 feet in width.
(b) Access to greenway land for agriculture may be appropriately
restricted for public safety to prevent interference with
agricultural operations, provided that access for farming
operations is permitted.
(3) All greenway land areas that are not public parks, or being farmed,
shall be left in a natural state. Greenway lands that are left in a
natural state, whether held as public or private land, shall be
exempt from the requirements of the Township Property

Maintenance Ordinance,124 with the exception of a six-foot-wide
buffer from roads, sidewalks, and pathways.
E. Permanent greenway protection through conservation easements.
(1) In Option 1 subdivisions (as per §§ 203-40, 203-41, and 203-42), all
greenway land provided shall be subject to permanent
conservation easements prohibiting future development and
defining the range of permitted activities. For example, the clearing
of woodland habitat shall generally be prohibited, except as
necessary to create trails, active recreation facilities, and to install
subsurface septic disposal systems or spray irrigation facilities. A
list of permitted uses of greenway lands is contained in this section
in Subsections B and C.
(2) The Joint Land Use Board may require portions of fee simple lots to
be encumbered by conservation easements to protect valuable or
sensitive natural features or landscape features on such lots.
F. Ownership of greenway land and common facilities.
(1) Development restrictions. All greenway land shall be permanently
deed restricted from future subdivision and development. Under no
circumstances shall any development be permitted in the open
space at any time, except for those uses listed in Subsection B.
(2) Ownership options. The following methods may be used, either
individually or in combination, to own common facilities. Common
facilities shall not be transferred to another entity except for
transfer to another method of ownership permitted under this
section, and then only when there is no change in the common
facilities or in the open space ratio of the overall development.
Ownership methods shall conform to the following:
(a) Fee simple dedication to the Township. The Township may, but

restricted from future development through a conservation
easement, or farmland preservation except for those uses
listed in Subsection B, and that the Township is given the
ability to enforce these restrictions.
(3) Dedication of easements to the Township. The Township may, but
shall not be required to, accept easements for public use of any
portion of the common land or facilities. In such cases, the facility

greenway lands and the common facilities, or any successor
organization thereto, fails to maintain all or any portion thereof
in reasonable order and condition, the Township may assume
responsibility for maintenance, in which case any escrow funds
may be forfeited and any permits may be revoked or
suspended.
(d) The Township may enter the premises and take corrective
action, including extended maintenance. The costs of such
corrective action may be charged to the property owner,
condominium association, homeowners' association,
conservation organization, or individual property owners who
make up a condominium or homeowners' association and may
include administrative costs and penalties as stated in Article
XI, Remedies and Penalties, of this chapter. Such costs shall
become a lien on said properties. Notice of such lien shall be
filed by the Township with the County Clerk or County
Registrar.
A. Cluster development shall be permitted as part of any development
within an RLM or RMD Zone, provided that the parcel contains not less
than 25 contiguous acres of land, that public water and sewer are
available and further subject to the criteria hereinafter set forth. The

A. Introduction. This purpose of this section is to provide guidance with
clarifying zoning and building permit requirements for an in-law suite
in a home.
B. Definitions. The following adopted definitions are relevant, in addition
to the definitions sections under § 203-5 of the Woolwich Township
Code, in determining what type of additions or remodeling may be
authorized regarding "in-law suites":
DWELLING UNIT  One or more rooms designed for the occupancy,
cooking, and sleeping of one or more persons living as a family.
FAMILY/FAMILY MEMBER  An individual, or two or more persons
related by blood, marriage, adoption or guardianship, occupying a
single dwelling unit. The term "family/family member" does not include
any organization or institutional group.
C. Zoning requirements. Based upon the above definitions and the
Township's overall Master Plan, this section does not allow dwelling
unit or apartment as an authorized use in single-family zoning districts
(R-1, R-2, R-3, 5A Five Acre Residential, PUD and all other approved
§ 203-75 YOUTH SPORTS § 203-76.1
198:831
residential zones). However, there is no prohibition in the construction
of an in-law suite, provided that the following requirements are met:
(1) Only family members shall reside in the in-law suite, and said
family member must be allowed unrestricted access to the common
areas of the dwelling unit (e.g., the kitchen, bathroom, living room,
etc.)
(2) The in-law suite shall not have separate gas and electric utilities
(more than one meter per utility would constitute a separate
dwelling unit and is prohibited).
(3) The in-law suite shall not be located in an accessory building (this
would constitute a separate dwelling unit) such as a unit over a
garage.
(4) The in-law suite shall be connected to the main heated living area
of the dwelling (the suite shall not be connected to the building by a
breezeway, as this would constitute a separate dwelling unit).
(5) The in-law suite shall have principal means of access to the outside
of the dwelling unit via the dwelling unit's main exterior doorways
(single access to the outside to the "suite" would constitute a
separate dwelling unit).
(6) The in-law suite may have a kitchen and bathroom as well as a
bedroom.
D. Appeals. Appeals from this section or their interpretation are decided
by the Joint Land Use Board in accordance with the "appeal of Zoning
Officer determination" process. The appellant should contact the Land
Use Department or the Zoning Officer in order to obtain additional
information regarding the appeals process.
E. Additional building permit application requirements. All permit
applications shall be accompanied by the following additional
information:
(1) Construction documents, including a floor plan acceptable to the
Construction Code Official, indicating the use of each room,
doorway locations and demonstrating compliance with Subsection
C of this section;
(2) A signed and notarized affidavit from the property owner stating
who will reside in the in-law suite and acknowledging that the inlaw
suite is prohibited from use as an apartment (change in owner
or occupant requires a new affidavit);
(3) A building addition location plan (if adding to the home);
(4) Any deviation from this section requires Joint Land Use Board
Approval;

§ 203-76.2. Use and placement of portable storage units and pods.
[Added 4-16-2012 by Ord. No. 2012-12]
(5) Nothing in this section is intended to supersede "the right to farm"
for temporary living for migrant workers.
F. Purpose. It is the express purpose of this section to provide an
economically feasible alternative to nursing home and boardinghome
care so that immediate elderly family members (55 years of age or
older), or disabled family members over the age of 18, can live with
family members while maintaining some degree of overall
independence. Additionally, this section attempts to halt the
proliferation of unauthorized conversions of single-family dwelling units
into two/multiple dwelling units in a single-family zone and/or
unauthorized rental units.
A. Definitions. As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the
meanings indicated:
PERSONAL PROPERTY  Any movable item or thing that is subject to
ownership.
PORTABLE STORAGE UNIT/POD  Any container designed for the
storage of personal property that is typically rented to owners or
occupants of property for their temporary use and which is customarily
delivered and removed by truck.
PUBLIC AREA  Includes any street, sidewalk, highway, public lane,
alley, right-of-way, easement, Township parking lot or other public place
in the Township.
TEMPORARY  Having a limited duration or use; not of permanent
nature.
B. Permit required (multifamily dwellings, detached single-family
residential and nonresidential). No person shall place or utilize a
portable storage unit/pod or permit a portable storage unit/pod to be
placed upon a property which a person owns, rents, occupies or
controls without first having obtained a permit from the Township
Zoning Officer. Any placement of a portable storage unit/pod on public
area shall first have written approval from the Township Police
Department and an approved permit from the Zoning Officer. The
placement of said portable storage unit/pod must be temporary; any
permanent storage unit must comply with the appropriate accessory
use controls contained in the applicable zoning district as per the
Woolwich Township Code.
C. Application for permit; fees; conditions of issuance.

the expiration of the existing permit. Renewal shall be at the
discretion of the Code Enforcement Officer.
(5) A nonresidential permit shall be valid for a period of 30 calendar
days and may be renewed upon application to the Zoning Officer
for an additional 30 calendar days, not to exceed 60 calendar days.
Application for renewal shall be made prior to the expiration of the
existing permit. Renewal shall be at the discretion of the Code
Enforcement Officer.
(6) A permit may be revoked at any time during its term if the
placement or use of the portable storage unit/pod constitutes a

ARTICLE VIII
Signs
[Amended 3-21-1994 by Ord. No. 94-2; 6-6-2005 by Ord. No.
2005-16; 5-17-2010 by Ord. No. 2010-09]
§ 203-77. Signs.
A. Intent and purpose. In order to preserve the Township as a desirable
community in which to live, farm and do business, a pleasing, visually
attractive environment is of foremost importance. The regulation of
signs within the Township is a highly contributive means by which to
achieve this desired end. These sign regulations are prepared with the
intent of enhancing the overall environment, specifically the aesthetic
values, and promoting the continued well-being of the Township. It is
the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare through a comprehensive system of reasonable,
consistent and nondiscriminatory sign standards and requirements.
These sign regulations are intended to:
(1) Enable the identification of places of residence and business.
(2) Allow for the communication of information necessary for the
conduct of commerce.
(3) Lessen hazardous situations, confusion and visual clutter caused by
proliferation, improper placement, illumination, animation and
excessive height, area and bulk of signs which compete for the
attention of pedestrian and vehicular traffic.
(4) Enhance the attractiveness and economic well-being of the
Township as a place to live, farm and conduct business.
(5) Protect the public from the dangers of unsafe signs.
(6) Permit signs that are compatible with their surroundings and aid
orientation, and preclude placement of signs in a manner that
conceals or obstructs adjacent land uses or signs.
(7) Encourage signs that are appropriate to the zoning district in
which they are located and consistent with the category of use to
which they pertain.
(8) Curtail the size and number of signs and sign messages to the
minimum reasonably necessary to identify a residential or business
location and the nature of any such business.
(9) Establish sign size in relationship to the scale of the lot and
building on which the sign is to be placed or to which it pertains.
(10) Preclude signs from conflicting with the principal permitted use of
the site or adjoining sites.
§ 203-77 YOUTH SPORTS § 203-77
198:839
(11) Regulate signs in a manner so as to not interfere with or obstruct
vision of or distract motorists, bicyclists or pedestrians.
(12) Require signs to be constructed, installed and maintained in a safe
and satisfactory manner.
(13) Preserve and enhance the natural aesthetics and scenic
characteristics of this farming community.
B. Any sign, banner, billboard, or signboard hereafter erected or
maintained shall conform with the provisions of this chapter and any
other ordinances or regulations of the Township of Woolwich. A sign/
signboard is defined as "a display (as a lettered board or a configuration
of neon or lighted tubing) used to identify or advertise a place of
business or a product." A banner is defined as "a strip of cloth, canvas
or other flexible material which is durable and weather-resistant, on
which a sign or an advertisement graphic is painted or displayed." A
billboard is defined as "a large flat panel designed to carry outdoor
advertising."
C. The limitations on signs as set forth for the various zones by this
chapter shall not apply to any sign or directional device erected by the
federal, state, county or Township government, or agency thereof, nor
to any "no trespassing" sign erected in accordance with the applicable
statutes of the State of New Jersey.
D. The limitations on sign location and area as set forth by this chapter for
the business, commercial, professional and light industry zones shall
not apply to parking lot markers, directional signs and entrance and
exit signs which are erected on the premises, provided that each such
sign does not exceed two square feet in area and does not contain any
advertising of the use on the premises; and further provided that the
number and location of said signs are approved by the Joint Land Use
Board. [Amended 11-17-2014 by Ord. No. 2014-15]
E. Substitution clause. Subject to the landowner's consent, a
noncommercial message/copy of any type may be substituted for any
duly permitted or allowed commercial message/copy or any duly
permitted or allowed noncommercial message; provided that the sign
structure or mounting device is legal without consideration of message
content. Such substitution of message may be made without any
additional approval or permitting. This provision prevails over any more
specific provision to the contrary in this chapter and section. The
purpose of this substitution clause provision is to prevent any
inadvertent favoring of commercial speech over noncommercial
speech, or favoring of any particular noncommercial message over any
other noncommercial message. This provision does not create a right to
increase the total amount of signage on a parcel, nor does it affect the
requirement that a sign structure or mounting device be properly
permitted. This substitution clause provision does not allow for the
substitution of offsite commercial messages in place of onsite
§ 203-77 WOOLWICH CODE § 203-77
198:840

chapter:

change of message as any change in structure must comply with all
relevant building codes and permit process.
F. Severability generally and specific to severability of prohibition on
billboards. If any part, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph,
sentence, phrase, clause, term or word of this article and/or any other
code provisions and/or laws are declared invalid or unconstitutional by
the valid judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, the
declaration of such unconstitutionality shall not affect the prohibition
on billboards as contained herein.
G. Other provisions of code regulating signs. This sign article does not
supercede the more specific regulations set forth as part of the zoning
and design standards enacted in connection with the Township's
Transfer of Development Rights (TDR) Ordinance. The provisions
contained in the TDR ordinances will govern any signage related to any
comprehensive sign packages for development within the regional

[Added 12-17-2001 by Ord. No. 01-15]
§ 203-90. Findings and purpose.
§ 203-91. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
A. The Township Committee finds and declares that the creation and
preservation of affordable housing in the Township serves the public
interest. Maintaining and improving a stock of sound affordable
housing requires affirmative steps by local government working
cooperatively with public bodies at all levels and with the private sector.
The purpose of this article is to create in the Township of Woolwich a
trust fund from payment of development fees to assist in the marshaling
of public and private monies dedicated to affordable housing projects
and programs.
B. The New Jersey Supreme Court, in Holmdel Builder's Association v.
Holmdel Township, 121 N.J. 550 (1990), determined that mandatory
development fees are both statutorily and constitutionally permissible.
The Court further anticipated that the Council on Affordable Housing
would promulgate appropriate development fee rules specifying,
among other things, the standards for these development fees. The
purpose of this article is to provide such rules in accordance with the
Fair Housing Act, N.J.S.A. 52:27D-301 et seq., and New Jersey Council
on Affordable Housing Procedural and Substantive Regulations
contained in N.J.A.C. 5:91, 5:92 and 5:93 et seq.
C. The purpose of the Affordable Housing Contribution Ordinance is to
provide revenues with which to fund rehabilitation of housing units and
accessory apartments in Woolwich Township occupied by low- and
moderate-income households, to construct housing for low- and
moderate-income families in the Township and/or to fund any other
programs for low- and moderate-income housing in order for the
Township of Woolwich to meet its responsibility for providing affordable
housing pursuant to Mount Laurel II and the Fair Housing Act in any
later amendment to the housing plan element and fair share plan. The
funds collected pursuant to this article shall be used exclusively for the
production of low- and moderate-income housing and to offset
municipal expenses in developing and administering the program(s)
under which low- and moderate-income housing shall be produced to
meet the fair share need to the Township. No funds shall be expended
except as permitted by N.J.A.C. 5:93-8.15 or other approval of the
Court.
§ 203-90 YOUTH SPORTS § 203-91
198:861

Assessor utilizing estimates for the additional equalized assessed value;
final equalized assessed value will be determined prior to the issuance
of a certificate of occupancy for each house or, in the case of
commercial development, prior to project completion, by the Municipal
Tax Assessor.
(1) Residential development fees. Developers shall pay a development
fee of 1% of the equalized assessed value of any residential
development, provided no increase in density is permitted. Where
an increase in density is permitted through a use variance or a
rezoning which is adopted after the adoption date of this article,
developers shall pay a development fee of 6% of the equalized
assessed value of any additional housing units in addition to a fee of
1% on the number of units permitted prior to the variance or
rezoning.
(2) Nonresidential development fees.
(a) Developers shall pay a fee of 2% of equalized assessed value
for nonresidential development, provided no increase in floor
area is permitted. Where an increase in floor area is permitted
through a use variance or a rezoning which is adopted after the
adoption date of this article, the nonresidential developer shall
pay a fee of 2% of equalized assessed value for the floor area
ratio (FAR) the developer could previously construct prior to
receiving the variance or rezoning and an increased fee for the
additional FAR.
(b) The right of the Township to the increased fee and the right of
the nonresidential developer to enhanced development rights
§ 203-91.1 WOOLWICH CODE § 203-92
198:864
§ 203-93. Eligible exactions, ineligible exactions and exemptions.
shall depend upon the developer and the municipality entering
into an agreement concerning the increased fee; the fee
imposed bearing a reasonable relationship to the value of the
enhancement resulting from the zoning or variance; and the
court approving the fee. If a nonresidential developer realizes
enhanced development rights other than an increased FAR
pursuant to either a rezoning or variance, the same standards
set forth above shall apply.
A. Developers who have tax credits or other subsidies for the construction
for low- and moderate-income units shall be exempt from paying
development fees.
B. Developments that have received preliminary or final approval prior to
the imposition of a development fee shall be exempt from development
fees unless the developer seeks a substantial change in the approval;
for example, a substantial alteration in site layout, development density
or types of uses within the development.
C. All other major subdivisions and site plans which do not include
affordable housing shall be subject to housing impact fees as defined
herein.
D. Any project subject to a general development plan (GDP) that includes
any affordable housing shall be exempt only to the following extent. Any
portion of the GDP that has not received a preliminary or final approval
or has received a preliminary or final approval and undergone a
substantial change shall be subject to a fee of 0.5% of equalized
assessed value for residential development and 1% of equalized
assessed value for all nonresidential development. The total fee
anticipated from the GDP shall be adjusted by the amount resulting
from the following formula: number of affordable units required by the
GDP X $25,000 per unit. If the developer constructs affordable rental
housing, thereby generating a rental bonus pursuant to current COAH
standards, the number of affordable units generating the $25,000 per
unit credit shall be increased accordingly, provided that the total
number of units and rental bonus credits that shall be eligible for the
$25,000 per unit credit shall be capped at the Township's current fair
share as of the date the Township adopts this article and publishes
notice of said adoption. Developer's credit shall be applied against the
developer's low and moderate obligation under this article as
residential units or commercial developments are approved until the
total number of credits are utilized unless developer, at its option,
elects to designate any particular nonresidential approval as a
development subject to the payment of the fees.
E. Construction costs of $20,000 or less.
§ 203-92 YOUTH SPORTS § 203-93
198:865
§ 203-94. Collection of development fees.
§ 203-95. Housing Trust Fund.
(1) Residential building permits which involve construction costs of
$20,000 or less shall be exempt from paying development fees;
provided, however, if a residential property owner applies for two
or more building permits within a five-year period, the combined
cost of which exceeds $20,000, then the property owner shall pay a
development fee calculated by using the combined construction
costs. For third and subsequent applications within five years, the
development fee due would be based upon the combined
construction cost less the development fee already paid.
(2) As an example, if in Year I a homeowner constructs a residential
addition, the cost of which is $20,000 (which is exempt from the
payment of a fee), and in Year 3 the same homeowner seeks to
construct another addition, the cost of which is $15,000, the
homeowner, prior to obtaining a building permit in Year 3, would
have to pay a development fee based upon the combined cost. In
this case, the fee would be based on a cost of $35,000. If the same
property owner constructed another addition in Year 4, the cost of
which was $10,000, the development fee due in Year 4 would be
based on the combined construction cost of $45,000 less the
development fee already paid.
A. Developers shall pay 50% of the calculated development fee to
Woolwich Township at the issuance of building permits. The
development fee shall be estimated by the Tax Assessor prior to the
issuance of building permits.
B. Developers shall pay the remaining fee to Woolwich Township at the
issuance of certificates of occupancy. At the issuance of certificates of
occupancy, the Tax Assessor shall calculate the equalized assessed
value and the appropriate development fee. The developer shall be
responsible for paying the difference between the fee calculated at
certificate of occupancy and the amount paid at issuance of building
permit.
A. All development fees shall be deposited with the Chief Financial Officer
of the Township in a separate designated interest-bearing Housing
Trust Fund. The development fees placed in the Housing Trust Fund
shall be deemed "dedicated revenues," as such term is defined in
N.J.S.A. 40A:4-36. In establishing the Housing Trust Fund, the Township
shall provide whatever express written authorization that may be
required by the bank utilized by the Township in order to permit the
court to direct the disbursement of development fees pursuant to
§ 203-99 of this article. No money shall be expended from the Housing
Trust Fund unless the expenditure conforms to a spending plan
approved by the court.

198:866
§ 203-96. Use of funds.
§ 203-97. Monitoring and reporting requirements.
B. If the court determines that the Township of Woolwich is not in
conformance with the court's approval or COAH's rules on development
fees, the court is authorized to direct the manner in which all
development fees collected pursuant to this article shall be expended.
Such authorization is pursuant to this article, the court's rules on
development fees, and the written authorization from the Township
Committee to the named bank or depository.
A. The Township shall use revenues collected from development fees for
any activity approved by the court for addressing the Township's fair
share obligation. The expenditures of all money shall conform to a
spending plan approved by the court.

activities that preceded a judgment of repose.
C. No more than 20% of the revenues collected from development fees
shall be expanded on administration costs necessary to develop, revise
or implement the housing plan element, including, but not limited to,
salaries and benefits for Township employees or consultant fees
necessary to develop or implement a rehabilitation program, a new
construction program, a regional contribution agreement, a housing
element, and an affirmative marketing program. Administrative funds
may be used for income qualification of households, monitoring the
turnover of sale and rental units, and compliance with COAH's
monitoring requirements. Development fees shall not be used to defray
the costs of existing staff, except that the court or COAH may consider
permitting fees to defray the cost of staff whose sole responsibility is to
implement the housing element.
A. The Township shall collect information on each applicant for low- and
moderate-income housing on forms approved by COAH. Such report
shall include:
(1) Monitoring forms approved by COAH;
(2) An evaluation of the income and demographic characteristics of
each applicant of low- and moderate-income housing, as well as the
occupants of the units; and
(3) An evaluation of any necessary adjustments in the affirmative
marketing program as a result of the evaluation in Subsection A(1)
above.
B. The Township shall evaluate the results of its affirmative marketing
activities and file a report with COAH and the court by August 30th of
each year.

F. The manner through which the Township will address any expected or
unexpected shortfall if the anticipated revenues from development fees
are not sufficient to implement the plan.
A. In the event that any of the conditions set forth in Subsection B below
occur, the court shall be authorized, on behalf of the Township, to direct
the manner in which all development fees collected pursuant to this
article shall be expended. Should any such conditions occur, such
revenues shall immediately become available for expenditure at the
direction of the court upon the Township Clerk's receipt of written
notification from the court that such a condition has occurred. In
furtherance of the foregoing, the Township shall, in establishing a bank
account pursuant to § 203-95 of this article, ensure that the Township
has provided whatever express written authorization may be required
by the bank to permit the court to direct disbursement of such revenues
from the account following the delivery to the bank of the
aforementioned written notification provided by the court to the
Township Clerk.
B. Occurrence of the following may result in the court taking an action
pursuant to Subsection A above:

A. Quantification of affordable housing obligation for residential
developers. Except as otherwise provided below, in those
circumstances where an applicant seeks to develop land for residential
purposes and receives no right to increased density or other
compensatory bonus, said applicant shall produce and develop on site
one residential unit of housing affordable to low- and moderate-income
households for every eight market rate residential units constructed
(11.11%). In the event 11.11% of the total units should result in a
fraction equaling one half percent or greater, the affordable housing
obligation shall be rounded to the next higher number. Affordable
housing shall be as defined under the FHA and COAH's regulations.
Nothing herein shall relieve applicants seeking to develop projects of
eight or fewer units from the requirements of the Township's Mount
Laurel Development Fee Ordinance in its current form or any future
form.

Part 2
Woolwich Regional Center And Auburn Road Village Regulations
[Added 10A-n2d7 -D20es0i8gnB yStOarndd.a Nrdos. 2008-21]
ARTICLE XIV
General Provisions
§ 203-117. Purpose.
The purpose of this Part 2 is to provide zoning regulations and design
standards that are to be used in combination with the open space and
circulation plans to promote the creation and sustainability of mixed-use
walkable communities and neighborhoods along the Route 322 Corridor and
within the Auburn Road area of Woolwich Township, New Jersey. The zoning
regulations and design standards address seven development sectors within
the Woolwich Regional Center and the Auburn Road Village. Sectors have
been identified and are designed to promote stability and sustainability to
the concept of the community of the 21st Century as they are designed
to accommodate the growth of both regional and local services, some
pedestrian-oriented, some automobile-oriented, and provide employment,
civic and residential choices for communities of up to 4,246 residential units
and roughly five million to six million square feet of retail/commercial space.
A. Subsectors.
(1) The Woolwich Regional Center:
(a) Woolwich Newtown (RC-1).
(b) Gateway Highway Service (RC-2).
(c) Large Format Retail (RC-3).
(d) Big Box Retail (RC-3).
(e) Regional Office and Hotel (RC-3).
§ 203-117 YOUTH SPORTS § 203-117
198:881
(f) Neo-Traditional Senior Community (RC-3).
(g) Gateway East (RC-4).
(2) The Auburn Road Village: Mixed Use Commercial/Residential
Walkable Neighborhood Center (AR-1).
B. The regulations and standards within this Part 2 address location,
mixture and intensities of permitted uses, as well as site planning and
architectural controls designed to promote vibrant urban form
consistent with the visioning process undertaken by Woolwich
Township officials, civic leaders and citizens.
C. This is not a document about architectural style. By style we mean such
descriptive terms as "colonial," "victorian," "modern," "post-modern,"
etc. While each of us may have a collective memory of a place or places
where such styles have elicited positive experiences of community, the
history of human settlement instructs us that basic design
considerations independent of "architectural style" are determinants of
successful human scale community building. Good design promotes
§ 203-117 WOOLWICH CODE § 203-117
198:882
healthy community of place. The tenets of good design expressed in this
document are based on seven principles:
(1) Scale: the visual arrangement and massing of buildings, voids and
landscape elements that promote walkability and other alternative
forms of transportation, a sense of place and a human scale rather
than auto-oriented suburban sprawl.
(2) Rhythm: a pattern of facade and streetscape elements that
discourages monotony and creates an inviting pedestrian
environment and visual compatibility with buildings and places.
(3) Edges: physical elements that define a place and provide transition
to adjacent areas.
(4) Colors and materials: the visible components of buildings and
streetscapes, including siding, trim, doors, windows, gutters,
downspouts, roofing and all other architectural and site elements.
They must be in context with their environment and must be
sustainable, low maintenance, durable and tactile.
(5) Density: the proximity at which a community lives, works and plays
together.
(6) Choice: the provision of housing, employment, retail, recreation
and other services for people of all ages and lifestyles.
(7) Diversity: a variation of scale, rhythm, materials, density and
choice that provides an array of options for all people.
D. The local visioning process has identified a series of goal statements, as
outlined below, which are to be considered in the review of all
development applications involving lands located within the mapped
Woolwich Regional Center and the Auburn Road Village. Requests for
variances, waivers and/or deviations from the ordinance provisions of
this code shall be evaluated in the context of the impact the same may
have on the following goal statements:
(1) Promote traditional neighborhood developments where the
physical, visual and spatial characteristics are established and
reinforced through the consistent use of compatible urban design
and architectural design elements. Such elements shall relate
characteristics of an individual structure or development to other
existing or planned structures or developments in a harmonious
manner, resulting in an overall development pattern and
streetscape.
(2) Encourage innovative mixed-use and multiple-use plans so that the
housing demand of varying age groups, families and income levels
may be met by greater variety of type, design and layout of
dwellings and by the construction and more efficient use of open
space. To that end, the goal is to create smaller lots than currently
§ 203-117 YOUTH SPORTS § 203-117
198:883
§ 203-118. Use of Part 2.
exist in Woolwich Township to accommodate a mixture of singlefamily
detached units, twins, townhouses, condominium flats and
apartment flats above commercial and office uses which are to be
integrated into the plan.
(3) Promote the creation of neighborhoods and districts that are
distinct and identifiable in landscape, architecture and public space
elements.
(4) Encourage the development of "sustainable" community identified
by economic and fiscal balance, social integration and
maximization of water and energy conservation through the use of
passive and active technologies.
(5) Encourage land development practices that will promote the public
health, safety, and welfare by creating neo-traditional land use
alternatives to conventional, use-segregated "suburban sprawl,"
such as larger-lot subdivisions and strip commercial developments.
(6) Discourage uses and design patterns that tend to contribute to
traffic congestion through the dependence on private automobiles.
(7) Establish a comprehensive street and path network based on the
principles of the grid to accommodate an integrated multimodal
transportation system with the intent of providing a safe pedestrian
environment and pedestrian paths.
(8) Alleviate undue traffic congestion by reducing excessive sprawl of
development and the segregation of land uses which result in the
inefficient use of land and which necessitate the use of private
vehicles.
(9) Encourage creative green technologies integrated into public
spaces and private development parcels to achieve flood control,
stormwater recharge and water filtration in an effort to preserve an
indispensable natural resource.
(10) Allow for the directing of additional development through transfer
of development rights (TDRs) in an effort to preserve the remaining
rural, historic and agricultural character of Woolwich Township.
A. This document outlines the purpose of the zoning regulations and
design standards and identifies the tenets of good design based upon
specific principles. It also contains a series of goal statements that must
be considered in the review of all development applications.
Specifically, this document acts as an enabling ordinance which
contains a development process section, phasing rules, general
standards and definitions, a listing of principal and accessory uses, bulk
and area regulations for all permitted uses, design standards and a
street regulating plan. Further detailed rules associated with street
§ 203-117 WOOLWICH CODE § 203-118
198:884
layout and design, stormwater management, and parking and open
space are found in other sections of this Part 2.
B. The zoning regulations and design standards are an interrelated set of
plans, diagrams, photographs, tables and text which specify the design
and intent of the Woolwich Regional Center and the Auburn Road
Village.
C. Steps for developing land.
(1) Step 1: Review sections related to the variance, waiver and/or
deviation process, phasing rules and general standards and
definitions.
(2) Step 2: Review enabling ordinance section, including specifics on
implementation. Specifics on implementation is the text which
explains how regulations that are specified within the document
will be implemented. This is the legal language that clarifies the
regulations.
(3) Step 3: Review total number and types of residential units,
densities and square footage of nonresidential uses.
(4) Step 4: Review bulk, area, and design regulations for each land use
and building type that specifically addresses the following
categories: town scale, block scale, site scale, public realm and
private realm in relationship to architecture and design, parking,
edges and buffers and the environment.
(a) The town scale shows the location of a particular permitted
use in the Route 322 Corridor and Auburn Road area and its
relationship to Center-wide features. The block scale
specifies tract and block dimensions, sidewalk and planting
strip widths, mid-block crossings, streetlighting and street
furniture, architectural elements, public space and right-ofway
considerations as well as issues of rhythm, scale and
building orientation.
(b) The site scale identifies typical area and bulk regulations
pertaining to lot area, width and depth, building and
§ 203-118 YOUTH SPORTS § 203-118
198:885
impervious coverage, building setbacks, fencing, open space
and stormwater considerations.
(c) The public realm identifies the outside features of the
architecture of buildings on each lot, including height,
elevations, window-to-eave offsets, facade fenestration, rhythm
breaks, porches, and other related matters.
(d) The private realm identifies building factors related to rear
deck and outdoor space areas, chimney materials, upper-floor
breezeways, stoops, awnings, solar screens, balconies and
permitted uses internal to the structure.
(5) Step 5: The Land Use Master Plan maps for both areas are the legal
maps which are part of this document. They are the regulating
§ 203-118 WOOLWICH CODE § 203-118
198:886
§ 203-119. Legislative intent.
plans for the design of both Centers. All regulations in this
document are derived from these maps. It reflects the location of
streets, avenues and boulevards, open space and parks, retail and
mixed-use buildings within both Centers.
A. This Part 2 is intended to create the standards and requirements for the
Woolwich Regional Center and the Auburn Road Village, which have
been contemplated in some form by the Township dating back three
years to 2003. The Township Committee seeks to create mixed-use, neotraditional
neighborhoods with public uses and open space areas
designed to serve as both passive and active amenities.
B. Both Centers are also intended to integrate themselves with newly
developed lands and with existing properties in and around the existing
Route 322 Corridor and Auburn Road area, some of which are presently
commercial and some of which are residential. It is intended that most
of these existing properties will eventually be converted to some form of
mixed uses or complementary stand-alone developments.
C. The Township Committee and Joint Land Use Board have promulgated a
series of policy statements as listed below, which are to be considered
in reviewing all development applications involving lands located in
both the Woolwich Regional Center and the Auburn Road Village.
(1) Develop new mixed-use communities, which reflect the traditional
character of this evolving rural Township.
(2) Require, whenever possible, the interconnection of existing and
proposed uses so as to create integrated neighborhoods and a
greater sense of community by using design techniques that
provide for modified grid patterns accentuated with special, more
grand avenues.
(3) Provide a layout of streets and open space edges which encourage
pedestrian interconnections to residential, civic and commercial
uses within a one-half-mile walking distance.
(4) Provide a clearly articulated and rationally designed open space
system which consists of both integrated and peripheral active and
passive parks.
(5) Extend greater opportunities for housing, commercial and
recreational facilities to all residents of the Township.
(6) Encourage a more efficient use of land and public services by
directing development in a pattern that resembles a traditional
mixed-use development with varied housing types.
(7) Provide an approval, which will require the development to relate
the type, design, and layout of residential development on any site
§ 203-118 YOUTH SPORTS § 203-119
198:887
§ 203-120. General provisions.
to the surrounding environs and context, and to the Township's
goal of encouraging mixed-use, neo-traditional development in a
manner sensitive to the preservation or enhancement of property
within existing residential areas.
(8) Establish policies and procedures intended to promote flexibility
for the marketability of dwelling unit types while requiring the
maintenance of the underlying integrity of the plan in an efficient
and expedient forum.
(9) Discourage generic, modern suburban development that bears no
relation to the historic development pattern of the Township and
Gloucester County while promoting the creation of new
neighborhoods and developments that exhibit the design features
of neo-traditional neighborhoods and small towns in the county.
(10) Promote the creation of places which are oriented to the
pedestrian, promote citizen security, and social interaction.
(11) Establish community plazas and squares which act as focal points
of activity and interaction for both commercial and residential
neighborhoods.
(12) Promote developments with visual and spatial characteristics as
expressed in the components of the regulating plan and site plan
and design standards.
(13) Incorporate a land use component specifically addressed to the
needs of senior citizens.
(14) Develop a plan that addresses the fiscal imbalance of current
zoning and provides a phasing of development in a fiscally
responsible manner.
(15) Accommodate both the need and desire for the automobile in
community planning.
A. This Part 2 supersedes any provisions of the Woolwich Township Site
Plan Ordinance, Subdivision Ordinance or Zoning Ordinance131 as they
apply to the Township as a whole. The Regulating Plan, which includes
the Land Use Element, Circulation Plan Element, Public Spaces Plan
Element, Stormwater Element, and Zoning Regulations and Design
Standards Element, is incorporated as a companion document herein
by reference.132 [Amended 12-15-2014 by Ord. No. 2014-17]
B. In the event of any inconsistencies or contradictions, this Part 2 shall be
deemed as controlling over those lands located in the two Centers. The

§ 203-119 WOOLWICH CODE § 203-120
198:888
§ 203-121. Phasing plan.
Regulating Plan shall be incorporated herein by reference as the design
basis for the lands included in the Woolwich Regional Center and
the Auburn Road Village. The Regulating Plan shall be governed in
its entirety by the provisions of this Part 2 with the exception that
those provisions of the Township Subdivision and Site Development
Ordinance133 and Zoning Ordinance specifically referenced within this
Part 2 shall also apply to the zone district.
C. The approval or disapproval of any portion of any Center development
shall be based on an interpretation of the effect of the proposed
development on the surrounding properties and the zone district if the
same deviates in any manner from the Regulating Plan incorporated
herein by reference. In the event of a deviation from the same, the
determination shall be evaluated based upon the following provisions:
(1) The Regulating Plan, as incorporated herein by reference, shall be
deemed to be the basic structure of both the Woolwich Regional
Center and the Auburn Road Village and cannot be modified
without approval of the Township Committee and/or the Joint Land
Use Board depending on the extent of the deviation from the
provisions of the Regulating Plan.
(2) The Regulating Plan is conceptual in nature in that it is not an
engineered plan and that the actual layout of the streets and alleys
shall be determined at the time of site plan and/or subdivision
approval. The general locations of streets and alleys will remain;
however, minor modifications may be permitted by the Joint Land
Use Board due to engineering and site plan considerations,
provided that the overall integrity of both the project scale and the
comprehensive nature of the interconnected grid and parallel
circulation/roadway system as illustrated in the conceptual
drawings of this document are maintained.
(3) The regulations in this Part 2 shall be deemed to be the minimum
standards applicable for the Woolwich Regional Center and the
Auburn Road Village. In the event of any requests for deviation
from standards for any section of proposed development or any
portion of any section of either Center, Township Planner or Center
Subcommittee or the Joint Land Use Board, depending upon the
extent of the deviation, may require more stringent standards
based on the proposed effect of the deviation on the overall Center
plan or on specific areas of either development which may be
impacted by the proposed deviation, in order to protect the health,
safety and welfare of the citizens of the Township and the overall
integrity of the plan.

§ 203-122. Township Planner and/or Center Subcommittee.
A. Any applicant seeking to develop properties located within the
Woolwich Center or Auburn Road Village shall be required to provide a
phasing schedule, which phasing schedule shall be subject to the
review of and approval by the Joint Land Use Board. The intent of the
phasing schedule shall be to establish parameters within which
permitted housing stock shall be constructed in conjunction with the
construction of land-use-related infrastructure components.
B. The Joint Land Use Board shall have the discretion to develop a suitable
mechanism to ensure a balanced development so as to minimize and
moderate fiscal impacts on the Township which may otherwise be
created by the construction of housing.

nonresidential floor area or any other suitable calculation which the
Joint Land Use Board deems to be appropriate in light of the intended
goal of minimizing and moderating fiscal impacts.
A. The Township Committee can choose to use the professional services of
the Township Planner and/or establish a Center Subcommittee to
review applications for development of lands within both the Woolwich
Regional Center and the Auburn Road Village. For purposes of this Part
2 and Regulating Plan, the reviewer shall be referred to as the
Township Planner. The Township Planner is hereby established and
acknowledged, the purpose of which shall be to review all plans for
development as well as variances, waivers and/or deviations from the
Regulating Plan as incorporated in this Part 2 by reference. The
Township Planner shall be responsible for reviewing and providing
recommendations to the Joint Land Use Board for its approval or denial
for deviations from any of the aforesaid design standards set forth in
the Regulating Plan and this Part 2.
B. In those matters involving variances, waivers and/or deviations, the
applicant shall be responsible for demonstrating to the Joint Land Use
Board the nature of the variances, waivers and/or deviations sought,
the amount of land or building lots affected, the impact of the variances,
waivers and/or deviations on the immediately surrounding area of the
Woolwich Regional Center and the Auburn Road Village and, if
applicable, the effect on the overall district or subdistrict based upon
the extent of the variances, waivers and/or deviations requested.
C. The Township Planner shall have the right to prepare and require the
submission of an application checklist, provided the same is adopted by
the Township Committee by ordinance.

§ 203-124. Interpretation of development standards and guidelines.
said deviation shall be established in any determination made by the
Joint Land Use Board.
B. Proposed deviations shall be reviewed and approved or denied by the
Joint Land Use Board based upon the following criteria:
(1) The design and improvement shall be in harmony with the purpose
and intent of this Part 2.
(2) The design and improvement shall generally enhance the street
and/or building regulating plans, or in any case not have on adverse
impact on its physical, visual, or spatial characteristics.
(3) The design and improvement shall generally enhance the
streetscape and neighborhood, or in any case not have an adverse
impact on the streetscape and neighborhood.
(4) The modification shall not result in configurations of lots or street
systems which shall be impractical or detract from the appearance
of the Center or the ability of adjacent properties to develop per the
Regulating Plan.
(5) The proposed modification shall not result in any danger to the
public health, safety, or welfare by making access to the dwellings
by emergency vehicles more difficult, by depriving adjoining
properties of adequate light and air, or by violating the other
purposes for which zoning ordinances are to be enacted.
(6) Landscaping and other methods shall be used to ensure compliance
with the design standards and guidelines of this Part 2.
(7) The minimum lot size of any lot to be created shall only be reduced
below the requirements of this Part 2 by approval of the Joint Land

deviation while ensuring the integrity of the overall Town Center
plan.
A. The development standards contained in the Regulating Plan and
design vocabulary contained therein are both written and illustrated.
The illustrations and written text are intended to be complementary;
and wherever an apparent inconsistency exists, an applicant may apply
to the Joint Land Use Board for interpretation of the ordinance
regarding such standard. Any interpretation made by the Joint Land
§ 203-123 WOOLWICH CODE § 203-124
198:892
Use Board shall be made in conjunction with the overall intent and
character of the plan as codified in the Regulating Plan.
B. The development standards as contained in the ordinance set forth
specific requirements for development guidelines which are to be
strictly construed. The design vocabulary shall be interpreted with the
maximum degree of flexibility to promote consistency in design, taking

Regional Center and Auburn Road Village are set forth in this Part
2, and the design standards as applicable to each section of the
Regional Center are set forth in the Regulating Plan incorporated
herein by reference.
(2) Unless expressly permitted, all other uses are deemed to be
prohibited. The outdoor storage of commercial trucks, tractor
trailers, recreation vehicles, tractors, campers and boats is
prohibited in all subsections of the Woolwich Regional Center and
Auburn Road Village unless approved as part of a site plan.
A. The transfer of units from another site located within the Township,
which units to be transferred shall be incorporated into the density for
the applicable portion of the Woolwich Regional Center and the Auburn
Road Village of the Township, shall be based upon the TDR
Ordinance.134
B. The acquisition of development rights which may be acquired from
another site located within the Township, which units if not owned by
the applicant shall only be added to the base density upon evidence of
the acquisition of same. The agreement shall set forth the reduction on
the sending site and the proportionate increase on the receiving site
and shall be binding upon all parties both as to acquisition and
reduction in density. The Township Committee shall incorporate a
reference to the retirement of specific areas of land in the agreement.
C. The Township Committee and Joint Land Use Board may approve the
inclusion of low- and moderate-income affordable housing units
previously not planned for by the Township and not previously
incorporated in its Housing Element and Affordable Housing Plan, in
order to increase density based upon this provision. The proposal to
provide affordable housing units must also be approved by either the
New Jersey Council on Affordable Housing (COAH) or the court as an
amendment to the Township's Housing Element and Fair Share Plan.
Any increase in density to be based upon this section of this Part 2 shall
be determined based upon the established guidelines by either COAH

198:909
Street Screen
SUBURBAN SPRAWL  The name given to development designed
according to segregated use zoning standards, and auto-dependent criteria
concerning access and parking. The resultant development provides for
a low-density landscape of independently designed uses connected by a
system of hierarchical streets, which do not provide through access. A
majority of the land in this model is relegated to street and parking
surfaces, and although the building density and population may be low, the
amount of usable open space is minimal to none, and traffic congestion is
common.
Suburban Sprawl
SUSTAINABLE  Having the ability to accommodate and maintain
population growth and economic expansion through intelligent design.
TEXTURE  The exterior finish of a surface, ranging from smooth to coarse.
TOWNHOUSE  A one-family dwelling unit, with a private entrance,
attached horizontally in a linear arrangement, being located on a separate
lot, and being separated from an adjoining dwelling unit by an approved

independent of the corresponding wall of the adjoining unit and having
a totally exposed front and rear wall to be used for access, light and
ventilation.
TRADITIONAL AND NEO-TRADITIONAL NEIGHBORHOODS 
Neo-traditional neighborhoods Incorporate design principles that
produce compact, mixed-use, pedestrian-scaled communities. The
following conventions are generally employed in the design of
traditional neighborhoods.
The neighborhood is limited in area to that which can be traversed
in a ten- to fifteen-minute walk.

TRANSOM  A horizontal window above a door or window, usually
rectangular in shape.
Transom
TRELLIS  Lightweight elements used for controlling the shape or to
support climbing and other plants. In most instances, it is usually
constructed on a flat plane, in a two-dimensional way, unlike an arbor, which
is frequently a three-dimensional structure.
Residences, shops, workplaces, and civic buildings are located in
close proximity.
(2)
A well-defined and detailed system of interconnected streets serves
the needs of the pedestrian and the car equally, providing multiple
routes to all parts of the neighborhood.
(3)
Physically defined open spaces in the form of plazas, squares, and
parks, in addition to finely detailed public streets, provide places
for formal and informal social activity and recreation.
(4)
Private buildings form a clear edge, delineating the private from
the public realm.
(5)
Civic buildings reinforce the identity of the neighborhood,
providing places of assembly for social, cultural, and religious
activities.
(6)
Traditional neighborhoods pursue certain objectives through their
design:
Independence of movement for the elderly and young by bringing
many activities of daily living within walking distance.
(1)
Reduced traffic congestion and road construction costs by reducing
the number and length of car trips.
(2)
Use or preparation for future use of alternative forms of
transportation by organizing appropriate building densities.
(3)
Improved security of public spaces organized to stimulate informal
surveillance by residents and business operators.
(4)
Enhanced sense of community and improved security through
provision of a range of housing types and workplaces in proximity
to one another.
(5)
Accessible places for public assembly and civic engagement by
identification of suitable sites for civic buildings.

TWIN  A one-family dwelling unit, with a private entrance, attached
horizontally in a linear arrangement to one other dwelling unit, each located
on a separate lot, and being separated from each other by an approved
wall extending from the foundation through the roof and structurally
independent of the corresponding wall of the adjoining unit and having
a totally exposed front and rear wall to be used for access, light and
ventilation.
VERNACULAR  A regional adaptation of an architectural style or styles;
usage has intrinsically resolved the architectural response to climate,
construction technique, and, to some extent, social mores.

[Amended 8-20-2018 by Ord. No. 2018-13]
§ 203-139. Large-format retail.
A. Goal: to provide locations for regional commercial uses that include
lifestyle commercial and office locations that are quasi-auto-dependent
and that are single- or multi-use buildings and that may or may not be
on individual lots.
B. Definition: single- or multi-use buildings that address a multitude of
regional commercial needs in a walkable lifestyle commercial
configuration.
C. Zoning Map.
D. The following examples best embody the purpose, goals and objectives
of the large-format retail unit:
(1) Photo 1.
§ 203-139 YOUTH SPORTS § 203-139
198:965
(a) Attractive one-story retail main streets work well when the
architecture is accentuated vertically to provide a sense of
enclosure on the street.
(b) Large glass storefronts provide an inviting image to shoppers.
(c) Arcades provide user comfort and help to modulate the
architectural rhythm, relating it to the human scale.
(d) Photo 2.
(e) Second-story office use is encouraged. It provides on-site users
of the first floor retail.
(f) Most national chains now have architecture that will fit into a
main street setting.
(g) Solar screens and awnings provide shade to lower floors.
(h) Creative use of projecting bays, fenestration and materials
provides architectural interest to the street and may serve as a
reference to a special place in the community.
(2) Photo 3.
(a) Sidewalks should be designed with a generous width to
encourage walking and outdoor dining.
§ 203-139 WOOLWICH CODE § 203-139
198:966
(b) Signage should be artfully incorporated into the building
facade; less is sometimes more.
(c) Appropriate levels of lighting are important to provide user
comfort in evening hours; decorative lighting fixtures add to
the design of the environment.
(3) Photo 4.
(a) Public or semipublic plazas or greens are important to provide
context to the land plan; provide gathering places on a daily
basis; and to provide a place for special events.
(b) The use of landscaping, walkways, fountains and architectural
follies helps to provide context to public and semipublic open
space.
E. Size and scope.
(1) Zone acreage: subject to Woolwich Adult Settlement Agreement.
(2) FAR: 0.25 or approximately 1,100,000 square feet.

D. The following examples best embody the purpose, goals and objectives
of the big box retail unit:
(1) Photo 1.
(a) The addition of amenities such as fountains, squares and
plazas provides site identity as well as focal points for
customer use. The elements also act to reduce the harshness of
large parking lots often associated with big box retail.
(b) Scale of otherwise large buildings can be broken down through
the use of offsets in facades and rooflines, materials use and
arcades and other sheltered walkways.
(c) Signage should be integrated into the facade design.
(2) Photo 2.
§ 203-140 YOUTH SPORTS § 203-140
198:977
(a) The playful use of signage can serve to break down the scale of
otherwise large buildings when integrated into the entire
architectural design of the building and used in conjunction
with vertical and horizontal building offsets, material changes
and orientation of horizontal and vertical elements.
(b) Over-scaled objects can serve as both whimsical sculpture and
safety bollards to protect pedestrians. The objects further
provide a playful dialogue on scale within the public and
semipublic spaces.
(c) Public entry points should be distinguished in the architecture.
(d) It is important to use architectural techniques to reduce the
perception that big box stores are horizontal buildings with
large blank walls. Creative use of materials offsets and glass
will be required.
(3) Photo 3.
(a) Pad sites present the opportunities to establish a strong
architectural edge along Route 322.
(b) All vehicle circulation is internal to the site.
§ 203-140 WOOLWICH CODE § 203-140
198:978
(c) Pedestrian pathways woven into the landscape are a key
design requirement.
(4) Photo 4.
(a) Parking lots constitute the largest public or semipublic space
in a big box center. Details associated with the use of
landscaping, textured pavement, wide sidewalks, textured
crosswalks, lighting and street furniture all serve to control
automobile speeds and to provide a safe and attractive
pedestrian environment.
(b) Arrangement of buildings into small courtyards helps to reduce
the scale perception of big box buildings and makes parking
proximate to front doors of multiple tenants.
E. Size and scope.
(1) Zone acreage; subject to Woolwich Adult Settlement Agreement.

D. The following examples best embody the purpose, goals and objectives
of the regional hotel/office unit:
(1) Photo 1.
(a) Single-use hotel and office buildings sit in a parklike setting
where the quality of landscape features is a critical design
element.
(b) While largely auto-dependent, the size of parking courts should
be kept small and integrated into the total landscape concept.
(c) The oversize portico matches the building scale and is
appropriate for the grand scale of the regional hotel and office.
(d) Vertical scale is broken by two layers of horizontal banding.
(2) Photo 2.
§ 203-141 YOUTH SPORTS § 203-141
198:989
(a) Stormwater features can be designed as an amenity such as a
lake and provide a community park setting to the wider
residents of the Township.
(b) The sophisticated use of materials such as glass and masonry
helps to mitigate the large massing of the building.
Approximately 60% of the facade is glass.
(c) The building is further broken down in scale by sitting the
building in an "L" shape with a glass corridor connection. The
"L" shape is an organizing element that helps provide context
to the public space, like a public square.
(3) Photo 3.
(a) The vertical scale of the building is broken by the use of three
layers of horizontal banding. The three alternating layers of
masonry, glass and masonry help define the base, the body and
the top of the building.
(b) Two-foot to ten-foot vertical and horizontal offsets further
mitigate the perception of a large monolithic building.
(c) Front yard parking is absent.
(4) Photo 4.
§ 203-141 WOOLWICH CODE § 203-141

ARTICLE XX
Mixed-Use Commercial/Residential Walkable Neighborhood Center
(AR-1) District
§ 203-146. Townhouse units.
A. Goal: to provide a mixture of unit sizes to address the needs and desires
of those at various stages of life who wish to live in densities associated
with townhouse living.
B. Definition: a one-family dwelling unit with a private entrance, attached
horizontally in a linear arrangement, being located on a separate lot,
and being separated from an adjoining dwelling unit by an approved
wall extending from the foundation through the roof and structurally
independent of the corresponding wall of the adjoining unit and having
a totally exposed front and rear wall to be used for access, light and
ventilation.
C. Zoning Map.
D. The following examples best embody the purpose, goals and objectives
of the townhouse unit:
(1) Photo 1.
§ 203-146 YOUTH SPORTS § 203-146
198:1053
(a) Bay windows work to provide street rhythm and to break down
the horizontal scale.
(b) Small private front yard planting softens the street
environment.
(c) Windows on the side facade enliven corner buildings.
(d) Stoops provide public/private transition.
(e) The front door is accentuated in scale.
(f) Durable materials stand up to the test of time.
(2) Photo 2.
(a) On a case-by-case basis, townhouses may be arranged in a
courtyard configuration with front doors and garages facing a
landscaped parking/multipurpose court.
(b) Modern can coexist with traditional as long as well-established
roles of rhythm, scale and material choice are respected.
(c) Low garden walls define courtyard edges.
§ 203-146 WOOLWICH CODE § 203-146
198:1054
(d) High-quality landscaping and surface materials such as pavers
are required in courtyards.
(3) Photo 3.
(a) Slight variations in dormer design reduce monotony in
otherwise identical units.
(b) Low front yard garden walls provide appropriate public/private
transition.
(c) A large mansard roof element accentuates horizontal breaks to
respect human scale at the sidewalk level.
(d) Generous windows on the front facade provide internal light
while animating the street and promoting safety.
(e) Roof gardens and decks provide necessary outdoor private
space.
(4) Photo 4.
(a) Vertical and horizontal architectural offsets and material
changes reinforce human scale at the street level.
(b) Windows turning the corner of the building acknowledge the
special location at a street intersection.
(c) Solar screens provided reduce unit energy loads and provide
horizontal breaks.
§ 203-146 YOUTH SPORTS § 203-146
198:1055
(d) Variations in window dimensions provide interest to the street
and address scale and rhythm issues.
E. Size and scope.
(1) Maximum number of units: 210 dwelling units.
(2) Densities: See TDR Market Analysis.
(3) Townhouses are encouraged to provide architectural edges to open
space.
(4) A variety of unit sizes must be offered.

ARTICLE XXI
Comprehensive Sign Plan
§ 203-150. Mixed Use Commercial/Residential Walkable Town
Center (RC-1); Mixed Use Commercial/Residential Walkable
Neighborhood Center (AR-1).
A comprehensive sign plan shall be provided which has a consistent sign
design theme throughout the Town Center or Neighborhood Center. The
color of letters and background shall be carefully considered in relation
to the color of the materials of the building(s) and where the signs are
proposed to be located. All building signs shall be compatible with the
architecture of the building and shall be a subordinate rather than
predominant feature of any building. If a project is submitted as a general
development plan (GDP) and meets the requirements of a GDP, the Joint
Land Use Board has the discretion to review and approve a separate
comprehensive sign package that is different than the following sign
ordinance for the parcels associated with the GDP.
A. Purpose.
(1) To implement and enforce the sign regulations set forth below.
(2) To encourage signage compatible with the character of buildings
and integrated with the building's architectural design and other
signs on and in the vicinity of the building.
(3) To promote creativity in signage design, utilizing high-quality
materials and craftsmanship and to develop a distinctive image.
(4) To encourage efficient use of signage to avoid visual clutter.
(5) To protect the public health, safety and welfare by promoting
signage that effectively identifies establishments and is visible to
both pedestrians and motorists alike.
B. Sign approval and enforcement procedures.
(1) Any person wishing to erect, alter, modify or expand any sign shall
first apply to the lessor (property owner) or its property
management agent for review and approval of such sign
improvement relative to an approved comprehensive sign plan.
Upon receipt of such approval in writing, such person shall then
apply to the Township Planner and Township Building Department
for all necessary permits. The applicant shall provide all
information and materials for the proposed sign(s) necessary for
the property owner and the Township Planner to determine
compliance with the approved comprehensive sign plan.
(2) If the Township Planner determines the proposed sign(s) conforms
to the applicable comprehensive sign plan standards and
restrictions, he/she shall issue zoning approval for such sign.
§ 203-150 YOUTH SPORTS § 203-150
198:1105
Notwithstanding the following requirements, the Township Planner
shall have limited discretion in the administration of these
standards. In the exercise of that discretion, he/she may approve
a sign that deviates in a minor way from such standards, if he/
she determines that the sign(s) substantially conforms to the
requirements set forth in the standards.
(3) The Township Planner shall have the final authority to approve or
deny a proposed sign request, to direct the removal of any sign
installed without such approval, and to enforce all provisions
contained in this Part 2.
(4) Failure to comply with such provisions may result in enforcement
action by the Township Planner, which may lead to the imposition of
penalties, including fines, as provided by the Township Code.
(5) Any person aggrieved by a compliance decision rendered by the
Township Planner may appeal such decision to the municipal board
having jurisdiction over such matters as determined by the
Township Planner after conferring with the Township Attorney.
C. General standards.
(1) The sign regulations set forth in the Township Code, Article VIII,
shall control for sign standards not otherwise enumerated in these
regulations or this sign plan.
(2) Flags and emblems of a government organization or of a political,
civil, philanthropic, educational or religious organization are
exempt from all provisions of the Township Code and this sign plan.
(3) No exposed raceways, ballast boxes or electrical signs shall be
permitted.
(4) Sign company names or stamps shall be concealed (applicable
ordinances and codes permitting).
(5) Public safety decals in minimum sizes may be used, subject to
compliance with all applicable codes.
(6) Tenants shall not use or affix to a building or window, temporarily
or permanently, any stickers or paper, cardboard, plastic or other
similar low-quality signs; nor shall banners, pennants and/or flagtype
signs of various materials be so used.
(7) No merchandise, wall storage units or equipment of any sort shall
be placed in front of building windows so as to obscure views into
and out of the building.
(8) Signs that are necessary for the safe movement of traffic or other
directional assistance shall be permitted, provided they follow the
materials, colors, and letter type standards approved for such
§ 203-150 WOOLWICH CODE § 203-150
198:1106
signage. All signage of this type shall be approved by the Township
Planner and lessor or lessor's authorized agent prior to installation.
(9) Special mounting standards shall be used for traffic directional,

comply with Subtitle 1 of Title 39 (Standard Traffic Signs) and be
mounted utilizing the special design details for such signs
approved for the project.
(10) Drawings showing letter sizes, letter type, fabrication, and
installation shall have to be approved and signed by the lessor or
lessor's authorized agent.

compatible with the principal structure to which they are attached
in both overall design and materials.

means of advertising.
(17) Animated, moving and fluttering signs (including business-related
banners, flags and pennants), blinking, flashing, sparkling or
glittering signs are prohibited. Signs that produce glare or use bare
bulbs, such as exposed neon and other exposed tube signs, as well
as signs that use bright day-glo or fluorescent colors are
prohibited. Signs that obstruct pedestrian traffic, such as sandwich
board and other portable signs, are prohibited.
(18)No permanent sign shall be painted directly on the surface of any
wall, building, fence or similar structure.
(19) The maximum graphic content coverage of any sign shall not
exceed 70% of the sign face.
(20)No sign shall have more than two faces, and such faces shall be
parallel to each other.
§ 203-150 YOUTH SPORTS § 203-150
198:1107
(21) Every permitted sign, including window lettering and exterior
signs, shall be constructed using high-quality materials and shall
be kept in good condition and repair at all times. All signs to the

requirement is satisfied shall primarily rest with the lessor of the
property.

shall not include reference to any sales, promotions, merchandise
or services. In addition, all such decorations shall be removed
within 10 days of the applicable holiday.
(27) All business establishments above the street level shall be
prohibited from installing or otherwise placing any signage on the
exterior of the building or in the windows of such building. This
includes both permanent and temporary signs of any kind.
(28) Permanent signs that advertise continuous sales, special prices,
etc., are prohibited.
D. Sign area measurement.
(1) The area of a sign shall be computed based on the area of the actual
sign face, exclusive of any supporting structure or bracing. Where
a sign has two parallel faces, only one of the faces shall be
measured to determine the area of the sign.

(2) Each store or establishment on the street level having frontage on
two streets shall also be permitted one of the above permitted
exterior signs along a secondary street frontage that is not
otherwise considered a principal building face.
§ 203-150 YOUTH SPORTS § 203-150
198:1115
(3) In addition to the above, restaurants, cafes, luncheonettes,
delicatessens and similar establishments shall also be permitted to
mount/hang a display board.
(4) No more than one additional sign shall be permitted on a drivethrough
canopy. Its design, size and lighting shall be consistent
with other proposed signs for the store or establishment.
H. Maintenance.
(1) Signs and supporting hardware shall be structurally safe, clean,
free of visible defects, and functioning properly at all times. The
responsibility to satisfy this requirement shall rest with the lessor
and shall be subject to the enforcement of the Township Planner.
(2) Repairs to signs shall use materials and craftsmanship that are
comparable or better than were used for the original sign, and shall
be subject to the review and approval of the lessor as well as the
Township Planner.
I. Colors and materials. Color is one of the most important aspects of
visual communication. It can be used to catch the eye or to
communicate ideas or feelings. Too many colors used simultaneously
can confuse and negate the message of a sign. Even the most carefully
planned sign may look unattractive due to poor color selection.
Contrast is an important influence on the legibility of signs. Light
letters on a dark background or dark letters on a light background are
the most legible.
(1) Limit the total number of colors used in any one sign. Small accents
of several colors may make a sign unique and attractive, but the
competition of large areas of many different colors decreases
readability.
(2) Colors or color combinations that interfere with legibility of the
sign copy or that interfere with viewer identification of other signs
shall be avoided. Bright day-glo (fluorescent) colors shall be
avoided as they are distracting and do not usually blend well with
other background colors.
(3) Sign colors shall complement the colors used on the structures and
the project as a whole.
(4) Sign materials shall be of the highest quality and shall be
compatible with the design of the facade where they are placed.
(5) The selected materials shall contribute to the legibility of the sign.
For example, glossy finishes are often difficult to read because of
glare and reflections.
(6) Required materials.
§ 203-150 WOOLWICH CODE § 203-150
198:1116
(a) The following are required materials for signs unless otherwise
approved by the Township Planner:
[1] Wood (carved, sandblasted, etched, and properly sealed,
primed and painted, or stained).
[2] Metal (formed, etched, cast, engraved, and properly
primed and painted or factory-coated to protect against
corrosion). Such signs shall be prepared in a manner such
that there shall be a three-dimensional quality to the
appearance of the sign face(s).
[3] High-density preformed foam or similar material approved
by the Township Planner.
(b) New materials may be very appropriate if properly designed in
a manner consistent with these standards, and painted or
otherwise finished to complement the architecture of the
building.
J. Sign illumination. The way in which a sign is to be illuminated shall be
considered carefully. Like color, illumination has considerable value for
visual communication.
(1) First, consider if the sign needs to be lighted at all. Lights in the
window display may be sufficient to identify the business. This is
particularly true if good window graphics are used. Often, nearby
streetlights provide ample illumination of a sign after dark.
(2) If the sign can be illuminated by an indirect source of light, this is
usually the best arrangement because the sign will appear to be
better integrated with the building's architecture. Light fixtures
supported in front of the structure cast light on the sign and
generally a portion of the face of the structure as well. Indirect
lighting emphasizes the continuity of the structure's surface and
signs become an integral part of the facade.
(3) Whenever indirect lighting fixtures are used, care shall be taken to
properly shield and place the light source to prevent glare from
spilling over into mixed-use or residential areas and any public
right-of-way. Signs shall be lighted only to the minimum level
required for nighttime readability.
(4) Signs comprised of individual letters mounted directly on a
structure can often use a distinctive element of the structure's
facade as a backdrop, thereby providing a better integration of the
sign with the structure. In keeping with this approach, internally
illuminated individual back-lighted solid letters (i.e., reverse
channel or hallo-type lighted letters) are permitted.
(5) Overall, the most appropriate type of sign illumination is indirect
lighting. Again, indirect lighting helps the sign to appear as an
§ 203-150 YOUTH SPORTS § 203-150
198:1117
integral part of the facade, not something that was added later.
Indirect lighting is generally more appropriate for smaller single
buildings. In addition, indirect lighting produces a more intimate
ambience on the street.
(6) Any illuminated sign located on any building, which sign is adjacent
to a residential use, shall not be illuminated between the hours of
11:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m.
(7) Lighting for signage may be on a timer.
(8) External light sources shall be directed and shielded to limit direct
illumination of any object other than the sign.
(9) Internally illuminated sign boxes or individual letter signs with
translucent faces are prohibited. Internally illuminated reverse
channel letter type signs and individual letter signs are permitted.
The use of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) for such signs is
encouraged.
(10) Externally illuminated signs shall be lit only by downward pointing
shielded fixtures where 90% of the light emitted from such fixtures
is shone directly on the face of the sign. Wall-mounted goose-necktype
lighting fixtures are encouraged.
(11)No exposed sign illumination and no floodlighting of signs or
storefronts shall be permitted.
(12) All wiring associated with signs shall be installed and maintained
so as not to be in view of the public. Wiring shall under no
circumstances be installed within conduit attached to the face of
any building.
(13) Any light fixture used to illuminate a sign shall be compatible in
design with the architecture of the principal building to which it is
attached.
(14) Upward lighting of signs and canopies or awnings is prohibited.
(15) Exposed bulbs or tubing, including neon, is prohibited.
(16) The light from a illuminated sign shall be steady in nature, not
flashing, moving or changing in brilliance, character, color, degree,
intensity, location and type of illumination, and shall be the
minimum necessary to provide for the readability of the proposed
sign without shedding further illumination on nearby buildings,
especially residential buildings or units in the vicinity of the sign.
(17) Light sources shall utilize energy-efficient fixtures to the greatest
extent possible.
(18) Burned-out lamps, failing ballasts or other necessary electrical
components shall be replaced within two weeks.
§ 203-150 WOOLWICH CODE § 203-150

§ 203-151. Gateway Highway Service (RC-2); large-format retail
(RC-3); big box retail (RC-3); regional office/hotel (RC-3); Gateway
East (RC-4).
A comprehensive sign plan shall be provided which has a consistent sign
design theme throughout the sector. The color of letters and backgrounds
shall be carefully considered in relation to the color of the materials of the
building(s) and where the signs are proposed to be located. All building
signs shall be compatible with the architecture of the building and shall be
a subordinate rather than predominant feature of any building.
K. Removal of signs.
(1) In the event a business ceases operation for a period of time in
excess of 30 days, the lessor shall, during the following tencalendar-
day period, or greater period as agreed to by the
Township Planner, remove any sign identifying or advertising said
business.
(2) For the purpose of this subsection, the word "remove" shall mean:
(a) Removal of the sign face, along with posts, columns, brackets,
and/or other supporting structures; and
(b) Restoration of the area affected to the original condition prior
to such sign installation. Affected building surfaces shall be
restored to match adjacent portions of the structure.
A. Purpose.
(1) To implement and enforce the sign regulations set forth below.
(2) To encourage signage compatible with the character of buildings
and integrated with the building's architectural design and other
signs on and in the vicinity of the building.

materials and craftsmanship, and to develop a distinctive image.
(4) To encourage efficient use of signage to avoid visual clutter.
(5) To protect the public health, safety and welfare by promoting
signage that effectively identifies establishments and is visible to
both pedestrians and motorists alike.
B. Sign approval and enforcement procedures.
(1) Any person wishing to erect, alter, modify or expand any sign shall
first apply to the lessor (property owner) or its property
management agent for review and approval of such sign
improvement relative to an approved comprehensive sign plan.
Upon receipt of such approval in writing, such person shall then
apply to the Township Planner and Township Building Department
§ 203-150 YOUTH SPORTS § 203-151
198:1119
for all necessary permits. The applicant shall provide all
information and materials for the proposed sign(s) necessary for
the property owner and the Township Planner to determine
compliance with the approved comprehensive sign plan.
(2) If the Township Planner determines that the proposed sign(s)
conforms to the applicable comprehensive sign plan standards and
restrictions, he/she shall issue zoning approval for such sign.
Notwithstanding the following requirements, the Township Planner
shall have limited discretion in the administration of these
standards. In the exercise of that discretion, he/she may approve a
sign that deviates in a minor way from such standards, if he/she
determines that the sign(s) substantially conforms to the
requirements set forth in the standards.
(3) The Township Planner shall have the final authority to approve or
deny a proposed sign request, to direct the removal of any sign
installed without such approval, and to enforce all provisions
contained in this document.
(4) Failure to comply with such provisions may result in enforcement
action by the Township Planner, which may lead to the imposition of
penalties, including fines, as provided by the Township Code.
(5) Any person aggrieved by a compliance decision rendered by the
Township Planner may appeal such decision to the municipal board
having jurisdiction over such matters as determined by the
Township Planner after conferring with the Township Attorney.

(b) Noncommercial product logos and signature marks shall be
permitted on a case-by-case basis subject to the Design
Standards for Signs.
(c) Interior signage other than window signage, that is clearly
visible and positioned to be readily seen for outside the
building, shall be prohibited.
(d) Window signs shall be limited to individual letters placed on
the interior surface of the window and intended to be viewed
from outside. Glass-mounted graphic logos may be applied by
silk screening or prespaced vinyl die-cut forms.
(e) The window lettering or sign shall pertain only to the
establishment occupying that portion of the premises where
the window is located.
(f) The text or sign copy of a window sign shall be limited to the
business name and brief messages identifying the type of
product or service or pertinent information (e.g., "reservations
required" or business hours).
(g) Window signs indicting that an establishment is "Open" or
"Closed" for business shall be permitted; maximum one square
foot in area and no more than one sign per business frontage.
They shall be considered accessory to window signs and shall
not be included in incidental window sign area calculations.
(h) Window lettering or signs that have an exterior source of
illumination or include moving or animated images or text are
specifically prohibited.
(i) Building space leasing signs shall be permitted as follows: one
six-square-foot sign per street frontage for each leased space
or one twelve-square-foot sign per street frontage when more
than one space is available for lease in a building.
(7) Office tenant directory signs (outside building).
§ 203-151 YOUTH SPORTS § 203-151
198:1133
(a) Specifications.
[1] Maximum area: six square feet; no wider or taller than
three feet.
[2] Minimum letter height: none.
[3] Maximum lettering height: two inches.
[4] Maximum height above sidewalk: six feet.
[5] Maximum of one per building and only to be used for
upper-story tenants.
(b) The signs shall be located at the principal entrance to the
building serving tenants identified on the directory, shall be
affixed directly to the building face and shall be located, where
possible, perpendicular to building elevation where the
entrance is located.
F. Sign copy. The sign copy (text) of permanent signs shall relate only to
the name and/or nature of the business or service offered.
G. Number of signs.
(1) Each store or establishment on the street level shall be permitted a
maximum of two exterior signs, including a facade/wall sign, a
projecting/hanging sign, and an awning/canopy sign for each
principal building face. "Principal building face" shall be defined as
any building face that includes a public/customer entrance (not
emergency, service, or employee entrances) to the store or
establishment to which the sign is related. Window signs shall be
considered interior signs and shall be located on the inside of the
window only.
(2) Each store or establishment on the street level having frontage on
two streets shall also be permitted one of the above permitted
exterior signs along a secondary street frontage that is not
otherwise considered a principal building face.
§ 203-151 WOOLWICH CODE § 203-151
198:1134
(3) In addition to the above, restaurants, cafes, luncheonettes,
delicatessens and similar establishments shall also be permitted to
mount/hang a display board.
(4) No more than one additional sign shall be permitted on a drivethrough
canopy. Its design, size and lighting shall be consistent
with other proposed signs for the store or establishment.
H. Maintenance.
(1) Signs and supporting hardware shall be structurally safe, clean,
free of visible defects, and functioning properly at all times. The
responsibility to satisfy this requirement shall rest with the lessor
and shall be subject to the enforcement of the Township Planner.
(2) Repairs to signs shall use materials and craftsmanship that are
comparable or better than were used for the original sign, and shall
be subject to the review and approval of the lessor as well as the
Township Planner.
I. Colors and materials. Color is one of the most important aspects of
visual communication. It can be used to catch the eye or to
communicate ideas or feelings. Too many colors used simultaneously
can confuse and negate the message of a sign. Even the most carefully
planned sign may look unattractive due to poor color selection.
Contrast is an important influence on the legibility of signs. Light
letters on a dark background or dark letters on a light background are
most legible.
(1) Limit the total number of colors used in any one sign. Small accents
of several colors may make a sign unique and attractive, but the
competition of large areas of many different colors decreases
readability.
(2) Colors or color combinations that interfere with legibility of the
sign copy or that interfere with viewer identification of other signs
shall be avoided. Bright day-glo (fluorescent) colors shall be
avoided as they are distracting and do not usually blend well with
other background colors.
(3) Sign colors shall complement the colors used on the structures and
the project as a whole.
(4) Sign materials shall be of the highest quality and shall be
compatible with the design of the facade where they are placed.
(5) The selected materials shall contribute to the legibility of the sign.
For example, glossy finishes are often difficult to read because of
glare and reflections.
(6) Materials.
§ 203-151 YOUTH SPORTS § 203-151
198:1135
(a) The following are the permitted materials for signs unless
otherwise approved by the Township Planner:
[1] Wood (carved, sandblasted, etched, and properly sealed,
primed and painted, or stained).
[2] Metal (formed, etched, cast, engraved, and properly
primed and painted or factory-coated to protect against
corrosion). Such signs shall be prepared in a manner such
that there shall be a three-dimensional quality to the
appearance of the sign face(s).
[3] High-density preformed foam or similar material approved
by the Township Planner.
(b) New materials may be very appropriate if properly designed in
a manner consistent with these standards, and painted or
otherwise finished to complement the architecture of the
building.
J. Sign illumination. The way in which a sign is to be illuminated shall be
considered carefully. Like color, illumination has considerable value for
visual communication.
(1) First, consider if the sign needs to be lighted at all. Lights in the
window display may be sufficient to identify the business. This is
particularly true if good window graphics are used. Often, nearby
streetlights provide ample illumination of a sign after dark.
(2) If the sign can be illuminated by an indirect source of light, this is
usually the best arrangement because the sign will appear to be
better integrated with the building's architecture. Light fixtures
supported in front of the structure cast light on the sign and
generally a portion of the face of the structure as well. Indirect
lighting emphasizes the continuity of the structure's surface and
signs become an integral part of the facade.
(3) Whenever indirect lighting fixtures are used, care shall be taken to
properly shield and place the light source to prevent glare from
spilling over into mixed-use or residential areas and any public
right-of-way. Signs shall be lighted only to the minimum level
required for nighttime readability.
(4) Signs comprised of individual letters mounted directly on a
structure can often use a distinctive element of the structure's
facade as a backdrop, thereby providing a better integration of the
sign with the structure. In keeping with this approach, internally
illuminated individual backlighted solid letters (i.e., reverse
channel or hallo-type lighted letters) are permitted.
(5) Overall, the most appropriate type of sign illumination is indirect
lighting. Again, indirect lighting helps the sign to appear as an
§ 203-151 WOOLWICH CODE § 203-151
198:1136
integral part of the facade, not something that was added later.
Indirect lighting is generally more appropriate for smaller single
buildings. In addition, indirect lighting produces a more intimate
ambience on the street.
(6) Any illuminated sign located on any building, which sign is adjacent
to a residential use, shall be turned off no more than one hour after
closing unless necessary for security purposes.
(7) Lighting for signage may be on a timer.
(8) External light sources shall be directed and shielded to limit direct
illumination of any object other than the sign.
(9) Internally illuminated sign boxes or individual letter signs with
translucent faces are discouraged. Internally illuminated reverse
channel letter type signs and individual letter signs are permitted.
The use of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) for such signs is
encouraged.
(10) Externally illuminated signs shall be lit only by downward pointing
shielded fixtures where 90% of the light emitted from such fixtures
is shone directly on the face of the sign. Wall-mounted goose-necktype
lighting fixtures are encouraged.
(11)No exposed sign illumination and no floodlighting of signs or
storefronts shall be permitted.
(12) All wiring associated with signs shall be installed and maintained
so as not to be in view of the public. Wiring shall under no
circumstances be installed within conduit attached to the face of
any building.
(13) Any light fixture used to illuminate a sign shall be compatible in
design with the architecture of the principal building to which it is
attached.
(14) Upward lighting of signs and canopies or awnings is prohibited.
(15) Exposed bulbs or tubing, including neon, are prohibited.
(16) The light from a illuminated sign shall be steady in nature, not
flashing, moving or changing in brilliance, character, color, degree,
intensity, location and type of illumination, and shall be the
minimum necessary to provide for the readability of the proposed
sign without shedding further illumination on nearby buildings,
especially residential buildings or units in the vicinity of the sign.
(17) Light sources shall utilize energy-efficient fixtures to the greatest
extent possible.
(18) Burned-out lamps, failing ballasts or other necessary electrical
components shall be replaced within two weeks.
§ 203-151 YOUTH SPORTS § 203-151
198:1137
K. Removal of signs (except in the RC-3 District).
(1) In the event a business ceases operation for a period of time in
excess of 30 days, the lessor shall, during the following tencalendar-
day period, or greater period as agreed to by the
Township Planner, remove any sign identifying or advertising said
business.
(2) For the purpose of this section, the word "remove" shall mean:
(a) Removal of the sign face, along with posts, columns, brackets,
and/or other supporting structures; and
(b) Restoration of the area affected to the original condition prior
to such sign installation. Affected building surfaces shall be
restored to match adjacent portions of the structure.

ARTICLE XXII
General Design Standards (All Uses)
§ 203-152. Standards; incorporation into plan.
The physical appearance of a Center development shall be of the highest
quality. It is necessary that Center developments adhere to a set of
standards and criteria that address a variety of site plan considerations,
including site layout, building massing and form, and landscaping. This will
result in an overall coordinated appearance for a particular development.
The general design standards and criteria listed below must be
incorporated into a Center development plan submission for a development.
Design covenants shall incorporate, complement and expand upon these
general design standards and criteria. Such design covenants may be
required by the Joint Land Use Board as part of the development plan
application, review, and approval process.

permitted accessory buildings, shall be architecturally compatible and
be constructed of complementary materials.
L. The treatment of side and rear walls of any building in terms of building
materials and colors shall be similar to the treatment of the front
facade.
M. The visual impact of large parking lots in front of buildings (where
permitted) and long street frontages shall be minimized with low
architectural screen walls, landscaping and pedestrian systems and by
making parking lots smaller.
N. Nonresidential and mixed-use buildings shall be highlighted by such
features including:
(1) Outdoor patios.
(2) Display windows.

and/or places for sitting.
(12) Distinctive roof forms.
O. Nonresidential and mixed-use buildings shall be arranged and
clustered to maximize opportunities for shared circulation, parking,
loading, pedestrian walkways and plazas, recreation areas, transitrelated
facilities, and day and night security surveillance.
§ 203-153 WOOLWICH CODE § 203-153
198:1140
§ 203-154. Block layout.
P. New buildings or additions on any given street shall generally be
consistent with the predominant or emerging setback pattern for the
street.
Q. Street-level storefronts and building entrances shall be open and
inviting to pedestrians.
R. For buildings located and oriented around open space, awnings,
canopies, solar screens, and/or colonnades are encouraged.
S. Restaurants shall be permitted to operate outdoor cafes on sidewalks,
provided that pedestrian circulation and access to building entrances
are not impaired.
T. Special ground texture treatment shall be required for pedestrian
crossings in streets and elsewhere, to include brick, pavers, porous
pavement, stone and/or other material deemed suitable by the Joint
Land Use Board.
U. All streets, alleys, and sidewalks and pathways shall connect to other
streets within the Auburn Road Village and connect to existing streets
outside the Auburn Road Village, as appropriate. Dead-end streets are
generally not permitted within the Auburn Road Village unless such
condition is unavoidable, subject to Joint Land Use Board approval.
V. Air-conditioning units, HVAC systems, exhaust pipes or stacks, satellite
dishes and other telecommunications receiving devices shall be
screened or specially treated to be, as much as possible, inconspicuous
as viewed form the public right-of-way and adjacent properties or
otherwise incorporated into the architecture.
W. Street furniture such as benches, street lamps, bicycle racks, trash
receptacles, tree grates, bus stops, landscape planters and hanging
baskets and the like shall be provided. The Joint Land Use Board may
require some street furniture to be permanently secured to the
sidewalk.
A. The blocks created by streets, avenues, and boulevards shall conform in
location and size to the regulations specified in the Street Regulating
Plan, unless otherwise amended by approval of the Joint Land Use
Board.
B. As a general rule, buildings shall reflect a continuity of treatment
obtained by maintaining the buildings' scale or by subtly graduating
changes; by maintaining base courses; by continuous use of front
porches on residential buildings; by maintaining cornice lines in
buildings of the same height; by extending horizontal lines of
fenestration; and by echoing architectural styles and details, design
themes, building materials, and colors recommended in locations
designated on the plan as requiring special architectural treatment.
§ 203-153 YOUTH SPORTS § 203-154
198:1141
§ 203-155. Residential building design.
C. Aesthetics of block layouts.
(1) A residential neighborhood with varying block configurations shall
be designed within a street grid and accommodate a variety of lot
sizes and types. Flexibility is built into the Street Regulating Plan
as to the location and orientation of "small streets" and alleys.
(2) The build-to line for residential buildings shall be used as a
guideline for all residential units in a given block and shall not be
interpreted so as to create a single setback line. The intent shall be
that the buildings shall vary along setback lines within the
guidelines as established in this Part 2.
(3) Streets in some cases are intended to weave through
neighborhoods and open spaces to create varied site vistas while
maintaining the integrity of the street grid. Pedestrian walkways
for these streets are intended to promote walking to create a sense
of neighborhood. Small neighborhood parks and green edges
abutting residential homes are intended to add interest to the
neighborhood. Common open spaces are provided at the edges of
some blocks to provide opportunity for active and/or passive
recreational activities.
(4) All of the above components shall be viewed in conjunction with
one another in creating neighborhood design.
D. Buildings shall be architecturally emphasized through fenestration,
entrance treatment, and detailing. Buildings with more than one facade
facing a public street or internal open space shall be designed to
provide for enhanced facade treatments on those sides of said buildings
which are not the front of the building.
E. A block consisting of between three lots and 10 lots shall be developed
with the minimum of three different base model type homes varying by
both amount of habitable space and architecture treatment. Blocks
consisting of between 11 lots and 30 lots shall be developed with a
minimum of four base types. Each base model type home in any block
shall have at least two alternative front elevations containing different
design features as enumerated.
F. Exterior public and semi-public spaces, such as courtyards or plazas,
shall be designed to enhance surrounding buildings, and provide
amenities for users, in the form of textured paving, landscaping,
lighting, street trees, benches, litter containers, and other items of
street furniture, as appropriate. Courtyards shall have recognizable
edges defined on at least three sides by buildings, walls, elements of
landscaping, and/or elements of street furniture, in order to create a
strong sense of enclosure.
§ 203-154 WOOLWICH CODE § 203-155
198:1142
A. The front facade of a single-family detached, twin or townhouse unit
shall reflect traditional rules of scale and rhythm, Awnings, open and
usable porches, stoops, bay windows and/or balconies and facade and
roofline offsets are required to aid the articulation of scale and rhythm.
B. A minimum of 50% of single-family detached and twin dwelling units
shall have a front entrance articulated with a covered front entry porch.
Front porches shall generally be located on the front of the dwelling
facing the sidewalk, but may occasionally be located on the side wall of
a dwelling. The size of front entry porches shall be a minimum of eight
feet deep from the front wall of the dwelling to the enclosing porch rail
and a minimum of 10 feet long.
C. The ground floor of all residential units except flats shall be raised
above the level of the adjacent sidewalk as specified for the various
street types. Residential units shall have their ground floors raised
above ground level at the front of the building by a minimum of two
feet, and residential buildings which are required to comply with ADA
standards and state handicapped accessibility codes are exempt from
this requirement.
D. Garages are discouraged along the main front facade of single-family
detached, twin and townhouse units and are prohibited forward of such
facades. Subject to the rules of the Street Regulating Plan, garages may
be front, side or rear entry types. Windows are required in the walls of
such garages to admit light and eliminate blank walls. Sufficient
storage area to accommodate tools, auto accessories, trash/recyclable
materials storage, lawn and garden maintenance equipment shall be
considered in sizing the garages so that an accessory storage structure
will not be necessary. Individual bay overhead garage doors are
encouraged. Detached garages shall be offered as a permitted option on
certain available single-family detached and twin units.
E. All single-family detached, twin and townhouse units are encouraged to
have clearly defined front yards using landscaping, hedging, fencing, or
a brick or stone wall, none of which shall exceed three feet in height.
F. Where the rear of a single-family detached, twin or townhouse unit is
visible from an exterior or interior street, such building elevations and
yard areas shall be specially designed and treated to present a pleasant
appearance to such street.
G. Townhouse buildings shall consist of no more than eight townhouse
dwelling units in order to prevent the development of long and
monotonous buildings. There shall be different roofline heights and
vertical offsets in each overall townhouse building. No more than two
adjacent townhouse units shall have the same building offset, which
shall vary by at least two feet.
H. Flats shall have access provided by an outside entrance or stairway
exclusively serving the residential units.
§ 203-155 YOUTH SPORTS § 203-155
198:1143
§ 203-156. Nonresidential and mixed-use building design.
I. All single-family, twin and townhouse dwelling units shall have private
outdoor space, which may include a deck, patio and/or terrace. Such
outdoor space shall be enclosed, as appropriate, by a decorative wall or
fence, evergreen hedge, trellis or lattice, vines, or some combination
thereof.
J. In case of walls, fences or trellises, the height of such open space
enclosures shall be five feet or seven feet high. Portions of fencing
below five feet shall be of solid material and above five feet in height
must be made to screen views of neighboring uses.
K. Each upper-floor flat dwelling shall be provided with a terrace, recessed
inside the exterior building wall of the dwelling, or an occupiable
balcony projecting on the outside of the building wall. If a terrace or
balcony is not provided for upper-floor flats, each dwelling shall be
provided with access to a conveniently located common space, park or
green.
A. The scale of buildings shall be broken up both horizontally and
vertically with offsets to reinforce the human scale.
B. No commercial statements of the occupant's products or services shall
be allowed as part of the building facade or elevation.
C. Architectural designs shall be evaluated in terms of the sensitive
integration of form, textures, and colors with the particular landscape
and topographic characteristics of each individual site.
D. Groups of related buildings shall be designed to present a harmonious
appearance in terms of style and use of exterior materials, fenestration
and roof type.
E. Building exterior walls shall be articulated to reduce the scale and the
uniform appearance of buildings and to provide visual interest that will
be consistent with the community's identity, character and scale. The
intent is to encourage a more human scale that residents and workers
will be able to identify with their community. As such, one or a
combination of the following shall be utilized in a development:
(1) Roofline variation.
(2) Arcades, display windows and entry areas.
(3) Grouping into smaller or multiple structures.
(4) Mature landscaping and landform manipulation.
(5) Wall texture placement and change.
(6) Clustering small-scale elements such as planter walls around the
major form.
§ 203-155 WOOLWICH CODE § 203-156
198:1144
(7) Creation of a horizontal and vertical shadow line.
(8) Offsets and/or breaks in the building line.
(9) Patterned walls.
(10) Fenestration.
(11) Color change.
(12) Recessed entrances.
F. Each building shall be sensitive to the immediate neighboring
structure. Opportunities to provide walkway systems to adjoining
buildings, including common plazas or courtyards, are encouraged.
G. All facades of a building which are visible from adjoining properties
and/or public streets should contribute to the pleasing scale features of
the building and encourage community integration by featuring
characteristics similar to the front facade.
H. The exterior walls of each building shall be constructed of durable
permanent architectural materials compatible with campus-like
standards, tastefully handled, i.e., carefully selected brick; stone with a
weathered face or polished, fluted, or broken-faced. Exterior building
materials may include smooth-faced concrete block, tilt-up concrete
panels or prefabricated steel panels as secondary accent materials only.
I. Preengineered metal buildings, industrial-type structures featuring
predominantly painted exteriors, and corrugated metal-sided or
clapboard aluminum-sided "Butler" type buildings shall not be
permitted.
J. All facade materials must be low maintenance. There shall be no
exposed common concrete block on the exterior of any building, and
painted concrete block shall not be permitted.
K. Window treatment shall be required along the front and sides of all
buildings. The use of multifloor glass curtain walls should be avoided.
L. Drainage pipes and roof leaders on building surfaces must be located
on the interior and not exposed.
M. Building roofs are to be uncluttered. Vertical roof projections such as
towers, vents, stacks or roof-mounted equipment shall be integrated
into the architecture. All penetrations through the roof (i.e., mechanical
equipment or skylights) must be organized in a manner that is integral
to the architectural form of the building, or be completely screened
from view by parapet walls or approved enclosures. Screens shall be
attractive in appearance and reflect or complement the architecture of
the building to which they belong.
N. The design of canopies shall be in keeping with the design of the
building.
§ 203-156 YOUTH SPORTS § 203-157
198:1145
§ 203-157. Parking and circulation.
A. Off-street parking.
(1) Each building site must include adequate off-street automobile
parking and loading facilities per the ratios established in this Part
2. The Urban Land Institute's Shared Parking Analysis shall be
used by the applicant when it is deemed appropriate by the Joint
Land Use Board.
(2) Textured crosswalks are to be used where pedestrians come in
contact with vehicular traffic. All walks must be well lighted with
bollards. On-site pedestrian linkages must connect buildings to
external perimeter pedestrian systems.
(3) Parking is prohibited in front and side yards unless otherwise
noted.
(4) Parking access shall be via alleys unless otherwise noted (except in
the RC-3 District).
(5) Large parking fields are generally discouraged.
(6) Parking buffers are required on all four sides.
(7) Block cut-throughs shall provide access to rear yard parking;
minimums provided per this plan.
B. Use of on-street parking spaces.
(1) On-street parking credit may be counted for spaces which do not
actually front on the property for which they are to be considered
as serving, provided they are located within 1,000 feet of the
property for customer or client parking and 2,000 feet of the
property for employee parking. The Joint Land Use Board may, in
its discretion, elect to give such spaces on-street parking credit,
deny any credit for such spaces, or give partial credit for such
spaces depending on the use of the property upon which they front
and the uses of intervening properties located between the
property seeking to apply the spaces toward its parking need and
the spaces themselves.
(2) The following guidelines shall be used to determine which on-street
parking spaces an applicant may assume are available:
(a) Parking spaces located on a road that the Street Regulating
Plan classified as a residential street shall not be included in
the parking inventory for a commercial land use.
(b) Spaces directly abutting the applicant's property are onehundred-
percent available to the applicant, unless parking
regulations restrict parking during the time period when the
§ 203-157 WOOLWICH CODE § 203-157
198:1146
spaces are needed to satisfy the applicant's peak parking
demand.
(c) Spaces abutting a different commercial use shall not be
counted unless that use has an off-setting peak parking
demand or unless the owner of the use certifies that it has no
need for the available parking spaces.
(d) Parking that abuts open space, wetlands or detention basins
shall be considered available but must be shared with other
nearby commercial users. The applicant shall propose to the
Joint Land Use Board the percentage of the parking for which
credit will be taken and will explain to the Joint Land Use
Board the methodology used in determining that percentage.
C. Parking for all dwelling units shall be prohibited in front yard setback
areas. With the exception of lots that do not back up to lanes, as
depicted on the Street Regulating Plan, driveways and driveway access
shall be prohibited in any front yard area. Driveways shall be set back a
minimum of three feet from the side of dwelling units. Driveways shall
be set back a minimum of three feet from any side property line, unless
such driveway is shared by dwellings on two adjacent lots on the
common side lot line. Parking for townhouses shall be provided as
driveways or garages with access from a rear lane. Private driveways
for townhouses shall connect to lanes only and not to streets. Parking
for apartments may be located in common parking lots located on a lot
other than that containing the apartment building entrances. If access
to a garage is provided from a street, the front entrance of such a
garage shall be set back 10 feet further than the front wall of the
dwelling unit. The location of a garage shall be set back a minimum of
three feet from side property lines and five feet from a rear property
line.
D. Parking lot landscaping, buffering and screening.
(1) Lots for apartment and nonresidential uses shall balance the
functional requirements of parking with the provision of pedestrian
amenities. Transition areas between parking and civic, commercial,
or residential uses shall be designed with textured paving,
landscaping and street furniture approved by the Joint Land Use
Board.
(2) Parking lot layout, landscaping, buffering and screening shall be
provided to minimize direct views of parked vehicles from streets
and sidewalks, avoid spillover light, glare, noise, or exhaust fumes
onto adjacent properties, in particular residential properties, and
provide the parking area with a reasonable measure of shade, when
trees reach maturity. In order to achieve these objectives, parking
lots exposed to view of public streets and walkways shall be
surrounded by a minimum of a four-and-half-foot-high (three-foothigh
minimum in the RC-3 District), year-round visually impervious
§ 203-157 YOUTH SPORTS § 203-157
198:1147
screen, hedge, masonry wall and shall decrease where driveways
approach sidewalks or walkways, in order to provide adequate
visibility of pedestrians from motor vehicles and shall not interfere
with clear sight triangle requirements. Parking lots adjacent to
residential properties or residential alleys shall provide a minimum
six-foot-high year-round visually impervious screen, hedge or
masonry wall.
(3) The interior of all parking lots shall be landscaped to provide shade
and visual relief. This is best achieved by protected planting islands
or peninsulas within the perimeter of the parking lot. Parking lots
with 10 or fewer spaces may not require interior landscaping if the
Joint Land Use Board determines that there is adequate perimeter
landscaping. In parking lots with 11 or more spaces, a maximum of
one deciduous shade tree shall be required to be planted in the
parking lot for every five parking spaces. A six-foot planting
diamond, or equivalent planter, is required per tree. Choice of plant
materials, buffer width, type of screening, location, and frequency
of tree planting shall be flexible, provided these objectives are
designed to the satisfaction of the Joint Land Use Board.
E. Structured parking and carports.
(1) Structured parking shall be faced with other uses such as retail or
be designed to hide the utilitarian look of parking garages.
(2) Utilize the architectural vocabulary of adjacent facades to minimize
the inherent look of the parking structure and integrate the
structure as part of the overall facade.
(3) Parking entrances shall be indicated through increased massing,
increased detail, material change or signage and shall be clearly
visible from the secondary streets.
(4) Structured parking layouts shall take into consideration pedestrian
circulation and connections with adjacent building uses.
(5) Structured facades shall be articulated similar to, and colors shall
coordinate with, adjacent buildings.
(6) Utilitarian appearances of structured parking are not permitted.
Structures shall have design treatments such as colonnades,
arcades, awnings, landscaping, street furniture, and other public
amenities to create the appearance of an occupied building. Blank
walls are not permitted.
(7) Parked cars shall be visually screened from adjacent buildings and
the street, and such screening shall be in keeping with the rest of
the building's architectural style and materials.
(8) Locating structural parking at the interior of the block, surrounded
by buildings, is the preferred method.
§ 203-157 WOOLWICH CODE § 203-157
198:1148
(9) Vehicular access to structured parking shall be accessed from
alleys, placed underground, placed in structures above the ground
floor, or located behind or to the side of a building. Always provide
clear signage to direct the driver to the parking entrance.
(10) Structured parking shall not exceed 50 feet in height.
(11) Carports shall be required for some mixed-use developments and
flats, to be located within parking lots. Provision shall be made for
storage. Their design shall complement the principal structure and
in some instances be used as a buffer to single-family, twin and
townhouse units.
F. Residential garage and parking design standards.
(1) With the exception of lots that do not back up to lanes, as depicted
in this Part 2, driveways and driveway access shall be prohibited in
any front yard area.
(2) Driveways that are accessed through the front yard area shall be no
wider than 10 feet, and parking for all dwelling units shall be
prohibited within the front yard setback.
(3) Garages, driveways and parking areas shall have a minimum
setback of three feet from any side property line or side of dwelling
unit. An exception to the three-foot setback from the side property
line shall exist for townhouse and twin lots to permit garages,
driveways and parking areas that share a common wall on the
common property line.
(4) Garages shall only be located to the rear of the principal building.
(5) Two adjacent lots may share a driveway along their common
property line, subject to a cross-access easement.
(6) Residential lots may require on site parking spaces adjacent to the
garage in order to meet the minimum off-street parking
requirements if sufficient spaces are not provided within the
garage and the driveway to the garage.
(7) The maximum width of a driveway throat shall not exceed 24 feet.
There shall be no more than one driveway apron per lot.
(8) Driveways may be constructed of porous pavers, two-foot-wide
concrete to wheel tracks, or stone pavers.
(9) Except as noted, all driveways and parking spaces shall only be
accessed from the rear lane.
(10) Required parking for flats must be located internal to the block
upon which the condo/flats building is located. First-floor garage
parking for condo/flats is permitted, subject to meeting
architectural requirements.
§ 203-157 YOUTH SPORTS § 203-157
198:1149
(11) Each garage car space shall be counted as one off-street parking
space, regardless of the dimensions of the driveway.
(12) A one-car garage and driveway combination shall count as two offstreet
parking spaces, provided the driveway measures a minimum
of 18 feet in length between the face of the garage door and the
right-of-way.
(13) A two-car garage and driveway combination shall count as 3.5 offstreet
parking spaces, provided a minimum parking area width of
20 feet is provided for a minimum length of 18 feet as specified for
a one-car garage and driveway combination.
G. Shared parking.
(1) The overall intent for the provision of parking is to balance the use
mix with available parking opportunities both on- and off-street. A
parking analysis shall be performed in consideration of any
development application in order to ensure the adequacy of
parking without, wherever possible, overdeveloping off-street
parking areas. Off-street parking shall be provided according to
minimum requirements as specified in this Part 2, the Township
Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance137 and in
accordance with New Jersey Residential Site Improvement
Standards (RSIS).
(2) Off-street parking for commercial uses shall be sufficient to provide
parking for the employees of all proposed uses as well as long-term
customer parking. Spaces reserved for employees shall be
designated as such by means of striping and signage. Off-street
parking lots may in some instances be prohibited in the front yard
setback area. They shall be located at the side and rear of buildings
on the interior of lots whenever possible, and shall be accessed by
means of common driveways, preferably from side streets, lanes or
alleys. Cross-access easements for adjacent lots with
interconnected parking lots shall be required, in language
acceptable to the Township Committee. In addition to the off-street
parking requirements specified above, on-street parking shall be
provided to serve customers of commercial uses. Commercial onstreet
parking shall be provided as curbside, parallel, or angle
parking located along both sides of the streets on all blocks upon
which commercial uses front.
(3) Each applicant for a nonresidential development greater than
5,000 square feet shall be required to conduct a parking study to
determine the number of on-street and off-street parking spaces
required to accommodate peak parking demand. In calculating
peak parking demand, the applicant shall:
137. Editor's Note: See Ch. 163, Subdivision of Land.
§ 203-157 WOOLWICH CODE § 203-157
198:1150
(a) Project the peak number of occupied parking spaces using
formulas and procedures presented in the most recent edition
of Parking Generation, an information report published by the
Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE).
(b) Calculate the number of parking spaces needed by expanding
the number of occupied parking spaces by 10% to assure a
reasonable number of vacant parking spaces to permit
turnover of the parking supply.
(c) Identify how these parking spaces will be assured to future
occupants and customers of the proposed land uses.
(4) Shared parking shall be encouraged for all commercial parking lots
and particularly for those serving mixed-use commercial and
residential buildings. Where necessary, in parking lots which are
serving mixed-use commercial and residential buildings, the Joint
Land Use Board may, in its discretion, permit a limited amount of
parking to be reserved either for residential or specified
commercial uses only; or may restrict the hours that certain
spaces, the Board shall do so with the intent to limit such
restrictive use in order to advance the objective of encouraging
shared parking.
(5) An applicant seeking to satisfy its parking requirement using a
shared parking approach shall prepare a parking report that
documents how an adequate supply of parking spaces will be
provided to satisfy projected parking demand. The report shall be
prepared using procedures presented in the most recent version of
the report Shared Parking, published by the Urban Land
Institute. The report shall be prepared using the most current
shared parking methodology published by the Urban Land Institute
or the Institute of Transportation Engineers.
(6) A captured and shared parking study and report shall:
(a) Calculate the projected peak parking demand for each land use
that will be sharing the available parking supply using the
latest edition of the ITE informational report Parking
Generation.
(b) Calculate the extent to which parking demand will be
mitigated on the site as a result of trips captured from
adjoining land uses and therefore occurring without the use of
a vehicle.
(c) Calculate the peak parking accumulation for the development,
making use of shared parking procedures.
(d) Expand the peak parking accumulation by 10% to determine
the needed supply of parking spaces. This will assure an
adequate capacity of spaces for the turnover of vehicles.
§ 203-157 YOUTH SPORTS § 203-157
198:1151
(e) Determine the number of on-site parking spaces that will be
supplied.
(f) Determine the number of on-street parking spaces that are
available to the development in accordance with procedures
established by this section of Part 2.
(g) Determine whether any additional parking spaces will be
needed to serve the development and, if so, how they will be
supplied.
(h) Propose additional methods, if needed, to reduce parking
demand to mitigate an insufficient supply of parking. Other
methods could include the use of fringe parking lots, a satellite
parking lot with shuttle bus service, the provision of transit
subsites to employees in lieu of assurance of a parking space or
the establishment of a valet parking service making use of an
identified off-street parking lot.

(a) The number of required parking spaces may be reduced on a
space-per-space basis if the applicant can demonstrate that
suitable alternative parking spaces are located within close
proximity to the subject property or site, through a shared
parking arrangement with an adjoining use. Those spaces, to

§ 203-158. Green design guidelines.
Green building guidelines ensure that development within a Center
preserves the unique character of the site. The Township encourages the
construction of sustainable or "green" buildings. The guidelines that follow
are intended to result in environmentally friendly and economically vibrant
projects.
be counted towards this shared parking arrangement, must be
demonstrated to be available during the hours of operation of
the affected uses, and access to those spaces must be provided
for vehicles and pedestrians in a safe and efficient manner,
including shared driveways and interconnected walkways
where possible.
(b) The Township Planner may conduct site visits to confirm that
the amount of parking provided is being utilized by the
development and, in fact, that the parking remains sufficient to
meet the needs of the development. If at any time it is
determined that this is no longer the case, the construction of
additional banked or reserved parking spaces may be required
by the Township Planner to meet the demand.
H. The piling of snow is discouraged in required parking spaces or where it
will damage landscaping or appear unsightly in the public view.
A. Green building certification. According to the U.S. Green Building
Council (USGBC), Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design
(LEED) evaluates environmental performance from a whole building
perspective over a building's lifecycle, providing a definitive standard
for what constitutes a "green building." It is based on accepted energy
and environmental principles and strikes a balance between known
established practices and emerging concepts. LEED is a performanceoriented
system in which scoring points are earned for satisfying
performance criteria in the categories of sustainable site development
for new construction: reducing the urban heat island, energy efficiency,
water savings, materials selection and indoor environmental quality.
Different levels of green building certification are awarded by the
USGBC based on the total points earned. As a means of evaluating and
measuring achievements in sustainable design, this Part 2 encourages
design, construction, and operation of developments that meet the
criteria for a LEED-certified rating.
B. Reducing the urban heat island. The ambient air in urban environments
is usually significantly warmer (sometimes more than 10° F. warmer)
than the air in less developed areas, an effect known as the urban heat
island. Dark, nonreflective surfaces absorb heat from the sun and then
radiate it back to the surrounding area. Such hotter temperatures lead
to an increased need for air conditioning, which costs money and
consumes significant amounts of energy. Current statistics show that
air conditioning consumes 1/6 of all electricity used in the United
§ 203-157 YOUTH SPORTS § 203-158
198:1153
States. The following guidelines help to mitigate the formation of an
urban heat island:
(1) Provide shade (within five years) for 30% of the site's non-roof
impervious surfaces.
(2) Use light-colored/high-albedo materials (reflectance of a least 0.3)
for at least 30% of the site's non-roof impervious surfaces.
(3) Use highly reflective and high-emissive roofing material (at least
0.9 when tested in accordance with ASTM 408) for at least 75% of
the roof surface. In addition to the operational benefits to the
building, this application helps to extend the life span of a roof.
(4) Use a "green" vegetative roof for at least 50% of the roof area. In
addition to its ability to reduce stormwater flows and provide
insulation, this application helps to extend the life span of the roof.
C. Energy efficiency.
(1) Buildings should be designed to exceed by 20% the state energy
code or the most recent edition of ASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1
(without amendments), whichever is more stringent.
(2) Building owners are encouraged to provide a portion of the total
energy used by a building with on-site renewable sources, such as
photovoltaic systems.
D. Water savings. The following guidelines help decrease the amount of
municipal water needed for buildings:
(1) Decrease the quantity of potable water used for landscape
irrigation by 50%.
(2) Install ultra-low-flow fixtures in bathrooms and consider reusing
roof runoff volumes for flushing toilets in order to reduce the
amount of potable water required.
E. Materials selection and indoor environmental quality. The following
materials guidelines ensure quality environments that help decrease
the environmental impact of the materials needed for buildings:
(1) Divert as much construction waste away from disposal in landfills
as possible by recycling construction materials, including metal,
wood, concrete, brick, drywall and cardboard.
(2) Incorporate building materials that contain a high percentage of
recycled content.
(3) Incorporate building materials that have been manufactured and,
where possible, extracted regionally. Using regional products not
only reduces the amount of energy required for transportation, but
it also supports the local economy.
§ 203-158 WOOLWICH CODE § 203-158
198:1154
§ 203-159. Landscaping.
(4) Incorporate bio-based building materials where possible. This
includes materials incorporating certified wood, bamboo, wood,
cotton, cork, natural linoleum and agricultural fiber boards.
(5) Limit the amount of indoor air contaminants that are introduced
through building materials where possible. Materials, including
adhesives, sealants, paints and carpets, with lower VOC values
shall be preferred over standard versions. Materials made of wood
and agricultural fiber shall contain no added urea formaldehyde.
A. Landscaping shall be required in those areas that are designated as
setback areas, areas within parking lots, and areas not used for ingress,
egress, parking, or storage, and areas subject to grading and
recontouring.
B. Landscaping shall be integrated with other functional and ornamental
site design elements, where appropriate, such as recreational facilities,
ground paving materials, paths and walkways, fountains or other water
features, trellises, pergolas, gazebos, fences, walls, street furniture, art
and sculpture.
C. Plant suitability, maintenance and compatibility with site and
construction features are critical factors which shall be considered.
Plants shall be nonexotic, noninvasive and drought-tolerant and to the
best possible xeriscape.
D. Deciduous trees shall have at least a two-inch caliper at the time of
planting and shall be balled and burlapped. Evergreen trees shall be a
minimum of five feet to six feet high at the time of planting. Shrubs shall
be two feet in height at the time of planting. Only nursery-grown plant
materials shall be acceptable, and all trees, shrubs and ground covers
shall be planted according to accepted horticultural standards.
E. Within two years from the time of planting, all dead or dying plants,
whether installed new, transplanted, or designated as existing trees to
be retained on the plan, shall be replaced by the developer. The
developer shall be responsible for the required maintenance and
watering during the initial two years. Trees or other vegetation which
die after the second year shall be replaced and maintained by the
property owners or their agents.
F. Landscaping and site treatment plans shall consider seasonal flowers in
planters, planting beds, and hanging baskets.
G. Garbage collection, recycling and other utility areas shall be screened
around their perimeter by wood enclosures with a roof or by masonry
walls, with a minimum height of seven feet, and shall extend on three
sides of such an area, with a gate or door on the third side. Such a wall
shall be capped on the top. A landscaped planting strip a minimum of
three feet wide shall be located on three sides of such a facility. Planting

material shall be separated from the parking lots by Belgian block
curbing and shall have ramp access to such facility for vehicles and
carts. A mixture of hardy flowers and/or decorative evergreen and
deciduous trees may be planted.
H. To conserve energy, landscaping shall include the planting of evergreen
windbreaks to block northwest winds in the winter, thereby reducing
heating energy costs in the winter. Deciduous shade trees shall be
planted near the southern facades of buildings to block summer sun,
thereby reducing solar heat gain during the summer months.
I. All landscaping, including lawn areas, trees and shrubbery, shall be
maintained in excellent condition by the property owners or
development association by cutting, trimming, feeding, watering and
weeding. Plants shall be replaced as may be required. Landscaping
shall be installed upon the substantial completion of the building,
weather permitting, and an underground irrigation system may be
required by the Joint Land Use Board in some landscaped areas.
J. Existing vegetation to be preserved on each site must be designated on
each plan. Techniques to be employed to preserve such vegetated areas
shall be submitted to the Joint Land Use Board for review and approval.
Such techniques should address the following elements for the tree
structure so as to avoid damaging effects during and after construction
to these elements: crown; branch system; dripline; existing grade;
drainage and soil character; root system; and feeder root system.
A. Street trees, with a minimum caliper of two inches or 12 feet high at the
time of planting, shall be spaced per the requirements specified in the
Open Space Linkage Plan regarding streets, avenues, boulevards, and
highways, as well as medians of boulevards and divided roads. Bottom
branches shall be trimmed to a minimum of eight feet from the ground
to allow pedestrian passage in commercial areas. Street trees shall be
planted on both sides of the street and in the parkway between the curb
and the sidewalk, if such exists. Existing trees shall be used where
possible. In locations where healthy and mature shade trees exist, the
requirements for new trees maybe waived or modified.
B. The particular species of shade trees shall be determined upon specific
locational requirements, soil types, geology, climate and indigenous
species. The list of tree species permitted in the Center and Village is
presented in the Open Space Linkage Plan.
C. All intersections shall have street trees recognizing the requirements
for clear sight lines.
D. See the Public Spaces Plan for species options.
§ 203-159 WOOLWICH CODE § 203-161
198:1156
A. The specific locations of detention basins are indicated in the
Stormwater Management Plan. The system includes a host of
stormwater elements, including:
(1) Larger basins.
(2) Linear basins or bioswales and rain gardens.
(3) Small basins located in parks.
(4) Lakes or ponds.
B. Size and depth of the various elements shall be calculated based on
recognized engineering standards. Each parcel's stormwater drainage
must be collected on-site and released at an approved location or
locations. After being temporarily detained in basins, the stormwater
must be released at a controlled rate into the channel systems which
become part of the natural drainage watershed. In cases where water
drains onto the parcel from adjacent parcels, the drainage system must
provide for the inflow, unless special arrangements are made to the
contrary.
C. Stormwater detention areas may be necessary to ensure recharge of
sensitive groundwater systems. Determination of this need must be
made by the Township Engineer on the basis of topography, subsoil
characteristics, aquifer characteristics, and ground coverage.
D. Individual detention basins on each parcel shall not be required.
However, each site's individual drainage collection system must be
designed to collect and direct all surface runoff to an overall
comprehensive drainage system.
E. Detention basins must be sensitively designed to provide both practical
stormwater control and to develop into attractive and ecologically
stable landscapes. The following design guidelines shall be adhered to:
(1) Basin design should be site specific. Avoid using standard "cookiecutter"
shapes and angular designs; keep line and contours freeflowing
and natural in appearance.
(2) Vary basin shape and slopes to produce basins that blend into the
surrounding topography and existing natural conditions.
(3) Where appropriate, basin design should incorporate recreational
amenities such as ballfields and/or open play areas integrated with
plantings in a parklike and safe manner.
F. When required by the Joint Land Use Board and indicated on an
approved development plan, detention basins shall be landscaped. The
following planting design guidelines must be adhered to:
(1) Plant species should be tolerant of both wet and dry soil conditions.
§ 203-161 YOUTH SPORTS § 203-161
198:1157
§ 203-162. Lighting.
(2) Trees and shrubs should be planted in masses and groves to mimic
naturally occurring patterns.
(3) Plantings should be allowed to go on and over side slopes.
(4) Plantings should not be permitted on any dikes associated with the
detention basin unless approved by the Township Engineer.
(5) Provision for emergency access as well as general maintenance of
the basin should be reviewed and approved by the Township
Engineer. Plantings should be designed to disguise, yet not hinder,
vehicular access.
(6) Plantings should not be located too close to low-flow channels to
allow for maintenance of the basin.
(7) Vary plant spacing; allow for openings and gaps and more closely
planted areas.
(8) Tree plantings should be a mixture of species and sizes to be
reviewed and approved by the Joint Land Use Board.
(9) Shrubs should be planted in masses. Groups of single species
should be allowed to overlap a group of another species to form
large continuous beds.
(10) Grass mixtures should be specified that remain attractive while
being cut only three to four times per year, e.g., tall fescue
varieties. Avoid using high-maintenance fine lawn grasses. Where
appropriate, basins may be seeded with meadow grass or
wildflower mixtures that require only one mowing per year.
(11) Open areas, from the basin to existing woodlands, should be
planted with indigenous species of shade trees and naturalizing
meadow grass and/or wildflower mixture to help blend the two
areas together.
(12) Reforestation is a landscape treatment appropriate for detention
basins that are not highly visible or are located adjacent to areas of
native wood lots. Where reforestation is determined to be
appropriate by the Joint Land Use Board, tree sizes should vary.
Trees should be planted in groves.
A. Well-designed soft lighting of the building exterior shall be permitted,
provided that the lighting complements the architecture. The lighting
shall not draw inordinate attention to the building.
B. Parking lot, service area, and roadway lighting shall be provided by
freestanding fixtures designed to minimize glare to the street and
adjacent parcels. The type of fixture and color of lamping will be
§ 203-161 WOOLWICH CODE § 203-162

evaluated for their compatibility with existing streetlighting, the
architecture and natural site characteristics.
C. Freestanding lights shall be located and protected to avoid being easily
damaged by vehicles or vandalized. The height of such lights shall in no
case be greater than 15 feet, except for big box, large-format retail and
regional office/hotel commercial type uses, wherein the height of such
lights within the parking lots shall in no case be greater than 40 feet
and within rear areas of the building, exclusive of pad sites and service
areas, shall be no greater than 30 feet. All lighting shall be serviced
underground. [Amended 9-4-2012 by Ord. No. 2012-18]
D. Spotlight-type fixtures attached to buildings and visible to the public
are prohibited. Where lights along property lines will be visible from
adjacent properties or are adjacent to residential districts or uses, the
lights shall be appropriately shielded and shall have a maximum height
of 30 feet. [Amended 9-4-2012 by Ord. No. 2012-18]
E. The lighting for pedestrian walkways may include either cut-off or
exposed sources, but the height and intensity of the light must be
subdued. All lighting designs and installation are subject to Joint Land
Use Board review and approval.
F. All proposed lighting plans shall be accompanied by a point-by-point
plan indicating numerical illumination levels. The plan shall indicate
the average, minimum and maximum illumination levels and minimumto-
maximum illumination ratio for maintained footcandles. [Amended
9-4-2012 by Ord. No. 2012-18]
G. See the Public Spaces Plan for fixture options.
H. The use of string lighting in trees, up-lighting of trees or other special
effect lighting and after-hours lighting is permitted.
A. Restaurants shall be permitted to operate outdoor cafes on sidewalks,
including areas within the public right-of-way and in courtyards,
provided that pedestrian circulation and access to store entrances shall
not be impaired.
B. The design of sidewalk cafes shall be subject to approval by the Joint
Land Use Board. The following standards and guidelines are applicable
to sidewalk cafes:
(1) Allow for pedestrian circulation; a minimum of five feet of sidewalk
along the curb leading to the entrance of the establishment shall be
maintained free of tables and other encumbrances.
(2) Planters, posts with ropes, wrought iron railings, or other
removable enclosures are encouraged and shall be used as away of
defining the area occupied by the cafe.

(3) Extended awnings, canopies, or large umbrellas shall be permitted
and located to provide shade. Colors shall complement building
colors.
(4) Outdoor cafes shall be required to provide additional outdoor trash
receptacles.
(5) Tables, chairs, planters, trash receptacles and other elements of
street furniture shall be compatible with the architectural
character of the building where the establishment is located.
(6) Outdoor cafes shall not be entitled to additional signage, over and
beyond what is permitted for this use.
(7) The operators of outdoor cafes shall be responsible for maintaining
a clean, litter-free and well-kept appearance within and
immediately adjacent to the area of their activities.
A. Street furniture includes benches, waste containers, planters, phone
booths, bus shelters, bicycle racks, water fountains, potted plants and
planters, window boxes and bollards. The Public Spaces Plan provides
examples of desired vocabulary. Street furniture must be compatible
with the architecture of surrounding buildings, the character of the
area and other elements of the streetscape. Consistency in the selection
and location of the various elements of street furniture is critical for
maximum effect and functional usage.
B. The design of a building's related entrance areas, plazas or terraces
may vary, based on the intentions and needs of individual building
owners. At a minimum, however, building entrances shall be
highlighted with plant materials and paved surfaces.
C. In time, the need for varied forms of street furniture beyond signage
may arise. For example, introduction of a public or private transit
system may necessitate bus shelters. As such needs become formalized,
the developer must prepare a basic design vocabulary to cover such
individual needs consistent with the overall design program. Every
development shall include some or all of these community spaces: patio/
seating areas, pedestrian plazas with benches, window shopping
walkways, outdoor playground areas, kiosk areas, a water feature,
clock tower or other such deliberately shaped area and/or a focal
feature or amenity that, in the judgment of the Joint Land Use Board,
adequately enhances such community and public spaces. Any such
areas shall have direct access to a sidewalk network, and such features

§ 203-166. Screening of loading and service areas.
All loading docks and service areas must be sufficient to serve the business
being conducted on the parcel without using adjacent streets. No loading
and service areas shall be visible from any neighboring property or adjacent
street. Provision must be made for handling all freight on those sides of the
buildings which do not face a street. The recommended method of screening
should consist of walls and gates compatible in color and texture with the
building material, buffered by deciduous and evergreen shrubs and trees, so
as not to be visible from neighboring properties and streets. The joint use of
truck loading and maneuvering areas between on-site and adjacent off-site
complementary uses shall be maximized. Delivery and loading operations
shall not disturb adjoining neighborhoods or other uses.
§ 203-167. Solid waste and litter management.
shall not be constructed of materials that are inferior to the principal
materials of the building and landscape.
A. All outdoor containers shall be visually screened within a durable,
noncombustible enclosure, so as not to be visible from adjacent lots or
sites, neighboring properties or streets. No collection areas shall be
permitted between a street and the front of a building. Appropriate
landscaping shall be installed to form a year-round effective visual
screen at time of planting.
B. Collection areas shall be designed to contain all material generated onsite
and deposited between collections. Deposited material shall not be
visible from outside the enclosure.
C. Collection enclosures shall be designed of durable materials with
finishes and colors which are unified and harmonious with the overall
architectural theme.
D. Collection areas shall be so located upon the lot as to provide clear and
convenient access to collection vehicles and thereby minimize wear and
tear on on-site and off-site developments. Refuse collection and
recycling areas shall not be located within parking areas or required
landscaped buffers.
E. Collection areas shall be designed and located upon the lot so as to be
convenient for the deposition of material generated on-site.
F. An option to reduce the visual impact of the collection containers is to
store and compact material inside the building at the service area, thus
eliminating the need to screen containers.
G. Delivery, loading, trash removal or compaction, or other such
operations may be limited by the Joint Land Use Board between certain
hours where noise impacts at the lot line of any adjoining residential
property or district or otherwise exceeds Township and state
requirements. Also, an applicant shall provide an effective litter

fences or walls may be used to screen service and loading areas, private
patios or courts. Fences may be used to enclose playgrounds, recreational
areas, or to secure sensitive areas to uses, such as vehicle storage areas.
Fences shall not be located where they impede pedestrian or bicycle
circulation through or between site areas. If approved, all fences and walls
shall be designed as integrated parts of the overall architectural and site
design. All materials shall be durable and finished in textures and colors
complementary to the overall architectural design. No hedge, wall or fence
of any type shall be erected or maintained if it is deemed a safety hazard in
obstructing the view of motorists.
§ 203-170. Maintenance of improvements.

management plan, subject to Joint Land Use Board approval. Such
management plan shall be submitted with an application for final site
plan approval.
A. No open storage shall be permitted on any lot. No articles,
merchandise, products, goods, materials, incinerator, storage tanks, or
like equipment shall be kept in the open or exposed to public view, and
no accessory use should be constructed to permit open storage of
materials or goods on a lot. These requirements are not meant to
prohibit the outdoor sale of merchandise if designed appropriately in
the form of a garden center.
B. Nonenclosed areas for the storage and sale of seasonal inventory shall
be permanently defined and screened with walls and/or fences.
Materials, colors, and design of screening walls and/or fences and the

transformers, shall be screened and located at the side or rear of the
building and away from entrances. Recommended screening methods
include walls compatible with the building material, and a plant material
buffer utilizing a layered installation of shrubs, flowering trees, and ground
cover. Utility accessories such as boxes, meters and fire hydrants shall be
coordinated with the overall streetscape.
§ 203-173. Open space.
Projects in RC-1, RC-2, RC-3, RC-4 and AR-1 Districts shall provide an
adequate amount of open space, exclusive of detention and retention basins,
and developed for on-site conservation and recreation facilities to service
the needs of all employees and their visitors. The applicant shall submit
an open space plan showing the proposed land area and general location
of parks and any other land area to be set aside for conservation and
recreational purposes and a general description of improvements to be
C. Permitted surface materials for pedestrian multipurpose paths shall be
bituminous.
D. On-site pedestrian circulation systems shall be provided to meet the
circulation needs of on-site users. Such systems shall provide safe, allweather-

movement and shall be an integrated part of the overall architectural
and site design concept. At a minimum, sidewalks and/or pathways
shall connect focal points of pedestrian activity such as, but not limited
to, transit stops, street crossings, building and entry points, and shall
feature adjoining landscaped areas that include trees, shrubs, benches,
flower beds, ground covers, or other such materials.
E. Sidewalks shall be provided along the full length of the building along
any facade featuring a customer entrance, and along any facade
abutting public parking areas. Pedestrian sidewalks shall provide
weather protection features such as awnings or arcades when located
close to customer entrances.
F. Where appropriate, connections shall be made between on-site and
perimeter sidewalk and/or pathway circulation systems.
G. Pedestrian crosswalks shall be clearly delineated by a material different
from the surrounding road surface through the use of durable, lowmaintenance
surface materials such as pavers or scored concrete to
enhance pedestrian safety and comfort, as well as the attractiveness of
the sidewalk and/or pathway.
H. Permitted surface materials for crosswalks shall be pavers or stamped
asphalt.

made thereon, including a plan for the operation and maintenance of parks
and recreational facilities.
§ 203-174. Wildlife habitat.
The utilization of landscape planting to promote the creation and/or
preservation of wildlife habitat must take form at two levels. The first effort
is required in the areas referred to as "developed common open space."
This includes parks, playgrounds, backyards, walkways, etc. in which plant
material selected to satisfy the needs of the human population can also have
food and shelter value for bird and small game species. The second effort
lies in the protection of the habitat value of the undeveloped open space and
augmenting such habitat with plant material that further promotes food and
shelter values.
§ 203-175. Public safety.
§ 203-176. General residential standards.

permitted, provided they are constructed no more than 21 inches above
grade. In no case shall rear steps and landings in excess of 21 inches
high be closer than 15 feet to side and rear property lines. Property
owners may not alter existing property grade without Township
approval. The yard or patio shall be within an area enclosed by a
masonry wall, wooden fence, trellis or lattice, evergreen hedge, vines,
or some combination thereof. Rear walls, fences, or trellises may not be
closer than seven feet to the alley right-of-way. In case of walls, fences
or trellises, the height of such yard or patio enclosure shall be five feet
or seven feet high. Portions of fencing below five feet shall be of solid
material and above five feet in height must be made of a trellis or other
semi-transparent material and shall be suitable to provide privacy and
screen views of neighboring uses. Each upper-floor apartment dwelling
should be provided with a terrace consisting of a minimum of 64 square
feet, recessed inside the exterior building wall of the dwelling, or a
balcony of 72 square feet projecting on the outside of the building wall.
If a terrace or balcony is not provided for upper-floor apartments, each
dwelling shall be provided with access to a conveniently located
common space, park, or green with a minimum size equal to or greater
than the total of all combined balconies which should have been
provided to serve those residential units which do not have the same.
An additional 100 square feet of area per unit shall be included in the
common open space. Such additional space shall be designed to
accommodate hard surfaces, with places for grills, movable chairs,

Big Box Retail
[Added 8-20-2018 by Ord. No. 2018-13]
§ 203-184. Big box retail.
A. Goal: to provide locations for regional big box retail commercial uses
that are auto-dependent, that are single- or multi-use buildings and that
may or may not be on individual lots.
B. The following examples best embody the purpose, goals and objectives
of the big box retail unit:
(1) Photo 1.
(a) The addition of amenities such as fountains, squares and
plazas provides site identity as well as focal points for
customer use. The elements also act to reduce the harshness of
large parking lots often associated with big box retail.
(b) Scale of otherwise large buildings can be broken down through
the use of offsets in facades and rooflines, materials use and
arcades and other sheltered walkways.
(c) Signage should be integrated into the facade design.
(2) Photo 2.
(a) The playful use of signage can serve to break down the scale of
otherwise large buildings when integrated into the entire
architectural design of the building and used in conjunction
with vertical and horizontal building offsets, material changes
and orientation of horizontal and vertical elements.
(b) Over-scaled objects can serve as both whimsical sculpture and
safety bollards to protect pedestrians. The objects further
provide a playful dialogue on scale within the public and
semipublic spaces.
(c) Public entry points should be distinguished in the architecture.
§ 203-184 YOUTH SPORTS § 203-184
198:1231
(d) It is important to use architectural techniques to reduce the
perception that big box stores are horizontal buildings with
large blank walls. Creative use of materials, offsets and glass
will be required.
(3) Photo 3.
(a) Pad sites present the opportunities to establish a strong
architectural edge along Route 322.
(b) All vehicle circulation is internal to the site.
(c) Pedestrian pathways woven into the landscape are a key
design requirement.
(4) Photo 4.
(a) Parking lots constitute the largest public or semipublic space
in a big box center. Details associated with the use of
landscaping, textured pavement, wide sidewalks, textured
crosswalks, lighting and street furniture all serve to control
automobile speeds and to provide a safe and attractive
pedestrian environment.
(b) Arrangement of buildings into small countyards helps to
reduce the scale perception of big box buildings and makes
parking proximate to front doors of multiple tenants.
§ 203-184 WOOLWICH CODE § 203-184
198:1232
C. Size and scope.
(1) Zone acreage: 97.8 acres.
(2) FAR: 0.2 or approximately 900,000 square feet.
(3) The purpose of the zone is to provide the opportunity for a largeformat,
regionally based retail center that is attractive to national
chains and large anchor stores.
(4) Buildings are to be arranged in a manner that reinforces the Route
322 street edge while allowing for large parking fields.

ARTICLE XXVI
Regional Hotel and Office
[Added 8-20-2018 by Ord. No. 2018-13]
§ 203-185. Regional Hotel and Office.
A. Goal: to provide locations for everyday services necessary to sustain a
mixed-use regional community with general commercial and general
office locations that are quasi-auto-dependent, that are single-use
buildings and that may or may not be on individual lots.
B. Permitted uses:
(1) Hotels, extended stay conference centers.
(2) Offices for administrative, executive, professional, business sales,
government offices and similar uses, the normal attributes of which
do not involve the storage, exchange or delivery of merchandise to
the general public.
(3) Office of banks and loan associations not having drive-through
facilities for the transaction of business from motor vehicles.
(4) Public transportation stations and shelters.
(5) Utility facilities, including telephone, water, sewer, electricity and
gas.
(6) Wireless telecommunications towers and antenna located entirely
within an existing building or on the roof or side of a building or
attached to an existing structure.
C. Accessory uses:
(1) Flag poles; clock towers.
(2) Parking structures.
(3) Temporary building or yards for construction materials or
equipment, both incidental and necessary to construction in the
immediate area.
(4) Temporary construction trailers.
(5) Health and fitness centers accessory to hotels and for use by hotel
guests.
(6) Surface parking lots.
(7) Swimming pools on individual lots accessory to hotel uses.
(8) Walls and fences.
(9) Rental halls for meetings and social occasions accessory to hotel
uses.
§ 203-185 YOUTH SPORTS § 203-185
198:1243
(10) Restaurant, full service or fast food with no drive-through
accessory to hotel uses.
(11) Brewpubs, taverns and nightclubs serving legal beverages
accessory to hotel uses.
(12) Signage.
D. The following examples best embody the purpose, goals and objectives
of the regional hotel/office unit:
(1) Photo 1.
(a) Single-use hotel and office buildings sit in a parklike setting
where the quality of landscape features is a critical design
element.
(b) While largely auto-dependent, the size of parking courts should
be kept small and integrated into the total land scape concept.
(c) The oversize portico matches the building scale and is
appropriate for the grand scale of the regional hotel and office.
(d) Vertical scale is broken by two layers of horizontal banding.
(2) Photo 2.
(a) Stormwater features can be designed as an amenity such as a
lake and provide a community park setting to the wider
residents of the Township.
(b) The sophisticated use of materials such as glass and masonry
helps to mitigate the large massing of the building.
Approximately 60% of the facade is glass.
(c) The building is further broken down in scale by sitting the
building in an "L" shape with a glass corridor connection. The
"L" shape is an organizing element that helps provide context
to the public space, like a public square.
§ 203-185 WOOLWICH CODE § 203-185
198:1244
(3) Photo 3.
(a) The vertical scale of the building is broken by the use of three
layers of horizontal banding. The three alternating layers of
masonry, glass and masonry help define the base, the body and
the top of the building.
(b) Two-foot to ten-foot vertical and horizontal offsets further
mitigate the perception of a large monolithic building.
(c) Front yard parking is absent.
(4) Photo 4.
(a) Corner elements and roofline offsets provide architectural
interest and identify the location of the "front" door.
(b) The building facade is approximately 60% glass.
E. Size and scope.
(1) Zone acreage: 118.25 acres.
(2) FAR: 0.25 or approximately 1,000,000 square feet.
(3) The purpose of the zone is to provide for a hotel/office park.
(4) Buildings are to be arranged in a manner that reinforces street
edges.
(5) Maximum building height: 60 feet.
(6) On-street parking is not permitted on Route 322.
(7) Front yard parking is prohibited.
