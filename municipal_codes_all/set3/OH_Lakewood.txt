EDITOR'S NOTE
     The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification.  Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number.  For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06.  The code
and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding
the first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all
digits left of the decimal.  The section number appears right of the decimal. 
As another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number
is 113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
     This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in
allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion.  Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation.  Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code.  Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections.  For example, newly
created 575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be
placed in their logical position.
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section.  The history indicates the derivation by reference to either
its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that
time, or to its inclusion in any prior code.  Sections without histories
indicate that the section contains new matter which was ordained by the
Adopting Ordinance which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances.  It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections.  Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

specially assessed upon the owners of property in the city, shall be made
without the approval of council. Before property in the city may be specially
assessed for public improvements, council shall establish regulations
sufficient to require preliminary legislation declaring the improvements

   (b)   Council may by a two-thirds vote of all members specially assess the
cost of a public improvement upon affected property owners. However, if the
owners representing a majority of the foot frontage of the lots to be assessed
petition council for the improvement and assessment, council may approve the
special assessment by a majority vote.
5.9  MUNICIPAL INCOME TAX
   Any legislation providing for an increase in the rate of municipal income
tax charged on taxable income within the city, or providing for a reduction in
the resident income tax credit for residents of the city, shall not become
effective until council submits the legislation to the registered voters at a
primary or general election occurring more than 60 days after the passage of
the legislation, and until the legislation is approved by a majority of those
voting on the measure.
5.10  PROPERTY TAX LEVIES
   (a)   Taxation by Vote of Council. In any calendar year, taxes may be levied
upon the tax duplicate without a vote of the people for the current operating
expenses of the city, but no such tax shall be levied at a rate exceeding by

limitation allocated to the city on the 1938 tax duplicate. Except as permitted

municipal levies, council shall levy annually, without a vote of the people,
outside the constitutional and statutory 10-mill limitation and outside the
limitations provided by this charter, a tax upon all real and personal property

to the Ohio Police and Fire Pension Fund and to pay debt charges on securities
issued to support the fund.

other debt instruments by the city. Those franchises or other special
privileges given in connection with the issuance of bonds, notes or other debt
instruments by the city shall instead conform to any applicable provisions of
the state Constitution.
   (b)   No provision in this charter shall require the director of law to
prepare or endorse his or her approval of the form and correctness on bonds,
notes or other debt instruments of the city, when the city has engaged other
counsel as bond counsel to prepare and render approving opinions with respect
to these bonds, notes or other debt instruments of the city.

shall be assembled and filed with the clerk of council as one instrument.
Within 10 days after the filing of a petition the clerk shall transmit all the
papers constituting the petition to the county board of elections. The board
shall examine all signatures on the petition to determine the number of
registered voters of the city who signed the petition. The board shall return
the petition to the clerk within 10 days after receiving it, together with a
statement attesting to the number of registered voters of the city who signed
the petition. Upon receipt of the statement from the board of elections, the
clerk shall endorse upon the petition a certificate of the result by showing
the number of signatures required and the number of registered voters the board
has determined signed the petition.
   (e)   Additional Referendum Signatures. If the clerk's certificate shows
that the petition contains insufficient valid signatures in its support, the
clerk shall at once notify each member of the committee described in Section
9.3(b) by depositing the notice in the United States mail with postage prepaid
and by sending to an email address indicated to be sufficient for notice by the
member of the committee. The committee shall have 15 days after the notice of
insufficient valid signatures is sent to file petitions containing additional
signatures with the clerk. Within 10 days after the filing of these additional
signatures, the clerk shall transmit all the additional petitions to the county
board of elections. The board shall examine all signatures on the additional
petitions to determine the number of registered voters of the city who signed
the additional petitions. The board shall return the additional petitions to
the clerk within 10 days after receiving them, together with a statement
attesting to the number of registered voters of the city who signed the
additional petitions. If the signatures are still insufficient, or if no
further petitions have been filed, the clerk shall file the petition in the
clerk's office and shall notify, in the manner specified above, each member of
the committee of that fact.
   (f)   Procedure. If the referendum petition is found sufficient, or is
rendered sufficient by additional signatures as permitted in this section, the
clerk shall certify that fact to council and place the ordinance or resolution
on the next council docket for reconsideration. Council shall have 30 days
within which to reconsider and at its discretion repeal the ordinance or
resolution. If on reconsideration the ordinance or resolution is not entirely
repealed, or if council takes no final or other action within the 30-day
period, council shall submit the ordinance or resolution to a vote of the
registered voters. If a primary, special, regular municipal or other general
election is to be held not more than six months after the refusal of council to
reconsider the ordinance or resolution, provided the deadline imposed by the
county board of elections for filing ballot issues has not passed, the
ordinance or resolution shall then be submitted to a vote of the registered
voters. If no election is to be held within that time, council may submit the
ordinance or resolution to the registered voters at a special election not
sooner than 60 days after the receipt of the clerk's certificate by council and
not later than the next primary, regular municipal or other general election,
whichever of these elections comes first. If no other provision is made as to
the time of submitting the ordinance or resolution to a vote of the registered
voters, it shall be submitted at the next primary, regular municipal or other
general election.
   (g)   Ballot Form. The ballots used when voting upon any ordinance or
resolution proposed under this section shall state the title of the ordinance
or resolution and be in a form created by the county board of elections in
accordance with general law in order to determine whether the registered voters
are for the ordinance or resolution or against the ordinance or resolution.
   (h)   Majority Vote. If a majority of registered voters shall vote against
the ordinance or resolution that is the subject of referendum, it shall be
deemed repealed.
   (i)   Enactments not Subject to Referendum. Notwithstanding any provisions
to the contrary in Section
9.3(a), (k) or (l) or any other provisions of this charter, ordinances or
resolutions enacted for the following purposes shall not be subject to
referendum: to appropriate money for any lawful purpose; to create, revise or
abolish departments or to provide regulations for their governance; to
authorize the appointment of employees in any of the departments; to authorize
or otherwise affect the issuance of bonds, notes or other debt instruments of
the city; to authorize a contract for a public improvement or an expenditure of
money which contract is to be paid or expenditure is to be made, in whole or
part, from the proceeds of bonds, notes or other debt instruments of the city;
and to provide for the payment of operating expenses of any department of the
city.
   (j)   Initiated Legislation Subject to Referendum. Ordinances and
resolutions submitted to council by initiative petition, as provided in Section
9.2, and passed by council without change, or passed in an amended form and not
required to be submitted to a vote of the registered voters by a committee of
the petitioners, shall be subject to referendum in the same manner as other
ordinances and resolutions.
   (k)   Referendum of Measures Taking Early Effect. An ordinance or resolution
that under Section
2.12 goes into effect earlier than 40 days after its passage and approval by
the mayor, or the expiration of the time within which it may be disapproved by
the mayor, or its passage notwithstanding the disapproval by the mayor, as the
case may be, shall go into effect at the time indicated in the ordinance or
resolution but shall be subject to referendum in the same manner as other
ordinances and resolutions, except that it shall go into effect at the time
indicated in the ordinance or resolution. If the ordinance or resolution is
submitted to the registered voters and not approved, it shall be considered
repealed and any further action under the ordinance or resolution shall cease;
but the repealed ordinance or resolution shall be deemed sufficient au-thority
for payment under the ordinance or resolution of any expense incurred, work
done, or material or service furnished previous to the referendum.
   (l)   Acts Preliminary to Referendum Election. In case a petition is filed
requiring that a measure passed by council providing for an expenditure of
money or a public improvement be submitted to a vote of the registered voters,
all steps preliminary to the actual expenditure or actual execution of a
contract for the improvement may be taken prior to the election.
9.4  RECALL
   (a)   Recall Procedure.  Any elected officer provided for in this charter
may be removed from office by the registered voters qualified to vote for the
office as provided in this section. A petition demanding that the question of
removing the officer be submitted to those qualified to vote for the office
shall be addressed to council and filed with the clerk of council. The petition
shall be signed by registered voters qualified to vote for the office and equal
in number to at least 15 percent of the total votes cast at the last regular
municipal election for the office of the officer sought to be recalled, in case
the officer was elected by the voters of the entire city.  The petition shall
be signed by registered voters qualified to vote for the office and equal in
number to at least 25 percent of the total votes cast by the voters of the
officer's ward at the last regular municipal election for that office, if the
officer was elected to a ward position. The question of the removal of any
officer shall not be submitted to the registered voters until the officer has
served one year of the term during which the person is sought to be recalled
or, in case of an officer retained in a recall election, until one year after
that recall election.
   (b)   Recall Petitions.  Recall petition papers shall be procured from the
clerk of council. Prior to the issuance of petition papers, an affidavit shall
be made by one or more registered voters qualified to vote for the officer and
filed with the clerk, stating the name and office of the officer sought to be
removed. The clerk shall enter in a record maintained by the clerk the name of
each registered voter to whom the petition paper was issued and shall certify
upon each paper the name of each registered voter to whom the paper was issued
and the date of issuance. No petition paper issued under this section shall be
accepted as part of a petition unless it bears the clerk's certificate and is
filed as provided in this section.
   (c)   Signatures to Recall Petition. Each signer of a recall petition shall
sign his or her name in ink, and shall place his or her residence address on
the petition paper after his or her name. The signatures to any petition paper
need not all be appended to one paper, but to each paper there shall be
attached an affidavit by the circulator of the petition stating the number of
signers to that part of the petition and that each signature appended to the
paper is the genuine signature of the person whose name it purports to be, and
was made in the presence of the circulator.
   (d)   Filing of Recall Petition.  All papers constituting a recall petition
shall be assembled and filed with the clerk of council as one instrument within
30 days after the filing with the clerk the affidavit required by Section
9.4(b). Within 10 days after the filing of a petition the clerk shall transmit
all the papers constituting the petition to the county board of elections. The
board shall examine all signatures on the petition to determine the number of
registered voters of the city or ward who signed the petition. The board shall
return the petition to the clerk within 10 days after receiving it, together
with a statement attesting to the number of registered voters of the city or
ward who signed the petition. Upon receipt of the statement from the board of
elections, the clerk shall endorse upon the petition a certificate of the
result by showing the number of signatures required and the number of qualified
registered voters the board of elections has determined signed the petition. If
the clerk's certificate shows that the petition contains insufficient valid
signatures in its support, the clerk shall at once notify each person to whom
the petition paper was issued pursuant to Section
9.4(b) by depositing the notice in United States mail with postage prepaid and
by sending to an email address indicated to be sufficient for notice by any
person to whom the petition paper was issued.
   (e)   Supplemental Recall Petitions.  In the event the initial petition
contained insufficient signatures, it may be supported by supplemental
signatures of qualified registered voters signed in the manner required in
Section
9.4(c) appended to petitions issued, signed and filed as required for the
original petition within 15 days after the date of the notice of insufficiency
by the clerk. Within 10 days after the filing of these additional signatures,
the clerk shall transmit all the additional petitions to the county board of
elections. The board shall examine all signatures on the additional petitions
to determine the number of registered voters of the city or ward who signed the
additional petitions. The board shall return the additional petitions to the
clerk within 10 days after receiving them, together with a statement attesting
to the number of registered voters of the city or ward who signed the
additional petitions. If the signatures are still insufficient, the clerk shall
notify each person to whom the original petition paper was issued pursuant to
Section
9.4(b) in the manner described in Section 9.4(d). The final finding of the
insufficiency of a recall petition shall not prejudice the filing of a new
petition for the same purpose, provided that no new petition shall be filed by
any of the same persons within one year after the final finding of
insufficiency.
   (f)   Recall Election. If a recall petition or supplemental petition shall
be certified by the clerk to be sufficient, the clerk shall at once submit the
petition with a certificate to council and shall notify the officer sought to
be recalled of the recall action. If the officer whose removal is sought does
not resign within five days after this notice, council shall order and fix a
day for holding a recall election. Any recall election shall be held not less
than 60 nor more than 90 days after the petition has been presented to council,
whether at a primary, regular municipal or other general election or, if none
of these elections shall occur within 90 days after the petition has been
presented to council, at a special recall election called by council. The
recall election shall be submitted to the registered voters of the entire city
if the officer to be recalled was elected by the voters of the entire city, and
the recall election shall be submitted to the registered voters of a single
ward if the officer to be recalled was elected by the voters of a single ward.
The county board of elections shall publish notice and make all arrangements
for holding the recall election, which shall be conducted in all other respects
as are special municipal elections.
   (g)   Ballots.  The ballots at any recall election shall be in a form
created by the county board of elections in accordance with general law in
order to determine whether the officer whose removal is sought shall be
recalled from office.
   (h)   Succeeding Officer. If the incumbent officer is not recalled in a
recall election, he or she shall continue in office for the remainder of his or
her unexpired term, subject to recall except as provided in this charter. If
the incumbent officer is recalled in the recall election, he or she shall be
deemed removed from office upon the announcement of the official canvass of
that election, and the office shall be filled as in the case of permanent
vacancies, except that the recalled officer may not be appointed to fill the
vacancy.

superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)
101.06  CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern. (ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail. (ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation. (ORC 1.52)
101.07  DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)   Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended. (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective. (ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance. (ORC 1.49)
101.08  SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable. (ORC 1.50)
101.09  DISTRIBUTION AND CHARGES.
   (a)   If requested, the Clerk of Council shall deliver one complete code in
binder, including the Charter to the Mayor, one to the Judge and Clerk of the

department or division of the City, one to the Lakewood Public Library and

101.99  GENERAL PENALTY.

Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is

pursuant to Section

      (1)   Contracts for professional or technical services, including,

or other professional or technical consultants;
      (2)   Contracts for the services and work of a construction manager. As
used in this subsection "construction manager" means a person, firm or
corporation with substantial discretion and authority to manage or direct a
project for the construction, demolition, alteration, repair or reconstruction
of any public building, structure, street, highway or other improvement;
whenever the City intends to enter into a contract to engage a construction
manager, the Awarding Authority shall first advertise, in a newspaper of
general circulation in the County where the contract is to be performed, notice
of its intent to engage a construction manager, which notice shall invite
interested parties to submit proposals for consideration and which notice shall
be published at least thirty days prior to the date for accepting such
proposals; and the Awarding Authority may also advertise the information
contained in the notice in appropriate trade journals, as determined by the
Awarding Authority, and the Awarding Authority may otherwise notify persons,
firms or corporations believed by the Awarding Authority to be interested in
such engagement;
      (3)   Contracts which are determined by the Council to be necessary to
meet an emergency arising in connection with the operation or maintenance of
any City department or agency or any equipment, property, improvement or
facility of the City, including, without limitation, contracts for work,
services, construction, reconstruction, renovation on repairs;

political subdivision or district or authority of the State or any agency of a
political subdivision or a regional council of governments;
      (7)   Contracts awarded pursuant to Section
111.02 for the purchase or lease of computer hardware or software where the
Board of Control has determined that it is either impractical to award the
contract under competitive bidding procedures, or cost effective and in the
best interests of the City to award the contract without competitive bidding,
and, in such cases, the Board of Control has approved a form of the contract to
be awarded without competitive bidding,
      (8)   Contracts, including leases, which may be awarded under the
statutes, or rules promulgated thereunder, of the State without competitive
bidding;
      (9)   Contracts for such purposes which may be awarded without
competitive bidding under principles of the common law or case law of the

      (10)   Contracts under other circumstances, where the Council determines
that it is either impractical to award the contract under competitive bidding
procedures, or cost-effective and in the best interests of the City to award
the contract without competitive bidding, and, in such cases, Council has
approved a form of the Contract to be awarded without competitive bidding.
   (b)   As used in this section, "Awarding Authority" means:
      (1)   In the case of contracts awarded pursuant to Section
111.01, the Director of Public Works;
      (2)   In the case of contracts awarded pursuant to Section
111.02, the Mayor, the Director of Public Works, the Director of Finance, the

   (c)   Bids shall be opened by the Awarding Authority or his designee at the
time, date and place as announced in the notice to bidders, the newspaper
advertising or the specifications. The time, place, and date of bid openings
may be extended to a later date by the Awarding Authority provided that written
or oral notice of the change shall be given to all persons who have received or
requested specifications no later than ninety-six hours prior to the original
time and date fixed for the opening. The Awarding Authority or his designee
shall publicly read each bid. Each bid shall contain the full name of each
person interested in it and shall be accompanied by a sufficient bond or
certified check on a solvent bank that if the bid is accepted a contract will
be entered into and its performance properly secured unless the bid is for a
contract for the construction, demolition, alteration, repair or reconstruction
of a public improvement, in which case it shall meet the requirements of Ohio
R. C. 153.54.  If the work bid embraces both labor and material, such items
shall be separately stated with the price thereof.
   The Awarding Authority may reject any bid. Where there is reason to believe
there is collusion or combination among bidders, the bids of those concerned
therein shall be rejected.  Ohio R.C. 9.31, as it may be amended from time to
time, or any successor statute, shall be applicable under this section with
respect to the matter of the withdrawal of bids made in error.
   (d)   The contract shall be between the City and the bidder who is awarded
the contract. The contract may provide for liquidated damages for delays beyond
a specified date.  When, in the opinion of the Awarding Authority it becomes
necessary, in the prosecution of any work or improvement under contract, to
make alterations or modifications in the contract, such alterations or
modifications shall only be made upon the order of the Awarding Authority and
the approval of the Board of Control or the approval of the Board of Trustees
of Lakewood Hospital when the Administrator of Lakewood Hospital is the
Awarding Authority, but such order shall be of no effect until the price to be
paid for the work and any additional work or material, or both, under the
altered or modified contract, has been agreed upon in writing and signed by the
Awarding Authority on behalf of the City and the contractor.
   No contractor may recover anything for work or material because of any such
alteration or modification unless the contract is made in such manner, nor
shall he be allowed to recover for such work or material, or either, more than
the agreed price. Alterations and modifications to contracts may be made
without advertising and competitive bidding.
   (e)   The unit or lump sum price stated in the contract shall be used in
determining the amount to be paid and shall constitute full and final
compensation for all the work. Partial payment to the contractor for work
performed under the lump sum price shall be based on a well-balanced schedule
prepared by the contractor and approved by the Awarding Authority or his
designee who shall apportion the lump sum price to the principal features
entering into or forming a part of the work under the lump sum price.
   Partial payment to the contractor for labor performed under either a unit or
lump sum price contract shall be made at the rate of ninety percent (90%) of
the estimates prepared by the contractor and approved by the Awarding
Authority, provided that all labor performed after the job is fifty percent
(50%) completed, shall be paid for at the rate of one hundred percent (100%) of
the estimates submitted by the contractor and approved by the Awarding
Authority.
   (f)   At the time named in the contract for payment to the person, firm,
corporation, partnership or association with whom or with which it is made, the
Awarding Authority or his designee shall make a full, accurate, and detailed
estimate of the various kinds of labor performed and materials furnished under
the contract, with the amount due for each kind of labor and material and the
amount due in the aggregate. The estimate shall be based upon the actual
measurement of such labor and materials, and shall give the amounts of
preceding estimate and the amount of labor performed and materials furnished
since the last estimate. From the date of completion or either acceptance or
occupancy by the City, a sufficient amount shall be retained as additional
security for ninety days for the faithful performance of the contract, after
which time if the contract has been faithfully performed nothing shall be
retained.
   (g)   The estimates referred to in subsection (f) hereof shall be filed by
the Awarding Authority and a certified copy thereof delivered to the Director
of Finance. Unless otherwise provided in the contract or other documents
incorporated into the contract, all material and equipment shall become the
property of the City upon its installation or when it otherwise becomes a part
of the building, construction, alteration, addition or other improvement,
provided that the City reserves all of its rights and remedies against the
contractor or material provider under the contract and applicable law.
   All materials furnished and delivered after the job is fifty percent (50%)
completed shall be paid for at the rate of ninety percent (90%) of the invoice
value of the materials. The balance of such estimate shall be paid when the
material is incorporated into and becomes a part of the building, construction,
addition, improvement, alteration, or installation, unless the contractor does
not prosecute the work with diligence and as specified or intended in the
contract.
   When the rate of work and amounts involved are so large that it is deemed
advisable by the Awarding Authority, estimates and payments shall be made twice
each month.
   (h)   The general laws of Ohio pertaining to the State's prevailing wage law
shall be applicable under this section.
   (i)   The provisions of Ohio R.C. 153.59, to the extent appropriate to
application to the City, shall apply to persons, firms, corporations or other
entities (the "contractor") who contract with the City and the subcontractors
of such contractors.
   (j)   The general laws of Ohio pertaining to the award of any contract for
the construction, reconstruction, improvement, enlargement, alteration, repair,
painting or decorating of a public improvement of the City shall, to the extent
appropriate to application to the City,  apply under this section; provided
that:
      (1)   The provisions of the City's Charter, Codified Ordinances,
noncodified ordinances or resolutions, and administrative rules and actions
taken pursuant thereto shall prevail over the general laws of Ohio.
      (2)   Ohio R.C. Chapter 149 shall not be applicable to this section.
      (3)   Council may determine that the provisions of the general laws of
Ohio, currently Ohio R.C. 153.51 to 153.53, inclusive, requiring separate bids
for each trade or kind of mechanical labor, employment or business and
pertaining to performance bonds and specifications of sureties, shall not apply
to the City and its contracts.

      (2)   The Applicable Department shall have authority to conduct random

audit or the investigation of a complaint may result in sanction as outlined in
subsection (i) below.
   (b)   Any person including a Covered Employee who alleges that his or her

that a violation of this section has occurred by filing a charge of
noncompliance with the Applicable Department within 180 days of the alleged

oath, the name and address of the person making the charge, the name and

a Covered Employer indicates that the Covered Employer may have violated this
Chapter;

may have violated this Chapter.
   (d)     Any investigation shall be completed within thirty (30) days of the
occurrence triggering the investigation.  To the extent permitted by law, the
City shall not make public in any manner and shall retain as confidential all
information obtained as a result of the preliminary investigation.  At the
completion of the investigation, the Director of the Applicable Department
shall take one of the following actions:

Employer that it is probable that a violation of this Chapter has occurred,
initiate a complaint against the Covered Employer and schedule it for informal
methods of conciliation pursuant to Division (e) of this section.

of the Applicable Department of probable cause to believe that a Covered
Employer is in noncompliance with this Chapter, the Director shall attempt to
conciliate the matter.  The Director shall send out notice to the Covered
Employer(s), the affected Covered Employee(s) and to the FEWB with a time and
date set for the conciliation meeting.  The conciliation meeting must be

investigation, though for good cause shown it can be rescheduled.  If the
investigation resulted from a filed charge of noncompliance, a conciliation
agreement may not be entered without the consent of both the Covered Employer
and the charging party.  If the investigation was initiated by the Applicable
Department on its own, the Director has authority to enter into a conciliation
agreement.
   (f)     Hearing.  If conciliation does not result in a settlement of the
complaint, the Director of the Applicable Department shall appoint a Hearing
Officer to conduct a hearing on the complaint.  Any Hearing Officer shall be
either a member of Ohio’s Judiciary or an attorney licensed to practice law in
Ohio.  The Hearing Officer shall schedule a hearing with a 30-day notice of the
hearing provided to the Covered Employer, Covered Employee(s) or other charging
parties, if any, and the FEWB.  In conducting such hearings, the Hearing
Officer shall be empowered to subpoena witnesses, compel their attendance,
administer oaths, take sworn testimony and require the production for
examination of any documents relating to the complaint.
   (g)     After the conclusion of the hearing, the Hearing Officer shall
report his or her findings to the Director within fifteen (15) days.  The
Director may adopt, reject or modify the findings of the Hearing Officer. 
Within seven (7) days after receipt of the findings of the Hearing Officer, the
Director shall render a decision in the form of a written order which shall
include findings of fact, a statement as to whether the Covered Employer has
violated this Chapter and such remedial actions as the Director may order.  The
order shall be served upon the parties by certified mail within fifteen (15)
days of the date of the decision.  A copy of the decision shall be provided to
the FEWB.
   (h)     Appeals.  Any Covered Employer or Employee who objects to any
decision of the Director of the Applicable Department relative to enforcement
of this Chapter may appeal such decision to the Common Pleas Court or as
otherwise permitted by law.
   (i)     Sanctions.  Any Covered Employer found not to be in compliance with
the provisions of this Chapter, who has submitted false or fraudulent
information, or who fails to cooperate in an investigation or an audit pursuant
to this section, may be subject to one or more of the following sanctions
imposed by the City of Lakewood:
      (1)   Withholding of payments, either in whole or in part, until the
Covered Employer cures the default or is in full compliance with this chapter.

   No remedy set forth in this Chapter is intended to be exclusive or a
prerequisite for asserting a claim for relief to enforce any rights granted
under this chapter in a court of law.
   (j)     Retaliation and Discrimination Barred.  During the term of the
contract, a Covered Employer shall not discharge, reduce the compensation or
otherwise discriminate against any employee for making a complaint to the City
or otherwise asserting his or her rights under this chapter, participating in
any of its proceedings or using any remedies to enforce his or her rights under
this Chapter.  A person who believes he or she has been retaliated against in
violation of this section may file a charge of noncompliance with the
Applicable Department.  Such charge shall be processed, investigated and, if
necessary, conciliated and heard according to the procedure set forth in this
Chapter.  If, after a hearing, the allegations of retaliation are found to be
true, the Director of the Applicable Department shall order appropriate
sanctions, including the denial of the right to bid on future City contracts
for a specified time period, as provided in subsection (i) in this section.
   (k)     This Chapter shall not prevent the City or any person from
exercising any right or seeking any remedy to which that person might otherwise
be entitled, or from filing any complaint with any other agency or court of law
or equity.

determination on the application within ten (10) days and respond to the
applicant in writing, setting forth the reasons for the determination.

shall cause legislation to be drafted and acted upon by Council granting the
exemption.  At such time, the Director shall forward to Council along with the
recommendation all supporting documents and other materials, including those
supplied by the applicant for the exemption, as provided in the next section. 
If the exemption is recommended and Council adopts the recommendation before
the Service Contract is entered into, the legislation authorizing such contract
shall include a provision granting the exemption.
      (3)   Contents of exemption request.
         A.   Hardship Exemption requests shall include:
            1.   The lower wage to be paid by the Covered Employer;
            2.   A detailed explanation of how the payment of the Fair
Employment Wage will cause particular harm; and

than one year.

Code shall be allowed against gambling and sports winnings.

federal income tax purposes, a deduction equal to the amount of up to $600 of
income combined from lottery, gambling and sports winnings, and games of
chance, or a deduction of $600, whichever is less, shall be allowed, provided
that in no case shall the deduction exceed the amount of combined income from
lottery, gambling and sports winnings, and games of chance.  If said income is
payable to the taxpayer in more than one year, the deduction applies only in
the first year in which the income is received.
   (b)   On all income, salaries, qualifying wages, commissions and other
compensation earned and/or received on and after January 1, 1981, by
nonresidents of the City for work done or services performed or rendered within

compensation paid as a result of an employee leaving the service of an employer

place of business of the individual's employer is located outside the City and

individual.
         C.   The individual is not a professional entertainer or professional

employee of such a promoter, all as may be reasonably defined by the City.

an occasional entrant to the City performs services within the City, the
employer of said individual shall begin withholding the City income tax from
remuneration paid by the employer to the individual, and shall remit the
withheld income tax to the City in accordance with the requirements of this
chapter.  Since the individual can no longer be considered to have been an
occasional entrant, the employer is further required to remit taxes on income
earned in the City by the individual for the first twelve days.
      (3)   If the individual is self-employed, it shall be the responsibility
of the individual to remit the appropriate income tax to the City.

income paid to an C corporation shareholder shall be taxable in the following
manner:

the extent that it represents wages or net earnings from self-employment.

allocated or apportioned to the State of Ohio, the full amount of the
distributive share is taxable.

DETERMINATION OF ALLOCATION OF TAX
128.0701 METHOD OF DETERMINATION.
   Net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without
the boundaries of the City shall be considered as having a taxable situs in the
City for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same proportion as the
average ratio of:

personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession

property includes property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of
such property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by
eight.
   (b)   Wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the taxable period
to persons employed in the business or profession for services performed in the
City to wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the same period to
persons employed in the business or profession, wherever their services are
performed.  For tax year 2004 and subsequent tax years, wages, salaries, and
other compensation shall be included to the extent that they represent
qualifying wages.
   (c)   Gross receipts of the business or profession from sales made and
services performed during the taxable period in the City to gross receipts of
the business or profession during the same period from sales and services,
wherever made or performed.

under uniform regulations, be substituted so as to produce such result.

in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the City and the sales result
from such solicitation or promotion.
   (c)   All sales of tangible personal property which is shipped from a place
within the City to purchasers outside of the City regardless of where title

operations of the real estate from which such rentals are derived (whether so

other representatives) constitutes a business activity of the taxpayer in whole
or in part.  If it does not constitute a business activity, the income is
taxable simply as "other income".
   (b)   Where the gross monthly rental of any and all real properties
regardless of number and value, aggregates in excess of two hundred fifty
dollars ($250.00) per month, it shall be prima-facie evidence that the rental,
ownership, management or operation of such properties is a business activity of
such taxpayer, and the net income of such rental property shall be subject to
tax; in the case of commercial property, the owner shall be considered engaged
in a business activity when the rental is based on a fixed or fluctuating

case of farm property, the owner shall be considered engaged in a business

of such employer.

withheld is to be considered paid to this Municipality, whether or not the
employer actually remits the tax to this Municipality for purposes of
determining employee payments or credits.

interest, and penalty, jointly and severally, for failure to file the
employer's return or to pay the employer's tax, interest and penalty as

COLLECTION OF UNPAID TAXES AND REFUNDS OF OVERPAYMENTS
128.1701 UNPAID TAXES RECOVERABLE AS OTHER DEBTS.
   All taxes imposed by this chapter shall be collectible, together with any
interest and penalties thereon, by suit, as other debts of like amount are
recoverable.  All legal actions to recover municipal income taxes and penalties
and interest thereon shall be brought within three (3) years after the tax was

of omission of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of income subject to this tax,

(Ord. 71-10.  Passed 11-1-10.)
128.1702 REFUNDS OF TAXES ERRONEOUSLY PAID.
   (a)   Taxes erroneously paid shall not be refunded unless a claim for refund
is made within three years from the date which such payment was made or the
return was due, or within three months after the final determination of the
federal tax liability, whichever is later.  In addition, the following shall
apply regarding refunds of tax withheld from non-qualified deferred
compensation plans (NDCP):
      (1)   A taxpayer may be eligible for a refund if the taxpayer has
suffered a loss from a NDCP.  The loss will be considered sustained only in the
taxable year in which the taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and
property pursuant to the NDCP.  Full loss is sustained if no distribution of
money and property will be made by the NDCP.
      (2)   A taxpayer who receives income as a result of payments from a NDCP,
and that income is less than the amount of income deferred to the NDCP and upon
which municipal tax was withheld, then a refund will be issued on the amount
representing the difference between the deferred income that was taxed and the
income received from the NDCP.  If different tax rates applied to the tax years
in which deferrals, a weighted average of the different tax rates will be used
to compute the refund amount.
      (3)   Refunds shall be allowed only if the loss is attributable to the
bankruptcy of the employer who had established the NDCP, or the employee's
failure or inability to satisfy all of the employer's terms and conditions
necessary to receive the nonqualified compensation.
   (b)   Income tax that has been deposited with the City of Lakewood, but
should have been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by the City
of Lakewood as a refund but is subject to the three-year limitation on
refunds.  Income tax that should have been deposited with the City of Lakewood,
but was deposited with another municipality, shall be subject to recovery by
the City of Lakewood.  The City of Lakewood will allow a non-refundable credit
for any amount owed the City of Lakewood that is in excess of the amount to be
refunded by the other municipality, as long as the tax rate of the other
municipality is the same or higher than the City of Lakewood's tax rate.  If
the City of Lakewood's tax rate is higher, the tax representing the net
difference of the rates is also subject to collection by the City of Lakewood.
   (c)   Overpayments of withheld tax that have resulted due to incorrect
withholding of an employee by an employer, and are not due as a result of
excess withholding requested by the employee, shall be refunded to the
employer.  It shall be the responsibility of the employer, and not the City of
Lakewood, to refund such overpayment to the employee.  However, nothing in this
subparagraph shall affect the right of a nonresident employee to apply directly
to the City of Lakewood for refund of income tax withheld for days worked out
of Lakewood.
   (d)   Payments on delinquent amounts shall be applied in the following
manner:
      (1)   To unpaid tax, then to penalty and interest assessments, on a year-
by-year order beginning with the oldest year for which delinquencies are due.
      (2)   To the taxpayer's current estimated tax liability.
         (Ord. 71-10.  Passed 11-1-10.)
128.1703 AMOUNTS OF LESS THAN FIVE DOLLARS.

128.1902 TAX CREDIT.
   (a)   When the taxable income of a resident of the City of Lakewood is
subject to a municipal income tax in another municipality on the same income
taxable under this chapter, such resident shall be allowed a credit of the
amount of income tax paid on such taxable income to such other municipality,

chapter in the manner prescribed herein from the taxpayers, to keep an accurate
record thereof, and to report all moneys so received.
(Ord. 71-10.  Passed 11-1-10.)
128.2302 DUTY TO ENFORCE COLLECTION.
   It shall be the duty of the Administrator to enforce payment of all taxes

of this chapter, and is hereby empowered, subject to the approval of the Board
of Review, to adopt and promulgate and to enforce rules and regulations

unable to pay the full amount of the tax due.  Such authorization shall not be
granted until proper returns are filed by the taxpayer for all amounts owed by
him under this chapter.  Failure to make any deferred payment when due shall
cause the total unpaid amount, including penalty and interest, to become
payable on demand and the provisions of Sections

return which, after being signed by such person, may be received by the
Administrator as the return of such person.
   (b)   If any taxpayer fails to file a tax return which is required by this
chapter within the time prescribed therefore, or makes willfully or otherwise,
a false or fraudulent return, then the Administrator shall make in a reasonable
manner such return from his own knowledge and from such information as he can
obtain throughout testimony or otherwise.
   (c)   In any case where a taxpayer has failed to file a return or has filed
a return which does not show the proper amount of tax due, the Administrator
may determine the amount of tax appearing to be due this City from the taxpayer
and shall send to such taxpayer a written statement showing the amount of tax
so determined, together with interest and penalties thereon, if any.  Such
determination may be modified or amended based upon information or data
subsequently secured by or made available to the Administrator.  If the
taxpayer fails to respond to the assessment within 30 days, the tax, penalties,
and interest assessed shall become due and payable and collectible as are other
unpaid taxes, penalty, and interest.
   (d)   Neither the Tax Administrator's execution of a return nor the Tax

of limitations on prosecutions set forth elsewhere in this chapter.

persons subject or presumed to be subject to the tax or by any officer, agent
or employee of a person subject to the tax or required to withhold tax or the
failure of any person to comply with the provisions of this chapter or with an
order or subpoena of the Administrator authorized hereby shall be deemed a

any individual or any of the several groups specified herein is found to be
unconstitutional, illegal or invalid, such unconstitutionality, illegality or
invalidity shall affect only such clause, sentence, section or part of this
chapter and shall not affect or impair any of the remaining provisions,
sentences, clauses, sections or other parts of this chapter. It is hereby
declared to be the intention of Council that this chapter would have been

and any and all suits and prosecutions for the collection of such taxes or for
the punishment of violations of this chapter shall have been fully terminated,

   (a)   Significant and wide ranging amendments to ORC 718 were enacted by Am
Sub HB 5, passed by the 130th General Assembly, and signed by Governor Kasich
on December 19, 2014, and H.B. 5 required municipal corporations to conform to
and adopt the provisions of ORC 718 in order to have the authority to impose,

(Ord. 31-2015.  Passed 12-21-2015.)

has the same meaning as when used in a comparable context in laws of the United
States relating to federal income taxation or in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised
Code, unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning. If
a term used in this chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is
used in a comparable context in both the laws of the United States relating to
federal income tax and in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised Code and the use is
not consistent, then the use of the term in the laws of the United States
relating to federal income tax shall control over the use of the term in Title
LVII of the Ohio Revised Code.
   For purposes of this Section, the singular shall include the plural, and the
masculine shall include the feminine and the gender-neutral.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   "ADJUSTED FEDERAL TAXABLE INCOME," for a person required to file as a
C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation
under division (v)(4) of this section, means a C corporation's federal taxable
income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined under
the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows: 
      (1)   Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal taxable
income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the intangible
income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
      (2)   Add an amount equal to five per cent of intangible income deducted
under division  (a)(1)  of this section, but excluding that portion of
intangible income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition
of property described in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code;
      (3)   Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal
taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other
disposition of an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code;
      (4)   (A)   Except as provided in division (a)(4)(B)  of this section,
deduct income and gain included in federal taxable income to the extent the
income and gain directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of
an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code;
         (B)   Division (a)(4)(A)  of this section does not apply to the extent
the income or gain is income or gain described in section 1245 or 1250 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (5)   Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction in
the computation of federal taxable income;
      (6)   In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated
investment company, add all amounts with respect to dividends to, distributions
to, or amounts set aside for or credited to the benefit of investors and
allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal taxable income;
      (7)   Deduct, to the extent not otherwise deducted or excluded in
computing federal taxable income, any income derived from a transfer agreement
or from the enterprise transferred under that agreement under section 4313.02
of the Ohio Revised Code;
      (8)   (A)   Except as limited by divisions (a)(8)(B), (C)  and (D)  of
this section, deduct any net operating loss incurred by the person in a taxable
year beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
The amount of such net operating loss shall be deducted from net profit that is
reduced by exempt income to the extent necessary to reduce municipal taxable
income to zero, with any remaining unused portion of the net operating loss
carried forward to not more than five consecutive taxable years following the
taxable year in which the loss was incurred, but in no case for more years than
necessary for the deduction to be fully utilized.
         (B)   No person shall use the deduction allowed by division (1)(H)  of
this section to offset qualifying wages.
         (C)   (i)   For taxable years beginning in 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, or
2022, a person may not deduct, for purposes of an income tax levied by a

than fifty per cent of the amount of the deduction otherwise allowed by
division (a)(8)(A)  of this section.
            (ii)   For taxable years beginning in 2023 or thereafter, a person

doing business in the Municipality shall withhold from each employee an amount
equal to the qualifying wages of the employee earned by the employee in the
Municipality multiplied by the applicable rate of the Municipality's income
tax, except for qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under
Section
128.052 of this Chapter or division (d) or (f) of this section. An employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from
qualifying wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer directly,
indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the
qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee.
      (2)   In addition to withholding the amounts required under division (a)
(1) of this section, an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may also

         (A)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (b)(1)(B) of this section of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the last day of the month following the last day of each
calendar quarter.
         (B)   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the municipal corporation in the preceding calendar year exceeded two
thousand three hundred ninety-nine dollars, or if the total amount of taxes
deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf of the
Municipality in any month of the preceding calendar quarter exceeded two
hundred dollars. Payments under division (b)(1)(B) of this section shall be
made so that the payment is made to the Tax Administrator not later than

         (C)   An employer, agent of an employer or other payer may be required
to make payment by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of all
taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of the employee for remittance to the
Municipality if the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required
to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on  payments to employees under section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31. 6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation.  The
payment of tax by electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect
an employer's, agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as
required under this section. Once the threshold for remitting payment
electronically for federal purposes has been met, any accrued municipal income
tax withheld from employee qualifying wages earned within the Municipality
shall be remitted to the Municipality at the same time that the federal tax
withholding payment is due.
   (c)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and file
a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or other
payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator.

withhold municipal income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
   (e)   (1)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to
remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability
for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other
payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (f)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (g)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
   (h)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer shall
file a Withholding Reconciliation Return with the Tax Administrator listing the

other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section.  The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (j)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax on
tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (k)   A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this Chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section. At no time shall an employer withhold at a rate
greater than that of the Municipality. (ORC 718.03)
   (l)   No person shall be required to withhold the tax on wages or other
compensation paid domestic servants employed by him exclusively in or about

shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day.  For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         (A)   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         (B)   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         (C)   Traveling from any location to another location in order to pick
up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that has
been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished, processed,
remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
         (D)   Transporting or delivering property described in division (b)(2)
(C)  of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the
employee does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate
owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
         (E)   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (c)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (b)
(1)  of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
   (d)   (1)   Except as provided in division (d)(2)  of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (b)(1)  of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (d)(1)  of this section may elect to withhold tax
for that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer
paid qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)   If an employer makes the election described in division (d)(2)  of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (e)   Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section 128.03 of this Chapter. To determine
whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a taxable year, a Tax
Administrator may require the employer to provide the Tax Administrator with
the employer's federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year.
   (f)   Divisions (b)(1)  and (d)  of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
128.051 of this Chapter.

128.053 COLLECTION AT SOURCE; VLT.
   (a)   The Municipality shall require a casino facility or a casino operator,
as defined in Section 6(C)(9)  of Article XV, Ohio Constitution, and section
3772.01 of the Ohio Revised Code, respectively, or a lottery sales agent
conducting video lottery terminals sales on behalf of the state to withhold and
remit municipal income tax with respect to amounts other than qualifying wages
as provided in this section.
   (b)   If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the internal revenue service is required by section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall
deduct and withhold municipal income tax from the person's prize award at the
rate of the tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the video lottery
terminal facility is located.
   (c)   Amounts deducted and withheld by a video lottery sales agent are held
in trust for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is owed.
      (1)   The video lottery sales agent shall issue to a person from whose
prize award an amount has been deducted and withheld a receipt for the amount
deducted and withheld, and shall obtain from the person receiving a prize award
the person's name, address, and social security number in order to facilitate
the preparation of returns required by this section.
      (2)   On or before the tenth day of each month, the video lottery sales
agent shall file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality providing the names, addresses, and social security numbers of the
persons from whose prize awards amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount
of each such deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the
amount of the prize award from which each such amount was withheld, and any
other information required by the Tax Administrator. With the return, the video
lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax Administrator all
amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (3)   A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all receipts
issued under division (e) of this section and shall make those records
available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be
maintained in accordance with section 5747.17 of the Ohio Revised Code and any
rules adopted pursuant thereto.
      (4)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, each video
lottery terminal sales agent shall file an annual return electronically with
the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the facility is
located indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The video lottery sales agent shall remit electronically with
the annual return any amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not
previously remitted. If the name, address, or social security number of a
person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was
omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall
be indicated on the annual return.
      (5)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a video
lottery sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with
respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The information return shall show the total amount of municipal
income tax deducted and withheld from the person's prize award by the video
lottery sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent
shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of
each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
      (6)   A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit
the amounts deducted and withheld is personally liable for the amount deducted
and withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty
and interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
   (d)   If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video
lottery sales agent that purchases the video lottery terminals from the agent
shall withhold an amount from the purchase money that is sufficient to cover
the amounts deducted and withheld and any penalties and interest thereon until
the predecessor video lottery sales agent operator produces either of the
following:
      (1)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
      (2)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no amounts
are due.
   If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is
personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
   (e)   The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (f)   If a lottery sales agent files a return late, fails to file a return,
remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to remit amounts deducted
and withheld as required under this section, the Tax Administrator of a
municipal corporation may impose the following applicable penalty:
      (1)   For the late remittance of, or failure to remit, tax deducted and
withheld under this section, a penalty equal to fifty per cent of the tax
deducted and withheld;
      (2)   For the failure to file, or the late filing of, a monthly or annual
return, a penalty of five hundred dollars for each return not filed or filed
late. Interest shall accrue on past due amounts deducted and withheld at the
rate prescribed in section 5703.47 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (g)   Amounts deducted and withheld on behalf of a municipal corporation
shall be allowed as a credit against payment of the tax imposed by the
municipal corporation and shall be treated as taxes paid for purposes of
section
128.07 of this Chapter. This division applies only to the person for whom the
amount is deducted and withheld. 
   (h)   The Tax Administrator shall prescribe the forms of the receipts and
returns required under this section.

128.061 DETERMINING MUNICIPAL TAXABLE INCOME FOR TAXPAYERS WHO ARE NOT
INDIVIDUALS.
   "Municipal Taxable Income" for a taxpayer who is not an individual for the
Municipality is calculated as follows:  "Income" reduced by "Exempt Income" to
the extent otherwise included in income, multiplied by apportionment, further
reduced by any "Pre-2017 Net Operating Loss Carryforward" equals "Municipal
Taxable Income".
   (a)   "Income" for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the "Net
Profit" of the taxpayer. 
      (1)   "Net Profit" for a person other than an individual is defined in
Section
128.03(v). 
      (2)   "Adjusted Federal Taxable Income" is defined in Section
128.03(a)  of this Chapter.
   (b)   "Exempt Income" is defined in Section
128.03(j) of this Chapter.
   (c)   "Apportionment" means the apportionment as determined by Section
128.062 of this Chapter. 
   (d)   "Pre-2017 Net Operating Loss Carryforward" is defined in Section
128.03(ff)  of this Chapter. (Ord. 31-2015.  Passed 12-21-2015.)
128.062 NET PROFIT; INCOME SUBJECT TO NET PROFIT TAX;  ALTERNATIVE
APPORTIONMENT.
   This section applies to any taxpayer engaged in a business or profession in
the Municipality unless the taxpayer is an individual who resides in the
Municipality or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company, or
telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under Chapter
5745 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (a)   Net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a
taxable situs in the Municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation in
the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
   As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,
wherever the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from
which taxes are not required to be withheld under section
128.052 of this Chapter;
      (3)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (b)   (1)   If the apportionment factors described in division (a)  of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
         (A)   Separate accounting;
         (B)   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (C)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
Municipality;
         (D)  A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (a) of Section
128.19 of this Chapter.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (b)(1)  of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(a)  of Section
128.19 of this Chapter.
      (4)   Nothing in division (b) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
   (c)   As used in division (a)(2)  of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)   A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         (A)   The employer;
         (B)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (C)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (c)(1)(B)  of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (c)(1)  or (2)  of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
   (d)   For the purposes of division (a)(3)  of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal
corporation as follows:
      (1)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For the
purposes of this division, a sale of property originates in a municipal
corporation if, regardless of where title passes, the property meets any of the
following criteria:
         (A)   The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         (B)   The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from
a location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is
regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of
sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
         (C)   The property is shipped from a place within the municipal
corporation to purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the
taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the
solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (e)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in
which the property generating the net profit is located and the municipal
corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit
resides.
A municipal corporation shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate
accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this
division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
For purposes of the application of any net operating loss realized from the
rental of real estate, said loss is to be applied using separate accounting as
it relates to those properties within a given municipal taxing jurisdiction.
Common or shared expenses relating to rental real estate shall be allowed
equally among all rental properties.
   (f)   (1)   Except as provided in division (f)(2)  of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation
in which the real estate is located.  Net profit reported by the real estate
agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
      (2)   An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation.  The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section
128.08 of this Chapter.
   (g)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (j)( 11)  of Section
128.03 of this Chapter, by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has
apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that
is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to
that municipal corporation.  In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to
its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount
other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were
the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation. 
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.
   (h)   When calculating the ratios described in division (a)  of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (b)  of this section, the owner
of a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property,
payroll, and gross receipts of such disregarded entity. (Ord. 31-2015.  Passed
12-21-2015.)

   (a)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)   "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (a)
(1)  of this section.
      (4)   "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
section 4927.01 of the Revised Code.
      (5)   "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
section 5727.01 of the Revised Code.
   (b)   (1)   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the municipal
income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.
         (A)   The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with
the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under federal law.
         (B)   The election continues to be binding for each subsequent five-
year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing consolidated
municipal income tax returns under division (b)(2)  of this section; or
         (C)   A taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The
Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election period in
effect under division (b)(1)  of this section. The election to discontinue
filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (b)(1)  or (2)  of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (c)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that inter-
company transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has
been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of
net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is required to file a
consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year shall file a
consolidated municipal income tax return for all subsequent taxable years
unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from the Tax
Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a change
in circumstances.
   (d)   A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated municipal income tax return in
the same manner as is required under the United States Department of Treasury
regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the consolidated
federal income tax return required to be filed by the common parent of the
affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (e)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (e)(2), (3), and (4) 
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in section

income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears
in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for
"a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under division (a) of
128.03 of this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         (A)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
128.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (B)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
128.062 of this Chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group. The entity shall be subject to
taxation as a separate taxpayer on that portion of the entity's net profit or
loss not included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated
group and sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (A)   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
128.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (B)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (f)   Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section
128.062 of this Chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by sub-stituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (g)   Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (h)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may
continue to file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such
election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1,
2016.  (Ord. 31-2015.  Passed 12-21-2015.)
128.07  DECLARATION OF ESTIMATED TAX.
   (a)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's tax liability for a municipal corporation's
income tax for the current taxable year.
      (2)   "Tax liability" means the total taxes due to a municipal
corporation for the taxable year, after allowing any credit to which the
taxpayer is entitled, and after applying any estimated tax payment, withholding
payment, or credit from another taxable year.
   (b)   (1)   Every taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for
the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars. For the
purposes of this section:
         (A)   Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as paid
to the municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld in equal amounts
on each payment date. If the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all
amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as
paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (B)   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent

128.08  CREDIT FOR TAX PAID.
   (a)   When the taxable income of a resident of the City of Lakewood is
subject to a municipal income tax in another municipality on the same income
taxable under this chapter, such resident shall be allowed a credit of the
amount of income tax paid on such taxable income to such other municipality,
equal to fifty percent (50%)  of the amount obtained by multiplying the lower
of the tax rate of such other municipality or of the City of Lakewood by the
taxable income earned in or attributable to the municipality of employment or
business activity but, in any event, such credit shall not be applied to a rate
in excess of one percent (1%)  of the taxable income earned in or attributable

this section, taxable income shall include the distributive share of net
profits of a resident partner or owner of an unincorporated business entity.
   (b)   A claim for credit or refund under this section shall be made in such
manner as the Administrator may by regulation provide. In the event such

128.082 REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR QUALIFYING LOSS.
   (a)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation plan
described in section 3121(v)(2)(C)  of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   (A)   Except as provided in division (a)(2)(B)  of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (B)   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (a)(2)(A)  of this
section computed without re-gard to division (a)(2)(B)  of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (C)   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in division (d) of this section, a refundable
credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a municipal
corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during the taxable
year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the qualifying
loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each mu-nicipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the non-qualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (c)   (1)   For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (d)   The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation. (Ord. 31-2015.  Passed 12-21-2015.)
128.083 CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.
   A Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created
under section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the Ohio Revised Code to the same extent
that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are
employed in another municipal corporation, pursuant to Section
128.08 of this Chapter. (Ord. 31-2015.  Passed 12-21-2015.)
128.084 CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.
   (a)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
128.096 of this Chapter. 
   (b)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality.  To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in section
128.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (c)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
128.096 of this Chapter.
   (d)   Nothing in this section requires a Municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation.  Section 128.08 of this
Chapter regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail.

taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
128.092 of this Chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this
division conflicts with any provision in Section

with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize

      (2)   A person may notify a Tax Administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (A)   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The
Tax Administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         (B)   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation' s
income tax for the taxable year.
The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly explains
the person' s circumstances, including the location of the previous worksite
location and the last date on which the person performed services or made any
sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also shall include the
following statement: " The affiant has no plans to perform any services within
the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal corporation, or
otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation during
the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by the
municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered
a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with the municipal
corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal corporation's
resolutions, ordinances, or rules." The person shall sign the affidavit under
penalty of perjury.
         (C)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division ( n)( 2)
of this section, the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the Tax Administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (n) of this section prohibits the Tax Administrator from performing an
audit of the person.

section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (b)(2) and (3) or

   (a)   Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to the

withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
   (d)   The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,

   (a)   Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall automatically receive
an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax return.  The extended due
date of the municipal income tax return shall be the fifteenth day of the tenth
month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates.
   (b)   Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal extension for a
period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return.  The extended due date of the municipal income tax return

   (c)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that the tax
administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return.  If the request is received by the
tax administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the tax administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (d)   An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension of
the time to pay any tax due.
   (e)   If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G)  of section 5747.08 of the
Ohio Revised Code, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the
filing of a municipal income tax return.  The extended due date of the
municipal income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of the
state income tax return.

state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars or less. 
      (3)   If a taxpayer, who is otherwise permitted to do so under this
Chapter or under Chapter 718 of the Ohio Revised Code, intends to file an
amended consolidated municipal income tax return, or to amend its type of
return from a separate return to a consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's
consolidated federal income tax return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax
Administrator before filing the amended return.
   (b)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as
provided under division (b)(2)  of this section, the amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless the
applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
Section
128.19 of this Chapter  has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
   (c)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division within the period prescribed by division  (a)(2)  of this
section for filing the amended return even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars or less, no refund
need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set forth in
division (c)(2)  of this section, a request filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed within
the time prescribed in Section
128.096 of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division (c)(2)  of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. (Ord. 31-2015.  Passed 12-21-2015.)
128.096 REFUNDS.
   (a)   Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality, in accordance with this section, shall refund to employers,
agents of employers, other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or
withholding tax levied by the Municipality:
      (1)   Overpayments of more than ten dollars;
      (2)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten
dollars.
   (b)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing.  Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and/or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses. 
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (b)
(3)  of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If the Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund
request included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax
return, the Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the
amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and
instructions for requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
128.18 of this Chapter.
   (c)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (b)  of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)   The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only post-mark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (d)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
division (a)(4)  of Section
128.10 of this Chapter.
   (e)   As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in

reasonable alternative dates for the audit.
   (c)   At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by

taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers

   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting

examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter.  Upon written request by
the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (b)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice

records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's possession

was directed pursuant to Section
128.10 of this Chapter, in addition to any applicable penalty described in
Section
128.99 of this Chapter.

Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
128.10 of this Chapter.
      (3)   The penalties provided for under divisions (b)(1)  and (2)  of this
section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
128.99 of this Chapter for a violation of
128.15 of this Chapter, and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax
Administrator by law.

disclose such information except in accordance with a proper judicial order or
in connection with the performance of that person's official duties or the
official business of the Municipality as authorized by ORC 718 or the charter
or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax Administrator of the Municipality or
a designee thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received
under this chapter and other related tax information to the Internal Revenue
Service, the State Tax Commissioner, and Tax Administrators of other municipal
corporations.

Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (c), (g), and (h)  of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)   The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in
accordance with this Chapter.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax Administrator
and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."
   (c)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)   The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax Administrator
sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested. The effective
date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or one year
after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)   The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the Municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Ad-ministrator;
      (3)   The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the Municipality's income tax ordinance;
      (4)   If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)   The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)   The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (d)   (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of section
128.15 of this Chapter.
   (e)   If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section, the
opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)   The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to change
for any of the reasons stated in division (c)  of this section;
      (2)   It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (f)   A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (g)   This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (h)   An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared.  An opinion of
the Tax Administrator does not bind the Tax Administrator of any other
municipal corporation.
   (i)   A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (j)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under division (f)  may not be appealed.  (Ord. 31-
2015.  Passed 12-21-2015.)
128.17  ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (a)   (1)   The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code. 
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (b)   (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division.  A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (b)(1)  of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review. (Ord. 31-2015.  Passed 12-21-2015.)
128.18  LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (a)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio Revised Code
Chapter 718.  All powers and duties vested by ordinances in the Board of Tax
Review prior to the adoption of this section are hereby vested in this Board of
Tax Review with respect to tax years 2015 and earlier.
      (2)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members who
must be domiciled in the Municipality. 
   Two members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the
Municipality, and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with
the Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years immediately
preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the Mayor
of the Municipality. This member may be an employee of the Municipality, but
may not be the director of finance or equivalent officer, or the Tax
Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly involved in
municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the
Mayor of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of the administrative
official.
      (4)   Members of the board of tax review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Section
718.11(A)(4)  of the Revised Code. 
      (5)   A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place.  This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)   No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the board.
      (9)   A member of a Local Board of Tax Review shall not be appointed to
or serve on another such board simultaneously.
   (b)   Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (c)   Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the assessment
to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall be in
writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (d)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division
(c)  of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare
or waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer
may appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (e)   The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination.  The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's
final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (f)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review.  Such records are not public records
available for inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code.  For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing.  Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code.  For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing.
(Ord. 31-2015.  Passed 12-21-2015.)
128.19  ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (a)   (1)   (A)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties  and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            (i)   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (B)   The time limit described in division (a)(1)(A)  of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (c)  of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (A)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
128.18 of this Chapter.  That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the ag-grieved person filed the request
did not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any
part of that assessment.
         (B)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (b)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five per cent or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (c)   A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought within
the time limitation provided in Section
128.096 of this Chapter.
   (d)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal.  The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal. 
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
128.18 of this Chapter, of the Ohio board of tax appeals, or any court to which
the decision of the Ohio board of tax appeals has been appealed, so that the
amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than
the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's
assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as
provided by Section
128.096 of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division
(d) of this section.
   (e)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 31-2015.  Passed 12-21-2015.)
128.20  ADOPTION OF RULES.
   (a)   Pursuant to Section 718.30 of the Revised Code, the Tax Administrator
is hereby authorized to adopt rules and regulations consistent with this
Chapter to carry out the functions of the position.
   (b)   All rules adopted under this section shall be published and posted on
the internet.
(Ord. 31-2015.  Passed 12-21-2015.)
128.21  LIABILITY FOR NON-PAYMENT BY CONSTRUCTION  CONTRACTORS, 
SUBCONTRACTORS, INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS,  AND OWNERS.
   (a)   Any individual or entity that contracts or subcontracts, for any
portion of work on a construction project in the Munnicipality, (for purposes
of this section, hereafter "the contractor"), to another individual or entity
for the performance of construction work ("the subcontractor"), shall be liable
for any failure of the subcontractor to pay or forward for payment all taxes
required to be withheld or paid under provisions of this Chapter, together with
applicable penalties and interest for nonpayment as provided in Section
128.10 above. It is the intention to impose liability for non-payment of taxes,
and any applicable interest and penalties, upon the entire chain of
construction employment and contracting, from wage worker or independent
contractor up through each subcontractor, contractor, general contractor, and
even to the owner, except as that owner may be exempt under subsection (b)
herein, to ensure that income taxes on construction projects are paid as
required. Issuance of an IRS Form 1099 is not a defense, but may be evidence of
liability under this section.
   (b)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, the owner or owners of residential
premises and who also occupy those premises shall be exempt from liability
under this section if the total cost of the project at the residence is fifty
thousand dollars ($50,000)  or less and the owner or owners have obtained
written confirmation that the contractor employed for the project is registered
with the Municipality prior to the commencement of work.
   (c)   The Municipality will not issue any type of building, occupancy or
construction permit to any individual or entity unless first presented with
documentation from the Administrator that all taxes required to be paid or
withheld under this Chapter have been paid to the Municipality.
   (d)   The Municipality will not release draws for work performed on any
construction project undertaken by the Municipality to any individual or entity
working on such project until presented with documentation from the Tax
Administrator that all taxes required to be paid or withheld under this Chapter
have been paid and forwarded to the Municipality.
(Ord. 31-2015.  Passed 12-21-2015.)
128.22  FILING NET PROFIT TAXES; ELECTION TO BE SUBJECT TO PROVISIONS OF
CHAPTER.
   (a)   A taxpayer may elect to be subject to Sections
128.22 to
128.2215 of the Codified Ordinances in lieu of the provisions set forth in the
remainder of this chapter. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter,
upon the taxpayer's election, both of the following shall apply:
      (1)   The state tax commissioner shall serve as the sole administrator of
the municipal net profit tax for which the taxpayer as defined in 128.2201(c)
of the Codified Ordinances is liable for the term of the election;
      (2)   The commissioner shall administer the tax pursuant to sections
718.80 to 718.95 of the Revised Code, Sections
128.22 to
128.2215 of the Codified Ordinances, and any applicable provision of Chapter
5703. of the Revised Code.
   (b)   (1)   A taxpayer shall make the initial election on or before the
first day of the third month after the beginning of the taxpayer's taxable year
by notifying the tax commissioner and the City, on a form prescribed by the tax
commissioner.
      (2)   (A)   The election, once made by the taxpayer, applies to the
taxable year in which the election is made and to each subsequent taxable year
until the taxpayer notifies the tax commissioner and the City of its
termination of the election.
         (B)   A notification of termination shall be made, on a form
prescribed by the tax commissioner, on or before the first day of the third
month of any taxable year.
         (C)   Upon a timely and valid termination of the election, the
taxpayer is no longer subject to Sections
128.22 to
128.2215 of the Codified Ordinances, and is instead subject to the provisions
set forth in the remainder of this chapter.
   (c)   The tax commissioner shall enforce and administer Sections
128.22 to
128.2215 of the Codified Ordinances. In addition to any other powers conferred
upon the tax commissioner by law, the tax commissioner may:
      (1)   Prescribe all forms necessary to administer those sections;
      (2)   Adopt such rules as the tax commissioner finds necessary to carry
out those sections;
      (3)   Appoint and employ such personnel as are necessary to carry out the
duties imposed upon the tax commissioner by those sections.
   (d)   The tax commissioner shall not be considered a tax administrator, as
that term is defined in section 718.01 of the Revised Code and Section
128.03 (qq) of the City Codified Ordinances. 
(Ord. 4-18.  Passed 2-20-2018.)
128.2201 DEFINITIONS.
   If a term used in Sections
128.22 to
128.2215 of the Codified Ordinances that is not otherwise defined in this
chapter is used in a comparable context in both the laws of the United States
relating to federal income tax and in Title LVII of the Revised Code and the
use is not consistent, then the use of the term in the laws of the United
States relating to federal income tax shall have control over the use of the
term in Title LVII of the Revised Code, unless the term is defined in Chapter
5703 of the Revised Code, in which case the definition in that chapter shall
control. Any reference in this chapter to the Internal Revenue Code includes
other laws of the United States related to federal income taxes. If a term is
defined in both this section and Section
128.03 of the Codified Ordinances, the definition in this section shall control
for all uses of that term in Sections
128.22 to
128.2215 of the Codified Ordinances.
   As used in Sections
128.22 to
128.2215 of the Codified Ordinances only:
   (a)   "Municipal taxable income" means income apportioned or sitused to the
municipal corporation under Section
128.2202 of the Codified Ordinances, as applicable, reduced by any pre-2017 net
operating loss carryforward available to the person for the municipal
corporation.
   (b)   "Adjusted federal taxable income," for a person required to file as a
C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation
as described in division (D)(5) of section 718.01 of the Revised Code and
Section
128.03 of the Codified Ordinances, means a C corporation's federal taxable
income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined under
the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
      (1)   Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal taxable
income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the intangible
income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
      (2)   Add an amount equal to five per cent of intangible income deducted
under subsection (b)(1) of this section, but excluding that portion of
intangible income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition
of property described in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal
taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other
disposition of an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code.
      (4)   (A)   Except as provided in subsection (b)(4)(B) of this section,
deduct income and gain included in federal taxable income to the extent the
income and gain directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of
an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code.
         (B)   Subsection (b)(4)(A) of this section does not apply to the
extent the income or gain is income or gain described in section 1245 or 1250
of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (5)   Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction in
the computation of federal taxable income.
      (6)   In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated
investment company, add all amounts with respect to dividends to, distributions
to, or amounts set aside for or credited to the benefit of investors and
allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal taxable income.
      (7)   Deduct, to the extent not otherwise deducted or excluded in
computing federal taxable income, any income derived from a transfer agreement
or from the enterprise transferred under that agreement under section 4313.02
of the Revised Code.
      (8)   Deduct exempt income to the extent not otherwise deducted or
excluded in computing adjusted federal taxable income.
      (9)   Deduct any net profit of a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that net profit in
the group's federal taxable income in accordance with subsection (e)(3)(B) of
Section
128.2206 of the Codified Ordinances.
      (10)   Add any loss incurred by a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that loss in the
group's federal taxable income in accordance with subsection (e)(3)(B) of
Section
128.2206 of the Codified Ordinances.
If the taxpayer is not a C corporation, is not a disregarded entity that has
made the election described in section 718.01 (L) (2) of the revised code,  and
is not a publicly traded partnership that has made the election described in
section 718.01 (D) (5) of the revised code, the taxpayer shall compute adjusted
federal taxable income under this section as if the taxpayer were a C
corporation, except guaranteed payments and other similar amounts paid or
accrued to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member,
or former member shall not be allowed as a deductible expense unless such
payments are in consideration for the use of capital and treated as payment of
interest under section 469 of the Internal Revenue Code or United States
treasury regulations. Amounts paid or accrued to a qualified self-employed
retirement plan with respect to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former
shareholder, member, or former member of the taxpayer, amounts paid or accrued
to or for health insurance for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former
shareholder, member, or former member, and amounts paid or accrued to or for
life insurance for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder,
member, or former member shall not be allowed as a deduction.
Nothing in subsection (b) of this section shall be construed as allowing the
taxpayer to add or deduct any amount more than once or shall be construed as
allowing any taxpayer to deduct any amount paid to or accrued for purposes of
federal self-employment tax.
   (c)   "Taxpayer" has the same meaning as in Section
128.03 (tt)(1)of the Codified Ordinances, except that "taxpayer" does not
include natural persons or entities subject to the tax imposed under Chapter
5745. of the Revised Code. "Taxpayer" may include receivers, assignees, or
trustees in bankruptcy when such persons are required to assume the role of a
taxpayer.
   (d)   "Tax return" or "return" means the notifications and reports required
to be filed pursuant to Sections
128.22 to
128.2215 of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of reporting municipal
income taxes, and includes declarations of estimated tax.
   (e)   "Taxable year" means the calendar year or the taxpayer's fiscal year
ending during the calendar year, or fractional part thereof, upon which the
calculation of the taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income is based pursuant
to this chapter. If a taxpayer's taxable year is changed for federal income tax
purposes, the taxable year for purposes of Sections
128.22 to
128.2215 of the Codified Ordinances is changed accordingly but may consist of
an aggregation of more than one taxable year for federal income tax purposes.
The tax commissioner may prescribe by rule an appropriate period as the taxable
year for a taxpayer that has had a change of its taxable year for federal
income tax purposes, for a taxpayer that has two or more short taxable years
for federal income tax purposes as the result of a change of ownership, or for
a new taxpayer that would otherwise have no taxable year.
   (f)   "Assessment" means a notice of underpayment or nonpayment of a tax
issued pursuant to Section
128.2210 of the Codified Ordinances.
      (Ord. 4-18.  Passed 2-20-2018.)
128.2202 APPLICABILITY; TAXABLE SITUS; APPORTIONMENT.
   This section applies to any taxpayer that is engaged in a business or
profession in the City and that has made the election under Section
128.22 of the Codified Ordinances.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b) of this section, net
profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of the City shall be considered as having a taxable situs in the
City for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same proportion as the
average ratio of the following:
      (1)   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the City during the taxable period to the average original cost of all of
the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the City to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during
the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession, wherever
the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from which
taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
128.052 of the Codified Ordinances;
      (3)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the City to
total gross receipts of the business or profession during the same period from
sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (b)   (1)   If the apportionment factors described in subsection (a) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the City, the taxpayer may request, or the tax commissioner may require, that
the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion of the income of the
taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving one or more of the
following:
         (A)   Separate accounting;
         (B)   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (C)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
         (D)   A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the tax commissioner denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by subsection (a) of Section
128.2210 of the Codified Ordinances.
      (3)   The tax commissioner may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in subsection (b)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by
subsection (a) of Section
128.2210 of the Codified Ordinances.
   (c)   As used in subsection (a)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)   A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:

customer, client, or patient.
      (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the tax commissioner determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in subsection (c)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If
the tax commissioner makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the tax
commissioner's determination was unreasonable.
   (d)   For the purposes of subsection (a)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to the City as
follows:
      (1)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be

         (a)   The property is shipped to or delivered within the City from a
stock of goods located within the City.
         (b)   The property is delivered within the City from a location
outside the City, provided the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own
employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the City and the
sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
City to the extent that such services are performed in the City.
      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the City  shall be sitused to the City.
      (4)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the City shall be sitused to the City.
      (5)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the City based upon the extent to which the
tangible personal property is used in the City.
   (e)   Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the
sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the City in which
the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate agent or
broker shall be allocated to the City based upon the ratio of the commissions
the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate
located in the City to the commissions received from the sale, purchase, or
lease of real estate everywhere in the taxable year.
   (f)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under section 718.01 of the revised code, the taxpayer shall add the
amount that is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was
apportioned to the City. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to its
net profit that was apportioned to the City any amount other than the amount
upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were the amount related to
the stock option not exempted from taxation.
This subsection applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to the City under this
section.
   (g)   When calculating the ratios described in subsection (a) of this
section for the purposes of that subsection or subsection (b) of this section,
the owner of a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the
property, payroll, and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.

tax liability has been calculated and paid by the taxpayer.
         (Ord. 4-18.  Passed 2-20-2018.)
128.2204 FILING OF ANNUAL RETURN; REMITTANCE; DISPOSITION OF FUNDS.
   (a)   (1)   For each taxable year, every taxpayer shall file an annual

which the return relates.
         (B)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that
the commissioner grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for
filing the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the commissioner receives
the request on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due, the
commissioner shall grant the taxpayer's extension request.
         (C)   An extension of time to file under subsection (d)(1) of this
section is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the tax
commissioner grants an extension of that date.
      (2)   If the commissioner considers it necessary in order to ensure
payment of a tax imposed in accordance with Section
128.012 of the Codified Ordinances, the commissioner may require taxpayers who

the taxpayer authorizes the commissioner to contact the preparer or other
person concerning questions that arise during the examination or other review
of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only to provide the
commissioner with information that is missing from the return, to contact the

   (a)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)   "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under subsection
(a)(1) of this section.
      (4)   "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
section 4927.01 of the Revised Code.
      (5)   "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
section 5727.01 of the Revised Code.
   (b)   (1)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of
corporations may elect to file a consolidated tax return for a taxable year if
at least one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to
municipal income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of
corporations filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to
that taxable year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning
with the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the
reporting method is required under federal law. The election continues to be
binding for each subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to
discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under subsection (b)(2) of this
section or a taxpayer receives permission from the tax commissioner. The tax
commissioner shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under
this section must be made on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of
the year following the last year of a five-year consolidated tax return
election period in effect under subsection (b)(1) of this section. The election
to discontinue filing a consolidated tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under subsection (b)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)   When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under Section
128.22 of the Codified Ordinances, a valid election made by the taxpayer under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) of Section
128.063 of the Codified Ordinances is binding upon the tax commissioner for the
remainder of the five-year period.
      (5)   When an election made under Section
128.22 of the Codified Ordinances is terminated, a valid election made under
this section is binding upon the tax commissioner for the remainder of the
five-year period.
   (c)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated tax return for that taxable year if the tax commissioner
determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany transactions
have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a distortive
shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net profits to a
municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated tax
return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated tax return for all
subsequent taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written
permission from the commissioner to file a separate return or a taxpayer has
experienced a change in circumstances.
   (d)   A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated tax return in the same manner

of this section, corporations that file a consolidated tax return shall compute
adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
128.2201 of the Codified Ordinances, by substituting "consolidated federal
taxable income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income"
appears in that subsection and by substituting "an affiliated group of
corporation's" for "a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in
that subsection.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall make any
adjustment otherwise required under subsection (b) of Section
128.2201 of the Codified Ordinances to the extent that the item of income or
deduction otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or
consolidated in the computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall do one of the following
with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for that taxable
year:
         (A)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
128.2202 of the Codified Ordinances, exclude the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net
profit or loss is so excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a
separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise
be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (B)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
128.2202 of the Codified Ordinances, include the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net
profit or loss is so included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a
separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in
the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (A)   The corporation filing the consolidated tax return shall exclude
the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the consolidated federal
taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the purposes of making the
computations required in Section
128.2202 of the Codified Ordinances, exclude the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (B)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with Sections
128.22 to
128.2215 of the Codified Ordinances on the basis of the entity's net profits
that would otherwise be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of
the affiliated group.
   (f)   Corporations filing a consolidated tax return shall make the
computations required under Section
128.2202 of the Codified Ordinances by substituting "consolidated federal
taxable income attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit
from" appears in that section and by substituting "affiliated group of
corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (g)   Each corporation filing a consolidated tax return is jointly and
severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges, or other
amounts applicable under Section
128.22 to
128.2215 of the Codified Ordinances or Chapter 5703. of the Revised Code to the
corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any
portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated
group.

Codified Ordinances fails to pay any tax as required under Sections
128.22 to
128.2215 of the Codified Ordinances, or any portion of that tax, on or before
the date prescribed for its payment, interest shall be assessed, collected, and
paid, in the same manner as the tax, upon such unpaid amount at the rate per
annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the date
prescribed for its payment until it is paid or until the date an assessment is
issued under Section

income tax liabilities to all municipal corporations in this state for a
taxable year.
      (2)   "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's combined tax liability for the current taxable
year.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (b)(4) of this section, every
taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for the current taxable
year, on the form prescribed by the tax commissioner, if the amount payable as
estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars.
      (2)   Except as provided in subsection (b)(4) of this section, a taxpayer
having a taxable year of less than twelve months shall make a declaration under
rules prescribed by the commissioner.
      (3)   The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of the taxable year or on
or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the taxpayer becomes
subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)   The tax commissioner may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.
   (c)   Each taxpayer shall file the declaration of estimated taxes with, and
remit estimated taxes to, the tax commissioner at the times and in the amounts
prescribed in subsection (c)(1) of this section. Remitted taxes shall be made
payable to the treasurer of state.
      (1)   The required portion of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year that shall be paid through estimated taxes shall be as follows:
         (A)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half per cent of the combined
tax liability for the taxable year;
         (B)   On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five per cent of the combined tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (C)   On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half per cent of the
combined tax liability for the taxable year;
         (D)   On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the
taxable year, ninety per cent of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year.
      (2)   If the taxpayer determines that its declaration of estimated taxes
will not accurately reflect the taxpayer's tax liability for the taxable year,
the taxpayer shall increase or decrease, as appropriate, its subsequent
payments in equal installments to result in a more accurate payment of
estimated taxes.
      (3)   (A)   Each taxpayer shall report on the declaration of estimated
taxes the portion of the remittance that the taxpayer estimates that it owes to
each municipal corporation for the taxable year.
         (B)   Upon receiving a payment of estimated taxes under this section,
the commissioner shall immediately forward the payment to the treasurer of
state. The treasurer shall credit the payment in the same manner as in division
(B) of section 718.85 of the Revised Code.
   (d)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of estimated taxes, there shall
be added to the taxes an amount determined at the rate per annum prescribed by
section 5703.47 of the Revised Code upon the amount of underpayment for the
period of underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as
described in subsection (e) of this section. The amount of the underpayment
shall be determined as follows:
         (A)   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (B)   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the
date prescribed for that payment;

and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (D)   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety per
cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently due.
      (3)   All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as
taxes collected under Sections
128.22 to
128.2215 of the Codified Ordinances and shall be credited and distributed to
municipal corporations in accordance with section 718.83 of the Revised Code.
   (e)   An underpayment of any portion of a combined tax liability shall be
due to reasonable cause and the penalty imposed by this section shall not be
added to the taxes for the taxable year if any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least ninety
per cent of the combined tax liability for the current taxable year, determined
by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a municipal
income tax return for that year.

128.2209 ADDITIONAL PENALTIES.
   (a)   In addition to any other penalty imposed by Sections
128.22 to
128.2215 of the Codified Ordinances or Chapter 5703. of the Revised Code, the
following penalties shall apply:
      (1)   If a taxpayer required to file a tax return under Sections
128.22 to
128.2215 of the Codified Ordinances fails to make and file the return within
the time prescribed, including any extensions of time granted by the tax
commissioner, the commissioner may impose a penalty not exceeding twenty-five
dollars per month or fraction of a month, for each month or fraction of a month
elapsing between the due date, including extensions of the due date, and the
date on which the return is filed. The aggregate penalty, per instance, under
this subsection shall not exceed one hundred fifty dollars.
      (2)   If a person required to file a tax return electronically under
Sections
128.22 to
128.2215 of the Codified Ordinances fails to do so, the commissioner may impose
a penalty not to exceed the following:
         (A)   For each of the first two failures, five per cent of the amount
required to be reported on the return;
         (B)   For the third and any subsequent failure, ten per cent of the
amount required to be reported on the return.
      (3)   If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under Section
128.22 of the Codified Ordinances fails to timely pay an amount of tax required
to be paid under this chapter, the commissioner may impose a penalty equal to
fifteen per cent of the amount not timely paid.
      (4)   If a taxpayer files what purports to be a tax return required by
Sections
128.22 to
128.2215 of the Codified Ordinances that does not contain information upon
which the substantial correctness of the return may be judged or contains
information that on its face indicates that the return is substantially
incorrect, and the filing of the return in that manner is due to a position
that is frivolous or a desire that is apparent from the return to delay or
impede the administration of Sections
128.22 to
128.2215 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty of up to five hundred dollars
may be imposed.
      (5)   If a taxpayer makes a fraudulent attempt to evade the reporting or
payment of the tax required to be shown on any return required under Sections
128.22 to
128.2215 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the
greater of one thousand dollars or one hundred per cent of the tax required to
be shown on the return.
      (6)   If any person makes a false or fraudulent claim for a refund under
Section
128.2211 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the
greater of one thousand dollars or one hundred per cent of the claim. Any
penalty imposed under this subsection, any refund issued on the claim, and
interest on any refund from the date of the refund, may be assessed under
Section
128.2210 of the Codified Ordinances without regard to any time limitation for
the assessment imposed by subsection (a) of that section.
   (b)   For purposes of this section, the tax required to be shown on a tax
return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax paid on or before
the date, including any extensions of the date, prescribed for filing the
return.
   (c)   Each penalty imposed under this section shall be in addition to any
other penalty imposed under this section. All or part of any penalty imposed
under this section may be abated by the tax commissioner. The commissioner may
adopt rules governing the imposition and abatement of such penalties.
   (d)   All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as taxes
collected under Sections
128.22 to
128.2215 of the Codified Ordinances and shall be credited and distributed to
municipal corporations in the same proportion as the underlying tax liability
is required to be distributed to such municipal corporations under section
718.83 of the Revised Code.
(Ord. 4-18.  Passed 2-20-2018.)
128.2210 ASSESSMENTS AGAINST TAXPAYER.
   (a)   If any taxpayer required to file a return under Section
128.22 to
128.2215 of the Codified Ordinances fails to file the return within the time
prescribed, files an incorrect return, or fails to remit the full amount of the
tax due for the period covered by the return, the tax commissioner may make an
assessment against the taxpayer for any deficiency for the period for which the
return or tax is due, based upon any information in the commissioner's
possession.
   The tax commissioner shall not make or issue an assessment against a
taxpayer more than three years after the later of the date the return subject
to assessment was required to be filed or the date the return was filed. Such
time limit may be extended if both the taxpayer and the commissioner consent in
writing to the extension. Any such extension shall extend the three-year time
limit in Section
128.2211 of the Codified Ordinances for the same period of time. There shall be
no bar or limit to an assessment against a taxpayer that fails to file a return
subject to assessment as required by Sections
128.22 to
128.2215 of the Codified Ordinances, or that files a fraudulent return. The
commissioner shall give the taxpayer assessed written notice of the assessment
as provided in section 5703.37 of the Revised Code. With the notice, the
commissioner shall provide instructions on how to petition for reassessment and
request a hearing on the petition.
   (b)   Unless the taxpayer assessed files with the tax commissioner within
sixty days after service of the notice of assessment, either personally or by
certified mail, a written petition for reassessment signed by the authorized
agent of the taxpayer assessed having knowledge of the facts, the assessment
becomes final, and the amount of the assessment is due and payable from the
taxpayer to the treasurer of state. The petition shall indicate the taxpayer's
objections, but additional objections may be raised in writing if received by
the commissioner prior to the date shown on the final determination. If the
petition has been properly filed, the commissioner shall proceed under section
5703.60 of the Revised Code.
   (c)   After an assessment becomes final, if any portion of the assessment
remains unpaid, including accrued interest, a certified copy of the tax
commissioner's entry making the assessment final may be filed in the office of
the clerk of the court of common pleas in the county in which the taxpayer has
an office or place of business in this state, the county in which the
taxpayer's statutory agent is located, or Franklin county.
   Immediately upon the filing of the entry, the clerk shall enter a judgment
against the taxpayer assessed in the amount shown on the entry. The judgment
may be filed by the clerk in a loose-leaf book entitled "special judgments for
municipal income taxes," and shall have the same effect as other judgments.
Execution shall issue upon the judgment upon the request of the tax
commissioner, and all laws applicable to sales on execution shall apply to
sales made under the judgment.
   If the assessment is not paid in its entirety within sixty days after the
day the assessment was issued, the portion of the assessment consisting of tax
due shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of
the Revised Code from the day the commissioner issues the assessment until the
assessment is paid or until it is certified to the attorney general for
collection under section 131.02 of the Revised Code, whichever comes first. If
the unpaid portion of the assessment is certified to the attorney general for
collection, the entire unpaid portion of the assessment shall bear interest at
the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the
date of certification until the date it is paid in its entirety. Interest shall
be paid in the same manner as the tax and may be collected by issuing an
assessment under this section.
   (d)   All money collected under this section shall be credited to the
municipal income tax fund and distributed to the municipal corporation to which
the money is owed based on the assessment issued under this section.
   (e)   If the tax commissioner believes that collection of the tax will be
jeopardized unless proceedings to collect or secure collection of the tax are
instituted without delay, the commissioner may issue a jeopardy assessment
against the taxpayer liable for the tax. Immediately upon the issuance of the
jeopardy assessment, the commissioner shall file an entry with the clerk of the
court of common pleas in the manner prescribed by subsection (c) of this
section. Notice of the jeopardy assessment shall be served on the taxpayer
assessed or the taxpayer's legal representative in the manner provided in
section 5703.37 of the Revised Code within five days of the filing of the entry
with the clerk. The total amount assessed is immediately due and payable,
unless the taxpayer assessed files a petition for reassessment in accordance
with subsection (b) of this section and provides security in a form
satisfactory to the commissioner and in an amount sufficient to satisfy the
unpaid balance of the assessment. Full or partial payment of the assessment
does not prejudice the commissioner's consideration of the petition for
reassessment.
   (f)   Notwithstanding the fact that a petition for reassessment is pending,
the taxpayer may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the petition. The acceptance of a payment by the treasurer of state does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the petition.
   If upon final determination of the petition an error in the assessment is
corrected by the tax commissioner, upon petition so filed or pursuant to a
decision of the board of tax appeals or any court to which the determination or
decision has been appealed, so that the amount due from the taxpayer under the
corrected assessment is less than the portion paid, there shall be issued to
the taxpayer, its assigns, or legal representative a refund in the amount of
the overpayment as provided by Section
128.2211 of the Codified Ordinances, with interest on that amount as provided
by that section. 
(Ord. 4-18.  Passed 2-20-2018.)
128.2211 REFUND APPLICATIONS.
   (a)   An application to refund to a taxpayer the amount of taxes paid on any
illegal, erroneous, or excessive payment of tax under Sections
128.22 to
128.2215 of the Codified Ordinances, including assessments, shall be filed with
the tax commissioner within three years after the date of the illegal,
erroneous, or excessive payment of the tax, or within any additional period
allowed by subsection (a) of Section
128.2210 of the Codified Ordinances. The application shall be filed in the form
prescribed by the tax commissioner.
   (b)   (1)   On the filing of a refund application, the tax commissioner
shall determine the amount of refund to which the applicant is entitled. The
amount determined shall be based on the amount overpaid per return or
assessment. If the amount is greater than ten dollars and not less than that
claimed, the commissioner shall certify that amount to the director of budget
and management and the treasurer of state for payment from the tax refund fund
created in section 5703.052 of the Revised Code. If the amount is greater than
ten dollars but less than that claimed, the commissioner shall proceed in
accordance with section 5703.70 of the Revised Code.
      (2)   Upon issuance of a refund under this section, the commissioner
shall notify each municipal corporation of the amount refunded to the taxpayer
attributable to that municipal corporation, which shall be deducted from the
municipal corporation's next distribution under section 718.83 of the Revised
Code.
   (c)   Any portion of a refund determined under subsection (b) of this
section that is not issued within ninety days after such determination shall
bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the
Revised Code from the ninety-first day after such determination until the day
the refund is paid or credited. On an illegal or erroneous assessment, interest
shall be paid at that rate from the date of payment on the illegal or erroneous
assessment until the day the refund is paid or credited.
(Ord. 4-18.  Passed 2-20-2018.)
128.2212 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (a)   If any of the facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in
an annual return filed by a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under
section 128.22 of the Codified Ordinances and used to determine the tax due
under Sections
128.22 to
128.2215 of the Codified Ordinances must be altered as the result of an
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax return, whether initiated by
the taxpayer or the internal revenue service, and such alteration affects the
taxpayer's tax liability under those sections, the taxpayer shall file an
amended return with the tax commissioner in such form as the commissioner
requires. The amended return shall be filed not later than sixty days after the
adjustment is agreed upon or finally determined for federal income tax purposes
or after any federal income tax deficiency or refund, or the abatement or
credit resulting therefrom, has been assessed or paid, whichever occurs first.
If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal income tax
return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a consolidated
return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax return, the
taxpayer shall notify the commissioner before filing the amended return.
   (b)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. An amended return required by this section is a
return subject to assessment under Section
128.2210 of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of assessing any additional
tax due under this section, together with any applicable penalty and interest.
The amended return shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments from a previously filed return no longer subject to assessment that
are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal tax return.
   (c)   In the case of an overpayment, an application for refund may be filed
under this subsection within the sixty-day period prescribed for filing the
amended return, even if that period extends beyond the period prescribed in
Section
128.2211 of the Codified Ordinances, if the application otherwise conforms to
the requirements of that section. An application filed under this subsection
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal income tax return unless it is also filed within the
time prescribed in Section
128.2211 of the Codified Ordinances. The application shall not reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments that are not affected, either
directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax
return.
(Ord. 4-18.  Passed 2-20-2018.)
128.2213 EXAMINATION OF RECORDS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS AND PERSONS.
   (a)   The tax commissioner, or any authorized agent or employee thereof, may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any taxpayer or other person that is subject to Sections
128.22 to
128.2215 of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of verifying the accuracy
of any return made or, if no return was filed, to ascertain the tax due as
required under those sections. Upon written request by the commissioner or a
duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every taxpayer or other person
subject to this section is required to furnish the opportunity for the
commissioner, authorized agent, or employee to investigate and examine such
books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns at a
reasonable time and place designated in the request.
   (b)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer or other person that
is subject to Sections
128.22 to
128.2215 of the Codified Ordinances shall be open to the tax commissioner's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the commissioner, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The
commissioner may require any person, by notice served on that person, to keep
such records as the commissioner determines necessary to show whether or not
that person is liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax
levied by a municipal corporation.
   (c)   The tax commissioner may examine under oath any person that the
commissioner reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The commissioner may, for this purpose, compel any such person to
attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers, records, and
federal income tax returns in such person's possession or control. The person
may be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other
tax practitioner at any such hearing or examination. This subsection does not
authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.
   (d)   No person issued written notice by the tax commissioner compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal income tax returns under this section shall fail to comply.

is to be applied.
      (2)   Such documentation shall be provided in the form prescribed by the
tax commissioner.
      (3)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the tax
commissioner to enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to grant a credit, to
determine if a taxpayer meets the conditions of a tax credit agreement entered
into by the City and taxpayer under section 718.15 or 718.151  of the Codified
Ordinances,, or to modify the terms or conditions of any such existing
agreement.

order of withdrawal account as authorized in the Consumer Checking Account

coming lawfully into the possession of the City's Director of Finance.
   (d)   "Uniform Depository Act" means Ohio R.C. Chapter 135 and any amendment
or supplement thereto. Wherever any provision of the Uniform Depository Act is

129, such provisions are applicable only to the extent that they are not in
conflict with or inconsistent with the City's Charter and ordinances or
resolutions.
      (Ord. 44-85.  Passed 11-18-85.)
129.09  FINDINGS BY COUNCIL; INAPPLICABILITY OF AND INCORPORATION OF STATE
LAWS.
   (a)   Council hereby makes the following findings with respect to the
authorization and the establishment of the policies and procedures for the
deposit and investment of public moneys in the City's Treasury:
      (1)   The authorization and establishment of such policies and procedures
are powers of local self-government that may be exercised by the City through
its ordinances under Sections 3 and 7 of Article XVIII of the Ohio Constitution
and
Article One of the City's Charter; and
      (2)   The authorization and establishment of such policies and procedures
are in the best interests of the City and its citizens:
         A.    To provide a more efficient management of the City's moneys and
investments; and
         B.    To enable the City to earn a greater yield on its investments
and provide safeguards of the City's moneys.
            (Ord. 39-17.  Passed 6-18-2018.)
   (b)   lt is hereby determined that the Uniform Depository Act shall not
apply to the City, except as it may be adopted by reference under this chapter,
and further provided that Ohio R.C. 135.11, 135.17, 135.18, 135.181 and 135.19
shall apply to the City; provided that Ohio R.C. 135.181, providing for the
pledge of a single pool of eligible securities to secure the repayment of
public moneys deposited or invested, may be utilized by an eligible depository
in lieu of the pledging requirements prescribed in Ohio R. C. 135.18, only if
the Director of Finance, at his or her option, consents in writing to the use
of such Section 135.181; however, it is further provided that the Director of
Finance with respect to deposits or investments, in his or her discretion, may
require additional security and provisions for pledging and perfecting liens
and enforcement of liens on behalf of the City which are in addition to or in
lieu of some or all of the provisions of Ohio R.C. 135.18 or 135.181. The
failure or refusal of an eligible depository to accept or conform to such
option or additional security or provisions shall constitute good cause for the
Director of Finance to terminate, at his or her discretion, and without
liability, any depository agreement or any executory contract to make an
investment. The exercise by the Director of Finance of his or her discretionary
option to allow the use of Ohio R.C. 135.181, shall not give rise to the
personal liability of the Director of Finance in the event of any loss of
public moneys deposited or invested and secured pursuant to such Section
135.181.
   (c)   Ohio R.C. 731.56 to 731.59, inclusive, shall not apply to the City,
except as  Ohio R.C. 731.59 is incorporated in part in Section
129.101(h) of this chapter and except as other provisions of such sections are
incorporated in this chapter.
   (d)   It is hereby determined that the provisions of this chapter and the
Uniform  Depository Act shall not apply to the deposit or investment of funds
authorized by an ordinance or a trust indenture pertaining to the authorization
of general obligation bonds or special obligation bonds, including revenue
bonds and mortgage revenue bonds, or notes in anticipation of such bonds. 
(Ord. 44-85.  Passed 11-18-85.)
129.10  DEPOSITORIES.
   (a)   The Director of Finance shall determine the amount of public moneys
which shall be available in active deposits to provide the needed cash flow to
pay warrants and checks issued and outstanding, and to provide for a reasonable
surplus in addition to the amount needed to pay such warrants and checks, and
maximize the interest received on public moneys of the City. Interest on active
deposits shall be paid or credited by the City’s designated eligible
depositories at least quarterly and when funds are withdrawn, computing the
time of payment from the date of deposit.  No service charge shall be made by a
designated eligible depository against an active deposit or collected from or
paid by the Director of Finance unless such service charge is the same as is
customarily imposed by institutions receiving money on deposit, subject to
check, in which event the Director of Finance may pay such charge.  All public
moneys of the City not deposited in active deposits shall be invested pursuant
to Section
129.101.
   (b)   The Director of Finance shall, by a writing filed with the Clerk of
Council, designate one or more eligible depositories as the depository or
depositories of the City’s active deposits.  When more than one eligible
depository is designated, the active deposits shall be allocated among the
eligible depositories from time to time at the sole discretion of the Director
of Finance.  The Director of Finance shall consider the following in making the

the depository; and
      (4)   Any other terms or conditions with respect to the depository s
acceptance of the City’s active deposits.
   (c)   The initial designation of depositories for the City’s active deposits
shall be for a period not to exceed six months and shall be made without giving
the notice hereinafter provided for.  Subsequent designations of depositories
for the City’s active deposits shall be for a period specified in the Director
of Finance’s written designation of depositories pursuant to subsection (b)
hereof, which period shall not be less than six months nor longer than five
years; and shall be made after the Director of Finance has provided written
notice by first-class mail to the eligible depositories having an office in the
City, and such other eligible depositories as determined by the Director of
Finance, at least sixty days prior to the date of the action of the Director of
Finance designating depositories for the City’s active deposits.  Such notice
shall:  provide an estimate of the maximum amount of such active deposits at
any time during the period of designation and the proposed period of
designation or alternative proposed periods of designation; request such
depositories to apply in writing for all or part of the City’s active deposits
on or before a date and time specified in the notice; request such depositories
to state in their application the amount of such active deposits that will be
accepted by it; the rate or rates of interest, if any, that will be paid on
such active deposits; the service charges, if any, that will be made for its
services, other terms or conditions with respect to the depository’s acceptance
of all or part of the City’s active deposits and the location of its offices in
the City or, if none are located in the City, the location of its nearest
offices, and include or request any other information to or from such
depositories which the Director of Finance deems relevant.

   (d)   The Director of Finance shall enter into a contract, approved as to
form and content by the Director of Law, with such depositories for the
appropriate period determinated pursuant to subsection (c) hereof.  Such
contract shall establish the rate or rates of interest, if any, to be paid by
the depository on the City’s active deposits, the service charges, if any, the
depository may make for its services, and other terms or conditions of the
depository’s acceptance of the City’s active deposits.
   (e)   The limitations on the aggregate amounts of public moneys that may be
on deposit with eligible depositories as set forth in the Uniform Depository
Act shall apply under this chapter.

131.01  PROVISION, ALTERATION, DEDICATION AND VACATION OF STREETS.
   (a)   Council shall provide for the care, supervision, control and
improvement of public highways, streets, avenues, alleys, sidewalks, public
grounds, bridges, aqueducts and viaducts within the City. The Director of
Public Works shall have supervision of these matters in accordance with Section
123.03.
   (b)   When it deems it necessary, Council may cause any street, alley or
public highway to be opened, straightened, altered, diverted, narrowed or
widened.  No street or alley dedicated to public use by the proprietor of
ground in the City shall be deemed a public street or alley, or under the care
or control of Council unless the dedication is accepted and confirmed by an
ordinance passed for such purpose.
   (c)   Council, when vacating any street or part of street or changing the
name of any street, may include in one ordinance the change of name or the
vacation or narrowing of more than one street, avenue, or alley, but before
vacating any street or part thereof, or narrowing any street, Council shall
first adopt a resolution declaring its intention so to do. The Clerk of Council
shall cause notice of such declaration to be served in the manner that the
service of summons is required to be made upon all persons whose property abuts
upon the part of the street affected by the proposed vacation or narrowing, and
by publication on the official website of the City. That notice shall state the
time and place when objections can be heard before the Board of Revision of
Assessments. Upon the report of the Board of Revision of Assessments approving
the proposed vacation or narrowing Council may by ordinance declare such
vacation or narrowing, and such order of Council vacating or narrowing a street
or alley which has been dedicated to public use by the proprietor shall, to the
extent to which it is vacated or narrowed, operate as a revocation of the
acceptance thereof by Council, but the right of way and easement therein of any
lot owner shall not be impaired thereby. 
(Ord. 5-18.  Passed 6-18-2018.)
131.02  BOARD OF REVISION OF ASSESSMENTS.
   The Board of Revision of Assessments shall consist of the Mayor, Director of
Law, the Director of Finance, the Director of Public Works and the President of
Council. The Mayor shall be the president of the board and the Director of
Finance shall be the secretary thereof.  The board shall meet at such times and
place as is provided by its rules, and shall hear all matters coming before it
un-der the authority of the Charter and Code.
(Ord. 5-18.  Passed 6-18-2018.)
131.03  FRANCHISES.
   (a)   Grant.  Council may grant permission to any individual, company or
corporation to construct and operate a public utility in the streets and public
grounds of the City. It may prescribe the kind and quality of service or the
product to be furnished, the rate or rates to be charged therefor, and any
terms and conditions conducive to the public interest; and also the manner in
which the streets and public grounds shall be used and occupied. Such grant or
any amendment or renewal thereof shall be for such period of time as Council
may determine, but it
shall not exceed a period of 25 years.
   (b)   Renewals. Council may renew any grant for the construction or
operation of any utility, at its expiration, upon such tetms as may be
conducive to the public interest. All such grants and renewals thereof may
reserve to the City the right to purchase all the property of the utility in
the streets and highways and elsewhere used in, or useful for, the operation of
the utility, at a price either fixed by ordinance, or to be fixed in the manner
provided by the ordinance making the grant or renewal of the grant. Nothing in
such ordinance shall prevent the City from acquiring the property of any such
utility by condemnation proceedings or in any other lawful mode; but all such
methods of acquisition shall be alternative to the power to purchase, reserved
in the grant or renewal as hereinbefore provided. No ordinance making such
purchase shall be valid unless it shall expressly provide therein that the
price to be paid by the City for the property that may be acquired by it from
such utility by purchase, condemnation or otherwise, shall exclude all value of
such grant or renewal. Upon the acquisition by the City of the property of any
utility by purchase, condemnation or otherwise, all grants or renewals shall at
once terminate.
   (c)   Extension. Council may grant to any individual, company or corporation
operating a public utility, the right to extend the appliances and service of
such utility. All such extensions shall become a part of the aggregate property
of the utility, and shall be subject to all the obligations and reserved rights
applicable to the property of the utility by virtue of the ordinance providing
for its construction and operation. The right to use and maintain any such
extension shall expire with the original grant of the utility to which the
extension was made or any renewal thereof.
   (d)   Consents. No consent of the owner of property abutting on any highway
or public ground shall be required by Council as a condition of its authority
to authorize the construction, extension, maintenance or operation of any
public utility by original grant or renewal.
   (e)   Regulations. All rights granted for the construction and operation of
public utilities in the City shall be subject to both the additional, more
specific regulations found within the Code and the continuing right of Council
to require such reconstruction, relocation, change or discontinuance of the
appliances used by the utility in the streets, alleys, avenues, and highways of
the City, as shall in the opinion of Council be necessary in the public
interest. In ordering any such reconstruction, relocation, change or
discontinuance Council shall provide for such alteration in the rates for
service and in the terms upon which purchase is authorized to be made by the
City, as shall be necessary or equitable to protect the owner of the utility
against loss of property value.

   In the event a member's customary day off, or that of other uniformed

empowered to so find and declare and to thereupon require members to work
forty-eight hours per calendar week and on holidays without allowance for time
off for overtime.
   Any such action shall become effective upon the posting on the bulletin
board in police headquarters of a notice signed by the Mayor and shall continue
until notice of termination is similarly posted. In case of any such action,

Council at its next regular meeting.
(Ord. 4691.  Passed 6-19-1950.)
135.04  ENFORCEMENT OF DISCIPLINE; OVERTIME COMPENSATION.
   Nothing hereinabove set forth or in Chapter 149 shall be construed to

for overtime.

   (c)   Rate of Pay; Exceptions.  Traffic guards shall be paid at their hourly
rate only for time actually worked, unless otherwise provided for by ordinance.

Catholic Diocese, as a result of inclement weather or other emergency
condition, suspends classes for the school system or any portion thereof and,

      (2)   During the spring (Easter) and winter (Christmas) school breaks,
all regularly assigned traffic guards who have been continuously employed for

Safety and the approval of Council, shall pay to the surviving spouse of the

ninety days as if the traffic guard were working his assigned crossing. If not
regularly assigned to a specific crossing, he shall be paid for a minimum of
three hours per each scheduled work day.
      (2)   In the event of any accidental death payment pursuant to this
subsection, the City shall be subrogated to all the traffic guard's rights of
recovery therefor against any person or organization, and the representative of
the estate of such traffic guard shall execute and deliver instruments and
papers and shall do whatever else is necessary to secure such rights.

in the nature of local improvements, and to provide for the payment of any part
of the cost of any such improvement by levying and collecting special
assessments upon abutting, adjacent and contiguous or other specially
benefitted property. The amount assessed against the property specially
benefitted to pay for such local improvements shall not exceed the amount of
benefits accruing to such property. Any cost for such improvement in excess of
any sum assessed therefor shall be paid by the City.
(Ord. 20-18.  Passed 6-18-2018.)
141.02  METHODS OF SPECIAL ASSESSMENT.
   Special assessments upon property deemed benefitted by a public improvement,
shall be by any one of the following methods:
   (a)   By a percentage of the tax value of the property assessed;

   (c)   By the foot frontage of the property bounding and abutting upon the
improvement.
      (Ord. 20-18.  Passed 6-18-2018.)
141.03  PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENTS.
   When it is deemed necessary to make a public improvement to be paid for in
whole or in part by special assessment, Council shall declare the necessity
thereof by resolution, and such resolution shall include the method of
assessment, the mode of payment, and the number of annual installments. Such
resolution shall thereupon be certified to the Director of Finance, who shall
thereupon proceed to make an assessment report, in accordance with the method
of assessment provided in the resolution, which report shall be filed with
Council, and shall show the lots and lands assessed, and the amount of the
assessment as to each. Such special assessment shall be payable in such number
of annual installments and at such times as the legislative authority
prescribes, provided that the number of annual installments of any assessment
shall not exceed the maximum maturity for which bonds may lawfully be issued in
anticipation thereof. If no period of such maximum maturity is specified then
the period for which such assessments shall be levied shall not be less than
one year, but may not exceed the estimated life of the usefulness of the
improvement as certified by the Director of Finance.
(Ord. 20-18.  Passed 6-18-2018.)
141.04  NOTICES SERVED.
   Upon the filing of such report the Director of Finance shall cause written
notice to be served upon the owner of each lot or parcel of land assessed, or
upon the persons in whose name the same may be assessed for taxation upon the
tax duplicate, said notice to be served as is provided for service of summons
in civil actions; and as to all nonresidents and persons who cannot be found,
publication of such notice shall be as prescribed in Chapter
107. Said notice shall contain a statement of the character of the proposed
improvement, the fact that the assessment report has been filed with Council,
the rate of such assessments, the number of installments, and shall set a time
and place when complaints and claims will be heard before the Board of Revision
of Assessments. 
(Ord. 20-18.  Passed 6-18-2018.)
141.05  PLANS OF PROPOSED IMPROVEMENTS.
   At the time of the passage of the resolution provided in Section
141.03 there shall be on file in the office of the Director of Public Works,
plans, specifications, estimates and profiles of the proposed improvement
showing the proposed grade of the street and improvement after completion, with
reference to the property abutting thereon, which plans, specifications,
estimates and profiles shall be open to the inspection of all persons
interested.
(Ord. 20-18.  Passed 6-18-2018.)
141.06  BOARD OF REVISION OF ASSESSMENTS.
   The Board of Revision of Assessments established by Section
131.02 shall hear all claims and objections as to the character of all
improvements to be paid for in part or in whole by special assessments, the
necessity therefor, and the equity of the assessments as provided in the
assessment report. A majority of those constituting the Board of Revision of
Assessments shall determine all complaints and objections submitted to it, and
as to each improvement the Board shall, after such hearing, amend, equalize and
adjust the assessment report, and shall report its findings as to the necessity
for the improvements and any amendments it directs in the assessments, to
Council. 
(Ord. 20-18.  Passed 6-18-2018.)
141.07  CLAIMS.
   An owner of a lot or of land bounding and abutting upon a proposed
improvement claiming that he or she will sustain damage by reason of the
improvement shall present such claim to the Board of Revision of Assessments
within two weeks after the service of notice of the completion of the
publication provided in Section
141.04. Such claim shall be in writing and shall set forth the amount of
damages claimed, with a general description of the property with respect to
which it is claimed the damage will accrue. Any owner who fails so to do shall
be deemed to have waived such damages and shall be barred from filing a claim
or receiving damages therefor. This provision shall apply to all damages which
will obviously result from the improvement, but shall not deprive the owner of
his or her right to recover damages arising without his or her fault, from acts
of the City or its agents. The Board of Revision of Assessments shall report to
Council all such claims for damages filed with it.
(Ord. 20-18.  Passed 6-18-2018.)
141.08  FINAL ASSESSMENT.
   (a)   When the Board of Revision of Assessments shall have made its final
report to Council as to any improvement, if Council decides to proceed with the
improvement an ordinance for the purpose shall be passed. Such ordinance shall
set forth specifically the lots and lands to be assessed for the improvement,
shall contain a statement of the general nature of the improvement, the
character of the materials which may be bid upon therefor, the mode of payment
therefor, a reference to the resolution theretofore passed for such improvement
with date of its passage, and a statement of the intention of Council to
proceed therewith in accordance with such resolution and in accordance with the
plans, specifications, estimates and profiles provided for such improvement. In
setting forth specifically the lots and lands abutting upon the improvement and
to be assessed therefor, it shall be sufficient to describe them as all the
lots and lands abutting and abounding upon such improvement between and
including the terminal of the improvement, and in describing those which do not
so abut it shall be sufficient to describe the lots by their appropriate lot
numbers, and the lands by metes and bounds, and this rule of description shall
apply in all proceedings in which lots and lands are to be charged with special
assessment. Special assessments shall be payable by the owners of the property
assessed at the time stipulated in the ordinance, and shall be a lien from the
date of the assessment, upon the respective lots and parcels of land assessed,
enforceable in the manner provided by general law.
   (b)   No final assessment ordinance shall be adopted without the concurrence
of three-fourths of the members of Council, unless the owners of a majority of
the foot frontage to be assessed petition in writing for the assessment in
which event Council, a majority of its members thereto concurring, may adopt
the ordinance.
(Ord. 20-18.  Passed 6-18-2018.)
141.09  DAMAGES ASSESSED.
   At the time of the passage of the ordinance determining to proceed with the
improvement as provided in Section
141.08, Council shall determine whether the claims for damages so filed shall
be judicially inquired into before commencing or after the completion of the
proposed improvement. When claims for damages are filed within the time
limited, and Council having passed an ordinance for making the improvement,
determines that the damage shall be assessed before commencing it, the Director
of Law shall make a written application for a jury, to a court of competent
jurisdiction, or a judge in vacation. The court or judge shall direct the
summoning of a jury in the manner provided for the appropria-tion of property
and fix the time and place for the inquiry and the assessment of such damages,
which inquiry and assessment shall be confined to such claim. The proceedings
had relative to such inquiry and determining of such damages shall be in the
manner provided by general laws for the appropriation of property to assess the
amount of damage in each particular case. When Council de-termines to assess
the damages after the completion of the improvement, for which a claim for
damages has been filed as provided in Section
141.07, the Director of Law shall, within 10 days after the completion of such
improvement make written application as provided in this section in the case of
the ascertainment of damages before the improvement was made, and the same
proceedings shall be had. No person who claims damages arising from any cause
shall commence a suit therefor against the City until he or she shall have
filed a claim for such damages with the Director of Finance and 60 days shall
have elapsed thereafter, to enable the City to take such steps as it may deem
proper to settle or adjust the claim; but this provision shall not apply to an
application for an injunction or other proceeding to which it may be necessary
for such applicant to resort in case of urgent necessity.
(Ord. 20-18.  Passed 6-18-2018.)
141.10  WORK TO BE DONE.
   When Council shall have passed an ordinance directing an improvement to be
made, to be paid for in whole or in part by special assessments, the Director
of Public Works shall, as provided by ordinance, either directly by the
employment of labor, or by entering into a contract therefor as provided by
law, cause the improvement to be made.
(Ord. 20 18.  Passed 6-18-2018.)
141.11  LANDS UNALLOTTED OR NOT ON DUPLICATE.
   When special assessments are levied by the percentage of tax value of the
property assessed or by the foot frontage of the property bounding and abutting
upon the improvement, and there are lands subject to such assessment which are
not assessed for taxation, the Director of Finance shall fix, for the purpose
of such assessment, the value of such lots as they stand and of such lands at
such depths as the Director of Finance considers a fair average of the depth of
lots in the neighborhood, so that it will be a fair average of the assessed
value of other lots in the neighborhood, and where lands are not subdivided
into lots, but are assessed for taxation, the Director of Finance shall fix the
value and the depth in the same manner; but the above rule shall not apply in
making a special assessment according to benefits.
(Ord. 20-18.  Passed 6-18-2018.)
141.12  INTEREST ON ASSESSMENT BONDS.
   When bonds or notes are issued in anticipation of the collection of
assessments, the interest thereon shall be treated as part of the cost of the
improvement for which assessments may be made. 
(Ord. 20-18.  Passed 6-18-2018.)
141.13  LIMITATION ON ASSESSMENTS.
   Council shall limit all assessments to the special benefits conferred upon
the property assessed, and in no case shall there be levied on any lot or
parcel of land any assessments for any or all purposes within a period of five
years, in excess of 33 and one third percent of the actual value thereof after
the improvement is made. Assessments levied for the construction of main sewers
shall not exceed the sum that, in the opinion of Council, would be required to
construct an ordinary street sewer or drain of sufficient capacity to drain or
sewer the lots or lands to be assessed for such improvement, nor shall any lots
or lands be assessed that do not need local drainage, or which are provided
therewith.
(Ord. 20-18.  Passed 6-18-2018.)
141.14  CITY'S PORTION OF COST.
   The City shall pay such part of the cost and expense of improvements for
which such special assessments are levied, as Council deems just, which part
shall not be less than one 50th of all such cost and expense; and in addition
thereto the City shall pay the cost of intersections; and Council may provide
for the payment of the City's portion of all such improvements by the issuance
of bonds or notes therefor, and may levy taxes, in addition to all other taxes
authorized by law, to pay such bonds or notes and the interest authorized by
law. Council may provide for the transferring to the General Fund of such
portion of the proceeds of special assessments or of the proceeds of bonds
issued in anticipation of the collection of special assessments, and of the
proceeds of bonds or notes issued or taxes levied to provide funds for the
payment of the City's share of the cost of improvements, as is equal to the
estimated cost of the engineering and inspection done or to be done directly by
the City in connection with said improvement.
(Ord. 20-18.  Passed 6-18-2018.)
141.15  REPLACING EXISTING IMPROVEMENTS.
   Council may provide in whole or in part the cost of replacing any
improvement existing in a street at the time of the adoption of this chapter by
levying special assessments as provided in this chapter, but any assessment for
such replacement in less than 20 years from date of a prior assessment for the
improvement to be replaced shall be limited to a sum not in excess of 33 and
one third percent of the cost of such improvement.
(Ord. 20-18.  Passed 6-18-2018.)
141.16  SUBSEQUENT IMPROVEMENTS.
   Every ordinance providing for an improvement to be paid for in whole or in
part by special assessments shall contain an estimate by the Director of Public
Works of the life of the proposed improvement. Any assessment thereafter made
for replacing such improvement within such period of estimated life shall be
limited to a sum not in excess of 33 and one third percent of the cost of such
replacement. Assessments for replacements at or after the expiration of such
estimated period of life shall be subject to no limitation except as provided
for as-sessments for original improvements. 
(Ord. 20-18.  Passed 6-18-2018.)
141.17  SUPPLEMENTARY ASSESSMENTS AND REBATES.
   Upon the completion of any improvement, the Director of Finance shall rebate
to the then owner of the property which shall have been assessed.
(Ord. 20-18.  Passed 6-18-2018.)
141.18  SEWER AND WATER CONNECTIONS.
   The Director of Public Works may compel the making of sewer and water con-
nections whenever, in view of contemplated street improvements or as a sanitary
regulation, sewer or water connections should in the Director's judgment be
constructed. The Director shall cause written notice of the Director's
determination thereof to be given to the owner of each lot or parcel of land to
which such connections are to be made, which notice shall state the number and
character of connections required. Such notice shall be served by a person
designated by the Director of Public Works, in the manner provided for the
service of sum-mons in civil actions. Nonresidents of the City, or persons who
cannot be found, may be served by one publication of notice in a newspaper of
general circulation in the City, which notice shall state the time within which
such connection shall be constructed; and if they be not constructed within the
said time, the work may be done by the City and the cost thereof, together with
a penalty of five percent (5 percent) assessed against the lots and lands for
which such connections are made. Said assessments shall be certified and
collected as other assessments for street improvement.
(Ord. 20-18.  Passed 6-18-2018.)
141.19  SIDEWALKS.
   Council may by resolution declare that certain specified sidewalks,
curbings, or gutters shall be constructed or repaired. Upon the adoption of
such a resolution, the Clerk of Council shall cause written notice of the
passage thereof to be served upon the owner, or agent of the owner, of each
parcel of land abutting upon such sidewalk, who may be a resident of the City,
in the manner provided by law for the service of summons in civil actions. The
Clerk shall return a copy of the notice within the time and manner of service
endorsed thereon, signed by the person serving it, to the Director of Public
Works, who shall file and preserve such return. For the purpose of such
service, if the owner of any such property is not a resident of the City, any
person charged with the collection of rent, or the payment of taxes on such
property, or having control thereof in any way shall be regarded as the agent
of the owner, and service upon such person shall have the like force and effect
as though personal service were made upon the owner thereof. If it appears in
any such return, however, that the owner is a nonresident, or that neither such
owner or agent could be found, publication of a copy of the resolution in a
newspaper of circulation in the City in the manner provided for service and
publication of resolutions for street improvements, shall be deemed sufficient
notice to such owner. If such sidewalks, curbings, or gutters be not
constructed or repaired within 30 days from the service of notice, or the
completion of the publication, the Director of Public Works may proceed by
direct employment of labor, or by contract, to do or have done the said
construction or repair at the expense of the owner and all such expense shall
be assessed on all the property abutting or bounding thereon. Such assessment
shall be collected in the same manner, with a penalty of five percent and
interest for failure to pay at the time fixed by the assessing ordinance, as in
cases of other improvements.
(Ord. 20-18.  Passed 6-18-2018.)
141.20  FURTHER PROCEEDINGS UNNECESSARY.
   No other or further proceedings for the construction or repair of sidewalks,
curb-ings and gutters, and levying assessments therefor, shall be necessary
than the proceedings required under this and the preceding Section. In any case
in which special assessments may be made on property for all the cost of
constructing or repairing sidewalks, curbings or gutters, such assessments
within the limit of 33 and one third percent of the real value of the property
shall be a valid assessment thereon. 
(Ord. 20-18.  Passed 6-18-2018.)
141.21  ASSESSMENT BONDS.
   Council may at any time borrow money and authorize the issuance of notes or
bonds according to law therefor in anticipation of the collection of
assessments levied for the purpose of paying the cost of constructing or
repairing sidewalks, which are to be or have been constructed by the Director
of Public Works upon the failure of the owners of the property to construct or
repair the same, pursuant to notice as provided in Section
141.19.
(Ord. 20-18.  Passed 6-18-2018.)
141.22  ALTERATIONS OR MODIFICATIONS IN CONTRACT.
   When it becomes necessary, in the opinion of the Director of Public Works in
the prosecution of any work or improvement under contract, such alterations or
modifications shall be made only upon the order of such Director in writing,
provided, however, that such alteration must be approved by Council in case it
involves an additional expenditure exceeding $1,000. No such order shall be
effective until the price to be paid for the work and material, or both, under
the altered or modified contract, has been agreed upon in writing and signed by
the contractor and the Director in behalf of the City.

order in which the names of such persons shall appear on the eligible list
shall be determined by their respective scores on that part of the examination
assigned the greatest weight.  In the event that two or more qualifying
applicants also receive identical scores on that part of the examination
assigned the greatest weight, the order of listing shall be determined by a
computer generated random number assigned each applicant, the lower number
qualifying for priority listing on the eligible list.  Such number is to be
posted at the exam for review by applicants.
   (b)   In the event two or more applicants receive the same total score on a

Commission deems appropriate under the circumstances.
   (c)   Failure of any person on an eligible list to accept a temporary

person accepts the temporary appointment, it shall not be considered part of a
probationary period in case of subsequent appointment.
   (d)   No such temporary appointment shall last longer than six months or the

and appointments shall be conducted in the same way as has been established for
original appointments.
   (b)   All promotions shall be made by examinations conducted by the
Commission or designee as outlined in these rules.  The Commission may
establish the length of service in the next lower class, grade or position and
other reasonable requirements to determine eligibility for the examination. 
All such requirements shall be specified at the time of posting notice for the
exam.
   (c)   Such notice shall be posted as determined by the Commission.
   (d)   At the discretion of the Commission credits for performance ratings of
applicants for any promotional examination may be given.  In no case, however,
shall the performance rating be given a weight of more than fifteen percent
(15%).  The examination announcement will indicate what weight performance
ratings will be given.  If performance ratings are used, the system implemented
by the appointing authority to establish the ratings shall be as prescribed by
the Commission.  If performance ratings are not used, an applicant may be
disqualified for demonstrated poor conduct or lack of capacity in office.
   (e)   In promotional examinations, seniority in service may be added to the
examination grade.  Such credit for seniority shall not be added unless the
applicants achieve a passing score on the exam which may include a rating for
performance evaluation.  Credit for seniority shall be determined as follows:
      (1)   Each of the first four (4) full years of service shall be counted
as one half (.50) point.
      (2)   Each full year of the next ten (10) years of service shall be
counted as eight- tenths (.80) of a point.
   Seniority credit shall be calculated based on the date of the first
component of the promotional examination.
   (f)   The Commission may establish other requirements it deems appropriate
as a part of any promotional exam.
   (g)   After the exams are scored eligible lists shall be created.  The
Commission shall certify the three standing highest on the list to the
appointing authority who shall appoint one of the persons so certified.  If
there are fewer than three names on an eligible list the Commission may certify
them, in which case the appointing authority may appoint one or reject all.  If
the appointing authority rejects all such names, the eligible list shall
terminate.
   (h)   If there are fewer than three individuals within the classified
service that meet the minimum requirements for promotional exams, the
Commission may elect to conduct an open, competitive or non-competitive exam.
   (i)   Subsections (a) through (h) hereof are specifically intended to
supersede State Code provisions on the general promotion for appointments to a
civil service position.
(Ord. 84-06.  Passed 5-7-07.)
144.08  PROCEDURE FOR PROMOTIONS FOR UNIFORMED POLICE AND FIRE.
   (a)   Promotions for uniformed Police and Fire shall be from class to class
from the lowest to highest.  No person shall be eligible to take any
promotional examination without having served two years in the highest grade in
the next lower class by the date of such examination.  This requirement may be
waived by the Commission if only one person is eligible, or if only one
eligible person is willing to take such examination.  In that event, persons
having served at least two years in the then next lower grade in the next lower
class shall also be eligible to take such examination.
   (b)   In no case shall any person be considered for the position of Chief
unless he or she has served a minimum of ten (10) years with that division in
the City of Lakewood.
   (c)   At the discretion of the Commission credit for performance ratings of
the applicants may be considered in the determination of a final score.  In no
case, however, shall the performance evaluation constitute more than fifteen
percent (15%) of the applicant’s final score.  Performance evaluations shall be
on forms and in a manner prescribed by the Commission.
   (d)   Applicants, otherwise eligible for promotion, who achieve a passing
score on a promotional exam shall receive credit for seniority which shall be
determined as follows::
      (1)   Each of the first four (4) full years of service shall be counted
as one half (.50) a point.
      (2)   Each full year of the next ten (10) years of service shall be
counted as eight- tenths (.80) of a point.
   Seniority credit shall be calculated based on the date of the first
component of the promotional examination.
   (e)   The Commission shall conduct the examinations in accordance with the
general rules of the Commission governing examinations.
   (f)   After the exams are scored, eligible lists shall be created.  The
Commission shall certify the three applicants standing highest on the list to
the appointing authority who shall appoint one of the persons so certified.  If
there are fewer than three names on an eligible list, the Commission may
certify them.  The appointing authority may appoint one or reject all.  If the
appointing authority rejects all such names the eligible list shall thereupon
terminate.
   (g)   If there are fewer than three individuals within the classified
service that meet the minimum requirements for promotional exam, the appointing
authority may elect to conduct an open, competitive exam according to original
appointment procedures to fill said vacancy.
   (h)   Subsections (a) through (g) hereof are  specifically intended to
supersede State Code provisions on the general promotion for appointments to a
civil service position.

   (a)   All original and promotional appointments to any position except as a
sworn member of the Divisions of Police or Fire, shall be for a probationary
period of ninety (90) days.  Original appointments to the positions of Patrol
Officer and Fire Fighter shall be for a probationary period of two years.  The
probationary period for promotional appointments as a sworn member of the
Divisions of Police and Fire shall be for one year.
   (b)   No appointment or promotion shall be considered final until the
employee has satisfactorily completed the probationary period.  The purpose of
the probationary period is to evaluate the suitability, performance, and
qualifications of the employee for permanent appointment to that position.
   (c)   If the service of the probationary employee is unsatisfactory he/she
may be removed or reduced at any time by the appointing authority.
   (d)   The probationary period of any employee may be extended by the
Commission for good cause shown upon written request of the appointing
authority.
   (e)   Any probationary employee who is removed may request a review by the
Commission.  Such request must be in writing and received by the Commission
within ten (10) days of such removal.  The Commission shall review the
procedure for such removal to ascertain that the removal was in accordance with
the provisions of this chapter.
   (f)   Subsections (a) through (e) hereof are specifically intended to
supersede State Code provisions on the probationary period of original and
promotional appointments.

144.11  LAY-OFF LISTS.
   (a)   A lay-off list shall be established by the Commission for all
positions in the classified Civil Service.  This list will be in effect for a
period of one year.  All persons who are laid off shall be placed on the
appropriate lay-off list and ranked according to seniority.  An individual’s
placement on the list shall terminate one year after such placement.
   If the appointing authority determines at any time, within the one year
period, to fill a position which has been made vacant by lay-off, the
Commission shall certify the person standing highest on the lay-off list for
appointment to the position and follow the relevant procedures provided in
Section 601 of the City of Lakewood Civil Service Rules and Regulations.

the term “regular time service” all regular time worked, regular time not
worked but compensated by reasons of the holiday, vacation or sick leave
provisions hereof and regular time neither worked nor directly compensated by
the City but for which an employee received worker's compensation because of
injury sustained in the course of employment by the City.
   (b)   Vacation time for all full-time permanent hourly employees and all
salaried employees not covered by a collective bargaining agreement, shall be
earned in one year and taken in the subsequent year, except that an employee's
paid vacation leave shall be adjusted (or prorated) to reflect time spent on
unpaid leave(s) of absence totaling thirty days or more (i. e. for each thirty
days spent on unpaid leave of absence, an employee shall lose one-twelfth of
regular paid vacation leave).
   (c)   Vacation pay of all employees shall be computed on the basis of
compensation schedules, including regular time as to hourly employees, in

operational requirements of the City, the Mayor, at his sole discretion, shall
have the authority to authorize a cash reimbursement for the vacation time such
employee would have lost as a result of such prevention. No employee shall take
more than four weeks vacation in a single uninterrupted period of time, except
upon termination of employment. Accrued vacation time in excess of ten weeks
(fifty working days) not taken by the employee shall be deemed surrendered by
the employee. Except as otherwise provided herein, vacation time not actually
taken as such is not compensable in money; however, an employee may be
compensated for vacation time earned upon the termination of his employment for
any reason other than discharge for cause, conditioned upon at least one week's
notice of such termination by such employee.
   (e)   All vacations shall be granted and taken at such times as shall be
mutually agreeable to the employee and his division head, insofar as possible.
Where they are unable to agree, the decision of the division head shall govern.
The division head may permit the vacation to be taken in other than consecutive
days. Each division head shall annually prepare a vacation schedule so devised
as to cause minimum interference with normal operation of the division. In the
event of conflict between employees in regard to vacation time, seniority shall
control.
   (f)   Notwithstanding the provisions of Ohio R.C. 9.44, in determining
service time, solely for the purpose of the above vacation schedules, for
employees employed by the City subsequent to December 31, 1984, prior service
time with the State or any political subdivision of the State shall not be
credited to the employee to establish an accrued basis of years of service upon
entry into City employment.
(Ord. 49-01. Passed 11-5-2001.)

employer from requiring any employee to report for work or to work on any
holiday if necessary, by reason of emergency or to carry on essential municipal
functions.

was in need of the care that was provided by the employee; and

153.01  DECLARATION OF NECESSITY.
   It is hereby found and determined that there exist within the City blighted,
deteriorated and deteriorating areas of the nature defined in this chapter
which constitute a serious and growing menace injurious and inimicable to the
public health, safety, morals and general welfare; that the existence of such
areas:
   (a)   Contributes substantially and increasingly to the spread of disease
and crime, and to losses by fire and accident, necessitating excessive and
disproportionate expenditures of public funds for the preservation of the
public health and safety, for crime prevention, correction, prosecution and
punishment, for the treatment of juvenile delinquency, for the maintenance of
adequate police, fire and accident protection, and for other public services
and facilities;
   (b)   Constitutes an economic and social liability, and
   (c)   Substantially impairs and arrests the sound growth of the community,
retards the provision of housing accommodations, aggravates traffic problems
and substantially impairs or arrests the elimination of traffic hazards and the
improvement of traffic facilities; and that this menace is beyond remedy and
control solely by regulatory processes and exercise of the police power and
cannot be dealt with effectively by the ordinary operation of private
enterprise without the aids herein provided; that the elimination in whole or
in part of blighted, deteriorated and deteriorating areas and the prevention of
occurrence or recurrence of such areas by redevelopment and by the
conservation, rehabilitation and reconditioning, to the extent feasible, of the
salvageable portions of such areas, and by other activities pursuant to urban
redevelopment or urban renewal as defined herein, are public uses and purposes
for which public money may be expended and private property acquired by
purchase, by donation and by eminent domain and are governmental functions of
concern to the City and require the exercise of the powers of government
granted to the City by the provisions of Article XVIII of the Ohio Constitution
and that the necessity, in the public interest and general welfare, of the
provisions of this chapter is hereby declared to be a matter of legislative
determination.
      (Ord. 63-67.  Passed 12-4-1967.)
153.02  COUNCIL POLICY.
   It is hereby declared to be the policy of Council to promote and encourage
the sound development, including renewal and redevelopment where necessary, of
the entire City, in accordance with the General Plan for the City. Council
realizes that the City Government will be unable to carry out coordinated and
effective programs for renewing the City without the cooperation and support of
the public as a whole. Therefore, Council stands ready to cooperate with
private enterprise, civic groups, neighborhood agencies and governmental
agencies in developing and carrying out urban renewal programs and projects to
promote the sound development of new areas, to prevent the spread of blight and
to eliminate blighted, deteriorated and deteriorating areas in the City.
(Ord. 63-67.  Passed 12-4-1967.)
153.03  DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
ascribed to them in this section unless a different meaning is clearly
indicated in the context.
   (a)   "Agency" or "urban renewal agency" or "local public agency" or "City"
means the City of Lakewood, Ohio.
   (b)   "Blighted or deteriorated area" means an area within the corporate
limits of the City in which there are a majority of structures or other
improvements which, by reason of dilapidation, deterioration, age or
obsolescence, inadequate provision for ventilation, light, air, sanitation or
open spaces, high density of population and overcrowding, unsafe and unsanitary
conditions or the existence of conditions which endanger life or property by
fire or other hazards and causes, or any combination of such factors, and an
area with overcrowding or improper location of structures on the land,
excessive dwelling unit density, detrimental land uses or conditions, unsafe,
congested or poorly designed streets or inadequate public facilities or
utilities, all of which substantially impair the sound growth and  planning of
the community, are conducive to ill health, transmission of disease, infant
mortality, juvenile delinquency and crime, and are detrimental to the public
health, safety, morals and general welfare.
   (c)   "Deteriorating area" means either:
      (1)   An area, whether predominately built up or open, which is not a
blighted or deteriorated area but which, because of incompatible land uses,
nonconforming uses, lack of adequate parking facilities, faulty street
arrangements, obsolete platting, inadequate community and public utilities,
diversity of ownership, tax delinquency, increased density of population
without commensurate increases in new residential buildings and community
facilities, high turnover in residential or commercial occupancy, lack of
maintenance and repair of buildings, or any combination thereof, is detrimental
to the public health, safety, morals and general welfare, and which will
deteriorate, or is in danger of deteriorating, into a blighted or deteriorated
area; or
      (2)   An area consisting principally of land in highways, railway or
subway tracks, bridge or tunnel entrances, or other similar facilities which
have a blighting influence on the surrounding area and over which air right
sites can be developed thereby eliminating such blighting influence.
   (d)   "Project area", "urban redevelopment area" or "urban renewal area"
means a blighted, deteriorated or deteriorating area, or any combination or
part thereof, which Council designates as of a character and size appropriate
for urban renewal activities and for which an urban redevelopment plan or urban
renewal plan is proposed or prepared.
   (e)   "General neighborhood renewal area" means an urban renewal area
together with any adjoining areas having specially related problems of such
scope that urban renewal activities therein have to be initiated in more than
one separate urban renewal project over an estimated period of up to eight
years.
   (f)   "Urban renewal" or "urban redevelopment" means the activities of the
City, with  or without State aid or assistance, for developing, undertaking and
carrying out of urban renewal or redevelopment programs and projects, including

or any part of such activities.
   (g)   "Open space land" means land which has not been developed by the
construction or installation of streets, utilities, buildings (except sporadic
or incidental structures) or other site improvements. Whether or not such an
area has been platted in whole or in part does not prevent its classification
as "open space land".
   (h)   "Redeveloper" means any person or entity either purchasing property
from the City within a project area or owning property located within such area
and entering into a conforming agreement with the City in consideration of
being permitted by the City to retain title to such property.

area or part thereof.

neighborhood renewal area. The general neighborhood renewal plan need not
contain all of the required contents set forth in Section

plan. Approval of the general neighborhood renewal plan by Council does not
create authority to carry out project execution activities.
   (k)   "Urban renewal project", "urban redevelopment project" or "project"
means undertakings and activities of the City, with or without State aid or
assistance, in a project area for the elimination and for the prevention of the

accordance with the urban renewal or urban redevelopment plan for the project

      (6)   Acquisition of any real property where necessary to eliminate

the construction or improvement by the City of any building other than
municipal buildings, except as provided in subsection (k)(7) and (8) and this
subsection.

   (b)   The Planning Commission shall submit in writing to Council its
approval or recommendations concerning such plan. Except as recommendations or

supporting documentation, the plan shall be conclusively presumed to have been
approved by the Commission. 
(Ord. 63-67.  Passed 12-4-1967.)
153.08  PUBLIC HEARING AND COUNCIL ACTION.
   (a)   Council, before approving a general neighborhood renewal plan or an
urban renewal or urban redevelopment plan, shall hold a public hearing on the
plan at which an opportunity shall be provided to all persons interested to be
heard either in person or by counsel, which hearing may be adjourned from time
to time. Notice of the date, time and place of such hearing will be published
in a newspaper of general circulation in the City once a week for two
consecutive weeks on the same day of the week, and at least seven full days
shall elapse between the second publication and the date set for the public
hearing. Such notice shall also contain a description of the project area by
its location in relation to highways, streets, watercourses or other natural or
artificial boundaries, and shall also designate the place at which the plan,
maps, plats and other materials describing the project area are and will be
available for public inspection.
   (b)   Following the completion of such public hearing, Council may either
approve or reject the general neighborhood renewal plan or the urban renewal or
urban redevelopment plan, or make modifications and approve such plan as
modified. However, if the boundaries of the project area are extended to
include any land (except land contained within the right-of-way lines of a
dedicated street or alley) not included in the urban renewal or urban
redevelopment plan upon which the public hearing was held pursuant to
subsection (a) hereof, or if there is added a type of urban renewal or
redevelopment activity not included in the urban renewal or urban redevelopment
plan upon which the public hearing was held pursuant to subsection (a) hereof
which requires the acquisition of property, or if there is any change deemed by
Council to be substantial in land use or redevelopment restrictions contained
in the urban renewal or urban redevelopment plan upon which the public hearing
was held pursuant to subsection (a) hereof, a public hearing shall be held on
such urban renewal or urban redevelopment plan, as modified, prior to the
approval thereof by Council in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a)
hereof. Moreover, if such modifications are other than in accordance with the
recommendations of the City Planning Commission, such general neighborhood
renewal plan or urban renewal plan or urban redevelopment shall, as modified,
shall be resubmitted to the Commission for its written approval or
recommendations pursuant to the provisions of Section
153.07.
   (c)   When Council wishes to approve a general neighborhood renewal plan, or
an urban renewal or redevelopment plan, it shall do so by ordinance passed by
not less than a majority vote, pursuant to the City Charter. However, if such
plan has not been approved by the Commission, or if there were any partial
disapprovals by or adverse recommendations of the Commission not accepted by
Council by its modifications of the plan in accordance therewith, then an
affirmative vote of two-thirds of the members of Council shall be required to
pass such ordinance.
   (d)   The ordinance of Council approving a general neighborhood renewal plan
should contain such findings and determinations as may be determined by Council
to be necessary or desirable but need not contain the other findings set forth
in subsection (e) hereof for approval of urban renewal or redevelopment plans.
Such approval of a general neighborhood renewal plan may be made before or at
the same time as the approval of an urban renewal or redevelopment plan for a
project within the general neighborhood renewal area.
   (e)   The ordinance of Council approving an urban renewal or redevelopment
plan shall include the following findings:
      (1)   Specific findings of fact as to the conditions in the project area
which make it a blighted, deteriorated or deteriorating area, and findings that
the project area is a blighted, deteriorated or deteriorating area.
      (2)   That the size and character of the area and the location of
elements of blight and deterioration in the area make it appropriate for urban
renewal activities.
      (3)   That the plan for the project area will afford maximum opportunity
consistent with the sound needs of the community as a whole for the
rehabilitation or redevelopment of the project area by private enterprise.
   (f)   The Clerk of Council shall certify as true and correct and deliver to
the Mayor a copy of the aforesaid ordinance of Council approving the plan for
appropriate further action, and any documents which were submitted to Council
to support findings made in the ordinance shall be filed with a copy of the
ordinance.
   (g)   The taking effect of the ordinance approving an urban renewal or
redevelopment plan shall constitute authority to spend moneys of the City
appropriated for carrying out urban renewal or redevelopment activities in
accordance with the plan, as well as the proceeds of bonds or notes issued for
such purpose, and to accept advances, gifts, donations and grants from the
Federal Government, the State, any entity, instrumentality or subdivision of
either, or from any other entity or person for such purpose.
(Ord. 63-67.  Passed 12-4-1967.)
153.09  MODIFICATION OF PLANS.
   An approved urban renewal plan may be amended, modified or changed by
ordinance of Council from time to time. However, if the boundaries of the

(Ord. 63-67.  Passed 12-4-1967.)
153.10  EXECUTION OF PROJECTS.
   (a)   Acquisition of Property.  When authorized by Council, the Mayor shall
cause the necessary steps to be taken to acquire the parcels of land in the
project area in accordance with the urban renewal or redevelopment plan,
including but not limited to, the negotiation for such parcels, obtaining
appraisals, title examinations and reports, executing contracts for any of such
services and appropriate documents to transfer title to the City. However, in
the event appropriation of property is necessary, Council shall initiate and
carry out, with the appropriate assistance of the several officers, employees,
boards and commissions of the City, the proceedings in accordance with the City
Charter and Ohio R.C. Chapter 163. Acquisition may take place at any time after
compliance with Sections
153.07 and
153.08.
   (b)   City Activities Preparing Property for Disposition.  After any
necessary appropriations of City moneys and authorization of expenditures by
ordinance of Council, after Council action, where appropriate, to rezone
property, vacate or dedicate streets or other public places and provide for the
establishment and preservation of open space areas, and after certification of
funds by the Director of Finance, where appropriate, and preparation and
approval of legal form of contracts by the Director of Law, the Mayor shall
make the contracts, purchase the supplies and materials and provide the labor,
pursuant to and in accordance with applicable provisions of the City Charter
and City ordinances, and provide such City activities as may be necessary to
carry out the urban renewal projects, including but not limited to: the
demolition, rehabilitation or repair of structures (whether voluntarily by the
private owners thereof or by the City for demonstration purposes in limited
numbers); the removal of pavement, sidewalks, lighting and trees; capping,
removal and relocation of City owned utility lines; grading; construction of
site improvements and supporting facilities; the temporary lease, rental or
permission to let others use structures or parcels of land while owned by the
City; relocation activities; and the enforcement of any applicable provisions
of law or conforming agreements relative to building, zoning, platting and the
repair or rehabilitation of land and structures remaining in private ownership.
   (c)   Disposition of Property.  After its determination that real property
is not needed for any municipal purpose because continued public ownership
thereof will not be necessary to the carrying out of the purpose of eliminating
conditions of blight and because the sale thereof is necessary to carry out the
purpose of preventing the occurrence or recurrence of the conditions of blight,
Council may authorize by ordinance the transfer, lease or conveyance of any
real property in accordance with and for the purposes of the plan, subject to
such lawful terms, conditions, restrictions and covenants (including covenants
running with the land) to assist in carrying out the purposes of the plan All
dispositions of real property shall be at not less than the fair value thereof
determined by Council based upon the proposed new uses and restrictions to be
imposed thereon under the urban renewal plan by Council through zoning
ordinances, private covenant or otherwise. Such determination shall be made
only after obtaining independent appraisals of such fair value upon the
aforesaid bases, which appraisals shall not be binding upon the City. The
manner of disposition shall be prescribed by ordinance, and may be by
negotiation, with or without any competitive bidding, and such competition and
award of a disposition contract may be based on factors other than price alone.
Two weeks' publication of notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the
City shall be sufficient notice for the taking of competitive bids. The
financial and legal ability of those proposing to acquire or lease such real
property shall be considered in all dispositions. The Mayor shall execute, on
behalf of the City, such instruments as may be necessary to transfer, lease or
convey such real property in the form approved by the Director of Law and
authorized by Council, which form shall include all covenants running with the
land, including any portions of the plan incorporated by reference. The Mayor
shall execute any certificates of completion of improvements or other
appropriate instruments that may be necessary in accordance with any covenants
in such instruments of lease or conveyance.
   (d)   If the owner of property in the project area is willing to make the
use of his property conform to the urban renewal or redevelopment plan and
Council finds and determines that the acquisition of such property by the City
will not be necessary if so conformed, the Mayor, upon Council's authorization,
may enter into a conforming agreement upon such terms end security as may be
authorized by Council. Such agreement may provide for the acquisition of
property upon continued failure of the property owner to keep his agreement
after notice from the City specifying such failure.
   (e)   In the execution of urban renewal or redevelopment projects, Council
may authorize, as to any appropriate projects or parts of projects, the
employment of community improvement corporations, community redevelopment
corporations and metropolitan housing authorities, as defined by the statutes
of Ohio, and, when authorized by ordinance of Council, may grant leases, make
conveyances and enter into agreements with such corporations related to
appropriate aspects of such projects to the full extent of the powers possessed
by such corporations. 
(Ord. 63-67.  Passed 12-4-1967.)

City from appropriate general or special funds or accounts established pursuant
to Ohio R.C. Chapters 135 and 5705, and the City may accept grants or gifts of
moneys or real or personal property from persons, entities, governments or
taxing authorities to be used for the planning and financing of such urban
renewal activities. All bonds or notes payable from the general credit and
taxes of the City to finance the urban renewal activities shall be issued in
accordance with the applicable provisions of Ohio R. C. Chapter 133.
(Ord. 63-67. Passed 12-4-1967.)
153.12  BUILDING PERMITS.
   After approval of an urban renewal or redevelopment plan by Council, no
building permit shall be issued for the improvement or enlargement of any
existing structure, or for the construction of a new structure, in the
clearance and redevelopment portion of the project area, except that such
permit may be issued for the repair of an existing structure when such repair
is deemed necessary for the immediate preservation of the public health and
safety or is required by the redeveloper in accordance with the redevelopment
plan.
(Ord. 63-67.  Passed 12-4-1967.)
153.13  TAX EXEMPTION.
   (a)   All property of the City, including funds, owned or held by it for the
purposes of this chapter, shall be exempt from levy and sale by virtue of an
execution, and no execution or other judicial process shall issue against the
same nor shall judgment against the City be a charge or lien upon such
property. However, the provisions of this section shall not apply to or limit
the right of obligees to pursue any  remedies for the enforcement of any pledge
or lien given pursuant to this chapter by the City on its rents, fees, grants
or revenues from urban renewal or redevelopment projects.
   (b)   The property of the City, acquired or held for the purposes of this
chapter on January 1 of any year, is declared to be public property used
exclusively for essential public and governmental purposes, and such property
shall be exempt from all taxes of the City, County, State or any taxing
authority thereof. However, such tax exemption shall terminate when the City
sells, leases or otherwise disposes of such property in a project area to a
purchaser or lessee which is not a person, corporation, partnership or other
association entitled to tax exemption with respect to such property.

(ORC 4513.60; Ord. 34-10.  Passed 7-19-10.)
303.09  LEAVING JUNK AND OTHER VEHICLES ON PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PROPERTY WITHOUT
PERMISSION OR NOTIFICATION.
   (a)   No person shall willfully leave any vehicle or an "abandoned junk
motor vehicle" as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63 on private property for more
than seventy-two consecutive hours without the permission of the person having
the right to the possession of the property or on a public street or other
property open to the public for purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or
upon or within the right of way of any road or highway, for forty-eight
consecutive hours or longer, without notification to the Police Chief of the
reasons for leaving the vehicle in such place.
   For purposes of this section, the fact that a vehicle has been so left
without permission or notification is prima-facie evidence of abandonment.
Nothing contained in this section shall invalidate the provisions of other
ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor vehicles on
streets, highways, public property or private property within the Municipality.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and
shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the Municipality in disposing of
an abandoned junk motor vehicle that is the basis of the violation, less any
money accruing to the Municipality from this disposal of the vehicle.  (ORC
4513.64; Ord. 34-10.  Passed 7-19-10.)
303.10  LEAVING JUNK VEHICLES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY WITH  PERMISSION OF OWNER.
   (a)   For the purposes of this section, "junk motor vehicle" means any motor
vehicle meeting the requirements of Ohio R.C. 4513.63(B) to (E) that is left
uncovered in the open on private property for more than seventy-two hours with
the permission of the person having the right to the possession of the
property, except if the person is operating a junk yard or scrap metal
processing facility licensed under authority of Ohio R.C. 4737.05 to 4737.12;
or regulated under authority of the Municipality; or if the property on which
the motor vehicle is left is not subject to licensure or regulation by any
governmental authority, unless the person having the right to the possession of
the property can establish that the motor vehicle is part of a bona fide
commercial operation, or if the motor vehicle is a collector's vehicle.
   Persons may store or keep by unrestricted method any collector's vehicle as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4501.01(F) on private property with the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property; except that such
person having such permission shall conceal, by means of buildings, fences,
vegetation, terrain or other suitable obstruction, any unlicensed collector's
vehicle stored in the open.
Council, the Chief of Police or the Municipal Zoning Authority, may send notice
by certified mail with return receipt requested, to the person having the right
to the possession of the property on which a junk motor vehicle is left, that
within ten days of receipt of the notice, the junk motor vehicle either shall
be covered by being housed in a garage or other suitable structure or shall be
removed from the property.
   No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in the open
for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this section. 
The fact that a junk motor vehicle is so left is prima-facie evidence of
willful failure to comply with the notice.  Each subsequent period of thirty
days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a separate
offense.
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor on a first offense.  If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of this
section, whoever violates this section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth
degree.  If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to
two or more violations of this section, whoever violates this section is guilty
of a misdemeanor of the third degree. (ORC 4513.65; Ord. 34-10.  Passed 7-19-

complaint.

      (Ord. 39-14.  Passed 12-15-2014.)
309.02  PARKING VIOLATIONS BUREAU ESTABLISHED.
   (a)   The City of Lakewood Parking Violations Bureau is hereby  established
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 4521.04.  The Parking Violations Bureau shall be a part
of the Division of Public Safety.  The Parking Violations Bureau has
jurisdiction over each Parking Infraction that occurs within the territory of
the City of Lakewood.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the
contrary, each Parking Infraction that occurs within the jurisdiction of the
Parking Violations Bureau and the enforcement of such Parking Infraction shall
be handled pursuant to and governed by the provisions of this Chapter.  The
commission of a Parking Infraction, as defined by Section
309.01(a) of this chapter, within the City of Lakewood shall not be considered
a criminal offense for any purpose, and a person who commits the violation
shall not be arrested as the result of the commission of the violation.
   (b)   The Director of Public Safety shall serve as the Violations Clerk of
the Parking Violations Bureau, and shall have the authority to appoint the
Hearing Examiner and any necessary clerical personnel.  No person shall be
employed as a Hearing Examiner unless the person meets the requirements
established by the Ohio Revised Code for Hearing Examiners.
   (c)   The fines, penalties, fees and costs established for a Parking
Infraction shall be collected, retained and disbursed by the Violations Clerk
if the Parking Infraction out of which the fines, penalties, fees and costs
arose occurred within the jurisdiction of the Parking Violations Bureau.  The
Violations Clerk shall provide tickets for Parking Infractions to the Law
Enforcement Officer and shall also provide tickets for Parking Infractions upon
requisition of the Division of Police.  Any person requisitioning tickets shall
account to the Violations Clerk for all tickets requisitioned at such times as
the Violations Clerk shall request.  The fines, penalties, fees and costs
collected by the Violations Clerk for a Parking Infraction shall be disbursed
by the Violations Clerk to the City of Lakewood.
   (d)   The Director of Public Safety shall have the authority to contract
with any non- governmental entity to provide services in processing, collecting
and enforcing parking tickets issued by Law Enforcement Officers or Civilian
employees and civil judgments and default civil judgments entered pursuant to
this Chapter.
(Ord. 58-10.  Passed 7-29-2010.)
309.03  PARKING TICKET SERVICE AND LIABILITY.
   (a)   The parking ticket shall be used by Law Enforcement Officers or
Civilian employees in all cases in which a person is charged with committing a
Parking Infraction within the City of Lakewood.  The parking ticket shall be
the summons and complaint for purposes of this Chapter.
   (b)   A Law Enforcement Officer or Civilian employee who issues a parking
ticket for a Parking Infraction shall complete the ticket by identifying the
Parking Infraction charged, recoding the license plate number, type and make or
model of the vehicle, and indicating the date, time and place of the Parking
Infraction charged.  The Law Enforcement Officer or Civilian employee shall
sign the ticket and affirm the facts it contains and file a copy with the
Violations Clerk.  If the operator of the vehicle is present, the Law
Enforcement Officer or Civilian employee also shall record on the ticket the
name of the operator in a space provided on the ticket for identification of
the offender, and then shall personally serve the parking ticket upon the
operator.  If the operator of the vehicle is not present, the Law Enforcement
Officer or Civilian employee shall insert the word “owner” in the space
provided on the ticket for identification of the offender, and then shall
constructively serve the parking ticket upon the owner of the vehicle by
affixing the ticket to the vehicle in a conspicuous place.
   Constructive service of a parking ticket upon an owner of a vehicle by
affixation as provided in this subsection, or by the procedure described in
subsection (d) of this section, has the same force and effect, and potentially
subjects both the owner and the operator of the vehicle whose act or omission
resulted in the Parking Infraction, if different, to the same fines, penalties,
fees and costs for failure to timely answer or to appear, if a hearing is
requesting, as if the parking ticket were personally served on both the owner
and operator of the vehicle at the time of the violation.
   (c)   The original of a parking ticket issued pursuant to this section or
any true copy of it shall be considered a record kept in the ordinary course of
business of the City of Lakewood and the law enforcement agency whose officer
issued it, and shall be prima-facie evidence of the facts it contains.
   (d)   An operator of a vehicle who is not the owner of the vehicle, but who
operates it with the express or implied permission of the owner is the agent of
the owner for purpose of the receipt of parking tickets served in accordance
with this section, and personal service of a parking ticket upon the operator
in accordance with this section constitutes constructive service upon the owner
for purposes of this chapter.  The operator of a rented or leased vehicle whose
act or omission resulted in an alleged parking infraction shall not be
considered an agent of the owner if the owner is engaged in the business of
renting or leasing vehicles pursuant to a written rental or lease agreement and
if the owner follows the procedures set forth in Section
309.08 of this Code.
   (e)   Except as provided in Section
309.08 of this code, when a parking ticket is issued for a Parking Infraction
and is served pursuant to this Section, the operator of the vehicle whose act
or omission resulted in the parking infraction for which the ticket was issued
and the owner of the vehicle involved in the parking infraction, if different,
are jointly liable for the parking infraction and any fines, penalties, fees
and costs arising out of the parking infraction.  Any owner of the vehicle who
pays any fines, penalties, fees and costs imposed for a parking infraction
pursuant to this Chapter may recover the amount paid from the operator of the
vehicle whose action or omission resulted in the parking infraction.  (Ord. 23-
10.  Passed 5-17-10.)
309.04  ANSWERS; PROCEDURES.
   (a)   A person who is personally or constructively served with a parking
ticket charging the commission of a parking infraction may answer the charge by
appearing personally before the Parking Violations Bureau, by mail or by
internet through an internet site provided on the ticket.  An answer shall be
made within fifteen (15) days from the date of the infraction, and shall be in
one of the following forms:
      (1)   An admission that the person committed the Parking Infraction, by
payment of any fine arising out of the Parking Infraction;
      (2)   An admission that the person committed the parking infraction, with
an explanation of the circumstances surrounding the parking infraction;
      (3)   A denial that the person committed the parking infraction and a
request for a hearing relative to such infraction.  If the person desires the
presence, at the hearing, of the Law Enforcement Officer or Civilian employee
who issued the parking ticket, the person must request their presence in their
answer.
   (b)   (1)   A person who admits that they committed a Parking Infraction
shall, and a person who admits that they committed a Parking Infraction with
explanation may, when they make their answer, pay the fine arising out of such
infraction admitted to the Violations Clerk of the Parking Violations Bureau.
      (2)   A person who admits that they committed a Parking Infraction with
explanation shall submit evidence to the Parking Violations Bureau that
explains the circumstances surrounding the Parking Infraction.  The evidence
may be submitted in person or, to avoid the necessity of personal appearance,
may be sent as affidavits and other documentary evidence, by mail.  When the
Hearing Examiner receives an answer admitting that a  person committed a
Parking Infraction with explanation, the Hearing Examiner shall promptly
determine whether the explanation mitigates the fact that the person committed
the Parking Infraction and notify the person, in writing, of their
determination.  If the Hearing Examiner determines that the explanation
mitigates the fact that the person committed the Parking Infraction, the
Parking Violations Bureau shall eliminate or reduce the amount of the fine
arising out of the Parking Infraction.  If the fine is eliminated or reduced
and the person has previously paid the fine, the amount paid in excess of the
revised fine shall be returned to the person; if the fine is eliminated or
reduced and the person has not previously paid the fine, the person shall pay
only the amount of the revised fine.  If the Hearing Examiner determines that
the explanation does not mitigate the fact that the person committed the
Parking Infraction, the person owes the entire amount of the fine.  If a person
admits that they committed a Parking Infraction with explanation and the person
fails to pay the amount of the fine due within ten (10) days after receiving
notice of the Hearing Examiner’s determination, unless the amount due has
previously been paid, the Hearing Examiner’s determination and the amount of
the fine due shall be considered a judgment and shall be treated as if it were
a judgment rendered subsequent to a hearing held pursuant to subsection (b) of
Section
309.06 of this Code.
      (3)   A person who denies that they committed a Parking Infraction shall
be granted a hearing concerning the infraction.  The Parking Violations Bureau
shall set a date for a hearing and notify the person, in writing, of the date,
time, and place of the hearing.  The hearing shall be conducted by a Hearing
Examiner in accordance with Section
309.06 of this Code.
   (c)   If a person who is personally or constructively served with a parking
ticket charging the commission of a Parking Infraction fails to timely answer
the charge, as provided in subsection (a) of this section, the Parking
Violations Bureau shall issue the proper notification of such infraction
pursuant to Section
309.05 of this Code, and proceed according to that Section.  Failure to answer
the charge within the fifteen (15) day period provided by subsection (a) of
this section, shall result in the imposition of an additional penalty of five
dollars ($5.00).
   (d)   The issuance of a parking ticket, the filing of or failure to file an
answer by a person personally or constructively served with the ticket, the
substance of an answer, the payment of any fines, penalties, fees and costs,
and any other relevant information shall be entered in the records of the
Parking Violations Bureau.
(Ord. 23-10.  Passed 5-17-10.)
309.05  FAILURE TO ANSWER.
   (a)   When a person is personally or constructively served with a parking
ticket charging the commission of a Parking Infraction in accordance with
Section
309.03 of this Code and the person fails to answer the charge within the time
specified in Section
309.04 of this Code, the Parking Violations Bureau shall send notifications of
infractions as follows:
      (1)   If the person who fails to answer was the operator of the vehicle
involved in the Parking Infraction at the time of the commission of the Parking
Infraction and was personally served with the parking ticket, a notification of
such infraction shall be sent to that person, and additionally if such person
is not the owner of the vehicle, as determined from the records of the Bureau
of Motor Vehicles, a notification of such infraction also shall be sent to the
owner at his most recent address appearing in such records;
      (2)   If the person who fails to answer was the owner of the vehicle and
was constructively served with the parking ticket, a notification of infraction
shall be sent to the owner at their most recent address appearing in the
records of the Bureau of Motor Vehicles.
   (b)   A notification of a Parking Infraction shall be sent within twelve
(12) months after the expiration of the time specified in Section
309.04 of this Code for the making of an answer, shall be sent by first class
mail, and shall contain all of the following:
      (1)   An identification of the Parking Infraction with which the person
was charged and the time and date of the Parking Infraction, which

(Ord. 23-10.  Passed 5-17-10.)
309.06  HEARING PROCEDURE.
   (a)   If a  person who is personally or constructively served with a parking
ticket charging the commission of a Parking Infraction or who receives a
notification of such infraction, in their answer to the charge denies that they
committed the infraction, the Hearing Examiner shall conduct a hearing to
determine if the person committed the Parking Infraction.  Each hearing shall
be conducted by a Hearing Examiner.  Each hearing shall be conducted in such
manner as the Hearing Examiner considers appropriate.  Rules regarding the
admissibility of evidence shall not be strictly applied in the hearing, but all
testimony shall be under oath.
   At the hearing, the City of Lakewood has the burden of proving, by a
preponderance of the evidence, that the person for whom the hearing is being
conducted committed the Parking Infraction.  If the person, in their answer,
denied that they committed the Parking Infraction and requested the presence at
the hearing of the Law Enforcement Officer or Civilian employee who issued the
parking ticket, the Law Enforcement Officer or Civilian employee shall be
required to attend the hearing unless the Hearing Examiner determines that such
officer’s presence is not required.  If such officer’s presence at the hearing
has been requested and such officer is unable to attend the hearing on the day
and at the time scheduled, the Hearing Examiner may grant a reasonable
continuance.  The person for whom the hearing is being conducted may present
any relevant evidence and testimony at the hearing.  The person does not have
to attend the hearing  if they submit documentary evidence to the Hearing
Examiner prior to the day of the hearing.
   The City of Lakewood shall submit the original parking ticket that was
personally or constructively served on the person or a true copy of that
ticket, and information from the Bureau of Motor Vehicles that identifies the
owner of the vehicle.  The ticket and the information in proper form is prima-
facie evidence that the registered owner of the vehicle was the person who
committed the Parking Infraction.  The City of Lakewood may present additional
evidence and testimony at the hearing.  The City of Lakewood does not have to
be represented at the hearing by an attorney.
   (b)   (1)   If a person for whom a hearing is to be conducted under
subsection (a) of this section appears at the scheduled hearing or submits
evidence in accordance with that subsection, the Hearing Examiner shall
consider all evidence and testimony presented and shall determine whether the
City of Lakewood has established, by a preponderance of evidence, that the
person committed such infraction.  If the Hearing Examiner determines that the
person committed such infraction, an order indicating the determination as a
judgment against the person and requiring the person to pay the appropriate
fines and any additional penalties, fees and costs shall be entered in the
records of the Parking Violations Bureau.
      (2)   If a person for whom a hearing is to be conducted under subsection
(a) of this section fails to appear at the scheduled hearing and fails to
submit evidence in accordance with that subsection, the Hearing Examiner shall,
if they determine from any evidence and testimony presented at the hearing, by
a preponderance of the evidence that the person committed the Parking
Infraction, enter a default judgment against the person and require the person
to pay the appropriate fines and any additional penalties, fees and costs.  A
default judgment entered under this subsection shall be entered in the records
of the Parking Violations Bureau.
      (3)   If a person who is sent a notification of a Parking Infraction
pursuant to Section
309.04 of this Code does not timely answer, as provided in subsection (c) of 
that section, the Hearing Examiner shall, if he determines from any evidence
and testimony presented to him by the local authority, by a preponderance of
the evidence, that the person committed the Parking Infraction, enter a default
judgment against the person and require the person to pay the appropriate fines
and any additional penalties, fees and costs.  A default judgement entered
under this subsection shall be entered in the records of the Parking Violations
Bureau.
      (4)   If the Hearing Examiner does not determine, by a preponderance of
the evidence, that a person in any of the classes described in subsection (b)
(1), (2) or (3) of this section committed the Parking Infraction, the Hearing
Examiner shall enter judgement against the City of Lakewood, shall dismiss the
charge of the Parking Infraction against the person, and shall enter the
judgment and dismissal in the records of the Parking Violations Bureau.
      (5)   A default judgment entered under this section may be vacated by the
Hearing Examiner who entered it if all of the following apply:
         A.   The person against whom the default judgment was entered files a
motion with the Parking Violations Bureau within one (1) year of the date of
entry of the judgment;
         B.   The motion sets forth a sufficient defense to the Parking
Infraction out of which the judgment arose; and
         C.   The motion sets forth excusable neglect as to the person’s
failure to attend the hearing or answer the notification of such infraction.
            (Ord. 23-2010.  Passed 5-17-2010.)
   (c)   Payment of any judgment or default judgment entered against a person
pursuant to this section shall be made to the Parking Violations Bureau in
which the judgment was entered within ten (10) days of the date of entry.  All
money paid in satisfaction of a judgment or default judgment shall be disbursed
by the Parking Violations Bureau to the City of Lakewood, Department of Finance
and the Parking Violations Bureau shall enter the fact of payment of the money
and disbursement in the records of the Parking Violations Bureau.  If payment
is not made within this time period, the judgment or default judgment may be
filed with the office of the Clerk of Courts, Civil Division, and when so
filed, shall have the same force and effect as a money judgment in a civil
action rendered in the court.
(Ord. 33-12.  Passed 7-2-2012.)
   (d)   Any person against whom a judgment or default judgement is entered
pursuant to this section and the City of Lakewood if judgement is entered
against the City pursuant to this section may appeal the judgement or default
judgement to the Lakewood Municipal Court by filing notices of appeal with the
Parking Violations Bureau and the Municipal Court within fifteen (15) days of
the date of entry of the judgement and by the payment of such reasonable costs
as the court requires.  Upon the filing of an appeal, the court shall schedule
a hearing date and notify the parties of the date, time and place of the
hearing.    The hearing shall be held by the court in accordance with the rules
of the court.  Service of a notice of appeal under this subsection by a person
does not stay enforcement and collection of the judgment or default judgment
from which appeal is taken by the person unless the person who files the appeal
posts bond with the Parking Violations Bureau in the amount of the judgment,
plus court costs, at or before service of the notice of appeal.
   Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the judgment on appeal of the
Municipal Court is final, and no other appeal of the judgment of the Parking
Violations Bureau and no appeal of the judgement of the Municipal Court may be
taken.
(Ord. 23-10.  Passed 5-17-2010.)
   (e)   A default judgement entered pursuant to this section may be filed with
the Municipal Court, office of the Clerk of Courts, Civil Division, under
subsection (c) of this section at any time within three (3) years after the
date of issuance of the parking ticket charging the Parking Infraction out of
which the judgment arose.  This division applies to any ticket issued for an
offense that would be a parking infraction on or after the effective date of
this section, if the ticket was issued within three years prior to the
effective date of this section and a warrant has not been issued and served on
the operator or owner of the vehicle involved in the offense.
(Ord. 56-10.  Passed 7-19-2010.)

      (3)   If an answer to the summons and complaint is made and the answer
denies the commission of such infraction, a bond shall be posted, or cash shall

this section.
      (4)   If no answer to the summons and complaint is made, a bond shall be

(Ord. 23-10.  Passed 5-17-2010.)
309.08  NON-LIABILITY OF OWNER.
   (a)   An owner of a vehicle is not jointly liable with an operator of the
vehicle whose act or omission results in a Parking Infraction for the Parking
Infraction or any fines, penalties, fees or costs arising out of the Parking
Infraction under this Chapter if either of the following applies:
      (1)   The owner answers the charge of the Parking Infraction under
Sections
309.04 or
309.05 of this Code, the answer denies that they committed such infraction and
requests a hearing concerning such infraction, the owner additionally asserts
and provides reasonable evidence at that time to prove  that the vehicle, at
the time of the commission of the Parking Infraction, was being used by the
operator without the owner’s expressed or implied consent, or the Parking
Violations Bureau determines that the vehicle was being used without the
owner’s expressed or implied consent at that time.
         If the Parking Violations Bureau does not so determine, it shall
conduct the hearing concerning such infraction according to Section
309.06 of this Code.
      (2)   The owner answers the charge of the Parking Infraction under
Section
309.04 or
309.05 of this Code, the answer denies that he committed the Parking

engaged in the business of renting or leasing vehicles under written rental or
lease agreements, and the owner additionally submits evidence that proves that,
at the time of the alleged commission of the Parking Infraction, the vehicle in
question was in the care, custody or control of a person other than the owner
pursuant to a written rental or lease agreement.  If the owner does not so
prove, the Parking Violations Bureau shall conduct a hearing relative to such
infraction according to Section
309.06 of this Code.
      (3)   The owner, at a hearing concerning the Parking Infraction conducted
in accordance with Section
309.06 of this Code, proves that the vehicle, at the time of the Parking

implied consent or proves the facts described in subsection (a)(2) of this
section.
   (b)   An owner of a vehicle who is engaged in the business of renting or
leasing vehicles under written rental or lease agreements, is not liable for
any penalties arising out of a Parking Infraction involving the vehicle if at
the time of the commission of the Parking Infraction, the vehicle was in the
care, custody or control of a person other than the owner pursuant to a written
rental or lease agreement, and if the owner answers the charge of the Parking
Infraction by denying that they committed the Parking Infraction or by paying
the fine arising out of the Parking Infraction within thirty (30) days after
actual receipt of the parking ticket charging such infraction or, if the owner
did not receive the parking ticket within thirty (30) days after receipt of
notification of infraction.
   (c)   Proof that the vehicle was in the care, custody or control of a person
other than the owner pursuant to a written rental or lease agreement at the
time of the alleged Parking Infraction shall be established by sending a true
copy of the rental or lease agreement or an affidavit to that effect to the
Parking Violations Bureau within thirty (30) days after the date of receipt by
the owner of the parking ticket charging such infraction or, if the owner did
not receive the parking ticket within thirty (30) days after receipt of the
notification of such infraction.  The submission of a true copy of a written
rental or lease agreement or affidavit shall be prima-facie evidence that a
vehicle was in the care, custody or control of a person other than the owner. 
In addition, any information required by subsection (a)(2) of this section may
be provided on magnetic tape or another computer readable media in a format
acceptable to the City of Lakewood or the Parking Violations Bureau.  (Ord. 23-

the Registrar of Motor Vehicles.  The notice shall be given not earlier than
sixteen (16) days nor later than three (3) years after the date of entry of the
third judgment, and shall be in a form and manner, and contain such

of the Bureau of Motor Vehicles in administering this section.  Upon payment of
the fee, the Parking Violations Bureau shall give the person a release to be

313.02  THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section.  Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations.  When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction.  Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of
that proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing
or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways.  For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway
or portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical
terminus of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at
which vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or
yield to traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence
districts the Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway,
or portion thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected
residence district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. 
Where two or more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b)
intersect and no traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield
signs shall be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department

within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection.  The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or

for a violation of (a)(1)A. of this section or for any equivalent offense, that
is vehicle-related the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn and
analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may be
admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.     In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant's whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation.  The three-hour time limit
specified in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not
extend or affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as
the maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test
or tests as described in that section.
The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse,
or a combination of them as described in this section when a person submits to
a blood, breath, urine or other bodily substance test at the request of a law
enforcement officer under Ohio R.C. 4511.191, or a blood or urine sample is
obtained pur-suant to a search warrant.  Only a physician, a registered nurse,
an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency medical technician-
paramedic, or a qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist shall withdraw a
blood sample for the purpose of determining the alcohol, drug, controlled
substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination content of the
whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma.  This limitation does not apply to
the taking of breath or urine specimens.  A person authorized to withdraw blood
under this subsection may refuse to withdraw blood under this subsection, if in
that person's opinion, the physical welfare of the person would be endangered
by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under subsection (e)(1)B.  hereof shall be
analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
indi vidual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.
         C.    As used in subsection (e)(1)B of this section, "emergency
medical technician-intermediate" and "emergency medical technician-paramedic"
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)     In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent evi-
dence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.  This subsection
does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding
for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)     Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person's attorney,
immediately up on the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B.  hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person's own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person's expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer.  If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person's own
expense.  If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)
(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as
required under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an
independent test performed at the person's expense.  The failure or inability
to obtain an additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the
admission of evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the
request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.     As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
"national highway traffic safety administration" means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.     In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.     The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.     The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.     If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.     Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude
a court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported
by probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section.  (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)     Forensic Laboratory Reports.
      (1)     Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)

      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant's attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)     A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount
of any substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report
pertains or the defendant's attorney receives a copy of the report, the
defendant or the defendant's attorney demands the testimony of the person who
signed the report.  The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit
in the interest of justice.
   (g)     Immunity from Liability for Withdrawing Blood.  Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical

hours of one a.m. and five a.m. and has in the holder's immediate possession
written documentation from the holder's employer.
      (3)   An employer is not liable in damages in a civil action for any
injury, death, or loss to person or property that allegedly arises from, or is
related to, the fact that the employer provided an employee who is the holder
of a probationary driver's license with the written documentation described in
subsection (a)(2) .
   The registrar of motor vehicles shall make available at no cost a form to
serve as the written documentation described in subsection (a)(2), and
employers and holders of probationary driver's licenses may utilize that form
or may choose to utilize any other written documentation to meet the
requirements of that division.
      (4)   No holder of a probationary driver's license who is less than
seventeen years of age shall operate a motor vehicle upon a highway or any
public or private property used by the public for purposes of vehicular travel
or parking with more than one person who is not a family member occupying the
vehicle unless the probationary license holder is accompanied by the
probationary license holder's parent, guardian, or custodian.
   (b)   It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection (a)(1)A. or
B. hereof if, at the time of the violation, the holder of the probationary
driver's license was traveling to or from an official function sponsored by the
school the holder attends, or an emergency existed that required the holder to
operate a motor vehicle in violation of subsection (a)(1)A. or B. hereof, or
the holder was an emancipated minor.
   (c)   (1)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c)(2) hereof,
if a person is issued a probationary driver's license prior to attaining the
age of seventeen years and the person pleads guilty to, is convicted of, or is
adjudicated in juvenile court of having committed a moving violation during the
six-month period commencing on the date on which the person is issued the
probationary driver's license, the holder must be accompanied by the holder's
parent or guardian whenever the holder is operating a motor vehicle upon a
highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking during whichever of the following time periods
applies:
            1.   If, on the date the holder of the probationary driver's
license pleads guilty to, is convicted of, or is adjudicated in juvenile court
of having committed the moving violation, the holder has not attained the age
of sixteen years six months, during the six-month period commencing on that
date;
            2.   If, on the date the holder pleads guilty to, is convicted of,
or is adjudicated in juvenile court of having committed the moving violation,
the holder has attained the age of sixteen years six months but not seventeen
years, until the person attains the age of seventeen years.
         B.   If the holder of a probationary driver's license commits a moving
violation during the six-month period after the person is issued the
probationary driver's license and before the person attains the age of
seventeen years and on the date the person pleads guilty to, is convicted of,
or is adjudicated in juvenile court of having committed the moving violation,
the person has attained the age of seventeen  years, or if the person commits
the moving violation during the six-month period after the person is issued the
probationary driver's license and after the person attains the age of seventeen
years, the holder is not subject to the restriction described in subsection (c)
(1)A.1. and 2. hereof unless the court or juvenile court imposes such a
restriction upon the holder.
      (2)   Any person who is subject to the operating restrictions established
under subsection (c)(1) of this section as a result of a first moving violation
may petition the court for occupational or educational driving privileges
without being accompanied by the holder's parent or guardian during the period
of time specified in that subsection.  The court may grant the person such
driving privileges if the court finds reasonable cause to believe that the
restrictions established in subsection (c)(1) will seriously affect the
person's ability to continue in employment or educational training or will
cause undue hardship on the license holder or a family member of the license
holder.  In granting the driving privileges, the court shall specify the
purposes, times, and places of the privileges and shall issue the person
appropriate forms setting forth the privileges granted.  Occupational or
educational driving privileges under this subsection shall not be granted to
the same person more than once.  If a person is convicted of, pleads guilty to,
or is adjudicated in juvenile court of having committed a second or subsequent
moving violation, any driving privileges previously granted under this
subsection are terminated upon the subsequent conviction, plea, or
adjudication.
      (3)   No person shall violate subsection (c)(1)A. hereof.
   (d)   No holder of a probationary license shall operate a motor vehicle upon
a highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking unless the total number of occupants of the vehicle
does not exceed the total number of occupant restraining devices originally
installed in the motor vehicle by its manufacturer, and each occupant of the
vehicle is wearing all of the available elements of a properly adjusted
occupant restraining device.
   (e)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether each occupant of the motor vehicle is wearing all of the
available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device as
required by subsection (d) hereof, or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket,
citation, or summons if the requirement in that subsection has been or is being
violated, or for causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person
for a violation of that requirement.
   (f)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of subsection (a)(1)A. or B. hereof has been or
is being committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket, citation, or
summons for such a violation or for causing the arrest of or commencing a
prosecution of a person for such violation.
   (g)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Occupant restraining device" has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C.
4513.263.
      (2)   "Family member" of a probationary license holder includes any of
the following:
         A.   A spouse;
         B.   A child or stepchild;

if the stepparent has not adopted the probationary license holder;
         G.   An eligible adult, as defined in Ohio R.C. 4507.05.
      (3)   "Moving violation" means any violation of any statute or ordinance
that regulates the operation of vehicles, streetcars, or trackless trolleys on
the highways or streets.  "Moving violation" does not include a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4513.263 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a
violation of any statute or ordinance regulating pedestrians or the parking of
vehicles, vehicle size or load limitations, vehicle fitness requirements, or
vehicle registration.
   (h)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.

   (b)   Without limiting or precluding the consideration of any other evidence
in determining whether a violation of subsection (a)(1), (2), (3), (4) or (5)
of this section has occurred, it shall be prima-facie evidence that the
offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the operator of the
motor vehicle owned by the offender or under the offender's control is in a
category described in subsection (a)(1), (2), (3), (4) or (5) of this section

the vehicle involved in the offense and the impoundment of that vehicle's
license plates.  If issued, the order shall be issued and enforced under Ohio
R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4511.203 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordi-nance, the court may order the criminal forfeiture to

forfeiture under this subsection is assigned or transferred and division (B)(2)
or (3) of Ohio R.C. 4503.234 applies, in addition to or independent of any
other penalty established by law, the court may fine the offender the value of

   (e)   If a court orders the criminal forfeiture of a vehicle under
subsection (c) of this section, upon receipt of the order from the court,
neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor any deputy registrar shall accept
any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any motor
vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the order.  The period of denial
shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the
termination.  If the court terminates the forfeiture and notifies the

properly made and the operator has the operator's driver's license on or about
the operator's person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license.  A
person's failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person's license
on or about the person's person shall be prima-facie evidence of the person's
not having obtained a driver's license.
   
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (b)(2) hereof, whoever violates
this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor.  When the offense is an

the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has

occupant restraining device impossible or impractical, provided that the person
operating the vehicle has safely and appropriately restrained the child in
accordance with any recommendations of the physician or chiropractor as noted
on the affidavit.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that
the child was not of an age to which this section applies is a defense against
any ticket, citation or summons issued for violating this section.

the offender is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and shall be fined not less than
twenty-five dollars ($25.00) nor more than seventy-five dollars ($75.00).

evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in the tort action
and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that represents noneconomic
loss, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011 in a tort action that could have been

sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in

this section, it is an affirmative defense to the charge that the person
suffered an injury not more than seventy-two hours prior to the time the person
was issued the ticket or citation and that, because of the injury, the person
meets at least one of the criteria contained in Ohio R.C. 4503.44(A)(1).

   (b)   The desirability of expediting travel during normal and peak hours of

   (e)      Economy in the expenditure of money. (Ord. 37-10.  Passed 7-19-
2010.)
355.02  DESIGNATION OF PARKING SPACES.
   The Director of Public Safety is hereby directed and authorized to mark off
individual parking spaces in the parking zones designated and described in
Section
355.01 and in such other zones as may hereafter be established, such parking
spaces to be designated by lines painted or durably marked on the curbing or
surface of the street. At each space so marked off, no person shall park any
vehicle in such a way that such vehicle is not entirely within the limits of
the space so designated.
(Ord. 37-10.  Passed 7-19-2010.)
355.03  INSTALLATION OF METERS.

of parking meters and the fee per unit of time to be paid by the operator of
any vehicle occupying a designated parking space controlled by a parking meter.
Said Schedule shall be filed with the Clerk of Council. If Council fails to
reject said Schedule within sixty days, said Schedule shall become effective.
   (c)   Each device shall be so set as to display a signal showing legal
parking upon the deposit of the appropriate fee as established in the Municipal
Parking  Schedule. Each device shall be arranged so that upon the expiration of
the lawful time limit it will indicate, by a proper visible signal, that the
lawful parking period has expired. At such time the right of such vehicle to
occupy such space shall cease and the operator, owner, possessor or manager
thereof shall be subject to the penalties hereinafter provided. (Ord. 37-10.

parking space to which a parking meter assigned, the operator of such vehicle
shall, upon entering the parking meter space, immediately make or cause to be
made in the meter such proper payment as is required for such parking meter and
as is designated by proper directions on the meter, and when required by the
directions on the meter, the operator of such vehicle, after making the proper
payment, shall also set in operation the timing mechanism on such meter in
accordance with directions properly appearing thereon, and failure to make such
proper payment, and to set the timing mechanism in operation when so required,
shall constitute a violation of this section. Upon making of such proper
payment (and the setting of the timing mechanism in operation when so required)
the parking space may be lawfully occupied by such vehicle during the period of
time which has been prescribed for the part of the street in which the parking
space is located. Any person placing a vehicle in a parking meter space
assigned to a meter which indicates that unused time has been left in the meter
by the previous occupant of the space shall not be required to make a proper
payment so long as his occupancy of such space does not exceed the indicated
unused parking time. If such vehicle remains parked in any such parking space
beyond the parking time limit set for such parking space, and if the meter
indicates such illegal parking, then such vehicle shall be considered as
parking overtime and beyond the period of legal parking time, and such parking
shall be deemed a violation of this section. 
   (b)   As used in this section, "proper payment" means payment by U.S.
currency, a credit card transaction, a cellular phone application, any
combination of them, or any other method as designated by directions on the
meter.  (Ord. 37-17.  Passed 7-2-2018.)

tests in addition to any administered at the direction of a law enforcement
officer and shall be so advised. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional test by a person shall not preclude the admission of evidence
relating to the test or tests taken at the direction of a law enforcement
officer.

element of which takes place in this Municipality;
      (2)   While in this Municipality, he conspires or attempts to commit, or
is guilty of complicity in the commission of an offense in another
jurisdiction, which offense is an offense under both the laws of this
Municipality and such other jurisdiction;
      (3)   While out of this Municipality, he conspires or attempts to commit,
or is guilty of complicity in the commission of an offense in this
Municipality;
      (4)   While out of this Municipality, he omits to perform a legal duty
imposed by the laws of this Municipality, which omission affects a legitimate
interest of the Municipality in protecting, governing or regulating any person,
property, thing, transaction or activity in this Municipality;
      (5)   While out of this Municipality, he unlawfully takes or retains
property and subsequently brings any of such property into this Municipality;
      (6)   While out of this Municipality, he unlawfully takes or entices
another and subsequently brings such other person into this Municipality.

501.06  LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be
barred unless it is commenced within the following periods after an offense is
committed:
(1)   For a misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
(2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for an offense of which an element is
fraud or breach of a fiduciary duty, within one year after discovery of the
offense either by an aggrieved person, or by his legal representative who is
not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for an offense involving misconduct in
office by a public servant as defined in Section
525.01, at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.

delicti remains undiscovered.

evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process which commenced the prosecution
is quashed or the proceedings thereon are set aside or reversed on appeal. (ORC
2901.13)
   (i)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R. C. 718.06(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07  REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   His liability is based on conduct which includes either a voluntary
act, or an omission to perform an act or duty which he is capable of
performing;
      (2)   He has the requisite degree of culpability for each element as to
which a culpable mental state is specified by the section defining the offense.
   (b)   When the section defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in such section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. When the section neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, recklessness is sufficient culpability to commit the offense.
   (c)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense.  Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense.  Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (d)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of his control thereof for a
sufficient time to have ended his possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   “Culpability” means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (Ord. 13-02.  Passed 9-3-02.)
501.08  CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is his specific intention to cause a
certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition against
conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is his specific intention to engage in conduct of that
nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of his purpose, when he is aware
that his conduct will probably cause a certain result or will probably be of a
certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when he is aware that
such circumstances probably exist.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, he perversely disregards a known risk that his conduct is likely
to cause a certain result or is likely to be of a certain nature. A person is
reckless with respect to circumstances when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, he perversely disregards a known risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, he fails to perceive or avoid a risk that his conduct may cause a
certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is negligent with
respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse from due care, he
fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09  ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense under this General
Offenses Code, shall engage in conduct which, if successful, would constitute
or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense which was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense, of
complicity in the commission of an offense, or of conspiracy to commit an
offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to commit the same offense in
violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned his or her effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense, an offense of the next lesser degree than the offense attempted. In
the case of an attempt to commit an offense not specifically classified, an
attempt is a misdemeanor of the first degree if the offense attempted is a
felony, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor, or to engage in
conspiracy, is not an offense under this section.
(ORC 2923.02)
501.10  COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the

      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Conspire with another to commit the offense in violation of Ohio
R.C. 2923.01 (Conspiracy);
      (4)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense, or an offense, the court, when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
or her complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or
claimed complicity of a witness may affect his or her credibility and make his
or her testimony subject to grave suspicion and require that it be weighed with
great caution.
   “It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth.”
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his or her complicity under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he or she
were the principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of
this section or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11  ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.

following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
his office or employment, except that if the section defining the offense
designates the officers, agents or employees for whose conduct the organization
is accountable or the circumstances under which it is accountable, such
provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
his office or employment, except that if the section defining the offense
designates the officers, agents or employees for whose conduct the organization
is accountable or the circumstances under which it is accountable, such
provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of his office or employment.
   (b)   When strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, “organization” means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated association, estate, trust or other commercial or legal entity.

   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf.
(ORC 2901.24)
501.13  VICTIM NOTIFICATION.

disposition of the charges.  If no charge or charges result from the death,
then the victim’s family or representative shall be so notified.
   (d)   The failure of a public official or public agency to comply with the
requirements of this chapter does not give rise to a claim for damages against
that public official or public agency.  (Ord. 150-02.  Passed 12-16-02.)
501.99  PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.

road;

hour period and not more than two (2) consecutive hours with no less than a one

animal or livestock is forfeited and sold pursuant to this subsection, the
proceeds from the sale first shall be applied to pay the expenses incurred with
regard to the care of the animal from the time it was taken from the custody of
the former owner. The balance of the proceeds from the sale, if any, shall be
paid to the former owner of the animal.
   (d)   Whoever violates subsection (b) of this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the fourth degree on the first offense, or a misdemeanor of the

exemption.
      (7)   The Detector of Public Safety shall notify Council at least 30 days

      (1)   Zoning Districts. Hens may be kept only in an R1 Residential Single
- Family or R2 Residential Single- and Two - Family District.
      (2)   Application, Permit and Renewal. Before the keeping of hens may
occur, an annual permit shall have first been obtained from the Director of
Public Safety. The permit application must be accompanied by a $25.00 fee paid
to the City. New permit applications shall include the following information:
the name, phone number, home address and email address of the applicant; the
size and location of the subject property; a proposal containing the number of
hens the applicant seeks to keep on the property; a description of any coop or
outdoor enclosure providing precise dimensions and the precise location of
these enclosures in relation to property lines and adjacent properties, with
specifications and drawings if available; a certificate or letter showing that
the applicant has taken a class in keeping backyard hens from the Ohio State
University Extension or other source approved by the Director of Public Safety;
the permission of the property owner for the applicant to keep hens, if the
applicant is not the owner; and the applicant's permission for any City

the applicant is in compliance with all applicable codes.
      (3)   Inspection. Within 30 days of the Director of Public Safety or his
or her designee receiving the initial application, he or she shall cause the
lot to be inspected. The person(s) inspecting the premises shall determine if
the lot dimensions in the application are accurate; determine the feasibility
of the applicant meeting the remaining criteria in this subsection (e); and
note whether any extraordinary circumstances exist, such as outstanding
property citations or unsanitary property conditions, or such as the
applicant's proximity to other approved or proposed coops such that a
neighborhood may be adversely impacted, that would militate against the
granting of the application. For new permit applications, an inspection of the
coop and any fencing shall be conducted within 30 days' notice from the
applicant that the coop has been installed.
   A determination shall be made, within 30 days of the inspection, whether the
permit should be issued.
      (4)   Personal Use; Limitations. Hens may be kept only for personal use
by persons residing in the principal structure on the lot on which the hens are
kept. No hens may be kept on a lot containing more than three dwelling units.

that lot. No more than six hens shall be allowed on any lot.
      (5)   Setbacks. Coops or accessory structures housing hens shall be kept
at least three feet from the side and rear property lines. All such structures
shall be located no less than 20 feet behind the rearmost wall of the principal
structure on the lot.
      (6)   Enclosure. The base surface of a coop and run must not exceed 80
square feet and six feet in height and shall be exempt from the lot coverage
restrictions contained in the Zoning Code. Hens shall not be allowed out of
these enclosures unless the rear yard of the property is fenced along the rear
and side lot lines, and a resident of the property on which the hens are kept
is directly monitoring them within the fenced area of the back yard such that
the resident is able to immediately return the hens to the cage or coop if
necessary. The manufacturer's specifications for the coop, or otherwise
adequate drawings including dimensions, shall be submitted for approval
together with the application for the permit. Hens shall be kept in a covered,
predator-proof coop that is well-ventilated and designed to be accessed for
cleaning. The enclosure shall be of uniform and sturdy design and constructed
of quality materials. Fencing, if used, shall be securely fastened to posts of
reasonable strength firmly set into the ground and shall be stretched tightly
between support posts. The enclosure shall be maintained in good repair at all
times so as to protect the aesthetics of the neighborhood and to not present a
blighted or untidy appearance to the property or to neighbors. Hens shall have
access to an outdoor enclosure or run that is adequately fenced to contain the
hens on the property, to prevent them from running at large, and to prevent
access by predators. The combined area of the coop and run shall allow at least
three square feet per hen, and shall otherwise be constructed to provide humane
conditions and to ensure the health and well-being of the animals occupying it
are not endangered by the manner of keeping or confinement.
      (7)   Sanitation; Slaughtering. The coop and outdoor enclosure must be
kept clean, dry and sanitary; free from debris and offensive odors; and devoid
of rodents and vermin. It shall be so located that adequate drainage is
obtained, normal drying occurs and standing water is not present.  The coop and
outdoor enclosure must be cleaned on a regular basis to prevent the
accumulation of waste. All feed must be stored in a rodent - proof container.
No hens shall be slaughtered except in accordance with, and only if permitted
by, Chapter 918 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (8)   Number and Transferability. Within the first year of the effective
date of this section, no more than 24 non - transferable permits shall be
issued pursuant to this subsection (e). At the first anniversary of the
effective date of this section and at each anniversary thereafter, an
additional 13 non - transferable permits may be issued pursuant to this
subsection (e), except that at no time shall the total number of permits issued
in the City exceed 50. Initial applications shall be kept on file by the
Director of Public Safety and considered in order of their receipt.
      (9)   Permit Revocation. The Director of Public Safety may revoke a
permit at any time if the permit holder materially fails to adhere to the
provisions of this subsection (e).

permit may be appealed to the Board of Building Standards pursuant to Section
1173.05.

is it intended by the City as a guaranty or warranty of any kind, whether
express or implied to any person, including without limitation the general
public, persons residing or passing near the applicant's premises, or the
applicant, either in general or individually, as to the danger, or lack
thereof, or degree of risk to health or safety of any animal, specifically or

that dog, by certified mail or in person, of both of the following:
      (1)   That the person has designated the dog a nuisance dog, dangerous

hearing regarding the designation in accordance with this section. The notice
shall include instructions for filing a request for a hearing in the county in
which the dog's owner, keeper, or harborer resides.
   (b)   If the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog disagrees with the
designation of the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, as
applicable, the owner, keeper, or harborer, not later than ten days after
receiving notification of the designation, may request a hearing regarding the
determination. The request for a hearing shall be in writing and shall be filed
with the municipal court that has territorial jurisdiction over the residence
of the dog's owner, keeper, or harborer. At the hearing, the person who

the court makes a final determination and during the pendency of any appeal,
the dog shall be confined or restrained in accordance with the provisions of
division (D) of section 955.22 of the Revised Code that apply to dangerous dogs
regardless of whether the dog has been designated as a vicious dog or a

dog shall not be required to comply with any other requirements established in
the Revised Code that concern a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, as
applicable, until the court makes a final determination and during the pendency
of any appeal.
   (d)   If a dog is finally determined under this section, or on appeal as

respect to the dog and the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog as if the dog
were a dangerous dog, and section 955.54 of the Revised Code applies with
respect to the dog as if it were a dangerous dog, and the court shall issue an
order that specifies that those provisions apply with respect to the dog and
the owner, keeper, or harborer in that manner. As part of the order, the court
shall require the owner, keeper, or harborer to obtain the liability insurance

lieu of arrest or citation.
   (c)   Initiation of Nuisance Declaration Process.  The Director of Public
Safety or his or her designee, upon finding that two or more nuisance
activities or any one felony as outlined in subsection (a) have occurred within
a twelve-month period, may cause a written notice and order to be served on the
owner of the property.  The notice shall declare that if a third nuisance
activity, or any additional felony as outlined in subsection (a) hereof occurs
within a twelve-month period of the first nuisance activity, such property
shall be declared a nuisance property. The notice and order shall set forth the
nature of the nuisances and the estimated costs to abate any future nuisance
and shall state that the owner may avoid being charged the costs of abatement
by taking steps to prevent any further nuisance activity as set forth in this
section.  The notice shall further state that the City may abate the nuisance
by responding to the activities using administrative and law enforcement
actions and the costs of such abatement shall be assessed on the nuisance
property as set forth in subsection (g).  Notice shall be served pursuant to
the Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure.
   (d)   Nuisance Declaration.  If a third nuisance activity as declared in

Director of Public Safety or his or her designee may declare the property to be
a nuisance under this chapter.  Once a property has been declared a nuisance
then any subsequent occurrence of any activity listed in subsection (a) may
cause another nuisance declaration.  The cost of responding to the nuisance
activity shall be assessed on the nuisance property. The nuisance declaration
may come before or after the City has incurred the response costs. The costs
shall be calculated as set forth in subsection (g) hereof. The City shall
provide notice to the owner of the nuisance property to pay the costs of
abatement at least thirty (30) days before such costs are certified to the
County Auditor for assessment against the property, and such notice shall
contain a description of the nuisance activity that is the basis for the notice
of intent to assess the property, and the cost to abate.  If the same is not
paid within thirty (30) days of the mailing of the notice, such amount may be
certified to the County Auditor for collection as other taxes and assessments
are collected, or the City may seek recovery of such costs by civil action.
Notice shall be served pursuant to the Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure.
(Ord. 23-08.  Passed 12-15-2008.)
   (e)   Reconsideration Request.  The owner of a nuisance property who
receives a nuisance declaration notice from the Director of Public Safety or
his or her designee pursuant to subsection (d) may appeal such notice by
submitting a written request for reconsideration to the Director of Public
Safety within thirty (30) days of the date of the nuisance declaration notice. 
If the Director of Public Safety or his or her designee finds that the facts
presented do not constitute a public nuisance then the Director of Public
Safety or his or her designee shall rescind the notice. Otherwise the Director
of Public Safety or his or her designee shall deny the request and advise the
appellant in writing of the denial and of the appellant’s right to file an
appeal to the Board of Nuisance Abatement Appeals.
   (f)   Appeal to the Board of Nuisance Abatement Appeals.  The owner may
appeal the denial of the request for reconsideration by submitting a written
appeal letter to the Board of Nuisance Abatement Appeals within thirty (30)
days of the date of the denial.  Any such appeal shall not stay any actions by
the City to abate the first or any subsequent nuisance activity.  In any such
appeal, the City must show by a preponderance of the evidence that each
nuisance activity stated in the notice being appealed, or if the activities
stated in the notice number more than three, each nuisance activity for which
the City seeks compensation, has occurred, and that the declaration of the
property as a nuisance property or of the intent of the City to assess the
property for abatement costs, whichever is applicable, is justified.  If a
nuisance activity has been evidenced by a criminal conviction then it shall be
per se proof that the activity has occurred. 
   The City shall be deemed to have failed to meet this standard if the owner
demonstrates by a preponderance of evidence that:
      (1)   He or she was not the owner at the time of any of the nuisance
activity that is the basis of the notice; or
      (2)   He or she had knowledge of the nuisance activity, but has promptly
and vigorously taken all actions necessary to abate each nuisance including,
without limitation, compliance with the requirements of Ohio R.C. 5321.17(C)
and 5321.04(A)(9); or
      (3)   He or she had no knowledge of the nuisance activity and could not
with reasonable care and diligence, have known of the nuisance activity; and
upon receipt of the notice of the declaration of the property as a nuisance
property, he or she promptly took all actions necessary to abate the nuisance
including without limitation, compliance with the requirements of Ohio R.C.
5321.17(C) and 5321.04(A)(9).
         (Ord. 23-08.  Passed 12-15-2008.)
   (g)   Costs of abatement shall be the actual cost based upon expenses and
the hourly wage of any personnel involved in the response to the nuisance
activity defined in subsection (d) and any related notice and declaration
proceedings.
(Ord. 25-12.  Passed 3-19-2012.)
   (h)   The declaration of a nuisance property, an order to abate a nuisance,
or the assessment of costs by the City on a property, does not affect or limit
the City’s right or authority to bring criminal prosecution or other legal
action against any person for violation of the City’s ordinances.  (Ord. 23-
08.  Passed 12-15-2008.)

515.09  INSPECTIONS BY BUILDING COMMISSIONER OR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS.
   The Building Commissioner and/or law enforcement officers shall, in addition
to any other authority vested in them, have the power, upon presentation of
proper credentials, to enter and inspect any private property or place, and
inspect any report or records at any reasonable time when granted permission by
the owner, or by some other person with apparent authority to act for the
owner. When permission is refused or cannot be obtained, a search warrant may
be obtained from a court of competent jurisdiction upon showing of probable
cause to believe that a violation of this chapter may exist. Such inspection
may include administration of any necessary tests.
(Ord. 66-76. Passed -12-6-76. )
515.10  STOPPING AND TESTING OF MOTOR VEHICLES BY LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS.
   The law enforcement officer shall, in addition to any other authority vested
in him, have the power to stop and test any motor vehicle or motorcycle
operated on a public right of way or public space, reasonably suspected of
violating any provision of this chapter, and issue a notice of violation or
abatement order.  (Ord. 66-76. Passed 12-6-76.)
515.11  EMERGENCY EXCEPTION.
   The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to the emission of sound for
the purpose of alerting persons to the existence of an emergency, or the
emission of sound in the performance of emergency work. (Ord. 66-76. Passed 12-
6-76.)
515.12  SPECIAL VARIANCES.
   (a)   The Building Commissioner shall have the authority, consistent with
this section, to grant special variances.
   (b)   Any person seeking a special variance pursuant to this section shall
file an application with the Building Commissioner. The application shall
contain information which demonstrates that bringing the source of sound or
activity for which the special variance is sought into compliance with this
chapter would constitute an unreasonable hardship on the applicant, on the
community, or on other persons. Notice of an application for a special variance
shall be given by the Commissioner to persons who frequent the area of the
sound or activity and who may be adversely affected by the granting of the
variance. Any individual who claims to be adversely affected by allowance of
the special variance may file a statement with the Commissioner containing any
information to support his claim.
   (c)    In determining whether to grant or deny the application, the
Commissioner shall balance the hardship to the applicant, the community, and
other persons of not granting the special variance against the adverse impact
on the health, safety and welfare of persons affected, the adverse impact on
property affected, and any other adverse impacts of granting the special

others, any right afforded him or her by the employer's smoking policy or by
this chapter.

541.01  DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section

      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing which is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount which would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, “fair market value” has the same meaning as
defined in Section
545.02(c)(3).
   (c)   Prima-facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Section
545.02(d) may be used to establish the value of property pursuant to this
section. (ORC 2909.11)

State or a political subdivision, and that is used for public purposes.
(Ord. 42-02.  Passed 9-3-2002.)

radioactive material, caustic or corrosive material, or other inherently

involved in the offense.

545.15 or

committed by the offender in his same employment, capacity or relationship to
another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single offense.  The value
of the property or services involved for the purpose of determining the value
is the aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in
the series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If an offender is being

services involved for the purpose of determining the value is the aggregate
value of all property and services involved in all of the offenses in the
course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series. 
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in his same employment,
capacity or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)(1) of this
section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims
or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection (b)(2) of this
section.

property or services involved in a theft offense:

museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing which has intrinsic
worth to its owner and which is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount which would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(l) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing such
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any property, real or personal, not covered under
subsections (c)(l) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair market
value of such property or services. As used in this section, “fair market
value” is the money consideration which a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which such property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of such security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
such livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of such instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services which may be received thereby, is
prima-facie evidence of the value of such instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of such
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for such services, either in writing, or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in such notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of such
services.

777.01  PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.
   (a)   Purpose.  The purpose of this chapter is to establish reasonable and
uniform regulations to minimize and control the negative secondary effects of
Sexually Oriented Businesses within the City in order to promote the health,
safety, and welfare of the citizens of the City. The provisions of this chapter
have neither the purpose nor the effect of imposing a limitation or restriction
on the content of any communicative materials or communication, including
sexually oriented entertainment. Similarly, it is not the purpose of effect of
this chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented
entertainment protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by
distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their
intended market. Furthermore, it is not the intent of effect of this chapter to
condone or legitimize the distribution or exhibition of entertainment that is
obscene.
   (b)   Findings. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects
of Sexually Oriented Businesses on the community presented in hearings before
the Council; on findings incorporated in the cases of the City of Renton v.
Playtime Theaters, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986), Young v. American Mini Theaters,
426 U.S. 50 (1976); and on studies in other cities including New York, New
York; Islip, New York; Los Angeles, California; Indianapolis, Indiana;
Whittier, California; Austin, Texas; and Phoenix, Arizona; along with Manatee
County, Florida; New Hanover County, North Carolina; and the State of
Minnesota; this Council finds:
      (1)   Sexually Oriented Businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful
and unhealthy activities.
      (2)   Sexual acts, including masturbation and oral and anal sex, occur at
Sexually Oriented Businesses, especially those which provide private or semi-
private booths or rooms for viewing films, videos, or live sexually-oriented
entertainment. Such activities may result in spreading communicable diseases
such as syphilis, gonorrhea, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
      (3)   Offering sexually oriented entertainment under conditions that
encourage such activities creates unhealthy conditions.
      (4)   Sanitary conditions in some Sexually Oriented Businesses are
unhealthy, in part because of the failure of owners and operators to regulate
those activities and maintain their facilities.
      (5)   Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in
the areas of Sexually Oriented Businesses where persons view sexually oriented
films.
      (6)   The findings noted in subsections (b)(1) through (5) hereof raise
substantial governmental concerns.
      (7)   Sexually Oriented Businesses have operational characteristics,
which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial
governmental concerns.
      (8)   A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to
place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and operators of
Sexually Oriented Businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will place a
heretofore nonexistent incentive on operators to see that Sexually Oriented
Businesses are run in a manner consistent with the health, safety and welfare
of patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the City. It is
appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual
operator of the Sexually Oriented Business, and fully in possession and control
of the premises and activities occurring therein.
      (9)   The regulation of nudity in Sexually Oriented Businesses will
further the substantial governmental interests in preventing prostitution and
other sex- related crimes, including illegal sex acts, and protecting the
public health, safety, and welfare.
      (10)   Removal of doors, curtains, partitions, drapes, or any other
obstruction whatsoever that would be capable of wholly or partially obscuring
the view from outside a viewing booth of any person inside a viewing booth in
Sexually Oriented Businesses and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with
viewing booths will advance the substantial governmental interest in curbing
the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult arcades and
theaters and will facilitate enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and
other federal, state and local laws, thereby furthering the substantial
governmental interest in protecting the public health, safety, and welfare.
      (11)   Requiring sufficient lighting in all Sexually Oriented Businesses
will advance the substantial governmental interest in curbing illegal sexual
activity on the premises of Sexually Oriented Businesses, and will facilitate
enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and other federal, state and
local laws, thereby furthering the substantial governmental interest in
protecting the public health, safety, and welfare.
      (12)   The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately
responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of Sexually Oriented
Businesses, and by employees of such businesses, will facilitate the
enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and other federal, state and
local laws, and will thereby further the substantial government interest in
protecting the public health, safety, and welfare.
      (13)   A person who recently has been convicted of a sexually related
crime is not an appropriate individual to operate or be employed in a Sexually
Oriented Business or adult motel.
      (14)   Barring such individuals from the management of and employment in
Sexually Oriented Businesses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and
prevents the commission of sexually related criminal acts, including conduct
which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases.

filed, the City will issue such applicant a provisional sexually oriented
business license or Sexually Oriented Business employee license upon request of
the applicant. The provisional license:
      (1)   Will allow an applicant for a Sexually Oriented Business license to
operate the Sexually Oriented Business or adult motel named in the license
application under the same terms as a normal Sexually Oriented Business issued
pursuant to Section

license to act as an employee on the premises of a Sexually Oriented Business

employee license issued pursuant to Section
777.09 of this chapter for the period of time specified in subsection (g)
hereof; and

applicant pursuant to a judicial decision overturning the license denial; or
      (3)   The date one (1) year from the issuance of the provisional license.
   (h)   In the event that judicial review of the denial of a new license
application is still pending thirty (30) days before the expiration date of a
provisional license, the provisional licensee may file a renewal license
application with the Building Commissioner pursuant to Section
777.12 (b) of this chapter. The Building Commissioner shall grant an
application for renewal of a provisional license unless he determines that new
grounds exist for denial of a license application pursuant to Section

application. In the event that an application for renewal of a provisional
license is denied and the applicant seeks judicial review of that denial; the

of the previous license denial.

motel, or similar commercial establishment has rented or subrented a sleeping

contain the following endorsement, or a substantially similar endorsement
approved by the City:
"It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy may not be canceled nor
the intention not to renew be stated until ninety (90) days after receipt by

   (f)   General Indemnification.  Each application for consent to Occupy or
Use the Public Right-of-Way, and each annual registration, shall include, to
the extent permitted by law, the Service Provider's express undertaking to
defend, indemnify and hold the City and its elected and appointed officers,
officials, employees, agents, representatives and subcontractors harmless from
and against any third party claims (including all damages, losses and expenses,
reasonable attorney's fees and costs of suit or defense) arising out of,
resulting from or alleged to arise out of or result from the negligent,
careless or wrongful acts, omissions, failures to act or misconduct of the
Service Provider or its Affiliates, officers, employees, agents,
representatives, contractors or sub-contractors in the Construction,
Reconstruction, installation, operation, maintenance, repair or removal of its
System or Facilities, and in providing or offering Services over the Facilities
or System, whether such acts or omissions are authorized, allowed or prohibited
by this chapter.  A Service Provider, however, will have no obligation to
defend, indemnify or hold the City and its elected and appointed officials,
officers, employees, agents and representatives harmless from damages or claims
arising solely from the City's or their own negligence.

instrument shall be maintained at the sole expense of the Service Provider so
long as any of the Service Provider's Facilities are located within the Public
Right-of-Way of the City.  The requirements of this Section
904.02(g) shall not apply to a Service Provider that: (1) has presumed initial
consent to Occupy or Use the Public Right-of-Way under Section
904.02(b); and (2) has not been the subject of litigation or other en-forcement
action by the City arising from the Service Provider's activities in the Public
Right-of-Way within the five (5) years prior to initial or annual registration
hereunder.

credit or other instrument, the City shall give written notice to the Service

the City.

      (5)   Failure to pay fees, costs, taxes or compensation when and as due
the City.
      (6)   Insolvency or bankruptcy of the Service Provider.
      (7)   Violation of material provisions of this chapter.
   (m)   Notice and Duty to Cure.  In the event that the Director believes that
grounds exist for revocation of consent to Occupy or Use the Public Right-of-
Way, he shall give the Service Provider written notice of the apparent
violation or noncompliance, providing a short and concise statement of the
nature and general facts of the violation or noncompliance, and providing the
Service Provider a reasonable period of time not exceeding thirty (30) days to
furnish evidence:
      (1)   That corrective action has been, or is being actively and
expeditiously pursued, to remedy the violation or noncompliance;
      (2)   That rebuts the alleged violation or noncompliance; or
      (3)   That it would be in the public interest to impose some penalty or
sanction less than revocation.
   (n)   Identification of Facilities. When the City determines that
identification of Facilities is necessary to begin planning for Right-of-Way
improvement projects, Service Providers, upon receipt of notice by the City,
are required to use reasonable efforts to field identify their Facilities.  In
identifying Facilities, customary industry standards must be adhered to and
markings must identify the Service Provider responsible for the Facilities. 
All markings must also be clearly readable from the ground and include the
Service Provider's name, logo and identification numbering or tracking. 
Advertising is not permitted and all marking colors shall be those approved by
the City.
   (o)   Waiver of Requirements.  It is within the Director's reasonable
discretion to waive a portion or portions of this chapter where such
requirements, in the Director's judgment, are not necessary or appropriate to
protect the City's interests and the purposes and intent of this chapter.
   (p)   New or Additional Facilities When the Right-of-Way is Full.  The City
shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of new or additional
Facilities within the Public Right-of-Way if the Right-of-Way is full.  In
making such decisions, the City shall strive to the extent possible to
accommodate all existing and potential users of the Right-of-Way, but shall be
guided primarily by considerations of the public health, safety and welfare,
the condition of the Right-of-Way, the time of year with respect to essential
Utilities, the protection of existing Facilities in the Right-of-Way, future
City and County plans, if applicable, for public improvements, development
projects which have been determined to be in the public interest and
nondiscriminatory and competitively neutral treatment among Service Providers.
(Ord. 59-16.  Passed 4-3-17.)
904.05  LOCATION, RELOCATION AND REMOVAL OF FACILITIES.
   (a)   Location of Facilities.    All Facilities shall be Constructed,
Reconstructed, installed and located in accordance with the following terms and
conditions:
      (1)   Facilities shall be installed within an existing compatible
underground duct or conduit whenever Excess Capacity exists within such
Facility.
      (2)   Unless application of this provision is specifically prohibited by
state or federal law, a Service Provider with permission to install Overhead
Facilities shall install its Facilities on pole attachments to existing utility
poles only, and then only if Surplus Space is available; and no pole located
within the Public Right-of-Way shall exceed fifty (50) feet in height unless
approved  by City Council ordinance.
      (3)   Whenever the existing electric, cable, telecommunications and other
similar Facilities are located underground in a certain area  in a Public
Right-of-Way, a Service Provider with permission to Occupy the same Public
Right-of-Way with the electric, cable, telecommunications or other similar
Facilities, must also locate its Facilities underground to the extent
technologically feasible and economically practicable.
      (4)   Whenever a Service Provider is required to locate or relocate
Facilities underground in a certain area of the Right-of-Way, every Provider
with Facilities within the same certain area of the Right-of-Way shall
concurrently relocate their Facilities underground. This requirement may be
waived by the City for good cause shown including consideration of such factors
as:  the remaining economic life of the Facilities, public safety, customer
service needs, any Law precluding such undergrounding of the Facilities, and
hardship to the Provider, as determined by the Director.  If a Provider is
denied a requested waiver from the above requirements, the Provider may appeal
the denial of the Director to the Mayor as set forth in Section
904.99(c).  Notwithstanding the above, no Service Provider shall be required to
bear the expense of relocation or undergrounding of any Facilities if such
requirement would be prohibited by law.
      (5)   Except for Overhead Facilities as provided herein, no Facilities
shall be located above ground in a Public Right-of-Way without the express
written permission of the Director.
      (6)   The City reserves the right to require a Service Provider to
provide Excess Capacity in the Public Right-of-Way at the time of Construction,
Reconstruction, installation, location or relocation of Facilities.
   (b)   Excess Capacity. To reduce Excavation in the Public Right-of-Way, it
is the City's goal to encourage Service Providers to share occupancy of
underground conduit as well as to construct, whenever possible, excess conduit
capacity for occupancy of future Facilities in the Public Right-of-Way. 
Therefore, if a Service Provider is constructing underground conduit in the
Public Right-of-Way for its own Facilities, and the City reasonably determines
such construction is in an area in which other Service Providers would likely
construct Facilities in the future, the City may require the Service Provider
to construct the conduit in the Public Right-of-Way with Excess Capacity in the
Public Right-of-Way, provided the Service Provider shall be reimbursed for the
use of the Excess Capacity by another Service Provider, and subject to good
engineering practices approved by the Director.  The Service Provider may
charge a reasonable market lease rate for occupancy of the additional conduit
space as reimbursement.
   (c)   City Owned Conduit.  If the City owns or leases conduit in the path of
a Service Provider's proposed Facilities, and provided it is technologically
feasible and not economically impracticable for the Service Provider's
Facilities to Occupy the conduit owned or leased by the City, the Service
Provider shall be required to Occupy the conduit owned or leased by the City in
order to reduce the necessity to Excavate the Public Right-of-Way.  The Service
Provider shall pay to the City a Public Way Fee that is assessed pursuant to
Section
904.08 for such Occupancy.
   (d)   Relocation or Removal of Facilities.  Within thirty (30) days
following written notice from the City, a Service Provider shall, at its own
expense, temporarily or permanently remove, relocate, change or alter the
position of any Facilities in the Public Right-of-Way, or commence such work if
the City determines completion within 30 days is unnecessary or overly
burdensome, whenever the City shall have determined that such removal,
relocation, change or alteration is reasonably necessary for:
      (1)   The Construction, Reconstruction, repair, maintenance or
installation of any City or other public improvement, in, upon, or near the
Public Right-of-Way;
      (2)   The operations of the City or other governmental entity in or upon
the Public Right-of-Way;
      (3)   When the public health, safety, and welfare requires it, or when
necessary to prevent interference with the safety and convenience of ordinary
travel over the Public Rights of Way; or
      (4)   The sale, conveyance, vacation, or narrowing of all or any part of
the Public Right-of-Way.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Service Provider who
has Facilities in the Public Rights-of-Way subject to a vacation or narrowing
that is not required for the purposes of the City, shall have a permanent
easement in such vacated portion or excess portion in conformity with Ohio
Revised Code Section 723.041.
   Notwithstanding the above, no Service Provider shall be required to bear the
expense of removal, relocation, change or alteration of position of any
Facilities if such requirement would be prohibited by law.
   (e)   Removal of Unauthorized Facilities.  Within thirty (30) days following
written notice from the City, any Service Provider or other Person that owns,
controls or maintains any unauthorized System, Facility or related
appurtenances in the Public Right-of-Way shall, at its own expense, remove
those Facilities or appurtenances from the Public Right-of-Way of the City or
shall arrange to sell the System, Facilities or appurtenances to the City,
unless removal or sale is prohibited by state or federal law.  A System or
Facility is unauthorized and subject to removal, following notice, in the
following circumstances:
      (1)   Upon revocation of the Service Provider's consent to Occupy or Use
the Public Right-of-Way;
      (2)   If the System or Facility was Constructed, Reconstructed,
installed, operated, located or maintained without the consent to do so, except
as otherwise provided by this chapter;
      (3)   Upon abandonment of a Facility in the Public Right-of-Way, with the
exception of underground facilities abandoned in a manner authorized and
approved by the City;
      (4)   If the System or Facility was Constructed, Reconstructed,
installed, operated, located or maintained, or any Excavation of a Public
Right-of-Way was performed, without prior issuance of a required Construction
Permit, except as otherwise provided by this chapter;
      (5)   If the System or Facility was Constructed, Reconstructed,
installed, operated, located or maintained, or any Excavation of a Public
Right-of-Way was performed, at a location not permitted pursuant to the City's
consent to Occupy or Use the Public Right-of-Way or Construction Permit; or
      (6)   If the Service Provider fails to comply with the Registration
requirements of Section
904.03 of this chapter.
   (f)   Failure to remove or relocate Facilities.  If the Service Provider
fails to remove or relocate any of its Facilities within the thirty (30) days
period set forth in subsection (e) of this Section
904.05, or receive an extension of time from the Director for commencement and
completion of removal or relocation, then, to the extent not inconsistent with
applicable law, the City shall have the right, but not the obligation, to do
the following:
      (1)   Declare that all rights, title and interest to the Facilities
belong to the City with all rights of ownership, including, but not limited to,
the right to connect and use the Facilities or to effect a transfer of all
right, title and interest in the Facilities to another Person for operation; or
      (2)   Authorize removal of the Facilities installed by the Service
Provider in, on, over or under the Rights of Way of the City at Service
Provider's cost and expense, by another Person; however, the City shall have no
liability for any damage caused by such action and the Service Provider shall
be liable to the City for all reasonable costs incurred by the City in such
action; and
      (3)   To the extent not inconsistent with applicable law, any portion of
the Service Provider's Facilities in, on, over or under the Public Right-of-Way
of the City designated by the City for removal and not timely removed by the
Service Provider shall belong to and become the property of the City, without
payment to the Service Provider, and the Service Provider shall execute and
deliver such documents, as the City shall request, in form and substance
acceptable to the City, to evidence such ownership by the City.
   (g)   Emergency Removal or Relocation of Facilities.  The City retains the
right and privilege to cut or move any Facilities, or stop work on any
Construction, Reconstruction, installation, operation or Excavation, located in
the Public Right-of-Way of the City, as the City may determine to be necessary,
appropriate or useful in response to any need to protect the public health,
safety or welfare; except to the extent that the City's actions would cause a
dangerous or potentially dangerous situation. 
(Ord. 59-16.  Passed 4-3-17.)
904.06  NOTICE OF WORK, ROUTINE MAINTENANCE AND EMERGENCY WORK.
   (a)   Notice of Work, Generally.  Except in case of Emergency, as provided

Obstruction of, a Public Right-of-Way or closing of a Public Street.
      (2)   For Routine Maintenance and New Service Orders that require the
Service Provider to cause a Lane Obstruction in a Public Street for more than
four (4) hours, the Service Provider shall provide the City with forty-eight
(48) hours advance notice prior to commencing the Routine Maintenance or New
Service Order, and shall submit a drawing showing the planned traffic
maintenance and indicating how the Service Provider will meet all requirements
of ODOT's Manual of Traffic Control Devices or other applicable ODOT

shall avoid soil compaction and impact by use of methods such as construction
fencing.
      (2)   When tree roots must be affected by any Construction work within
the Public Right-of-Way, the Service Provider shall obtain recommendations
regarding protective construction practices from a certified arborist having
expertise in tree preservation, which recommendations shall be subject to the
approval of the Director or his or her designee.  Soil compaction and root
cutting shall both be considered to require protective construction practices. 
The arborist's recommendations shall be provided to the Director or his or her
designee prior to commencement of Construction.
      (3)   Trees within the Public Right-of-Way shall not be removed without
the written consent of the City following a request submitted to the Director
or his or her designee, unless such removal is required in an Emergency in
which case notice of such removal shall be provided to the Director within
twenty-four (24) hours of the commencement of such activity.  Compensation for
trees removed with the City's permission in connection with Construction work
performed by a Service Provider shall be paid to the City prior to completion
of Construction work, based upon cost of replacement analysis as provided in

extent that the City has promulgated rules and regulations regarding tree
trimming or vegetation management, such rules and regulations shall supersede
any conflict with the foregoing standards.
      (5)   The Service Provider shall provide the City Public Works Department
with at least two business days' notice of all tree trimming or vegetation
management activities, unless such activities are required because of an
Emergency, in which case notice shall be provided to the Director within
twenty-four (24) hours of the com-mencement of such activity.
   (r)   Landscape Restoration.
      (1)   All trees, landscaping and grounds removed, damaged or disturbed as
a result of the Construction, Reconstruction, installation, maintenance, repair
or replacement of Facilities must be replaced or restored as nearly as may be
practicable, to the condition existing prior to performance of work, except to
the extent that tree trimming is necessary to prevent the interference of tree
branches with Overhead Facilities.  Trees that were to have been preserved in
accordance with the requirements of this section that die within one year
following completion of Construction shall require compensation to be paid to
the City, based upon cost of replacement analysis as provided in the Guide for
Plant Appraisals or similar publication.
      (2)   Grass or lawn areas within the Public Right-of-Way that are
disturbed or damaged during Construction work shall be restored to a grassy
condition.
         A.   Topsoil shall be stockpiled separately from poorer quality clay

unless the City Engineer has applied for and obtained from the OEPA approval to
modify the specific limits in the Federal pretreatment standards. When
requested, an application for modification of the Federal pretreatment
standards shall be considered for submittal by the City Engineer when the
City's wastewater treatment system achieves consistent removal of the
pollutants. "Consistent removal" means reduction in the amount of pollutant or
alteration of the nature of a pollutant which is in the influent to the
wastewater treatment system to a less toxic or harmless state by the time it is
discharged in the effluent. The reduction or alteration shall be achieved in
ninety-five percent (95%) of the samples taken when measured according to the
procedures set forth in 40 CFR Section 403.7(c)(2) of the "General Pretreatment
Regulations for Existing and New Sources of Pollution."

who are suspected of using dilution to meet the pretreatment standards required
by this chapter, or in any other cases where the imposition of mass limitations
is deemed appropriate to the City.
   (g)   Accidental Discharges.  Each user shall provide protection from
accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by
this chapter. Where necessary, facilities to prevent accidental discharge of
prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the owner or user's
own cost and expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating
procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the City Engineer
for review, and shall be approved by the City Engineer before construction of
the facility. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall
not relieve the industrial user from the responsibility to modify the user's
facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this chapter.
   (h)   If any waters or wastes are discharged, or are proposed to be
discharged to the public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess
the characteristics enumerated in subsections (d) and (e) hereof, and which in
the judgment of the City Engineer may have a deleterious effect upon the
wastewater disposal system processes, equipment or receiving waters, or which
otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the City
Engineer may:
      (1)   Reject the wastes;
      (2)   Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/or
      (3)   Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to
the public sewers. If the City Engineer permits the pretreatment or
equalization of waste flows, the design and installation of the plans and
equipment shall be subject to the review and approval of the City Engineer, and
subject to the requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances and laws. 
   (i)   Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when in the
opinion of the City Engineer, they are necessary for the proper handling of
liquid wastes containing grease in excessive amounts or any flammable wastes,
sand or other harmful ingredients; except that such interceptors shall not be
required for private living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors shall
be of a type and capacity approved by the City Engineer and shall be located as
to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Where
installed, all grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be maintained by the
owner, at his expense, in continuously efficient operation at all times.
   (j)   Where preliminary treatment of flow-equalizing facilities are provided
for any waters or wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory

opinion of the City Engineer, to stop an actual or threatened discharge which
presents or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health
or welfare of persons, to the environment or to the wastewater disposal system,
or an actual or threatened discharge that would cause the City to violate any
condition of its NPDES permit.
   (d)   Any user notified of suspension of wastewater treatment service and/or
such user's wastewater discharge permit shall immediately stop the discharge.
In the event that the user fails to comply voluntarily with the suspension
order, the City Engineer shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including
immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to
the wastewater disposal system or endangerment to any individuals The City
Engineer shall reinstate the wastewater discharge permit and/or the wastewater

not affect the remaining sections.
(Ord. 96-84. Passed 9-17-1984.)
913.23  BYPASSES.
   (a)   Definitions.  As used in this section:
      (1)   "Bypass" means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any
portion of an industrial user's treatment facility.
      (2)   "Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to
property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become
inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can
reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property
damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
   (b)   Allowable Bypasses.  An industrial user may allow any bypass to occur
which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but
only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation.
These bypasses are not subject to the provisions of subsection (c) and (d)
hereof.
   (c)   Notice.
      (1)   If the industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass,
it shall submit prior notice to the City at least ten days before the date of
the bypass.
      (2)   An industrial user shall submit oral notice of any unanticipated
bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the City within
twenty-four hours from the time the industrial user becomes aware of the
bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the
time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission
shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the
bypass, including the exact date and time of its occurrence; if the bypass has
not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps
taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass.
The City may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral
report has been received within twenty-four hours before the date of the
bypass.
   (d)   Prohibited Bypasses.
      (1)   Bypass is prohibited, and the City may take enforcement action
against an industrial user for a bypass, unless:
         A.    Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury
or severe property damage; and
         B.    There was no feasible alternative to the bypass, such as the use
of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes or maintenance
during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if
adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of
reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during
normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance.
      (2)   The City may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its
adverse effects, if the City determines that it will meet the two conditions
listed in paragraphs (d)(1)A. and B. hereof.
         (Ord. 88-91. Passed 10-7-1991.)
913.24  ADJUSTMENT OF CATEGORICAL PRETREATMENT STANDARD  FOR POLLUTED INTAKE
WATER.
   Categorical pretreatment standards may be adjusted to reflect the presence
of pollutants in the industrial user's intake water in accordance with the
following:
   (a)   Application.  Any industrial user wishing to obtain credit for intake
pollutants must make application to the City. Upon request of the industrial
user, the applicable standard will be calculated on a "net" basis (i.e.
adjusted to reflect credit for pollutants in the intake water) if the
requirements of subsections (b) and (c) hereof are met.
   (b)   Criteria.
      (1)   The industrial user must demonstrate that the control system it
proposes or uses to meet applicable categorical pretreatment standards would,
if properly installed and operated, meet the standards in the absence of
pollutants in the intake waters.
      (2)   Credit for generic pollutants such as biochemical oxygen demand
(BOD), total suspended solids (TSS) and oil and grease should not be granted
unless the industrial user demonstrates that the constituents of the generic
measure in the user's effluent are substantially similar to the constituents of
the generic measure in the intake water or unless appropriate additional limits

1129.01  PURPOSE.
   Commercial District regulations are established to ensure the availability
of suitable areas for business and commercial uses while at the same time
promoting the most desirable and beneficial use of land that will stabilize and
protect the character and value of the residential neighborhoods within the
City.  Four (4) commercial zoning districts have been established to meet the
needs of the community.
(Ord. 87-04. Passed 11-1-2004.)
   (a)   The C1 Office District has a limited application within the Central
Business District of the City.  This district seeks to preserve and protect the
general character of the area and to allow for expansion around the core as
dictated by market conditions.
   (b)   The C2 Retail District is established to provide standards for the
continued operation of small commercial establishments.  This district would
permit those retail uses that typically locate side by side to create a
shopping environment that encourages pedestrian interaction between stores and
where stores thrive on being adjacent to other retail uses.
   (c)   The C3 General Business District is established to provide for
commercial uses that generally require independent, freestanding buildings,
larger parking areas, and may have unique traffic patterns because of such
factors as drive-in facilities.
      (Ord. 91-95. Passed 10-7-1996.)
   (d)   The C4 Public School District is limited to property within the City
that is owned by the Lakewood Board of Education at the time of adoption of
this Ordinance.  This district seeks to preserve and protect the general
character of the area and to allow for development and redevelopment of these
properties.  Any property designated as a C4 Zoning District shall retain its
zoning designation should the Board of Education transfer ownership.  Any
property located in the C4 Zoning District that is not in compliance with the
regulations as set forth in Schedule
1129.05 requires an amendment to the Zoning Map pursuant to Section
1105.02 prior to transfer.
      (Ord. 87-04. Passed 11-1-2004.)
1129.02  PRINCIPAL AND CONDITIONAL PERMITTED USES.
   Unless otherwise provided by law or in this Code, buildings, structures or
land shall only be used or occupied following the adoption of this Code for the
uses permitted herein.  Schedule
 1129.02 enumerates those uses that may locate in a C1 Office, C2 Retail, C3
General Business, and C4 Public School District as a matter of right as a
principal use and those uses which may locate in a given district upon
obtaining a Conditional Use Permit.
   (a)   A use listed in Schedule
 1129.02 shall be permitted by right in a district when denoted by the letter
“P,” provided that all provisions of the Ordinances and this Code have been
met.
   (b)   A use listed in Schedule
1129.02 may be permitted as a conditional use in a district when denoted by the
letter “C,” provided that the regulations in Chapters
1161 and
1173, and all other provisions of the Ordinances and this Code have been met.
      (Ord. 91-95. Passed 10-7-1996.)
   (c)   Any use listed in Schedule
1129.02 as a permitted or conditionally permitted use may be permitted in a
Planned Development, provided that the regulations in Chapter
1156, and all other provisions of the Ordinances and this Code have been met.
   (d)   Any use listed in Schedule
1129.02 as a permitted or conditionally permitted use in the base zones of the
Mixed Use Overlay District (MUOD) may be permitted as a conditional use in a
MUOD, provided that the regulations in Chapter
1135, and all other provisions of the Ordinances and this Code have been met.

1133.09  DEMOLITION OR REMOVAL OF RESIDENTIAL STRUCTURES.
   (a)   Lakewood consists of very distinctive neighborhoods that were settled
at different times during its development each with its own distinctive housing
patterns, which are reflective of the time period during which these
neighborhoods were nurtured during the growth of the City.  Many of these
residential neighborhoods are easily recognizable by their consistency of
characteristics such as height, setbacks and side yards as well as their
distinctive exterior façade design elements including, but not limited to,
porches and steps, masonry, stoops, cornices and trims, doors and windows and
other architectural styles and features, which over the years created a
neighborhood environment and streetscape that brought neighbors together.
   In a correspondence from the Ohio Historic Preservation Office dated May 5,
1992, their opinion is that the entire City constitutes a single historic
district, eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places.  As
stated in their letter, “The City is significant as a late nineteenth and early
twentieth century streetcar suburb.  The City is also unique in that for a
community of its size and density it retains remarkable integrity to convey
both its historic and architectural significance.”
   As a result of the Ohio Historic Preservation findings, the City encourages
conservation, preservation, redevelopment, and revitalization of residential
neighborhoods to preserve their unique environments and for the public welfare
of the City.  The City acknowledges as a matter of public policy that the
preservation and protection of residential neighborhoods is required for the
health, safety and welfare of the people.

Residential Properties.  No demolition or removal of a principal structure,

source of property damage or loss, in order to remedy conditions immediately
dangerous to life, health or property, or to remedy a nuisance, as jointly
determined and recommended by the Commissioner, the Fire Chief, and the City
Engineer; or (Ord. 24-2016.  Passed 5-2-2016.)
      (2)   The passage of 180 days following application to the Commissioner
for a demolition permit or permit to move a principal structure, during which
time the applicant has further made good faith application to all required
boards and commissions of the City for approval of a new principal structure at

(Ord. 15-14.  Passed 3-17-2014.)
1134.03  PROCEDURES FOR IDENTIFICATION, NOMINATION AND  DESIGNATION OF AN HPD
OR HP.
   (a)   Relationship to Base Districts: The HPD or HP is the designation of an
additionally restricted zone, or specific property restrictions for an historic
property, within any zone, which may be applied to existing zoning districts as
described herein. When such a district or property is established, the HPD or
HP shall be shown as an indication to the underlying districts by the
designation of HPD for Historic Preservation District, or HP for Historic
Properties, on the zoning map.
   An HPD or HP may cross or transit several base districts, however, the uses
permitted in each base district are limited to the boundaries of that base
district, except as otherwise provided herein.
   (b)   Nomination Procedure: The Heritage Advisory Board may propose to the
Commission nominations of any area, place, building, public interior portion of
a building, structure, work of art or other object as an HPD or HP. In the case
of an HP, if the Heritage Advisory Board does not propose a nomination, the
owner of the proposed HP may directly propose to the Commission such
nomination. In the case of an HPD, if the Heritage Advisory Board does not
propose a nomination, the owners of a majority of the properties within the
proposed HPD, as measured by the foot frontage of all properties within the
proposed HPD, may directly propose to the Commission such nomination. The
signature on such proposal of any owner of a parcel of property proposed for
nomination as an HP or within an HPD shall constitute the consent of all owners
of such parcel of property. Proposals for nomination must be on one or more
standard publicly available forms promulgated by the Heritage Advisory Board.
The nomination of an HPD or HP shall not constitute nomination of any public
interior portion of such area, place, building or structure unless the public
interior portion is specifically identified as part of the proposal for
nomination. A proposal for nomination shall specify which specific site
improvements are included in the proposal for nomination, and any improvements
not specified shall be deemed not to have been nominated.
   (c)   The Commission may establish from time to time such procedures and
policies with respect to nominations and other matters described in this
chapter. Moreover, the Commission may, where appropriate, issue specific unique
historic guidelines to govern any such designated HPD or HP. The purpose of
such guidelines are to assist the Architectural Board of Review to limit its
judgment and review procedures to design and engineering issues, rather than
its own independent view of historic appropriateness, which are hereby
expressly left in the province of the Commission with the advice of the
Heritage Advisory Board.
   (d)   Considerations for Nomination:  In considering the nomination of any
area, place, building, public interior portion of a building, structure, work
of art or other object in the City as an HPD or HP, the Commis-sion shall apply
the following criteria with respect to each property. One (1) or more or the
following must apply:
      (1)   The character, interest or value as part of the heritage of the
City, the region, State of Ohio or the United States;
      (2)   The location as a site of a significant historic event;
      (3)   The identification with a person or persons who significantly
contributed to the historic development of the City;
      (4)   An HPD's or HP's exemplification of the cultural, economic, social,
archeological, or historic heritage of the City;
      (5)   The portrayal of the environment of a group of people in an era of
history characterized by a distinctive architectural style;
      (6)   The embodiment of distinguishing historical characteristics of a
group of people in an era of history characterized by a distinctive
architectural style;
      (7)   HPD's or HP's identification as the work of an architect or master
builder whose individual work has influenced the development of the City;
      (8)   HPD's or HP's embodiment of elements of architectural design,
detail, materials or craftsmanship which represent a significant architectural
or technological innovation;
      (9)   HPD's or HP's unique location or singular physical characteristics
representing an established and familiar visual feature of a neighborhood,
community or the City, itself at large;
      (10)   HPD's or HP's having yielded or its likelihood of yielding
information important to the understanding of prehistory or history.
   (e)   Additional Considerations for an HPD:  In addition to meeting at least
one (1) of the above criteria, a proposed HPD must also meet the following
criteria in order to be designated an HPD:
      (1)   The area within the proposed boundaries must have a high degree of
historic integrity, without excessive loss of architectural or historic
character.
      (2)   The area within the proposed boundaries must have an internal
historic cohesiveness in the sense of a shared common history of its
inhabitants, historical development according to the Vision, a shared
architectural style or design, or a body of architecture illustrating the
evolution of architectural styles over a period of time.
   (f)   Additional Considerations for an HP:  In addition to meeting at least
one (1) of the criteria listed in subsection (c) above, a proposed HP must also
meet the following criteria in order to be designated an HP:
      (1)   The proposed HP must have a high degree of historic integrity,
without excessive loss of architectural or historic character.
      (2)   The proposed HP must have an internal historic cohesiveness in the
sense of a shared common history of its inhabitants, historical development
according to the Vision, a shared architectural style or design, or a body of
architecture illustrating the evolution of architectural styles over a period
of time.
   (g)   Nomination by the Commission: After a hearing, the Commission may
nominate certain areas, places, sites, buildings, public interior portions of
buildings, structures, works of art and other objects as eligible to be
designated as either an HPD or an HP.
   (h)   Nomination Not Self-Executing:  Once the Commission has approved a
nomination of any certain areas, places, sites, buildings, public interior
portions of buildings, structures and works of art and other objects as
eligible to be designated either an HPD or an HP, the secretary of the
Commission shall schedule a public hearing on the designation of the HPD or HP.
The rules of this chapter, or the unique historic guidelines adopted by the
Commission for any HPD or HP, are not effective until the HP or HPD is
designated by the Commission.
   (i)   Consent for Historic Designation: Prior to the hearing on designation
of the nominated property or district, the person(s) who submitted the proposed
nomination to the Commission shall attempt to secure the written consent, on a
publicly available form promulgated by the Heritage Advisory Board, of the
affected property owner(s) to the designation of a property or district as an
HP or HPD. However, written approval is not required for the property to be
determined as an HP or HPD. The signature on such form of any owner of a parcel
of property proposed for nomination as an HP or within an HPD shall constitute
the consent of all owners of such parcel of property. The Commission shall
proceed to the public hearing on the question of the proposed designation and
may defer action in its discretion while consent is being solicited.
   (j)   The application for designation and all accompanying submissions shall
be reviewed and studied by the Commission prior to its decision. The Commission
shall give due consideration to the advice of the Heritage Advisory Board, such
consents to designation and comments as have been filed with it, and the views
as may have been expressed by persons participating in the hearing before the
Commission, as well as any other relevant information brought before the
Commission, in making its decision with respect to the proposed designation of
each HPD or HP by a majority vote of its members.
(Ord. 15-14. Passed 3-17-2014.)
   (k)   The Commission shall determine whether said area, place, site,
building(s), public interior portions of a building, structure(s), works of art
and other objects shall be designated as an HPD or HP. In the event the owner
of a property nominated as an HP, or each owner within a district nominated as
an HPD, does not consent to designation, the Commission may only designate an
HP or HPD by a vote of at least four of its members, or otherwise the
Commission may designate an HP or HPD by a majority vote of a quorum of its
members. Regardless of any current National Register of Historic Places status,
an HPD or HP must be locally determined by the Commission for this chapter to
apply.
(Ord. 6-18.  Passed 6-18-2018.)
   (l)   The Commission may approve by majority vote unique historic guidelines
for a created district or a specific historic property. The Commission shall
schedule a public hearing on the question of such guidelines, which may be a
separate hearing or which may coincide with a hearing for nomination or
designation. If specific architectural guidelines are not created, the
Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation shall apply to an HPD
or HP for Architectural Board of Review purposes.
   (m)   Applications for nomination and designation which have been denied by
the Commission may be resubmitted by the original applicant within ten (10)
days from the date of ruling, if a request is made in writing by the applicant
setting forth the grounds thereof. If the Commission determines by vote that
valid grounds have been submitted, a rehearing shall be granted. If the request
is not made within ten (10) days from date of ruling, no application on the
same proposed HPD or HP may be made to the Commission by any party for a period
of six (6) months from the date the original application was denied. The filing
of an application for a rehearing shall not be deemed to extend the time
permitted by law for the filing of an appeal to the Courts.
   (n)   Notice Procedures for Public Hearing on Nomination or Designation:
      (1)   Notice of any public hearing called under this chapter shall be
made in accordance with Lakewood Codified Ordinances no less than seven (7)
days before the hearing; said notice shall state the time, place and purpose of
the hearing in accordance with Chapter
107 (Publication of Legal Notices) of the ordinances.
      (2)   No less than seven (7) days prior to a public hearing, the
Commission additionally shall give written notice of a public hearing, stating
the time, place and purpose to all owners and residents of property in and
within two hundred (200) feet of the property for which either an HPD or an HP
nomination or designation is proposed.
         (Ord. 15-14. Passed 3-17-2014.)
1134.04  LOCATION OF AN HPD OR HP.
   Location of an HPD or HP is limited to the C1 Commercial Office, C2
Commercial Retail, C3 Commercial General Business, C4 Commercial Public School
Districts, R1H Single-Family, high density, R1M Single-Family, medium density,
R1L Single-Family, low density, R2 Single- and Two-Family, L Lagoon, MH
Multiple-Family, high density and ML Multiple-Family, low density, Residential
Districts.  (Ord. 15-14.  Passed 3-17-2014.)
1134.05  PERMITTED ACCESSORY USES.
   Permitted accessory uses in an HPD shall be those uses listed as accessory
in the underlying base zone. 
(Ord. 15-14.  Passed 3-17-2014.)
1134.06  PROCEDURES FOR THE REVIEW OF PROPOSED ALTERATIONS, DEMOLITION AND NEW
CONSTRUCTION AND FOR ISSUANCE OF APPROVAL TO PROCEED WITH WORK (CERTIFICATE OF
APPROPRIATENESS).
   (a)   No person shall make any alteration or demolition with respect to any
property designated historic that is situated in a determined HPD or has been
determined an HP unless a certificate of appropriateness has been previously
issued with respect to such property. With respect to any such alteration or
demolition, the owner of the property to be altered or demolished shall first
apply for and secure a certificate of appropriateness from the Architectural
Board of Review. In addition, any improvements or changes undertaken within
public rights-of-way within an HPD also require a certificate of
appropriateness from the Archi-tectural Board of Review.
   (b)   Unless the Commission has previously approved unique historic
guidelines, the Architectural Board of Review when considering an application
for a certificate of appropriateness shall determine whether the proposed
construction, reconstruction, alteration or demolition is appropriate and shall
refer to the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation, as
amended from time to time, and which on the date of the adoption of this
chapter are as follows:
      (1)   A property shall be used for its historic purpose or placed in a
new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the
building and its site and environment.
      (2)   The historic character of a property shall be retained and
preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and
spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided.
      (3)   Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time,
place and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development,
such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other
buildings, shall not be undertaken.
      (4)   Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired
historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved.
      (5)   Distinctive features, finishes, and construction techniques or
examples of craftsmanship that characterize an HP shall be preserved.
      (6)   Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than
replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a
distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color,
texture and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement
of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical or
pictorial evidence.
      (7)   Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause
damage to the historic materials and structures, if appropriate, shall be
undertaken using the gentlest means possible.
      (8)   Significant archeological resources affected by a project shall be
protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation
measures shall be undertaken.
      (9)   New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction
shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new
work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the
massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic
integrity of the property and its environment.
      (10)   New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be
undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future, the essential form
and environment would be unimpaired.
   (c)   In the case of archeological properties, the Architectural Board of
Review shall refer to the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation's Treatment
of Archeological Properties: A Handbook or successor publication(s).
   (d)   Approval Not Self-executing Where the Commission has Issued Unique
Historic Guidelines:  When unique historic guidelines have been established, if
the proposed construction, reconstruction, alteration or demolition is
determined by the Architectural Board of Review to be appropriate, then the
Architectural Board of Review shall approve the certificate of appropriateness,
subject to a final additional review by the Commission.
   (e)   Denial: If the Architectural Board of Review determines that the
proposed construction, reconstruction, alteration or demolition is
inappropriate, then the Architectural Review Board shall deny the certificate
of appropriateness.
   (f)   Notice of Denial to Applicant:   In the event that the Architectural
Board of Review denies an application for a certificate of appropriateness, the
secretary of the Architectural Board of Review shall forthwith notify the
applicant in writing and transmit to him/her a copy of the reasons for denial
and recommendations, if any, of the Architectural Board of Review.
   (g)   Effect of Denial: Upon denying an application for a certificate of
appropriateness, the Architectural Board of Review shall impose a waiting
period to not exceed thirty (30) days from the date of disapproval during which
the applicant may develop a compromise proposal. With respect to an application
involving a demolition, the Architectural Board of Review may, at its
discretion, extend the aforementioned waiting period a maximum of one (1) year
from the date of disapproval. If both parties accept a compromise proposal, the
Architectural Board of Review may henceforth approve a final certificate of
appropriateness, unless unique historic guidelines have been adopted by the
Commission and pertain, in which case any compromise must also be approved by
the Commission.
   (h)   Negotiations During Waiting Period for Demolition:  In the case of a
denial of an application for a certificate of appropriateness for demolition:
      (1)   The Architectural Board of Review, along with the Director,
Commissioner, members of the Heritage Advisory Board, and other officials of
the City as needed, may participate in negotiations with the owner or owners
and any other interested party in an effort to find a means of preserving the
property. If the aforementioned do not agree on a means of preserving the
property at the initial meeting then they may continue to undertake meaningful
and continuing discussion with the purpose of finding a method of preserving
the property.
      (2)   If the applicant fails to meet with the aforementioned in good
faith, in the time specified, then the Architectural Board of Review's denial
of the application will stand.
      (3)   If, after holding such good-faith meetings in the waiting period as
specified above, and after reviewing a substantial hardship statement filed by
an applicant, the Director determines in writing that failure to approve an
application for a certificate of appropriateness will create a substantial
hardship to the applicant and that such certificate of appropriateness may be
approved without substantial detriment to the public welfare and without
substantial derogation from the purposes of this chapter, then the
Architectural Board of Review shall approve a certificate of appropriateness
for such proposed demolition.
   (i)   Negotiations During Waiting Period for Alteration:  In the case of
denial of an application for a certificate of appropriateness for construction,
reconstruction or alteration:
      (1)   The Architectural Board of Review, along with the Director,
Commissioner, members of the Heritage Advisory Board, and other officials of
the City as needed, may participate in negotiations with the owner or owners
and any other interested party in an effort to find a means of preserving the
historic integrity of the property. The aforementioned shall investigate the
feasibility of all means of preserving the historic integrity of the designated
property. If the aforementioned do not agree on a means of preserving the
historic integrity of the property at the initial meeting, then they may
continue to undertake meaningful and continuing discussion of the purpose of
finding a method of saving the historic integrity of the property.
      (2)   If the applicant fails to meet with the aforementioned in good
faith, in the time specified, then the Architectural Board of Review's denial
of the application will stand.
      (3)   If, after holding such good faith meetings in the waiting period,
and after reviewing a substantial hardship statement filed by the applicant,
the Director determines in writing that failure to approve an application for a
certificate of appropriateness will create a substantial hardship or burden to
the applicant and that such certificate of appropriateness may be approved
without substantial detriment to the public welfare and without substantial
derogation from the purposes of this chapter, then the Architectural Board of
Review can approve a certificate of appropriateness for such proposed
alteration.
   (j)   Alternative Summary Procedures Not Requiring Board or Commission
Action:  The Director, or his/her designee, may administratively approve an
application for a certificate of appropriateness for the following activities:
      (1)   Repair or replacement of gutters and downspouts, provided there is
no change in material or location.
      (2)   Exterior wall insulation provided the exterior holes are repaired
with a matching material. For vinyl or aluminum siding, the necessary siding
shall be removed prior to the work and then reinstalled. Insulation work that
requires venting of any type that appears on the exterior of a structure
requires a certificate of appropriateness.
      (3)   Re-roofing, only with like material and if the original style and
shape of the roof is not altered.
      (4)   Storm windows and storm doors, provided that the item(s) installed:
         A.   Does/do not significantly alter the visual effect of the opening;
         B.   Is/are compatible with the character of the building;
         C.   Does/do not require the removal of original windows and/or doors.
      (5)   Repair of the surface of driveways, parking or loading areas or
walkways with like material.
   (k)   Summary Procedures Report:  The Director shall provide to the
Architectural Board of Review a summary of the certificates of appropriateness
for each administrative approval issued.
   (l)   As long as the following activities do not result in alteration to the
HPD or HP, they are approved:
      (1)   Exterior and interior painting; and
      (2)   Landscaping improvements, referring only to the planting or
arrangement of trees, shrubs, flowers and plants.
   (m)   If no action has been taken by the Architectural Review Board or the
Director, or his/her designee, on an application for a certificate of
appropriateness within sixty (60) days after such application has been received
by the Architectural Review Board, the certificate of appropriateness shall be
deemed issued. 
(Ord. 15-14.  Passed 3-17-2014.)
1134.07  HARDSHIP; APPLICATION FILED AFTER DENIAL OF A CERTIFICATE OF
APPROPRIATENESS.
   (a)   An applicant who has been denied a certificate of appropriateness may,
within thirty (30) days of the denial, request a finding of substantial
hardship and submit a substantial hardship statement based on economic impact
or other substantial burden. Such a request shall include a sworn statement or
affidavit in support. The Commission may hold a public hearing on the
substantial hardship statement.
   (b)   All of the following criteria shall be considered to determine the
existence of a substantial hardship:
      (1)   Denial of a certificate will result in a substantial reduction in
the economic value of the property.
      (2)   Denial of a certificate will result in a substantial economic
burden on the applicant because the applicant cannot reasonably maintain the
property in its current form.
      (3)   No reasonable alternative exists consistent with the architectural
standards and guidelines for the property.
      (4)   The owner has been unable to sell the property utilizing best
efforts.
      (5)   Previous alterations have interfered with the architectural
character of the HPD or HP and the character defining features to illustrate
the style or type are lost, and to return the HPD or HP to its original
character is not reasonable.
      (6)   If the owner is a not-for-profit organization, and it is
financially or physically infeasible to achieve its charitable purpose while
conforming to the pertinent architectural standards and guidelines.
      (7)   A court of competent jurisdiction has required the owner to abate
any violation of these ordinances within a time frame that does not comport
with the requirements of this chapter.
      (8)   Denial will result in a substantial burden as set forth in the
applicant's sworn statement or affidavit in support.
   (c)   In considering a substantial hardship statement, the Commission may
solicit expert testimony or request that the requesting party submit evidence
concerning property value, cost estimates, income expenses, and/or any other
information that the Commission deems necessary to determine whether the denial
of the request constitutes a substantial hardship. The level of documentation
required may vary as is appropriate to each case. The requesting party may
submit any personal or proprietary information to the staff of the City for a
confidential review, and such information shall be returned to the requesting
party, and a summary or evaluation of the information shall be provided to the
Commission without disclosure of the specific personal or proprietary
information.
   (d)   The Commission shall act upon a request for a finding of a substantial
hardship within a period not to exceed six (6) months from the original date of
the denial of a certificate of appropriateness or two (2) months from the date
the Commission receives all requested supporting material, whichever is later.
If no action has been taken by the Commission within this period, the request
shall be deemed granted, unless the time is extended upon by mutual agreement.
Upon the denial of a request, the requesting party shall be notified by mail.

   Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the contrary, the
Commission may rescind the nomination or designation of any area, place,
building, public interior portion of a building, or structure, work of art or
other object as an HPD or HP by majority vote by finding of one or more of the
following: (a) that the nominated or designated HPD or HD does not meet the
criteria or to protect the public interest in response to changed circumstances
since the nomination or designation was made; (b) prejudicial procedural error
in the nomination or designation process; or (c) professional or clerical error
in the nomination or designation. This rescission act of the Commission shall
relieve the owner of such property from any duties or penalties prescribed by
this chapter.

authorized by the Public Safety Director of the City to protect the public
health or safety, said action shall take precedence over the provisions of this
chapter.
   (b)   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent the correction
of any deterioration or damage to an area, place, building, public interior
portion of a building, structure, work of art or other object and restoration
to its condition prior to such deterioration or damage.  (Ord. 15-14.  Passed 
3-17-2014.)

1135.01  PURPOSE.
   (a)   The purpose of the Mixed Use Overlay District is to provide a
mechanism to accommodate development reuse and redevelopment in specified
locations, which is in the public interest and may not otherwise be permitted
pursuant to this Code .  A Mixed Use Overlay District may overlay several base
districts.  However, the uses permitted in each underlying district are limited
to the boundaries of that district, and the regulations of the underlying
district shall govern, except where additional uses are expressly allowed under
this Chapter.
   (b)   The Mixed Use Overlay District requirements and regulations allow for
more flexibility than those pertaining to other uses within the Code .  A Mixed
Use Overlay District may be mapped in an area where the proposed use changes
certain character and features otherwise limited by the underlying zoning only
if it has been determined that the current and anticipated future uses in the
immediate vicinity will be compatible with the mixed uses proposed and that
such uses are consistent with the Development Plan.  Therefore, the Commission
shall consider Mixed Use Overlay developments on a case-by-case basis.
   (c)   A Mixed Use Overlay District should offer one (1) or more of the
following advantages:
      (1)   Designs in residential and commercial areas that reflect the City’s
development and planning policies as set forth in this Code  and that are
consistent with the  Vision .
      (2)   Designs that are intended to encourage flexibility, innovation, and
creativity in site and development design by allowing the mixing of permitted
uses and/or modification or variation from otherwise applicable zone district
and development standards.
(3)   Designs which encourage a mix of retail, service, office, housing, live-
work units, and public activities to coexist in a manner that reflects human
scale and emphasizes pedestrian orientation, taking advantage of the vitality
that mixed uses can bring to the community.
      (4)   Designs which provide substantial buffers and transitions between
areas of different land uses and development densities.
      (5)   Designs which enhance the appearance of neighborhoods by conserving
areas of natural beauty and natural green spaces.
      (6)   Designs which provide a choice in the type of environment available
to the public by allowing development that would not be possible under the
strict application of other sections of this Code .
      (7)   Development and/or permanent reservation of open space,
recreational areas and facilities.
      (8)   A creative approach to the use of land and related physical
facilities that result in better urban design, higher quality construction and
the provision of aesthetic amenities.
      (9)   The efficient use of land, so as to promote certain economies in
the provision of utilities, streets, schools, public grounds and buildings, and
other facilities.
         (Ord. 59-04. Passed 7-6-2004.)
1135.02  LIMITATIONS ON FLEXIBILITY OF MIXED USE OVERLAY DISTRICTS.
   It is not intended that the Commission automatically grant exceptions or
maximum density increases for Mixed Use Overlay Districts, but it is expected
that the Commission shall grant only such increases or uses which are
consistent with the benefits resulting from the Mixed Use Overlay.  Therefore,
the Commission may require as a condition of approval any reasonable condition,
limitation or design factor, pursuant to Section
1161.02, General Standards for All Conditional Uses, which will promote proper
development of a Mixed Use Overlay development.
(Ord. 59-04. Passed 7-6-2004.)
 
1135.03  DESIGNATION OF A MIXED USE OVERLAY DISTRICT.
   (a)   Relationship to Base Districts. The Mixed Use Overlay District is an
overlay zone, which may be applied to existing zoning districts as described in
Section
1135.04, Location of Mixed Use Overlay District.  When such a district is
established, the Mixed Use Overlay District shall be shown as an overlay to the
underlying districts by the designation of MUOD on the Zoning Map.  A Mixed Use
Overlay District may overlay several base districts, however, the uses
permitted in each base district are limited to the boundaries of that base
district, except as otherwise provided herein.
   (b)   Development Standards.  The development standards, including, but not
limited to, the yard and setback requirements, the height limitations, parking
requirements, open space areas, and signage shall be established as a function
of the application to establish a Mixed Use Overlay District and the approval
of the application.  The following regulations shall be observed:
      (1)   Signage.
         A.   In a commercial district base zone, signage standards are set by
the base zone.
         B.   In a residential district base zone, the following additional
signage regulations apply:
            1.   Signs must be non-illuminated.
            2.   Gooseneck fixtures or indirect spotlights concentrated on an
area of a sign may be used to create illumination.
            3.   Only one sign per frontage, not to exceed 20 square feet per
sign, shall be allowed.
            4.   Signs must be either projecting signs, erected on the outside
wall of a building and projecting at an angle therefrom; or wall signs,
integral with the exterior face of an exterior wall of a building, or attached
to the wall or parallel with the wall and projecting not more than twelve
inches therefrom.
   The Commission may relax such standards if a creative and innovative design
is submitted and the sign does not adversely affect neighboring properties.
      (2)   Parking.
         A.   Applicants for Mixed Use Overlay developments shall submit a
parking and traffic management proposal that does not adversely affect the
neighborhood, identifies peak use times, and explores shared parking
agreements.
         B.   All residential uses must comply with parking requirements or
maintain existing parking conditions.
      (3)   Structural Requirements.
         A.   Mixed Use Overly proposals must contain a residential component.
         B.   Maintain form and scale of building being re-purposed.
         C.   The primary design objective for the Mixed Use Overlay District
are to reflect the area’s architectural significance/character, while promoting
the pedestrian scale environment.  The design must be compatible with the
neighborhood.
         D.   The principal or primary entrance to a non-residential structure
must be located on the building front.
      (4)   Outdoor dining.  Outdoor dining shall be permitted as a conditional
use in a Mixed Use Overlay District pursuant to Section
1161.03(t).
         (Ord. 17-13.  Passed 10-21-2013.)
1135.04  LOCATION OF MIXED USE OVERLAY DISTRICT.

1135.05  PRINCIPAL AND CONDITIONALLY PERMITTED USES.
   (a)   Permitted Uses.  Uses listed as permitted in the underlying “base”
zone.
   (b)   Conditional Uses for a Commercial District Base Zone. 
      (1)   Conditional Uses are those uses having some special impact or
uniqueness that requires a careful review of their location, design,
configuration, and special impact to determine the desirability of permitting
their establishment on any given site.  A Conditional Use may be granted
pursuant to the requirements of Section
1129.02, Principal and Conditional Permitted Uses.  Standards for specific
Conditional Uses may be found in Chapter
1161, Conditional Uses, or elsewhere as referenced herein.
      (2)   In keeping with the desire for flexibility in this district, the
following may be permitted as additional Conditional Uses in the Mixed Use
Overlay District:

Services, General Retail, Service Retail, Convenience Retail, Personal Care
Services, and Laundromat.
         B.   Conditional uses in a residential district base zone must be
comparatively small scale.  This does not mean these uses will serve only the
nearby dwellings, but the appearance, mix of uses, and scale of both buildings
and uses must be that of a local or neighborhood establishment.
      (3)   Modification of development standards shall be permitted on the
authority of the Commission as part of the conditional use review.

1141.01  PURPOSE.
Landscaping and screening regulations are established to:
   (a)   Protect residential and other environments from adverse effects -
- such as noise, odors, and dust -- of more intensive adjacent uses;
   (b)   Protect users of parking areas from excessive wind, glare, and
temperature extremes;
   (c)   Mitigate the adverse effects on public streets and adjacent properties
of noise, blowing dust and debris, and glare from motor vehicle headlights and
parking area lighting;
   (d)   Discourage unsafe access to and circulation in parking areas;
   (e)   Contribute to improved community appearance and property values and
preserve and enhance the established character of  Lakewood neighborhoods;
   (f)   Preserve privacy in residential areas next to non-residential uses and
discourage trespass onto such residential properties;
   (g)   Provide trees and shrubbery that improve the urban environment by
cooling the air and land, reducing carbon dioxide in the air, and producing
oxygen;
   (h)   Compensate for the inability, in a densely developed city like
Lakewood, to buffer incompatible uses by use of wide yards and open spaces.
      (Ord. 91-95. Passed 10-7-1996.)
1141.02  REQUIRED LOCATIONS AND EXCEPTIONS.
   (a)   Any multi-family, commercial, or industrial use located on a lot
having a rear or side lot line abutting a residential use, or a rear or side
lot line abutting a public right-of-way, shall install landscaping and
screening along such lot line(s), consistent with this Chapter.
   (b)   Exceptions:
      (1)   Screening on abutting lot:  No landscaping or screening shall be
required along a lot line where adequate landscaping or screening exists along
such lot line on the abutting lot(s).  If such existing screening is lawfully
discontinued, screening on the subject lot consistent with the purposes herein
shall be installed within sixty (60) days of the discontinuation.
      (2)   Below-grade areas:  The height of landscaping or screening along a
lot line that abuts a below-grade parking or loading area may be reduced by the
amount of the difference in grade between the parking or loading area and the
grade at the lot line.  Such difference in grade shall be the difference
between the highest point of the finished grade of the parking or loading area
and the mean average of the lot within four (4) feet of the lot line.
      (3)   Shared driveway:  No landscaping or screening shall be required
along that portion of a lot line along which there is a driveway or vehicular
circulation aisle that is shared with an abutting lot.
      (4)   Building walls:  A blank building wall (no doors, windows, or other
openings), or roof exhausts less than ten (10) feet from a property line along
a lot line shall qualify as screening for purposes of this Chapter if its
location is legally non-conforming or is permitted pursuant to this Code. 
      (5)   Line of sight hazard:  Landscaping and screening shall not create a
sight hazard, as determined by the City Traffic Engineer.
         (Ord. 91-95. Passed 10-7-1996.)
1141.03  LANDSCAPING PLAN.
   (a)   For any use required to provide landscaping and screening, a
landscaping plan shall be filed with an application for:
      (1)   Any rezoning (map amendment);
      (2)   Any conditional use;
      (3)   Any variance which must be approved by the Board;
      (4)   Any lot split or consolidation;
      (5)   Any building permit for a project which must be reviewed by the

   (b)   It shall be the duty of the Architectural Board of Review to review
the landscape plan to determine whether said plan is consistent with the
purposes of this Chapter.  The Architectural Board of Review may approve a
landscape plan, which it finds to be consistent with the purposes of this
Chapter.
(Ord. 91-95. Passed 10-7-1996.)
1141.04  LANDSCAPING AND SCREENING MATERIALS.
   (a)   Screening, approved by the Architectural Board of Review, may take the
form of:
      (1)   A landscaped earthen berm a minimum of two (2) feet high plus
plantings a minimum of two (2) feet high (a total of four [4] feet high) at all
points;
      (2)   A concrete or masonry wall;
      (3)   A wood, wrought iron, tubular steel, or similar fence compatible
with the character of the area in which the fence is to be placed;

1143.01  PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to establish flexible vehicle parking
requirements that support the Vision to provide safe, convenient, and
integrated transportation options throughout the City. Parking requirements are
based on the needs of the community and consider the context of the
neighborhood, transit availability, on-street parking, density, mix of uses,
walkability,  and the use of alternative modes of transportation. Parking
requirements are designed to accommodate average day-to-day demand, as opposed
to peak demand, in order to reduce excessive off-street parking and free up
land for more economically productive or environmentally conscious uses.
(Ord. 36-14.  Passed 1-20-2015.)
1143.02  GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   For every building hereafter erected or expanded, or where the use is
changed or enlarged, there shall be provided parking as set forth in this
chapter.
   (b)   No permits shall be issued for any building, improvement or use of
land, including, but not limited to, building permits and certificates of code
compliance, until a parking plan is submitted to the Director showing such
parking spaces, as defined in Section
1103.02 of this Zoning Code, as is hereunder required. Such plan shall be
prepared at a reasonable scale, showing property lines, the dimensions of the
property, the size and arrangement of all parking spaces, the means of ingress
and egress to such parking spaces from the street and interior circulation
within the property, the extent of any change required in existing site
conditions to provide required parking spaces and such other conditions as may
be necessary to permit review and approval of the proposed parking spaces.
   (c)   Off-street, on-site parking spaces for all uses as required by this
chapter shall be designed and maintained in accordance with applicable sections
of the Code so as to be safe, attractive and free of hazard, nuisance or other
unsafe condition.
   (d)   Unenclosed parking spaces shall not be used for repair of a motor
vehicle.
   (e)   Parking for all motor vehicles shall be on an improved surface of
concrete, asphalt or other materials approved by the Commissioner.
(Ord. 39-18.  Passed 5-6-2019.)
1143.03  DETERMINATION OF REQUIRED OFF-STREET PARKING SPACES.
   (a)   Where floor area is designed as the standard for determining parking
space requirements, floor area shall be computed on the gross floor area (GFA),
in square feet, of all floors of the building, including the exterior walls.
   (b)   Where number of employees is the standard for determining parking
space requirements, employees shall mean the regular working staff (paid, 
volunteer  or otherwise) at maximum strength per shift and in full-time-
equivalent numbers necessary to operate, maintain or service any given facility
or use under normal levels of service.
   (c)   The number of parking spaces required will be computed to the next
largest number.
   (d)   In the case of mixed uses or more uses as listed in Section

be adopted there exists lots, structures, and uses of land and structures which
were lawful prior to adoption of this Code but which would be prohibited,
regulated, or restricted under the terms of this Code or amendments thereto.
The legitimate interests of those who lawfully establish these non-conformities
are herein recognized by providing for their continuance, subject to
regulations limiting their completion, restoration, reconstruction, extension,
and substitution.  Nevertheless, while it is the intent of this Code that such
non-conformities be allowed to continue until removed, they should not be
encouraged to survive.  Nothing in this Chapter shall require any change in the
plans, construction, or designated use of a building or accessory structure or
use for which a valid building permit has been issued prior to the effective
date of adoption or amendment of this Code if construction has been diligently
started within six (6) months of the date of the permit and the entire
structure is completed according to the plans on file with the Commissioner
within two (2) years of the date of the permit.
(Ord. 91-95. Passed 10-7-1996.)
 
1149.02  NON-CONFORMING USE OF LAND (OR LAND WITH MINOR STRUCTURES).
   Where at the time of adoption of this Code lawful use of land exists which
would not be permitted by the regulations imposed by the Code, and where such
use involves no individual structures with replacement cost exceeding
$3,000.00, the use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful,
provided:
   (a)   No such non-conforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor
extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective
date of adoption or amendment of this Code.
   (b)   No such non-conforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any
portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such use at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this Code.
   (c)   If any such non-conforming use of land ceases for any reason for a
period of six (6) months, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the
regulations specified by this Code for the district in which such land is
located.
   (d)   No additional structure not conforming to the requirements of this
Code shall be erected in connection with such non-conforming use of land.
      (Ord. 91-95. Passed 10-7-1996.)
1149.03  NON-CONFORMING USE OF STRUCTURES OR STRUCTURES AND LAND IN
COMBINATION.
   If lawful use involving individual structures with a replacement cost of
$3,000.00 or more, or of structures and land in combination, exists at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this Code that would not be allowed
in the district under the terms of this Code, the lawful use may be continued
so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
   (a)   The Commission may, at public hearing and following the notice
procedures for use variance(s) set forth in Section
1173.04, authorize the expansion of a non-conforming structure or use a maximum
of 2,000 square feet or up to twenty percent (20%) of the existing floor area,
whichever is greater, where the Commission finds:
      (1)   That side and rear yards a minimum of ten (10) feet wide/deep will
be maintained along lot lines abutting conforming uses; the Commission may
require larger side or rear yards where necessary to effectively insulate
abutting conforming uses from the non-conforming use.
      (2)   That landscaping and screening, approved by the Architectural Board
of Review pursuant to Chapter
1141, will be provided.
      (3)   That expansion of the non-conforming use will not have a
substantial negative impact on the surrounding area; when determining whether
the expansion will have a substantial negative impact, the Commission may
consider, but is not limited to, the following:
         A.   Traffic patterns and generation, including on-site loading and
unloading areas;
         B.   Parking;
         C.   Lighting;
         D.   Whether there will be a substantial increase in the generation of
noise, vibrations, or fumes; and
         E.   Existing public services.
When considering whether to authorize the expansion, the Commission may
consider any other factors it deems relevant.
   (b)   Any non-conforming use may be extended throughout any part of a
building, which was manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of
adoption, or amendment of this Code, but no such use shall be extended to
occupy any land outside such building.
   (c)   If no structural alterations are made, any non-conforming use of a
structure or structure and land may, as a conditional use, be changed to
another non-conforming use provided the Commission makes the following
findings:
      (1)   That the proposed use is more appropriate and compatible with the
neighborhood than the existing use;
      (2)   That there will be reduction in traffic if the existing use created
a traffic problem.
In permitting such change the Commission may require appropriate conditions and
safeguards that it deems necessary to protect and improve the neighborhood.
   (d)   Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a
non-conforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform
to all of the regulations for the district, and the non-conforming use shall
not thereafter be resumed.
   (e)   When a non-conforming use of a structure, or structure and land in
combination, is discontinued or abandoned intentionally or otherwise for a
period of six (6) consecutive months (except when government action impedes
access to the premises), the structure, or structure and premises in
combination, shall not thereafter be used except in conformity with the
regulations of the district in which it is located.
   (f)   A non-conforming structure or use more than fifty percent (50%)
destroyed or removed by whatever means shall not be restored or replaced except
by a conforming structure or use.
      (Ord. 91-95. Passed 10-7-1996.)
1149.04  NON-CONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this Code that could not be built under the terms of this Code by
reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, its location on
the lot, or other requirements concerning the structure, such structure may be
continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, provided that no such non-
conforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its
non-conformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be altered to decrease
its non-conformity.
   (a)   Such non-conforming structure or non-conforming portions of a
structure more than fifty percent (50%) destroyed or removed by whatever means
shall not be restored or replaced except by a conforming structure or use.
   (b)   Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance
whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in
which it is located after it is moved.
      (Ord. 91-95. Passed 10-7-1996.)
1149.05  NON-CONFORMING LOTS.
   (a)   Where any single non-conforming lot in a residential district which
existed prior to adoption of this Code is in separate ownership and not of
continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership:
      (1)   A single-family dwelling and other accessory structures permitted
under Chapter
1121 may be constructed on such lot.
      (2)   This subsection (a) shall apply even though such lot fails to meet
the requirements for area and/or frontage that are generally applicable to the
district; requirements of Chapter
1121, other than those applying to area and/or frontage, shall apply to such
lot.
      (3)   Variances to requirements other than lot area or frontage shall be
obtained pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section
 1173.04.
   (b)   Where two (2) more lots or any combination of lots and portions of
lots with continuous frontage are in single ownership, and such lots do not
meet the area or frontage requirements of the district in which they are
located, such lots shall be considered a single zoning lot for purposes of this
Code.
      (1)   No portion of such zoning lot shall be used or sold in a manner,
which diminishes compliance with the area or width requirements for the
district in which the zoning lot is located.
      (2)   Re-subdivision of such zoning lot to create a lot, which does not
meet the area or frontage requirements of this Code, is prohibited.
         (Ord. 91-95. Passed 10-7-1996.)
1149.06  REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE.
   On any non-conforming structure or portion of a structure containing a non-
conforming use, work may be done in any period of twelve (12) consecutive
months on ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of nonbearing walls,
fixtures, wiring, or plumbing, to an extent not exceeding ten percent (10%) of
the current replacement cost of the non-conforming structure or non-conforming
portion of the structure as the case may be, provided that the cubic content
existing when it became non-conforming shall not be increased.  If a non-
conforming structure or portion of a structure containing a non-conforming use
is physically unsafe or unlawful due to lack of repairs and maintenance and is
declared by the Commissioner to be unsafe or unlawful by reason of physical
condition, it shall not thereafter be restored, repaired or rebuilt except in
conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located.  This
Section shall not apply to single- and two-family dwellings.  Nothing in the
Code shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe
condition of any building or part thereof.
(Ord. 91-95. Passed 10-7-1996.)

1156.01  PURPOSE.
   (a)   Planned Development (PD) zoning is intended to encourage orderly
development and redevelopment of property, while allowing more flexibility and
creativity in design to achieve high quality, integrated site planning not
otherwise possible under the constraints of normal zoning requirements without
detriment to neighboring properties. PDs are intended to permit a more flexible
approach to land use control and to promote development that is innovative,
integrated with surrounding uses, and shows sensitivity to cultural,
environmental, and economic considerations 
 
   (b)   Planned Development Zoning is intended to encourage development which
is consistent with the Community Vision including more compact development,
pedestrian-friendly site design, urban street character, energy-efficient
design, industry best practices, and accommodation of a range of compatible
land uses through appropriate site design.  PDs are intended to permit a more
flexible approach to land use control and to promote a variety of housing
types.
 
   (c)   A PD encourages the development of compact, pedestrian-scaled,
neighborhoods while providing greater efficiencies in use of infrastructure. 
It is intended to help advance revitalization initiatives and recognize the
market demand for new residential and commercial development within compact,
pedestrian friendly districts.  PD zoning is intended to work in conjunction
with the proactive development of pocket parks, open spaces, and the creation
of public spaces within the districts. PD Zoning specifically discourages those
uses that: promote a strip center development pattern, promote idle land and
over parking, and detract from the image enhancement intentions of this
district.
(Ord. 17-17.  Passed 3-20-17.)
1156.02  LOCATION OF PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS.
   (a)   Any parcel or collection of parcels greater than 10,000 ft2 in area
may be rezoned to PD. Past use of the site and the zoning of abutting
properties will be considered as part of the approval process.
 
   (b)   Approval of a Planned Development will result in a zoning map
amendment. It shall result in the creation of a new site-specific zoning
district with specific requirements and standards that are unique to that
planned development.
 
   (c)   Grouping of uses permitted in other districts to create developments
of compatible and mutually supportive activities is encouraged provided there
are adequate buffers to adjacent properties of other uses and designs to
promote compatibility and transitions to adjacent properties.
 
   (d)   It is not intended that the Commission automatically approve PD
proposals that seek increases in density, changes in allowed uses, or
alterations in district standards; rather, approvals shall only be received by
those proposals that provide design characteristics that substantially achieve
the purpose of this Chapter and cannot be substantially achieved in any base
zoning district.
 
   (e)   A PD should utilize the following characteristics to the greatest
possible extent which shall be considered in the approval process:
      (1)   Designs that reflect the Vision and that offer types or densities
of development that are not available under the other Sections of this Code.
      (2)   Designs that utilize a creative approach to achieve better urban
design, efficiencies in use of land and infrastructure, and the provision of
aesthetic amenities.
      (3)   Designs that provide appropriate buffers and transitions between
areas with different land uses and development densities.
      (4)   Designs that maintain or enhance the appearance of neighborhoods by
complementing neighborhood architectural character.
      (5)   Designs that are intended to encourage flexibility, innovation, and
creativity in site and development design by allowing the mixing of permitted
uses and/or modification of variation from otherwise applicable zone district
and development standards.
      (6)   Designs that conserve areas of natural beauty and green spaces to
the greatest degree possible consistent with accommodating new development.
      (7)   Designs that incorporate "green architecture" pursuant to
Resolution 7746-03, City of Lakewood Green Building Policy.
         (Ord. 17-17.  Passed 3-20-17.)
1156.03  STANDARDS FOR REVIEW OF A PRELIMINARY PD PLAN.
   An application for approval of a Preliminary PD Plan, together with
submitted plans and reports, shall be reviewed for its conformance with the
following standards:
   (a)   The proposed PD should contain uses that are sensitive to the abutting
land uses and to the zoning designation which the PD is replacing. Mixed use
within the planned development or within the same structure located in the PD
is encouraged where appropriate;
   (b)   The proposed PD shall comply with the subdivision requirements as set
forth in Chapter
1155 of this Code, except to the extent modifications, variances, or waivers
have been expressly allowed pursuant to paragraph (e) below;
   (c)   Adverse impacts on adjacent properties, including but not limited to
increased traffic or noise, as described in Chapter
515 of the Ordinances, and visual impacts, shall be mitigated to the maximum
extent feasible;
   (d)   The PD shall be integrated with adjacent development through street
connections, sidewalks, trails, and similar features;
   (e)   All district, development, and subdivision standards set forth in
Chapters
1127 and
1129 (such as lot size, floor area ratio, structure height, etc.), and
1155, except those specified in subsection (f) below, may be modified or varied
upon a finding that the proposed PD incorporates creative site design which
represents an improvement in quality and service of the purposes set forth in
Section
1156.01 over what could have been accomplished through strict application of
the otherwise applicable district or development standards, including but not
limited to improvements in open space provision and access; environmental
protection; tree/vegetation preservation; efficient provision of streets,
roads, and other utilities and services; or choice of living and housing
environments;
   (f)   The proposed PD shall comply with the following requirements, which
shall not be modified or varied except as expressly set forth below or as
permitted by the Commission.
      (1)   Minimum area requirement.  All Planned Developments shall have a
minimum size of 10,000 square feet.

            (Ord. 17-17.  Passed 3-20-17.)
1156.05  DESIGN PRINCIPLES.
   The following Design Principles provide certain guidelines and requirements,
as noted, in the design preparation of a Preliminary PD Plan.
   (a)   Building and Site Design.
      (1)   Wherever feasible, buildings shall be designed to provide massing
configurations with a variety of different wall planes.  Plain, monolithic
structures with long walls and roof plane surfaces are discouraged.
      (2)   Building facades should incorporate design elements such as changes
in color or texture; projections, recesses, and reveals; arcades or pergolas
providing pedestrian interest; or equivalent elements that subdivide the wall
into human scale proportions.  Blank facades are highly discouraged, especially
on walls facing streets or pedestrian ways. 
      (3)   Commercial Building facades shall have highly visible customer
entrances that feature canopies, overhangs, arcades, distinctive roof forms,
arches, display windows, or landscaped features.  Primary entrances should face
streets on which they are located.
      (4)   Buildings shall have well defined rooflines with attention to
architectural detail.  Consideration should be given to the prevailing pattern
of roofs in the area surrounding and within the PD.
      (5)   Sloping roofs, where used, shall have one (1) or more of the
following architectural features: gables, hips, horizontal or vertical breaks,
or other similar techniques that are to be integrated into the building
architecture.
 
   (b)   Building Materials.  Building materials shall be limited to brick,
masonry, stucco, wood, fiber, cement siding, wood shingle, wood siding,
cultured stone, or other similar materials.  Prohibited materials include
aluminum or vinyl siding, dryvit-type products on the lowest eight (8) feet of
any structure, split faced block, and other similar materials.
 
   (c)   Vehicular Circulation and Access.
      (1)   Circulation systems shall be designed to efficiently facilitate
traffic flow, yet designed to discourage speeds and volumes that impede
pedestrian activity and safety.
      (2)   Street designs are encouraged to incorporate traffic calming
devices and techniques.
      (3)   Common or shared access points are encouraged.
      (4)   To the maximum extent feasible, common or shared service and
delivery access shall be provided between adjacent parcels or buildings, and
provided to the rear of buildings.
      (5)   Safe and adequate site distances shall be provided at all
intersections.
      (6)   Transit stops should be incorporated into site plans, where
feasible.
      (7)   The developer as part of the site plan review process shall provide
traffic impact studies.
 
   (d)   Pedestrian Access and Circulation.
      (1)   A coordinated pedestrian system shall be provided throughout the
PD, including connections between uses on the site, and between the site and
adjacent properties and rights-of-way.  Pedestrian connections shall be
provided to properties across streets wherever feasible.
      (2)   The site shall be connected to adjacent properties and pedestrian
facilities to the maximum extent feasible.
      (3)   Continuous sidewalks or other pedestrian facilities shall be
provided between the primary entrances to buildings, all parking areas that
serve the buildings, pedestrian facilities on adjacent properties that extend
to the boundaries shared with the PD, any public sidewalk along perimeter
streets, or other community amenities or gathering spaces.
      (4)   Decorative sidewalks, such as brick pavers, are encouraged at key
intersections or streets.
      (5)   Street furniture or other amenities are encouraged, such as plazas,
benches, and decorative pedestrian light fixtures.
      (6)   Open and public areas should be provided as a mixture of green
space landscaping and hardscape pedestrian areas with a goal of twenty (20)
percent of the site area.
 
   (e)   Parking.
      (1)   Adequate parking shall be provided, but excessive parking is
discouraged.  The standards contained in Chapter
1143 shall be used as a guide, but those standards may be modified without the
need for a variance based upon other considerations as determined by the
Commission, and a finding by the Commission that the modified parking standards
would comply with the provisions of the Code and the intent of the PD.
      (2)   The visual impact of parking shall be minimized through the use of
interior landscaped islands and through dividing parking spaces into groupings.
      (3)   The edges of parking lots shall be screened through landscaping or
other methods such as decorative fences.
      (4)   A minimum of one (1) off-street parking space shall be required
behind each residential unit or garage.  No garage openings shall be permitted
onto public streets.
 
   (f)   Landscaping and Screening.
      (1)   It shall be the duty of the Commission to determine whether a
reasonable percentage of the area within a PD shall be maintained in a
combination of landscaped and urban open space.  The project must adhere to the
spirit of the City's landscape values.  The standards contained in Chapter
1141 shall be used as a guide, but those standards may be modified without the
need for a variance based upon other considerations determined by the
Commission that such considerations would comply with the provisions of the
Code and the intent of the PD.
      (2)   Pedestrian access from adjacent residential streets is encouraged. 
The owners of residential property directly abutting rear yards, parking and
loading areas of a PD shall be contacted and offered masonry screening and/or
appropriately designed alternatives.  PD applicants shall document meetings
with abutting residential owners and the results of such meetings.  The intent
of this provision is for the applicant to involve nearby residents in the PD
project.  City staff shall assist in this process.
      (3)   Where required, screening fences and walls shall be erected.  The
standards of Chapter
1141 shall be used as a guide, but those standards may be modified without the
need for a variance based upon other considerations determined by the
Commission that such considerations would comply with the provisions of the
Code and the intent of the PD.
      (4)   If used, the owner of the property on which the fence is required
to be erected shall permanently and adequately maintain screening fences or
walls.  The following types of walls or fences shall qualify, Chapter
1141 notwithstanding.
      (5)     Masonry wall or fence.  Masonry fences or walls shall be
constructed with the finish side out and of any of the following materials:

Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996
Federal law at 47 U.S.C. §332(c)(7)
1159.01  PURPOSE.
   These regulations are established to provide for the construction and use of
wireless telecommunication facilities in the City.  The regulations allow
wireless telecommunication facilities as a permitted use, conditional use, or
accessory use depending upon the specific land areas of the City in which, and
circumstances under which, they are proposed to be located.  The purpose of
these regulations is to balance the competing interests created by the Federal
Telecommunications Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-104, codified at 47 U.S.C. §§
151 et seq.) and the interests of the City in regulating wireless
telecommunication facilities for the following reasons:
   (a)   To provide for orderly development within the City;
   (b)   To protect property values;
   (c)   To maintain the aesthetic appearance of the City, including, but not
limited to, its unique residential character, unobstructed open spaces and
attractive commercial, office, and industrial areas;
   (d)   To protect residential properties, parks, open spaces and the
nonintensive commercial zoning districts which are characteristic of the City
from the adverse effects of towers and related facilities;
   (e)   To promote collocation of wireless telecommunications facilities in
order to decrease the total number of towers in the City;
   (f)   To provide for and protect the health, safety and general welfare of
the residents and visitors of the  City; and
   (g)   To maintain, where possible, the integrity of the existing zoning
regulations contained in the Code.
   The regulations establish a hierarchy of acceptable land areas for the
location of wireless telecommunication facilities through the establishment of
such use as a permitted use in certain zoning districts, as a conditional use
in certain zoning districts, or as a permitted accessory use for erection of
antennas only, which determination is dependent upon the location and
characteristics of such land areas.
(Ord. 3-98. Passed 5-18-1998.)

1161.01  PURPOSE.
   Several unique uses require regulations intended to accommodate such uses in
a reasonable and equitable manner while safeguarding the property rights of all
individuals and the health, safety, and general welfare of the community. 
Toward these ends, this Chapter provides for a more detailed evaluation of each
use conditionally permitted in a specific zoning district with respect to such
considerations as location, design, size, method(s) of operation, intensity of
use, public facility requirements, and traffic generation to ensure that each
proposal is consistent with the intent and objectives of the particular
district in which it is to be located.  Accordingly, a Conditional Use Permit
shall be required for any use deemed a conditional use by this Code, subject to
the procedures and requirements of this Chapter and Section
1173.02.
(Ord. 91-95. Passed 10-7-1996.)
1161.02  GENERAL STANDARDS FOR ALL CONDITIONAL USES.
   A conditional use, and uses accessory to such conditional uses, shall be
permitted where the use is identified by this Code as a conditionally permitted
use, or is found by the Commission to be a substantially similar use, in the
zoning district in which the use is located.  In addition to any specific
regulations required by this Code or the Ordinances, the Commission shall find:
   (a)   That the conditional use will be consistent with the general
objectives, or any specific objectives, for the zoning district in which it is
located, as set forth in this Code and the Vision.
   (b)   That the conditional use will be designed, constructed, operated and
maintained so as not to be detrimental to or endanger the public health,
safety, or general welfare.
   (c)   That the conditional use will not change the essential character of
the general vicinity in which it is located.
   (d)   That the conditional use will not be injurious to the uses permitted
by right in the immediate vicinity, nor substantially diminish or impair
property values within said vicinity.
   (e)   That establishment of the conditional use will not impede the normal
and orderly development of uses permitted by right in the immediate vicinity.
   (f)   That adequate utilities and public facilities and services, such as
streets and sewer and water services, are or will be provided; and that
establishment of the conditional use will not require expenditures of public
funds for such public facilities or services.
   (g)   That adequate measures have been taken to minimize traffic congestion
on public streets.
   (h)   That the conditional use will not suffer substantial hardship in the
future due to the conditional use being surrounded by uses permitted by right,
which are incompatible with the conditional use.
   (i)   That the conditional use shall, in all other respects, conform to the
applicable regulations of the district in which it is located as well as the
specific conditions set forth in Section
1161.03.
   (j)   A Conditional Use Permit issued pursuant to this Chapter may not be
transferred to any other person or address.
      (Ord. 91-95. Passed 10-7- 19 96.)
   (k)   Notwithstanding the above provisions, a Conditional Use Permit issued
pursuant to this Chapter for a Mixed Use Overlay development may be transferred
to another person or address provided that the regulations in Chapter
1135, Mixed Use Overlay District, and all other provisions of the Ordinances
and this Code that are not in conflict with Chapter
1135 have been satisfied.
      (Ord. 61-04. Passed 7-6-2004.)
   Notwithstanding anything in this Chapter or this Section to the contrary,
where the Commissioner determines, after compliance with the requirements of
Section
1173.02, that a permit holder seeking renewal of a permit issued pursuant to
this Section has remained in compliance with the conditions of said permit, the
Commissioner may issue such renewal.
(Ord. 91-95. Passed 10-7-1996.)
 
1161.03  SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS FOR SPECIFIC USES.

1161.02, the following specific conditions shall apply to each use or class of
uses listed in this Section

prescribing supplementary conditions and safeguards in addition to these

Review prior to the demolition of any existing single-, two- or three-family
dwelling, in the R1L, R1M, R1H, R2, ML, MH and L zoning districts, on the
proposed lot.  In addition, if applicable, approval by the Commission for
conditional use as accessory parking under this subsection must also be
approved prior to the demolition of any existing single-, two- or three-family
dwelling on the proposed lot.  If such lot is substantially vacant due to
demolition prior to the time of application for parking lot design approval and
conditional use approval, the lot shall have been vacant for at least twenty-
four (24) months preceding the application unless the Commission grants a
waiver from such time requirement based on reasonable causes for such
demolition by an owner, or prior owner, beyond his/her reasonable control, such
as fire or other source of property damage or loss.
When determining whether to grant a conditional use permit for accessory
parking, the Commission may limit the hours of operation of the proposed

applicable generally to other lands or structures in the same zoning district;

or non-harmonious use, structure, or site conditions, or whether the property
in question abuts a less restrictive zoning district;
      (3)   Whether the property in question will yield a reasonable return or
whether there can be any beneficial use of the property without the variance
(s);
      (4)   Whether the variance(s) is substantial;
      (5)   Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be
substantially altered or whether adjoining properties would suffer a
substantial detriment as a result of the variance(s);
      (6)   Whether the variance(s) would adversely affect the delivery of
governmental services (e.g., water, sewer, refuse removal);
      (7)   Whether the property owner purchased the property with knowledge of
the zoning restriction;
      (8)   Whether the property owner’s predicament feasibly can be obviated
through some method other than a variance(s); and
      (9)   Whether the spirit and intent of the Code would be observed and
substantial justice done by granting the variance(s).
         (Ord. 91-95. Passed 10-7-1996.)
   (d)   The following factors shall be considered by the Board or Commission,
where applicable, when determining whether an applicant will suffer an
unnecessary hardship; such hardship must be demonstrated by clear and
convincing evidence as to ALL of the following:
(Ord. 24-98. Passed 5-18-1998.)
      (1)   The property cannot be put to any economically viable use under any
of the permitted uses in the zoning district in which it is located;
      (2)   The variance(s) request stems from a condition which is unique to
the property at issue and not ordinarily found in the district;
      (3)   The hardship condition is not created by actions of the applicant;
      (4)   The applicant purchased the property without knowledge of the
zoning restriction;
      (5)   The variance(s) sought is the minimum which will afford relief to
the applicant;
      (6)   The granting of the variance(s) will not adversely affect the
rights of those property owners to whom notice is required under subsection (e)
herein;
      (7)   The granting of the variance(s) will not adversely affect the
public health, safety, or general welfare; and
      (8)   The variance(s) will be consistent with the general spirit and
intent of this Code.

structures that meet the definition of public nuisance structures are declared
to be “unsafe structures” as well.

the code are likewise declared to be public nuisance structures under this code
section.
   (c)   Per Se Public Nuisance Structures.  Vacant and unsafe structures in
which utility services have not been shut off are declared to be a public
nuisance because of the risk of harm from explosion, accidental fire or

(Ord. 40-09. Passed 5-18-2009.)
1306.522 DECLARATION OF PUBLIC NUISANCE; REPAIR OR DEMOLITION  OF UNSAFE
STRUCTURES AND EXTERIOR PROPERTY NUISANCES;  VIOLATIONS AND REMEDIAL NOTICES;
APPEALS PROCESS; COST RECOVERY.
   (a)   Declaration of Public Nuisance.  All public nuisance structures are
declared to be public nuisances. The public nuisance shall be abated by
correction of the violations to the minimum standards of the Codified
Ordinances of Lakewood, Ohio, the Revised Code and the Ohio Administrative
Code, including the Ohio Fire Code, or by demolition.
 
   (b)   Examination and Condemnation.
      (1)   The Building Commissioner, Assistant Building Commissioner or his
or her designee(for the purposes of this section, the “Commissioner”) is
authorized to examine or cause to be examined every building or other structure
reported to be unsafe or damaged or injurious to or a menace to the public, and
shall make a written record of the examination.
      (2)   The Commissioner may designate as a public nuisance structure any
structures or conditions, or any portion thereof, found to be unsafe under the
criteria established in Section
1306.521.
      (3)   The Commissioner may also declare that a public nuisance structure
which, due to its advanced state of dilapidation, substantial fire damage or
structural infirmity, is an immediate hazard to human life or health, may only
be abated by immediate repair and rehabilitation to the minimum standards of
the Codified Ordinances of Lakewood, Ohio, the Revised Code, and Ohio
Administrative Code, including the Ohio Fire Code, or by demolition.
      (4)   Whenever the Commissioner finds a vacant structure open to entry at
doors,  windows or other points accessible to the general public, the
Commissioner may cause the structure to be secured at those points of entry. 
The Commissioner shall be authorized at any time to enter the premises to
secure the structure in order to lessen the severity of the public nuisance. 
In securing the structure, the Commissioner may call any department,  division
or bureau of the City for whatever assistance may be necessary, or may, by
private contract, secure such structure, and may notify any public utility to
shut off service to the property.
   (c)   Notice of Violation.
      (1)   Whenever the Commissioner finds a building, structure or a portion
thereof to be unsafe, and determines it or the property on which it is located

mail to the owner, agent or person in control of the public nuisance structure
and to any mortgagee of record a written notice of violation stating the
defects in the building or structure.  The notice of violation shall require
the owner to abate the nuisance condition of the public nuisance structure by
correction of the violations and defects to the minimum standards of the
Codified Ordinances of Lakewood, Ohio, the Revised Code and the Ohio
Administrative Code, including the Ohio Fire Code, or by demolition and removal
of the public nuisance structure or a portion thereof within a stated time. 
The notice also shall state that if the nuisance is not abated within the
required time, the Commissioner may take appropriate action to repair, remove
or otherwise abate the public nuisance structure,  and that the owner, agent or
person in control shall be responsible for the costs.  The handing of the
violation notice to the owner, agent or person in control of the public
nuisance structure or a portion thereof shall be deemed actual notice, and is
legal and valid service, and no other form of service is necessary.
      (2)   If the person to whom the notice and order is addressed is not
found after a reasonable and diligent search, then the notice and order shall
be sent by certified mail to his tax mailing address, if available, as
indicated on the County tax duplicate, and a copy of the notice shall be posted
in a conspicuous place on the premises to which it relates.  The mailing and
posting shall be deemed legal service of the notice.
      (3)   An owner, agent or person in control of the public nuisance
structure, a mortgagee of record, or a lien-holder of record who has received a
notice of violation or a notice to make corrections to the minimum standards of
the Codified Ordinances of Lakewood, Ohio, the Revised Code and the Ohio
Administrative Code, including the Ohio Fire Code, or to demolish and remove,
as provided for in this section, shall inform prospective purchasers, vendees,
grantees, assignees, lessees, or land contractees of the notice of violation or
the notice to make corrections, or to demolish and remove. No person shall
transfer to a vendee, grantee, assignee, lessee, land contractee or any other
transferee any interest in a public nuisance structure after receiving a notice
of violation to make corrections, or to demolish and remove the same, without
first providing the transferee with a copy of the notice.
      (4)   No person, agent, firm or corporation shall sell, by land contract
or otherwise, any interest in any public nuisance structure without furnishing
the buyer, prior to the sale, a copy of any outstanding notice or order from
the City, including any notice of violation or any outstanding notice to make
corrections to the minimum standards of the Codified Ordinances of Lakewood,
Ohio, the Revised Code and the Ohio Administrative Code, including the Ohio
Fire Code, or any outstanding notice to demolish and remove.  No buyer or
grantee, by land contract or otherwise, shall obtain any interest in any public
nuisance structure without obtaining from the seller, prior to sale, the
documents described above.
      (5)   No person, agent, firm or corporation acting in the capacity of an
escrow agent in any real estate transaction involving the sale of a public
nuisance structure in the City, shall disburse any funds unless the provisions
of this section have been met.
      (6)   Any buyer or grantee, by land contract or otherwise, of a public
nuisance structure, shall begin at the date of transfer to comply with any
notice or order obtained or to be obtained under this paragraph and, within ten
(10) days of the date of transfer, shall notify the Commissioner, in writing,
of the actions that will be taken to comply. The Commissioner may then
establish a reasonable time to comply.
 
   (d)   Vacating Buildings and Prohibiting Use.  The Commissioner may also
require in the notice issued under subsection (c)(1) of this section that the
public nuisance structure or a portion thereof be vacated, not be reoccupied,
or used until the specified repairs and improvements are completed, inspected,
and approved by the Commissioner.
   The Commissioner may cause to be posted at each entrance to the public
nuisance structure a notice as follows:
 
“THIS STRUCTURE IS IN A DANGEROUS CONDITION AND HAS BEEN CONDEMNED AND ITS USE
HAS BEEN PROHIBITED BY THE BUILDING COMMISSIONER”
 
   The notice shall remain posted until the required corrections are made, or
until demolition is completed.  No person shall remove the notice without
written permission of the Commissioner,  nor shall any person use or enter the
public nuisance structure, except for the purpose of making the required
corrections, or effectively boarding, or demolishing the public nuisance
structure.
 
   (e)   Right to Appeal.
      (1)   Board of Building Standards and Building Appeals.
         A.   The owner, agent or person in control of a public nuisance

in this section within ten (10) days of the service of the  Commissioner’s
notice.

and conduct a public hearing within twenty (20) days of the receipt of the
notice of appeal.

Commissioner’s notice.
         D.   The Board of Building Standards and Building Appeals, upon
hearing all the facts and evidence, shall make a determination as to whether
the City has met its burden to show the existence of the condition or defects
in the Commissioner’s notice.
         E.   If the Board of Building Standards and Building Appeals makes a
determination that the City has met its burden, then the decision of the Board
shall become a final order.
         F.   The Board shall publish its decision and serve notice by
certified mail to the owner, agent or person in control of the public nuisance
structure or portion thereof and to any mortgagee of record.
         G.   Any notice served by the Commissioner shall automatically become
a final order if a written notice of appeal before the Board is not filed in
the office of the Board within the time set forth above.
      (2)   Appeal to court of competent jurisdiction.  Notwithstanding any
provisions contained herein, the owner or person in control of the structure
shall have the right to appeal the decision and order of the Board to a court
of competent jurisdiction.  In the absence of an appeal, all actions taken
shall constitute a valid exercise of the police powers of the City of Lakewood.
 
   (f)   Noncompliance with Notice.
      (1)   Commissioner authorized to abate, demolish, remove.  In case the
owner,  agent or person in control fails, neglects or refuses to comply with
the notice to repair or rehabilitate, or to demolish and remove a public
nuisance structure or a portion thereof, the Commissioner may take appropriate
action to abate, demolish or remove the public nuisance structure or portion
thereof or to abate or remove any condition constituting the nuisance.
      (2)   Action by Director of Law.  The Commissioner may advise the
Director of Law of the facts in the case, who may institute appropriate action
in court to cause correction of the violations and defects, or demolition and
removal,  or effective boarding of the building or structure pending
rehabilitation.
      (3)   Rehabilitation permits not a bar to Commissioner’s action to
abate.  The securing of rehabilitation permits for the building or structure
shall not in and of itself bar the Commissioner from taking action to abate the
nuisance.
      (4)   Failure to comply with notice.  In case the owner, agent or person
in control fails, neglects or refuses to comply with the notice to repair or
rehabilitate, or to demolish and remove a public nuisance structure or a
portion thereof, or to remove or abate any other condition that is defined as a
nuisance under this section, the Commissioner may take appropriate action to
take repair or maintenance measures or cause utility services to be shut off or
to otherwise abate the public nuisance.  The Commissioner shall specifically
state in writing the findings with respect to the public nuisance structure,
and shall determine whether to perform repair or maintenance based on factors
which may include the following: the distance of the structure from neighboring
structures, the type of structure, the extent of deterioration, the likelihood
of vandalism or arson, the economic likelihood of eventual complete
rehabilitation of the structure, and the cost of repair or maintenance.
      (5)   Notice of intent to demolish.  The Commissioner shall give written
notice informing the owner, agent or person in control of the public nuisance
structure or a portion thereof, as well as any mortgagee and lienholder of
record, of the City’s intention to demolish and remove the unsafe building or
structure at least thirty (30) days before the intended action by the City. 
The notice may be effective concurrently with the violation notice.
 
   (g)   Costs.
      (1)   Any and all expenses or costs incurred under this section for the
removal,  repair, alteration, securing or boarding of a public nuisance
structure or for abating any other nuisance identified under this section shall
be paid by the owner of such building or structure, except when such expenses
or costs are incurred with respect to a government or school building owned by
a governmental entity or political subdivision and are funded by federal money.
      (2)   Whenever an inspection is made after the compliance date stated on
a Commissioner’s notice issued under this section, or after a compliance date
established by a court of competent jurisdiction, which inspection is made to
determine whether the violation has been remedied and the violation has not
been remedied, or whenever an additional permit is obtained for work 
previously permitted and the original permit has expired or was appropriately
voided, a fee of one hundred dollars ($100.00) shall be charged for each
inspection, except that this fee shall not apply to owner- occupied one- and
two-family dwelling structures.
      (3)   If within thirty (30) days from the date the Commissioner sends a
statement of charges and costs incurred hereunder, the owner fails to pay for
the costs of removal, repair, alteration, securing or boarding or of
inspections of violations that have not been remedied, the Commissioner may
certify the amount to the City including collection agency fees. The City may
make written return to the County Auditor of the action under this section with
a statement of the charges for services, the amount paid for the performing of
labor and a proper description of premises. Certification to the County Auditor
is for the purpose of making expenses and costs a lien upon the lands, to be
collected as other taxes and returned to the City of Lakewood.
      (4)   Notwithstanding the method of collection set forth in this
subsection, the Director of Law may take any action necessary to collect the
costs of  demolition, boarding or other nuisance abatement from the owner or
other responsible party.

1308.01  GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization: Title. Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens. Therefore, the Council of Lakewood, State of Ohio, does ordain the
provisions of this chapter, hereinafter referred to as this "Code," which shall
be known as the Flood Damage Prevention Code of the City of Lakewood.
   (b)   Findings of Fact. The City has special flood hazard areas that are
subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property,
health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately
elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage also
contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such damages
and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations are
adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss. In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities,
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply. These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City as
identified in subsection (f) of this section, including any additional areas of
special flood hazard annexed by the City.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Rate Map for Cuyahoga County, Ohio and Incorporated
Areas effective August 15, 2019;
      (2)   Flood Insurance Study for Cuyahoga County, Ohio and Incorporated
Areas effective August 15, 2019;
      (3)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
flood-plain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard;
and
      (4)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City as required by subsection (c) of Section 1308.04.  Any revisions to
the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby adopted by reference and
declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or studies are on
file at the City Hall at 12650 Detroit Avenue, Lakewood, Ohio.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including subdivision regulations,
zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations are not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing
easements, covenants or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and
another ordinance, easement, covenant or deed restriction conflict or overlap,
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
   (h)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or federal law, such state or federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the City, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on these
regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (j)   Severability. Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof,
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.

subject to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than one foot or with
contributing drainage area less than one square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   “Zone C and Zone X (unshaded).” Areas determined to be outside the
500-year floodplain.
      (8)   “Zone V.” Coastal special flood hazard area subject to a 100-year
flood from velocity hazard (wave action); base flood elevations are not
determined.
      (9)   “Zone VE and VI-30.” Coastal special flood hazard area subject to a
100-year from velocity hazard (wave action); base flood elevations are
determined.
   (s)   “Flood insurance study (FIS).” The official report in which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (t)   “Floodproofing.” Any combination of structural and non-structural
additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate
flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary
facilities, structures and their contents.
   (u)   “Flood protection elevation.” The flood protection elevation, or FPE,
is the base flood elevation plus one foot of freeboard. In areas where no base
flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection
elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood elevations
determined and/or approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (v)   “Floodway.” A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base
flood discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the City.
      The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized
by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
   (w)   “Freeboard.” A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a
flood level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway
conditions, such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice
jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (x)   “Historic structure.” Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district;
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office; or
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by Lakewood as a historic property under a program certified by the Ohio
Historic Preservation Office.
   (y)   “Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis.” An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (z)   “Letter of map change (LOMC).” A letter of map change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective flood insurance
rate maps, flood boundary and floodway maps, and flood insurance studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   Letter of map amendment (LOMA). A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective flood insurance rate map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of map revision (LOMR). A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR). A comment by FEMA
regarding a proposed project that would, upon construction, affect the
hydrologic or hydraulic characteristics of a flooding source and thus result in
the modification of the existing regulatory floodway, the effective base flood
elevations, or the special flood hazard area. A CLOMR does not amend or revise
effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary and floodway maps, or flood
insurance studies.
   (aa)   “Limit of moderate wave action (LiMWA).” A line shown on a flood
insurance rate map to indicate the inland limit of the 1.5-ft breaking wave
height during the base flood.
   (bb)   “Lowest floor.” The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an “enclosure
below the lowest floor” which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area
other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance
with the applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for
enclosures below the lowest floor.
   (cc)   “Manufactured home.” A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term “manufactured home” does not include a “recreational vehicle.” For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Ohio R.C. Chapter 4781.
   (dd)   “Mean sea level.” For purposes of the National Flood Insurance
Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to
which base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are
referenced.
   (ee)   “Manufactured home park.” As specified in the Ohio Adm. Code 4781-12-
01 (K), a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three or
more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of charge
or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority. Manufactured home park does not
include any tract of land used solely for the storage or display for sale of
manufactured homes.
   (ff)   “Moderate wave action area (MoWA).” A special flood hazard area
subject to the potential for breaking wave heights of greater than or equal to
1.5 feet, but less than three feet, where the primary source of flooding is
storm surges, seiches. A MoWA is an area within zone AE on a FIRM that is
between the inland limit of zone VE and a Limit of Moderate Wave Action, where
identified. (Also known as "Coastal A Zone.")
   (gg)   “National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).” The NFIP is a federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the federal government that states if a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (hh)   “New construction.” Structures for which the “start of construction”
commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain regulation adopted by
Lakewood and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.
      For the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the
“start of construction” commenced on or after the effective date of an initial
FIRM February 1,1978 and includes any subsequent improvements to such
structures.
   (ii)   “Person.” Includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and
local governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in Ohio R.C.
111.15(A)(2) as any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not
limited to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society,
council, institution, state college or university, community college district,
technical college district, or state community college. "Agency" does not
include the general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general's
department, or any court.
   (jj)   “Recreational vehicle.” A vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but
as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal
use.
   (kk)   “Registered professional architect.” A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture pursuant to Ohio R.C. 4703.01 and 4703.19.
   (ll)   “Registered professional engineer.” A person registered as a
professional engineer pursuant to Ohio R.C. Chapter 4733.
   (mm)   “Registered professional surveyor.” A person registered as a
professional surveyor pursuant to Ohio R.C. Chapter 4733.
   (nn)   “Special flood hazard area.” Also known as “Areas of special flood
hazard”, it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on flood insurance rate maps, flood
insurance studies, flood boundary and floodway maps and flood hazard boundary
maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, A99, or V, VE. Special flood hazard areas
may also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal
state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (oo)   “Start of construction.” The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (pp)   “Structure.” A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas
or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (qq)   “Substantial damage.” Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to the "before damaged" condition
would equal or exceed fifty percent of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred. Substantial damage also means flood related damage
sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a ten-year period for
which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the average,
equals or exceeds twenty-five percent of the market value of the structure
before the damage occurred.
   (rr)   “Substantial improvement.” Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the “start of
construction” of the improvement.
      This term includes structures, which have incurred “substantial damage,”
regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however,
include:
      (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
      (2)   Any alteration of a “historic structure,” provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
“historic structure.”
   (ss)   “Variance.” A grant of relief from the standards of these
regulations.
   (tt)   “Violation.” The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations.
(Ord. 22-19.  Passed 7-15-19.)

      (6)   A floodplain development permit application fee set by the schedule
of fees adopted by the City.
   (e)   Review and Approval of a Floodplain Development Permit Application.
      (1)   Review.
         A.   After receipt of a complete application, the Floodplain
Administrator shall review the application to ensure that the standards of
these regulations have been met. No floodplain development permit application
shall be reviewed until all information required in subsection (d) of this
section has been received by the Floodplain Administrator.
         B.   The Floodplain Administrator shall review all floodplain
development permit applications to assure that all necessary permits have been
received from those federal, state or local governmental agencies from which
prior approval is required. The applicant shall be responsible for obtaining
such permits as required including permits issued by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act and Section 404 of the
Clean Water Act, and the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency under Section 401
of the Clean Water Act.
      (2)   Approval. Within thirty days after the receipt of a complete
application, the Floodplain Administrator shall either approve or disapprove
the application. If the Floodplain Administrator is satisfied that the
development proposed in the floodplain development application conforms to the
requirements of this chapter, the Floodplain Administrator shall issue the
permit. All floodplain development permits shall be conditional upon the
commencement of work within 180 days. A floodplain development permit shall
expire 180 days after issuance unless the permitted activity has been
substantially begun and is thereafter pursued to completion.
   (f)   Inspections. The Floodplain Administrator shall make periodic
inspections at appropriate times throughout the period of construction in order
to monitor compliance with permit conditions.
   (g)   Post-Construction Certifications Required. The following as-built
certifications are required after a floodplain development permit has been
issued:
      (1)   For new or substantially improved residential structures, or
nonresidential structures that have been elevated, the applicant shall have a

supply a completed floodproofing certificate for non-residential structures
completed by a registered professional engineer or architect together with
associated documentation.
   (h)   Revoking a Floodplain Development Permit. A floodplain development
permit shall be revocable, if among other things, the actual development
activity does not conform to the terms of the application and permit granted
thereon. In the event of the revocation of a permit, an appeal may be taken to
the Appeals Board in accordance with Section
1308.05  of these regulations.
   (i)   Exemption from Filing a Development Permit. An application for a
floodplain development permit shall not be required for maintenance work such
as roofing, painting, and basement sealing, or for small nonstructural
development activities (except for filling and grading) valued at less than two
thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500).
   (j)   State and Federal Development.
      (1)   Development that is funded, financed, undertaken, or preempted by
state agencies shall comply with minimum NFIP criteria.
      (2)   Before awarding funding or financing or granting a license, permit,
or other authorization for a development that is or is to be located within a
100-year floodplain, a state agency shall require the applicant to demonstrate
to the satisfaction of the agency that the development will comply with minimum
NFIP criteria and any applicable local floodplain management resolution or
ordinance as required by Ohio R.C. 1521.13. This includes, but is not limited
to:
         A.   Development activities in an existing or proposed manufactured
home park that are under the authority of the Ohio Department of Commerce and
subject to the flood damage reduction provisions of the Ohio Administrative
Code Section 4781-12;
         B.   Major utility facilities permitted by the Ohio Power Siting Board
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4906;
         C.   Hazardous waste disposal facilities permitted by the Hazardous
Waste Siting Board under Ohio R.C. Chapter 3734; and
         D.   Development activities undertaken by a federal agency and which
are subject to Federal Executive Order 11988 - Floodplain Management. Each
federal agency has a responsibility to evaluate the potential effects of any
actions it may take in a floodplain; to ensure that its planning programs and
budget request reflect consideration of flood hazards and floodplain
management; and to prescribe procedures to implement the policies and
requirements of EO 11988.
   (k)   Map Maintenance Activities. To meet National Flood Insurance Program
minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to
ensure that Lakewood's flood maps, studies and other data identified in
subsection (f) of Section 1308.01 accurately represent flooding conditions so
appropriate floodplain management criteria are based on current data, the
following map maintenance activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to submit new technical data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the City shall ensure that technical data reflecting
such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or other new development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with subsection (c) of
Section
1308.04.
         B.   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with this subsection (k)(l), prepared in a format
required for a conditional letter of map revision or letter of map revision,
and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and processing fees for these map revisions
shall be the responsibility of the applicant.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a conditional letter
of map revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in riverine areas where FEMA has provided base flood
elevations but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a letter of map
revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to subsection (k)(l)A
of this section.
      (2)   Right to submit new technical data. The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of Lakewood,
and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation / detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the City
have been modified by annexation or the City has assumed authority over an
area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce floodplain management
regulations for a particular area. In order that the City's flood insurance
rate map accurately represent the City boundaries, include within such
notification a copy of a map of the City suitable for reproduction, clearly
showing the new corporate limits or the new area for which the City has assumed
or relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (l)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation. The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section 1308.05.
      (4)   Where an existing or proposed structure or other development is
affected by multiple flood zones, by multiple base flood elevations, or both,
the development activity must comply with the provisions of this Chapter
applicable to the most restrictive flood zone and the highest base flood
elevation affecting any part of the existing or proposed structure; or for
other developments, affecting any part of the area of the development.
   (m)   Use of Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Map and/or Flood Insurance
Study Data.
      (1)   Zone A.
         A.   Within Zone A areas designated on an effective FIRM, data from
the preliminary FIRM and/or FIS shall reasonably utilized as best available
data.
         B.   When all appeals have been resolved and a notice of final flood
elevation determination has been provided in a letter of final determination
(LFD), BFE and floodway data from the preliminary FIRM and/or FIS shall be used
for regulating development.
      (2)   Zones AE, Al-30, AH, AO, VE, and Vl-30.
         A.   BFE and floodway data from a preliminary FIS or FIRM restudy are
not required to be used in lieu of BFE and floodway data contained in an
existing effective FIS and FIRM. However:
            1.   Where BFEs increase in a restudied area, communities have the
responsibility to ensure that new or substantially improved structures are
protected. Communities are encouraged to reasonably utilize preliminary FIS or
FIRM data in instances where BFEs increase and floodways are revised to ensure
that the health, safety, and property of their citizens are protected.
            2.   Where BFEs decrease, preliminary FIS or FIRM data should not
be used to regulate floodplain development until the LFD has been issued or
until all appeals have been resolved.
         B.   If a preliminary FIRM or FIS has designated floodways where none
had previously existed, communities should reasonably utilize this data in lieu
of applying the encroachment performance standard of subsection (i)(2) of
Section
1308.04 since the data in the draft or preliminary FIS represents the best data
available.
      (3)   Zones B, C, and X. Use of BFE and floodway data from a preliminary
FIRM or FIS are not required for areas designated as Zone B, C, or X on the
effective FIRM which are being revised to Zone AE, A1-30, AH, AO, VE, or VI-30.
Communities are encouraged to reasonably utilize preliminary FIS or FIRM data
to ensure that the health, safety, and property of their citizens are
protected.
   (n)   Substantial Damage Determinations. Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc.
After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Require owners of substantially damaged structures to obtain a
floodplain development permit prior to repair, rehabilitation, or
reconstruction.
         Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain

   (i)   Assurance of Flood Carrying Capacity. Pursuant to the purpose and
methods of reducing flood damage stated in these regulations, the following
additional standards are adopted to assure that the reduction of the flood
carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
      (1)   Development in floodways.
         A.   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
         B.   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
            1.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in subsection
(k)(l) of Section
1308.03;
            2.   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
            3.   Certification that no structures are located in areas that
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
            4.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the City, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
            5.   Concurrence of the Mayor of Lakewood and the Chief Executive
Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed actions.
      (2)   Development in riverine areas with base flood elevations but no
floodways.
         A.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Subsection (i)(l)B1. and (i)(1)B.3. - 5. of this section.
      (3)   Alterations of a watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations,
a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the "bankfull
stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
Lakewood specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is
required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in subsection (k)(l)A.3. of Section
1308.03 when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.
   (j)   Development Standards for Coastal High Hazard Areas and MoWa Areas.
The requirements of this subsection (j) apply to development in coastal high
hazard areas designated zone V or VE on the City's effective FIRM and when
designated on a preliminary or final FIRM issued by FEMA under the
circumstances provided in Section
1308.03 (m). The requirements of this subsection (j) also apply to development
in moderate wave action areas, within zone AE between a limit of moderate wave
action and the landward limit of zone V or VE designated on the City's
effective FIRM, or between a limit of moderate wave action and the offshore
limit of the City's jurisdiction where zone V or VE is not designated on the
City's effective FIRM.
      (1)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be elevated
on pilings or columns that may be armored as necessary to withstand Lake Erie
ice forces so that:
         A.   The bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member supporting
the lowest floor (excluding the pilings or columns) is elevated to or above the
flood protection elevation, and
         B.   The pile or column foundation and structure attached thereto is
anchored to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement due to the effects
of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components.
            1.   Water loading values shall be those associated with the base
flood.
            2.   Wind loading values shall be those defined according to
American Society of Civil Engineers 7-13 Minimum design loads and associated
criteria for buildings and other structures, or current version adopted by Ohio
Board of Building Standards.
            3.   A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop
or review the structural design, specifications and plans for the construction,
and shall certify that the design and methods of construction to be used are in
accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions of
subsection (j)(1)A. and B. of this section.
      (2)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall have the
space below the lowest floor either free of obstruction or constructed with
non-supporting breakaway walls, open wood lattice-work, or insect screening
intended to collapse without causing collapse, displacement, or other
structural damage to the elevated portion of the building or supporting
foundation system.
         A.   For the purpose of this subsection (j)(2), a breakaway wall shall
have a design safe loading resistance of not less than ten and no more than
twenty pounds per square foot.
         B.   Use of breakaway walls which exceed a design safe loading
resistance of twenty pounds per square foot (either by design or where so
required by local or state codes) may be permitted only if a registered
professional engineer or architect certifies that the designs proposed meet all
of the following conditions:
            1.   Breakaway wall collapse shall result from a water load less
than that which would occur during the base flood; and
            2.   The elevated portion of the building and supporting foundation
system shall not be subject to collapse, displacement, or other structural
damage due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all
building components (structural and non-structural). Water loading values shall
be those associated with the base flood. Wind loading values shall be those
defined according to American Society of Civil Engineers 7-16 Minimum design
loads and associated criteria for buildings and other structures, or equivalent
standard.
            3.   All space enclosed by breakaway walls, open wood lattice-work,
or insect screening below the lowest floor shall be used solely for parking of
vehicles, building access, or storage.
      (3)   The use of fill or redistributed existing fill, placed after the
initial identification of Zones V, VE or Vl-30 on the City's FIRM, for
structural support of buildings is prohibited.
      (4)   Alteration of sand dunes that will increase potential flood damage
is prohibited.
      (5)   Placement or substantial improvement of manufactured homes must
comply with subsection (j)(1) through (j)(5) of this section.

1308.05  APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)   Appeals Board Established.
      (1)   The Board of Building Standards and Building Appeals is hereby
appointed to serve as the Appeals Board for these regulations as established by
the Codified Ordinances.
      (2)   Records of the Appeals Board shall be kept and filed in City Hall
at 12650 Detroit Avenue, Lakewood, Ohio.
   (b)   Powers and Duties.
      (1)   The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by
the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of these
regulations.
      (2)   The Appeals Board shall authorize variances in accordance with
subsection (d) of this section.
   (c)   Appeals. Any person affected by any notice and order, or other
official action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be
granted a hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such
person shall file, within thirty days of the date of such notice and order, or
other official action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for
the mitigation of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain
Administrator's decision. Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the
applicant, and be filed with the Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the
appeal, the Floodplain Administrator shall transmit said notice and all
pertinent information on which the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made
to the Appeals Board. Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board
shall fix a reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties
in interest, and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is
submitted.
   (d)   Variances. Any person believing that the use and development standards
of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot or
parcel, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would
result in unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
         C.   All applications for variance shall be accompanied by a variance
application fee set in the schedule of fees adopted by the City.
      (2)   Notice for public hearing. The Appeals Board shall schedule and
hold a public hearing within thirty days after the receipt of an application
for a variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Notice of such hearing shall
be given consistent with Section
107.11 .
      (3)   Public hearing. At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the City;
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area;
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (4)   Factors for variances. Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant;
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws;
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages; and
         E.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. Upon consideration of the above
factors and the purposes of these regulations, the Appeals Board may attach
such conditions to the granting of variances, as it deems necessary to further
the purposes of these regulations.
      (5)   Other conditions for variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in subsection (d)(3)A. through K.
of this section have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond
one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance
increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas
pursuant to Ohio R.C. Chapter 2506.

      (3)   The developer shall not abuse the right of access or use it to
harass the tenant. Entry by the developer in excess of twice in any seven day
period for the purpose of showing the unit to purchasers shall be presumed to

hereinafter provided.  Failure to install carbon monoxide (CO) detectors as and
where required by such date shall subject the property owner to the penalties
set forth in Section
1331.99.
(Ord. 24-97.  Passed 6-16-1997.)
1331.02  LOCATION.
   (a)   In all dwelling units used for rental purposes at least one smoke
detector, and where required in Section
1
331.01(b), at least one carbon monoxide (CO) detector shall be installed in the
immediate vicinity of the sleeping area, as per the manufacturer’s
specifications.  A sleeping area is defined as the area or areas of the family
living unit in which the bedrooms or sleeping rooms are located.  Where
bedrooms or room ordinarily used for sleeping are separated by other use areas,
such as kitchens or living rooms, but not bathrooms or closets, they shall be
considered as separate sleeping areas for the purposes of this section.
   (b)   When bedroom or sleeping areas are not fully enclosed or separated
from other living areas within a living or sleeping unit, the smoke detector
and carbon monoxide (CO) detector shall be installed nearest the area
designated for sleeping, as per the manufacturer’s specifications.  (Ord. 24-
97.  Passed 6-16-1997.)
   (c)   Alarm signaling devices shall be clearly audible in all bedrooms
within the dwelling, apartment and condominium unit, when all intervening doors

1335.01  PERMIT REQUIRED.
   No person shall do any paint removal or exterior surface cleaning of any
structure located in the City by sand blasting, steam or high pressure
cleaning, chemical cleaning, open-flame burning, power sanding or other similar
method without first obtaining a permit therefor from the Building
Commissioner. A separate permit is required for each separate job or location
at which such activity will be done. (Ord. 28-93. Passed 7-19-1993.)
1335.02  PERMIT APPLICATION; DEPOSIT.
   (a)   An applicant for a permit shall first file an application therefor in
writing in the office of the Building Commissioner. The Commissioner shall
prepare and furnish forms for that purpose. Each application shall state:
      (1)   The location of the job;
      (2)   The structure or portion thereof upon which the process is to be
performed;
      (3)   The length of time it is estimated the process will take;
      (4)   The date when such work is to commence; and
      (5)   The type of process to be used.
   (b)   Each application shall be accompanied with a cash bond or deposit to
ensure compliance with this chapter and particularly with Section
1335.06(g), as follows:
      (1)   The contractor shall deposit two hundred dollars ($200.00) with
each permit in the form of cash or a certified check.
      (2)   In lieu of the cash deposit per permit, the contractor may post a
deposit in cash or a certified check (made payable to the City) in the amount
of three thousand dollars ($3,000) as security for compliance for a twelve-
month period.
      (3)   The Building Commissioner may require an additional deposit per
permit issued to a contractor when the Commissioner determines that the amount
of security posted for the twelve-month period is insufficient to cover
potential damage for the total number of permits then issued to the contractor
or as a consequence of forfeiture of the deposit pursuant to this chapter.
   (c)   At the conclusion of the work to be done under each permit, the
contractor shall report the same to the Building Commissioner, who shall review
such work for compliance with this subsection and Section
1335.06(g). If the cleanup work and other work done in order to return the site
to its original condition is not satisfactory, the Building Commissioner may
withhold the deposit posted for that permit and have City personnel, or
contractors retained by the City, properly clean up the site, correct any
health hazard and remove lead paint chips and any other debris left by the
permittee. The cost of such corrective measures will be calculated by the
Building Commissioner, and an itemized invoice will be provided to the
permittee. The amount of such invoice will be deducted from the deposit with
the balance returned to the contractor/permittee. If the contractor has elected
to post the seasonal deposit for security, the amount of such invoice will be
deducted from the current balance of that deposit. If the cost for corrective
measures exceeds the deposit posted for that permit, the contractor shall
immediately pay the balance due to the City. If the contractor has elected the
seasonal deposit provided herein, the amount will be deducted from the current
balance of that deposit unless, in the determination of the Building
Commissioner, such amount would reduce the seasonal balance below a reasonable
level based on the number of permits then issued to the contractor or would
exhaust the amount of the seasonal deposit. In that event, the contractor shall
immediately pay such amount to the Building Commissioner on behalf of the City.
   (d)   Failure to comply with this section regarding payment of amounts due
hereunder shall be cause for immediate revocation of the contractor
registration and any outstanding permit. In addition, the Director of Law shall
be empowered to seek other appropriate remedies, including damages on behalf of
the City.
   (e)   Nothing contained herein shall be construed to in any way limit,
reduce, mitigate or otherwise diminish the liability of the contractor/
permittee to any person, property owner, citizen or other affected individual
for damages arising from any cause as a consequence of the contractor/
permittee's actions, or work performed, even if a proper permit has been issued
under this chapter and the contractor has complied with all provisions hereof.
(Ord. 10-89. Passed 4-3-1989.)
1335.03  PERMIT FEE.
   At the time of filing an application, a permit fee shall be paid to the
Building Department in the amount of fifteen dollars ($15.00).  (Ord. 10-89.
Passed 4-3-1989.)
1335.04  REGISTRATION OF CONTRACTORS.
   Prior to the issuance of a permit, a contractor/applicant shall be
registered as a contractor with the City pursuant to Chapter
1323 of these Codified Ordinances, and shall have all requisite insurance in
place pursuant thereto. Chapter
1323 shall remain unchanged by this section.
(Ord. 10-89. Passed 4-3-1989.)
1335.05  NOTICE TO ADJACENT OWNERS OR OCCUPANTS.
   Before the applicant commences any such work, notice, by residence service,
shall be given by the applicant at least seven days in advance, in writing, in
form satisfactory to the Department of Law, to all owners and occupants of
buildings or other structures immediately adjacent to the structure on which
the proposed work is to be done. The applicant shall submit evidence to the
Building Commissioner, in satisfactory form, that such notice has been given.
(Ord. 10-89. Passed 4-3-1989.)
1335.06  RESTRICTIONS.
   (a)   If high pressure boilers are used for cleaning or other purposes, they
shall conform to the Ohio Revised Code and shall be operated in a safe and
approved manner.
   (b)   All such operations shall be shielded by tarpaulins or other screening
so as to prevent vapor, water, dust and debris from causing a nuisance by
falling on pedestrians, vehicles, public thoroughfares and adjoining property.
   (c)   No such operations shall be conducted during rains or snowfalls, when
wind speeds exceed fifteen miles per hour or during other conditions determined
as being unsafe for such process by the Division of Public Health.
   (d)   Ground tarping shall be used to at least thirty feet from the work
surface being stripped or cleaned or to a property line of less than thirty
feet and on adjacent sides, to collect as much of the residue as possible to
prevent it from falling upon the ground.
   (e)   All vents, windows and other areas through which air might enter the
premises upon which the work is being conducted shall be covered to prevent
infiltration.
   (f)   No such activity shall be permitted under any permit issued in
accordance with this chapter which violates Chapter
515 of the General Offenses Code.
   (g)   No paint removal process that presents a risk of generating dust
particles containing lead, nor any gasoline or propane-fired torch, shall be
used to remove any lead-based paint on any exterior surface except in
compliance with the procedures set forth herein. Where any such process is
proposed to be employed, the applicant shall provide the Building Commissioner
and the Director of Human Services, in a form acceptable to them, with test
results indicating the lead content of the paint to be removed, the cost of
such required testing to be borne by the applicant. If the lead content equals
or exceeds one mg/cm2 (the current Federally recognized maximum acceptable lead
concentration), no permit shall be issued. As a condition of any permit being
issued, the property owner shall authorize an agent of the City onto the
premises at any time between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m., Monday to
Friday, to conduct unannounced testing of the paint to be removed, the
particles generated by the process and the surfaces affected. If the City's
test with an X-ray fluorescence analyzer (XFR), or other method approved by the
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), indicates a lead
content equal to or exceeding one mg/cm2, the paint removal shall be
immediately halted and the permit revoked.
   (h)   After completion of the work to be performed under the permit, or
after revocation of such permit, the permittee shall be required to thoroughly
clean up all residue from the permit premises, adjacent property and public
rights of way or thoroughfares. In addition, the permittee shall ensure that no
paint removal and/or clean-up is performed in such a manner as to cause or
create a public nuisance and shall further ensure that the clean-up of the work
area is in such a manner as not to cause or create a public nuisance. The
permittee shall be required to notify the Building Commissioner of the
completion of work and shall respond immediately to any finding of deficiency
by the Building Commissioner with regard thereto.
(Ord. 28-93. Passed 7-19-1993.)
1335.07  STREET OBSTRUCTIONS.
   If obstructions are to be placed in City streets or public places, all

their entirety.
(Ord. 10-89. Passed 4-3-1989.)
1335.08  PERMIT REVOCATION.
   Noncompliance with any of the provisions of this chapter shall be cause for
immediate revocation of any permit issued for any work hereunder. The Building
Commissioner may revoke such permit and order the stopping of such work without
previous notice. No person shall do any work covered under this section after a
permit therefor has been revoked.
(Ord. 10-89. Passed 4-3-1989.)
1335.09  COMPLAINTS BY AFFECTED PERSONS OR ADJACENT PROPERTY OWNERS.

contractor shall agree, by acceptance of the permit and in form thereon, to
respond to all inquiries from the Building Department, the Division of Public
Health and the Law Department and to appear for discussions, hearings or
mediations concerning the dispute as required by the Department of Law. In the
event of a failure to comply, the contractor's registration to perform such
services in the City shall be revoked on order by the Director of Law. (Ord.
10-89. Passed 4-3-1989.)
1335.10  APPEAL TO BUILDING STANDARDS AND APPEALS BOARD.
   Any property owner or contractor who contents a decision by any officer of
the City, including, but not limited to, the Health Commissioner, the Building
Commissioner or the Director of Law, may appeal such decision or determination
to the Building Standards and Appeals Board pursuant to these Codified
Ordinances and in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Board. 
(Ord. 10-89. Passed 4-3-1989.)
1335.11  INTERPRETATION OF CHAPTER.
   (a)   Nothing contained in this chapter shall be deemed to exempt the
applicant or permittee from the provisions of any other section of these
Codified Ordinances, or from the payment of any other fee or from the necessity
of obtaining any other permit required under these Codified Ordinances.

1339.01  PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   (a)   The intent of this chapter is to establish technically feasible and
economically reasonable standards to achieve a level of storm water management,
and erosion and sediment control that will minimize damage to public and
private property and degradation of water resources, and will promote and
maintain the health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the City of
Lakewood. The standards, or best management practices (BMPs ), referred to and
required by this chapter shall be in accordance with the current version of the
Ohio Rainwater and Land Development Manual promulgated by the Ohio Department
of Natural Resources.

City that disturb an area greater than 8,000 square feet regardless of public
sewer configuration in the project area, unless specifically exempted in
Section
1339.01.
   (c)   This chapter does not require a storm water management plan for
routine public maintenance projects, such as sewer or watermain replacement or
street reconstruction, which does not result in the installation of additional
impervious surface and does not disturb more than five acres, as determined by
the City Engineer.
   (d)   This chapter requires owners who develop or redevelop their property
within the City to:
      (1)   Control the volume, rate and quality of storm water runoff from
their property to minimize the potential for downstream flooding, erosion, and
sedimentation;
      (2)   Reduce damage to receiving water resources and drainage systems
that are caused by new development or redevelopment activities;
      (3)   Preserve to the maximum extent practicable the natural drainage
characteristics of the building site and minimize the need to construct,
repair, and replace enclosed storm drain systems;
      (4)   Preserve to the maximum extent practicable natural infiltration and
groundwater recharge, and maintain subsurface flow that replenishes water
resources, wetlands, and wells;
      (5)   Assure that storm water controls are incorporated into site
planning and design at the earliest possible stage;
      (6)   Prevent unnecessary stripping of vegetation and loss of soil,
especially adjacent to water resources and wetlands;
      (7)   Reduce the need for costly maintenance and repairs to roads,
embankments, sewage systems, ditches, water resources, wetlands, and storm
water management practices that are the result of inadequate control of soil
erosion, sediment and storm water;
      (8)   Reduce the long-term expense of remedial projects needed to address
problems caused by inadequate control of storm water, erosion and sediment;
      (9)   Maximize the use of storm water management practices that serve
multiple purposes including, but not limited to, flood control, soil erosion
and sediment control, and water quality protection; and encourage such
practices that promote recreation and habitat preservation;
      (10)   Ensure that all storm water management, soil erosion and sediment
control practices are properly designed, constructed, and maintained;
      (11)   Protect and maintain the receiving stream's physical, chemical,
biological characteristics and stream functions;
      (12)   Incorporate water quality protection practices that encourage and
promote habitat preservation; and
      (13)   Provide perpetual management of storm water runoff quality and
quantity.

         C.    Control storm water runoff resulting from soil disturbing
activities.
         D.    Assure that development site owners control the volume and rate
of storm water runoff originating from their property so that surface water and
ground water are protected, soil erosion is controlled, and flooding potential
is not increased.
         E.    Preserve to the maximum extent practicable the natural drainage
characteristics of the building site and minimize the need to construct,
repair, and replace enclosed storm drain systems.
         F.    Preserve to the maximum extent practicable natural infiltration
and groundwater recharge, and maintain subsurface flow that replenishes water
resources, wetlands, and wells.
         G.    Assure that storm water controls are incorporated into site
planning and design at the earliest possible stage.
         H.    Prevent unnecessary stripping of vegetation and loss of soil,
especially adjacent to water resources and wetlands. 
         I.   Reduce the need for costly maintenance and repairs to roads,
embankments, sewage systems, ditches, water resources, wetlands, and storm
water management practices that are the result of inadequate soil erosion,
sediment and storm water control.
         J.    Reduce the long-term expense of remedial projects needed to
address problems caused by inadequate storm water, erosion and sediment
control.
         K.    Require the construction of storm water management practices
that serve multiple purposes including flood control, soil erosion and sediment
control, and require water quality protection; and encourage such practices
that promote recreation and habitat preservation.
         L.    Ensure that all storm water management, soil erosion and
sediment control practices are properly designed, constructed, and maintained.

1339.10  CONSTRUCTION MINIMUM STANDARDS.
   In order to control sediment pollution of water resources, the owner or
person responsible for the development area shall use conservation planning and
practices to maintain the level of conservation established in the following
standards. The permittee must adhere to all requirements of the EPA
construction general permit. In addition, the following items are general
guidelines and shall not limit the right of the City Engineer to impose at any
time additional, more stringent requirements, nor shall the guidelines limit
the right of the City Engineer to waive, in writing, individual requirements.
   (a)   The plan shall include measures that control the flow of runoff from
disturbed areas so as to prevent soil erosion from occurring.
   (b)   Structural practices shall be used to control erosion and trap
sediment from areas remaining disturbed for more than 21 days.
   (c)   Sediment Barriers:  Sheet flow runoff from denuded areas shall be
intercepted by silt fence or diversions to protect adjacent properties and
water resources from sediment. Where intended to provide sediment control, silt
fence shall be placed on a level contour. The relationship between the maximum
drainage areas to silt fence for a particular slope is shown in the table
below:
Table 1: Silt Fence Applicability
 
Maximum drainage area (in acres) to 100 Range of slope for a particular
linear feet of Silt Fence               drainage area (in percent)
0.5                                     <2%
0.25                                    > 2% but < 20%
0.125                                   > 20% but < 50%
 
This does not preclude the use of other sediment barriers designed to control
sheet flow runoff. The total runoff flow treated by a sediment barrier shall
not exceed the design capacity for that sediment barrier. Straw bale barriers
are not acceptable.
   (d)   Storm Water Diversion Practices:  Storm water diversion practices
shall be used to keep runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes where
practicable. Such practices, which include swales, dikes or berms, pipe slope
drains and diversions, may receive storm water runoff from areas up to 10
acres. Storm water diversion practices alone are not considered a sediment
control practice unless those are used in conjunction with a sediment settling
pond.
   (e)   All sediment control practices must be capable of pending runoff in
order to be considered functional.
   (f)   Clearing and grubbing will be done in two or more phases. The first
phase will include only those locations necessary to install the perimeter soil
erosion, sediment and storm water control BMPs. After the perimeter controls
are in place and functioning, the remaining phase(s) of clearing and grubbing
may continue.
   (g)   Timing of Sediment Trapping Practices: Sediment control practices
shall be functional throughout all phases of up slope earth disturbing
activity. Settling facilities, perimeter controls and other practices intended
to trap sediment shall be implemented prior to grading and within seven days
from the start of grubbing. They shall continue to function until the up slope
development area is permanently re- stabilized. As construction progresses and
the topography is altered, appropriate controls must be constructed or existing
controls altered to address the changing drainage patterns.
   (h)   Stabilization of Denuded Areas: Disturbed areas must be stabilized as
specified in the tables below, or according to the Ohio EPA NPDES storm water
permit rules, whichever is most restrictive:
Table 2: Permanent Stabilization
 
Area requiring permanent stabilization  Time frame to apply erosion controls
Any areas that will lie dormant for one Within seven days of the most recent

   (i)   Where vegetative stabilization techniques may cause structural
instability or are otherwise unobtainable, alternative stabilization techniques
must be employed. In any case, temporary or permanent stabilization will be
properly installed, pursuant to the most recent edition of the Ohio Rainwater
and Land Development manual, before the second building permit is issued.
   (j)   Sediment Settling Ponds: A sediment settling pond is required for any
one of the following conditions:
      (1)   Concentrated storm water runoff (e.g., storm sewer or ditch);
      (2)   Runoff from drainage areas, which exceed the design capacity of
silt fence or other sediment barriers;
      (3)   Runoff from drainage areas that exceed the design capacity of inlet
protection; or
      (4)   Runoff from common drainage locations with 10 or more acres of
disturbed land.
      (5)   Alternative controls can be used if the owner can show, in writing,
that the Ohio EPA approved the use of alternatives that the owner demonstrated
to be equivalent in effectiveness to a sediment settling pond.
   (k)   Sediment Settling Ponds shall be dewatered at the pond surface using a
skimmer (or City- approved equivalent device). The sediment settling pond
volume consists of both a dewatering zone and a sediment storage zone.
      (1)   Where storm sewer drainage areas include 10 or more acres
disturbed  at one time, a temporary (or permanent) sediment settling pond must
be provided until final stabilization of the site. In single- family
residential construction, final stabilization is after the houses are built and
permanent landscaping is done.
         A.    Alternative equivalent controls may be used if the owner can
show, in writing, that the Ohio EPA approved the use of the alternatives in the
SWP3 for the site, subject to the approval of the city engineer.
         B.    It is recommended that for drainage locations of less than 10
acres, smaller sediment settling basins or sediment traps be used.
      (2)   Each facility's storage capacity shall be no less than 1,800 cubic
feet of dewatering zone area per acre of total contributing drainage area and
1,000 cubic feet per disturbed acre of sediment storage zone area. The storage
volume will be measured from the bottom of the basin to the top of the primary
(principal) spillway.
      (3)   Permanent storm water management ponds that are designed to trap
sediment during construction shall be designed to provide for a slow release of
sediment-laden water. The draw down time shall be at least 48 hours, or meet
the criteria in the Ohio Rainwater and Land Development manual, whichever is
more stringent.
      (4)   The design configuration between inlet(s) and the outlet of
settling ponds must provide at least two units of length for each one unit of
width (> 2: 1 length -to -width ratio); a length to width ratio of 4: 1 is
recommended.
      (5)   The depth of the dewatering zone of the sediment settling pond must
be less than or equal to five feet.
      (6)   Sediment must be removed from the sediment settling ponds when the
design capacity has been reduced by 40 percent.
      (7)   Public safety, especially as it relates to children, must be
considered in the design. Alternative sediment controls must be used where site
limitations would preclude a safe design.
      (8)   Temporary sediment settling ponds will not be constructed in any
stream channel.
   (l)   Storm Sewer Inlet Protection:
      (1)   All stone sewer inlets that accept water runoff from the
development area shall be protected so that sediment -laden water will not
enter the stone sewer, unless the storm drain system drains to a sediment
settling pond and is exempted in writing by the City Engineer. In areas where
construction will be ongoing, such as subdivisions, the storm sewer protection
shall be maintained until all up slope areas reach final stabilization, as
determined by the City Engineer.
      (2)   All inlets receiving runoff from drainage areas of one or more
acres will require a sediment settling pond.
      (3)   At the end of this period the site owner shall hydraulically clean
the storm sewers to the satisfaction of the city engineer. All sediments shall
be removed from the system and shall not be flushed downstream.
   (m)   Storm Sewer and Other Drainage Outlets: All storm sewers, footer
drains, roof gutter drains and all other drains will be outletted at the bottom
of the slope. The slope below the outlet will be able to control the water
being drained through the storm sewer or other drains without causing erosion
of the stream or channel banks or channel bottom or other areas that the water
is outletted on.
   (n)   Working Near, Or Crossing Streams and Wetlands:
      (1)   Construction vehicles shall avoid water resources, wetlands,
riparian areas, and their setbacks. If construction vehicles must cross these
areas during construction, an approved temporary crossing shall be constructed.
Streams, including intermittent streams with a defined bed and banks, shall be
restabilized immediately after in-channel work is completed, interrupted, or
stopped. Erodible materials will not be used in making stream crossings.
      (2)   No soil, rock, debris, or any other material shall be dumped or
placed into a water resource or into such proximity that it may slough, slip,
or erode into a water resource unless such dumping or placing is authorized by
the approving authority and, when applicable, the U.S. Army Corps Of Engineers
and Ohio EPA, for such purposes as, but not limited to, constructing bridges,
culverts, and erosion or sediment control structures.
      (3)   If construction activities disturb areas adjacent to streams,
structural practices shall be designed and implemented on site to protect the
adjacent streams from the impacts of sediment runoff.
      (4)   No temporary or permanent sediment controls will be constructed in
a stream channel.
      (5)   Streams and wetland setbacks required by the City will be
implemented. As a minimum setback of 25 feet, as measured from the ordinary
high water mark of the surface water, will be maintained in its natural state
as a permanent buffer.
   (o)   Construction Entrance:
      (1)   Measures shall be taken to prevent soil transport onto public
roads, or surfaces where runoff is not checked by sediment controls.
      (2)   Stone with geotextile construction entrance(s) shall be implemented
as required by the City Engineer and the Ohio EPA. These will be planned and
installed according to the requirements in the most recent edition of the Ohio
Rainwater and Land Development manual.
      (3)   Where soil is transported onto a public road surface, the roads
shall be cleaned thoroughly at the end of each day, or more frequently, in
order to ensure public safety. Soil shall be removed from paved surfaces by
shoveling or sweeping. Street washing shall be allowed only after shoveling or
sweeping has removed most of the sediment and street sewer inlet protection is
properly installed unless end of sewer sediment ponds exist and are properly
functioning.
      (4)   Erodible material ramps in streets will not be used to enable
equipment to cross curbs. Non-eroosive materials ( e. g., wood and stone) can
be used.
   (p)   Unstable Soils:
      (1)   Unstable soils will be as determined by the local county Soil
Survey or by a detailed soils report. The city engineer may require detailed
soil reports when deemed necessary.
      (2)   Unstable soils prone to slipping or land sliding shall not be
graded, excavated, filled or have loads imposed upon them unless the work is
performed in accordance with a qualified professional engineer's
recommendations to correct, eliminate, or adequately address the problems.
   (q)   Cut And Fill Slopes: Cut and fill slopes shall be designed and
constructed in a manner that will minimize erosion and slippage. Consideration
shall be given to the length and steepness of the slope, soil type, up slope
drainage area, groundwater conditions and slope stabilization. The minimum
final unreinforced soil slopes will have a horizontal to vertical ratio of 2:1
(the horizontal will be two times the vertical).
   (r)   Stabilization of Outfalls and Channels: Outfalls and constructed or
modified channels shall be designed and constructed to withstand the expected
velocity of flow from the planned post-development frequency storm without
eroding. The planned post-construction velocity and flow shall include the
entire contributing watershed. Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed at
discharge locations and along the length of any outfall channel to provide non-
erosive velocity from the structure to a water course so that the natural
physical and biological characteristics and functions are maintained and
protected.
   (s)   Establishment of Permanent Vegetation: A permanent vegetative cover
shall be established on denuded areas not otherwise permanently stabilized.
Permanent vegetation shall not be considered established until ground cover is
achieved which, in the opinion of the City Engineer, has 80 percent vegetative
density over the entire disturbed area and provides adequate cover, and is
mature enough to satisfactorily control soil erosion and survive adverse
weather conditions.
   (t)   Disposition of Temporary Practices: All temporary soil erosion and
sediment control practices shall be disposed of immediately after final site
stabilization is achieved or after the temporary practices are no longer
needed, unless otherwise required by the City Engineer. Trapped sediment shall
be permanently stabilized to prevent further erosion. The construction
maintenance guarantee shall not be released by the City until all temporary
soil erosion and sediment control practices that are no longer needed have been
removed, properly disposed of and any trapped sediment has been stabilized.
   (u)   Underground Utility Construction: The construction of underground
utility lines or pipes shall be subject to the following criteria:
      (1)   Trenches shall remain open for no more than five days, unless
approved by the City Engineer.
      (2)   There shall be no turbid discharges to surface waters resulting
from dewatering activities. If trench or ground water contains sediment, it
must pass through a sediment settling pond or other equally effective sediment
control device, prior to being discharged from the construction site or to
waters of the State.
      (3)   When discharging clean ground water care must be taken to ensure
that it does not become pollutant laden by crossing over disturbed soils or
other pollutant sources.
   (v)   Inspections.  In general, inspections will be performed in accordance
with the Ohio EPA construction site inspection checklist.
      (1)   If inspections or other information indicates a control has been
used inappropriately or incorrectly or it has failed, it must be replaced or
modified for the site conditions.
      (2)   The owner of the development area shall have the site inspected for
soil erosion, sediment control and other environmental concerns every seven
calendar days, and within 24 hours of a  0.5- inch -or- greater rainfall event
until the City Engineer certifies the site as being stable. The City Engineer
certification does not relieve the permittee from meeting the Ohio EPA NPDES
inspection requirements.
      (3)   The owner, or his designated representative, shall keep a written
log of each inspection and any subsequent improvements to the soil erosion,
sediment control or other environmental controls. The inspections shall include
the date of the inspection, the name of the inspector, weather conditions, and
the actions needed to correct the identified problems.
      (4)   The inspection frequency may be reduced to at least once every
month if the entire site is temporarily stabilized or runoff is unlikely due to
weather conditions (e.g., the site is covered with snow, ice, or the ground is
frozen.) A waiver of inspection requirements is available until one month
before thawing conditions are expected to result in a discharge if all of the
following conditions are met: the project is located in an area where frozen
conditions are anticipated to continue for extended periods of time (i. e.,
more than one month); land disturbance activities have been suspended; and the
beginning and ending dates of the waiver period are documented. Once a
definable area has been fully stabilized, you may mark this on your plans and
no further inspection requirements apply to that portion of the site.
      (5)   Following each inspection, a checklist must be completed and signed
by the qualified inspection personnel representative. At a minimum, the
inspection report must include the inspection date; names, titles and
qualifications of personnel making the inspection; weather information for the
period since the last inspection including the timing, duration and depth of
any storms; weather information and a description of any discharges occurring
at the time of the inspection; location(s) of discharges of sediment or other
pollutants from the site; location(s) of BMPs that need to be maintained;
location(s) of BMPs that failed to operate as designed or proved inadequate for
a particular location; location (s) where additional BMPs are needed that did
not exist at the time of the inspection; and corrective action required
including any necessary changes to the comprehensive storm water management
plan and implementation dates.
      (6)   The inspection log will include the date and actions taken to
correct problems noted in past inspection logs.
      (7)   If the construction site disturbed area is 8,000 square feet or
larger,  a copy of all of the required inspection sheets will be submitted to
the City Engineer within three working days of the date that the inspection was
conducted. A log book of the inspections shall remain onsite until the notice
of termination is accepted by the Ohio EPA.
      (8)   Disturbed areas and areas used for storage of materials that are
exposed to precipitation shall be inspected for evidence of, or the potential
for, pollutants entering the drainage system.
      (9)   Erosion and sediment controls identified in the Storm Water
Pollution Prevention Plan shall be observed to ensure that they are operating
correctly.
      (10)   Discharge locations shall be inspected to ascertain whether
erosion and sediment control measures are effective in preventing significant
impacts to the receiving waters.
      (11)   Locations where vehicles enter or exit the site shall be inspected
for evidence of off -site vehicle tracking.
      (12)   Sensitive areas including riparian and wetland setbacks shall be
observed to ensure that they remain well marked and undisturbed.
      (13)   If the inspection reveals that a control practice is in need of
repair or maintenance, with the exception of sediment settling ponds, it must
be repaired or maintained within three days of the inspection. Sediment
settling ponds must be repaired or maintained within 10 days of the inspection.
      (14)   If any inspection reveals that a control practice fails to perform
its intended function and that another, more appropriate control practice is
required, the Construction Site Conservation Plan must be amended and the new
control practice must be installed within 10 days of the inspection.
      (15)   If the inspection reveals that a control practice has not been
implemented in the time required by this chapter it must be installed within 10
days from the date of inspection.
      (16)   If the inspection reveals that a planned control practice is not
needed, the record must contain a statement of explanation as to why the
control practice is not needed.
   (w)   Control of Materials and Debris: Site management practices shall be
implemented to prevent toxic materials, hazardous materials, or other debris
from entering the City's and state's water resources or wetlands. These
practices shall include, but are not limited to, the following:
      (1)   A covered dumpster shall be made available for the proper disposal
of construction site waste materials, garbage, plaster, drywall, grout, and
gypsum. A second covered dumpster will be provided for the proper disposal of
toxic and hazardous wastes.
      (2)   The washing of excess concrete material into a street, catch basin,
or other public facility or natural resource shall not occur. A designated area
for concrete washouts shall be made available and used for all concrete
washouts.
      (3)   All fuel tanks and drums shall be stored in a marked storage area.
A dike shall be constructed around this storage area with a minimum capacity
equal to 110 percent of the volume of the largest container in the storage
area. All additional requirements of the local fine authority must be followed.
If the fuel tanks have a self contained " dike," the plug will be kept in the "
dike" tank at all times.
      (4)   Any toxic or hazardous wastes and contaminated soils must be
disposed of according to all applicable environmental laws and statutes. Local
health districts and Ohio EPA can provide guidance on these issues.
      (5)   On a site with a prior industrial land use or a site that is
contaminated with gasoline, fuel oil, hydrocarbon based chemicals or other Ohio
EPA regulated contaminates, the storm water is considered wastewater. A permit
from Ohio EPA is required to address these sites.
      (6)   Proper permits shall be obtained for development projects on solid
waste landfill sites.
      (7)   Paint, paint washing liquids, excess paints and other paint wastes
are considered solid wastes and shall be disposed of in accordance with
applicable state regulations. Appropriate handling of these wastes shall occur
at the site so as to prevent the discharge of these wastes into surface or
ground waters.
      (8)   Restroom facilities will be provided for site workers at all times
that workers are present on the site and during all phases of the construction.
      (9)   All required permits from appropriate federal, state, or local
agencies are required to develop land with a previous industrial or commercial
use or another use that may have led to soil contamination by a regulated
pollutant.
   (x)   Pre-winter Stabilization: If the development area will, or is planned
to remain, active through the winter months, the owner of the development area
shall hold a pre -w inter stabilization meeting. The meeting will be held
before October 1. The owner shall invite the operator, developer, engineer,
contractor, City Engineer and anyone else requested by the City Engineer to the
meeting.
   (y)   Storm Water Basins:
      (1)   Pool Geometry: The minimum length -to -width ratio for the pond is
3:1 the (length will be three times the width).
      (2)   Riser in Embankment: The riser shall be located within the
embankment for purposes of maintenance access. Access to the riser will be by
manholes.
      (3)   Water Drains: Each retention basin shall have a drainpipe that can
completely drain the pond. The drain shall have an elbow within the pond to
prevent sediment deposition from plugging the drain.
      (4)   Adjustable Gate Valves: Both the storm water management and water
quality basin drains shall have adjustable gate valves. Valves shall be located
inside the riser at a point where they will remain dry and can be operated in a
safe and convenient manner. During the annual inspections the valves shall be
fully opened and closed at least once, and the certifying official shall attest
to this on the inspection form. To prevent vandalism, the handwheel shall be
chained to a ringbolt or manhole step.
      (5)   Principal Spillway: Each principal spillway shall be designed in
accordance with the NRCS standards and specifications for the office serving
the county. Each principal spillway shall have the capacity to pass the 100 -
year design storm flow. The inlet or riser size for the pipe drops shall be
designed so that the flow through the structure goes from weir flow control to
pipe flow control without going into orifice control in the riser. The crest
elevation of the primary spillway shall be no less than one foot below the
emergency spillway crest. Premium joint pipe is required and a removable trash
rack shall be installed at each location. Anti-seep collars shall be provided
for all pipe conduits through an embankment.
      (6)   Emergency Spillway: An emergency spillway shall be provided on each
storm water management basin. Emergency spillways shall convey flood flows
safely past the embankment, and shall be designed in accordance with NRCS
standards and specifications for the office serving the local county. Emergency
spillways shall have a 100 -year design storm capacity unless exempted in
writing by the city engineer.
      (7)   Embankments: Each dam embankment shall be designed in accordance
with the NRCS standards and specifications for the office serving the county
that the project is located in. Anti -seep collars shall be provided for all
pipe conduits through an embankment.
      (8)   Safety Features:
         A.   The primary spillway opening shall not permit access to the
public and other non-maintenance personnel.
         B.   The perimeter of all water pool areas that are deeper than three
feet shall be surrounded by benches that meet the following:
            1.   A safety bench, with a maximum slope of 3 percent, which
extends outward, on dry land, from the shoreline. This bench will be a minimum
of 25 feet wide to provide for the safety of individuals and maintenance
vehicles that are adjacent to the water pool. The safety bench may be
landscaped, without the use of structures, to prevent access to the water pool.
            2.   Side slopes between the safety bench and the aquatic bench
shall not be steeper than 3:1 (three feet horizontal for every one foot
vertical).
            3.   An aquatic bench that extends inward from the shoreline far
enough to ensure public safety and has a maximum depth of 15 inches below the
normal water surface elevations. The aquatic bench may be landscaped to prevent
access to the deeper water pool.
            4.   Side slopes beyond the aquatic bench and below the permanent
water level shall not be steeper than 2: 1 (two feet horizontal for every one
foot vertical).
            5.   The contours of the pond will be designed and managed to
eliminate drop-offs and other hazards.
            6.   Side slopes getting to the pond shall not exceed 3:1 and shall
terminate on a safety bench.
            7.   Soil erosion and sediment control practices used to satisfy
these standards shall meet the standards and specifications in the current
edition of the Ohio Rainwater and Land Development manual, NRCS field office
technical guide for the local county or Ohio EPA guidance, whichever is most
stringent.
         C.    These standards are general guidelines and shall not limit the
right of the City Engineer to impose at any time additional, more stringent
requirements, nor shall the standards limit the right of the City Engineer to
waive, in writing, individual requirements.
         D.    Soil limitations shall be determined by using the current
edition of the county soil survey written by the NRCS, USDA.
         E.    Methods for controlling increases in storm water runoff peaks
and volumes may include, but are not limited to: 
            1.   Retarding flow velocities by increasing friction; for example,
grassed road ditches rather than paved street gutters where practical,
discharging roof water to vegetated areas, or grass and rock -lined drainage
channels.
            2.   Grading and use of grade control structures to provide a 
level of control in flow paths and stream gradients.
            3.   Induced infiltration of increased storm water runoff into the
soil, where practical; for example, constructing special infiltration areas
where soils are suitable, retaining topsoil for all areas to be vegetated, or
providing good infiltration areas with proper emergency overflow facilities.
            4.   Provisions for detention and retention, for example, permanent
retention ponds and lakes, dry detention basins, and subsurface detention
tanks.
   (z)   Minimum Storm Water Management Design Criteria:
      (1)   The permittee must adhere to all requirements of the current EPA
construction general permit " post- construction storm water management'
section. Specific items of the construction general permit that the permittee
should be aware of and adhere to include the water quality volume calculation,
runoff coefficients based on the type of land use, and target drain times for
structural post - construction BMPs.
      (2)   In addition, the permittee must also adhere to the following items:
         A.   Storm Water Detention. The post-construction BMP(s) chosen must
be able to detain storm water runoff for protection of the stream channels,
stream erosion control, and improved water quality.
         B.    Properly Sized BMPs. The BMP(s) chosen must be sized to treat
the water quality volume (WQv) and ensure compliance with Ohio's water quality
standards in Chapter 3745-1 of the Ohio Administrative Code. The WQv shall be
equivalent to the volume of runoff from a 0.75 -inch rainfall.
         C.    Runoff Rate: The peak runoff rate from the development area
shall not be greater after development than it was before development. The
applicant shall provide calculations proving no increase in the runoff rates
from the one -, two -, five -, 10 -, 25 -, 50- and 100-year storms.
         D.    Runoff Volume:  Increases in the runoff volume shall be offset
by further restricting runoff rates.
      (3)   Based on the increase in runoff volume, the applicant shall
determine the critical storm for the development area.  The runoff rate from
the critical storm shall be restricted to the one -year pre-development storm
runoff rate. The critical storm shall be calculated as follows:
         A.    Determine the total volume of runoff from a one -year frequency,
24 -hour storm, occurring on the development area before and after development.
         B.    From the volumes in subsection (z)( 3) A determine the percent
of increase in volume of runoff due to development according to the equation (Q
after divided by the Q before) X 100 and, using this percentage, select the
critical storm from this table:
Table 4: Critical Storm Selection
 
The Percentage Increase in Volume of Runoff is:
Equal to or Greater Than And Less Than The 24-Hour “critical
                                       storm” for Discharge will be
0                        10            1 Year

500                      ---           100 Years
 
      (4)   Detention Or Retention Basin Exemption For Redevelopment Or For
Expansion Of Existing Facilities:
         A.    For any development regulated by this regulation, the
construction of a detention or retention basin may not be required for the
development if the post-development peak discharge for a 100 -year frequency
24-hour storm increases the existing peak discharge by one cubic foot per
second or less using the TR-55 method of calculation or other method approved
by the City Engineer. The City Engineer can waive this requirement if existing
storm sewers and drainage structures can safely handle the expected increase in
flow.
         B.    Only one exemption will be allowed per parcel. Any subsequent
expansion must provide for detention or retention and must include the
previously exempted area.
      (5)   Where the City Engineer determines that site constraints exist in a
manner that compromises the intent of this regulation to improve the management
of storm water runoff as established in this section, practical alternatives
may be used to result in an improvement of water quality and a reduction of
storm water runoff. Such alternatives must be in keeping with the intent and
likely cost of those measures that would otherwise be required to meet the
objectives of this section. When possible, all practical alternatives shall be
implemented within the drainage area of the proposed development project.
Practical alternatives can include, but are not limited to:
         A.    Fees shall be paid in an amount specified by the City Engineer.
These fees shall be applied by the City to storm water management  practices
that reduce existing storm water runoff.
         B.    Implementation of off-site storm water management practices.
         C.    Watershed or stream restoration.
         D.    Retrofitting of an existing storm water management practice.
         E.    Other practices approved by the City Engineer in keeping with
the intent of this section.
   (aa)   Application Procedures for Construction Conservation Plans (CCP):
      (1)   This plan will be combined with the post-construction water
quality, riparian setback and wetland setback plans that have also been
developed for the site.
      (2)   Plans developed by the site owners and approved by the City in
accordance with this regulation do not relieve the site owner of responsibility
for obtaining and complying with all other necessary permits and approvals from
federal, state, county, and local agencies and departments. If requirements
vary, the most stringent requirement shall be followed. Plans submitted to the
City Engineer for review and approval shall be accompanied by all other
required permits and documentation relevant to the project, including but not
limited to the permits required and issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,
Ohio EPA and ODNR Division of Water.
      (3)   The application must include a letter or report from the local
county SWCD that states that the construction site conservation plan, the
riparian and wetland setback plan and the post-construction water quality plan
have been reviewed for consistency with Ohio EPA and local regulations.
      (4)   Five sets of the plans and necessary data required by this
regulation shall be submitted to the City Engineer with text material being
submitted on 8.5 by 11 inch paper and drawings on no larger than 24 by 36 inch
sized paper. Submittals shall include:
         A.   At the preliminary plan approval request, the preliminary plans
only need to show all of the following existing and planned features: streams,
water bodies, wetlands, riparian and wetland setback areas, permanent BMPs and
storm water management detention and retention basins.
         B.    At the improvement plan approval request, the entire
comprehensive storm water management plan must be submitted.
      (5)   The City Engineer shall review the plans, including the review
report from the local county SWCD, and shall approve or return these with
comments and recommendations for revisions within 30 working days after receipt
of the plan as described above. A plan rejected because of deficiencies shall
receive a report stating specific problems. At the time of receipt of a revised
plan, another 30 -day review period shall begin.
      (6)   Approved plans shall remain valid for two years from the date of
approval. After two years the plan(s) approval automatically expires.
      (7)   No soil disturbing activity shall begin before all necessary local,
county, state and federal permits have been granted to the owner or operator.
      (8)   The City will do construction inspections until the site reaches
final stabilization as determined by the City Engineer.

1339.11  CONTROLLING POST-CONSTRUCTION WATER QUALITY RUNOFF.
   (a)   Comprehensive Storm Water Management Plan:   The post-construction
water quality plan developed to meet this regulation will be coordinated and
combined with the riparian and wetland setback plan and the construction site
conservation plan that are developed for the same site. These plans will be
titled and numbered in one consecutive sequence to make a comprehensive storm
water management plan for the site. The comprehensive storm water management
plan so developed will serve as the storm water pollution prevention plan
(SWP3) required by Ohio EPA as part of the NPDES storm water permit for general
construction.
   (b)   Purpose:  The intent of this regulation is to:
      (1)   Allow development while reducing damage to receiving water
resources and drainage systems that may be caused by new development or
redevelopment activities.
      (2)   Protect and maintain the receiving stream' s physical, chemical,
biological characteristics and stream functions.
      (3)   Provide perpetual management of storm water runoff quality and
quantity.
      (4)   Establish consistent technically feasible and operationally
practical standards to achieve a level of storm water quantity and quality
control that will minimize damage to public and private property and
degradation of water resources, and will promote and maintain the health,
safety, and welfare of the residents of the City.
      (5)   Preserve, to the maximum extent practicable, the natural drainage
characteristics of the building site.
      (6)   Reduce the need for costly treatment and mitigation for the damage
to and loss of water resources that are the result of inadequate storm water
quality control.
      (7)   Require the incorporation of water quality protection that
encourages and promotes habitat preservation into the construction of storm
water management practices.
      (8)   Recharge the aquifers by requiring that commercial development or
redevelopment lying within reach of subsurface soils classified as "UoB and
UeA" shall be required to utilize post construction BMPs that promote
infiltration and recharge unless the design engineer evaluation proves a
negative impact.
   (c)   Scope:  This regulation applies to development areas having new or
relocated projects involving highways, underground cables, pipelines,
subdivisions, industrial projects, commercial projects, building activities on
farms, redevelopment of urban areas and all other land uses not specifically
exempted. This regulation does not apply to:
      (1)   Land-disturbing activities related to producing agricultural crops
or silviculture operations regulated by the Ohio agricultural sediment
pollution abatement rules (1501:15-3-01 to 1501:15-3 -09 of the Ohio
Administrative Code) and existing at the time of passage of this regulation.
      (2)   Strip mining operations regulated by Chapter 1513 of the Ohio
Revised Code and existing at the time of passage of this regulation.
      (3)   Surface mining operations regulated by Chapter 1514 of the Ohio
Revised Code and existing at the time of passage of this regulation.
      (4)   Construction activities that do not include the installation of any
impervious surface (e.g., soccer fields), abandoned mine reclamation activities
regulated by the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, stream and wetland
restoration activities, and wetland mitigation activities.
      (5)   Linear construction projects (e.g., pipeline or utility line
installation), which do not result in the installation of impervious surface
and are independent of other construction projects (not part of a larger common
plan of development or sale). However, linear construction projects must be
designed to minimize the number of stream crossings and the width of
disturbance and achieve final stabilization of the disturbed area as defined in
the definitions section of this regulation.
      (6)   Transportation projects that are subject to industry specific Ohio
EPA rules are exempt from these rules.
      (7)   It is not the role of the City to point out each and every part of
the rules and how to implement them on the individual job sites. It is the
project owner's responsibility to be proactive in meeting the intent, purpose
and requirements of these regulations.
   (d)   Post-Construction Water Quality Control Plan:  In order to control
post-construction water quality damage and damage to public and private lands,
the owner of each development area shall be responsible for developing a post-
construction storm water management plan.
      (1)   This plan will be combined with the construction site conservation
plan and the riparian setback and wetland setback plans that are also developed
for the site.
      (2)   This plan will contain a description of controls appropriate for
each construction operation covered by these regulations, and the operator will
implement such controls in a timely manner.
      (3)   The BMPs used to satisfy the conditions of these regulations shall
meet the standards and specifications in the current edition of the Ohio Rain
Water and Land Development Manual, ODOT post-construction storm water
standards, or other manual that is acceptable to the City Engineer or Ohio EPA.
      (4)   The plan must make use of the practices that preserve the existing
natural condition to the maximum extent practicable.
      (5)   To meet the post-construction requirements of this regulation, the
post- construction water quality plan must contain a description of the post-
construction  BMPs that will be installed during construction for the site and
the rationale for their selection. The rationale must address the anticipated
impacts on the channel and floodplain morphology, hydrology and water quality.
      (6)   Structural post-construction BMPs cannot be installed within a
state surface water ( e.g., wetland or stream) unless it is authorized by a
Clean Water Act Section 401 water quality certification and Clean Water Act
Section 404 permit.
      (7)   This plan will identify the person or entity responsible for
continued maintenance of all vegetative and mechanical BMPs for both the
construction and post-construction phases of the development.
      (8)   Long-term maintenance requirements and schedules of all BMPs for
both the construction and post -construction phases of the development will be
provided as a standalone document to the post-construction operator and the
City.
      (9)   This plan will contain long-term maintenance inspection schedules,
including the printed name and contact point of the post-construction landowner
( e. g., president of the homeowners association, store manager  or apartment
complex manager).
      (10)   This plan will identify the person or entity that will serve as
the post- construction operator who will be financially responsible for
maintaining the perpetual inspection and maintenance of permanent storm water
conveyance and storage structures and other conservation practices.
      (11)   The method of ensuring that funding will be available to conduct
the long-term maintenance and inspections of all permanent storm water, soil
erosion and sediment control and water quality practices will be identified.
      (12)   Maintenance plans must ensure that pollutants collected within
structural post-construction practices, be disposed of in accordance with
local, state and federal regulations.
      (13)   Maintenance plans must include legally binding perpetual
maintenance easements and agreements. Easement documents must provide for City
access.
      (14)   The post-construction plan will also contain the following
information depending on the size of the development sites as well as any
additional information required by the City Engineer:
   (e)   Development Sites Smaller than One Acre: A development site that will
disturb 8,000 square feet or more, but less than one acre of land and is not a
part of a larger common plan of development or sale which will disturb five or
more acres of land shall identify:
      (1)   Storm Water Issues: A statement as to how the decreased storm water
quality that will be caused by the planned development project will be handled.
      (2)   Description of Measures: A description of the BMPs that will be
installed during the construction process to control pollutants in storm water
discharges that will occur after construction operations have been completed.
      (3)   Upland Areas: Structural measures placed on upland areas to the
degree attainable.
      (4)   Map: A map of the entire site showing the overall development.
      (5)   Riparian and Wetland Setback: All riparian and wetland setback
areas will be identified on the plans. They will also be marked in the field
prior to the start of construction.
      (6)   BMPs: BMPs used in the post -construction water quality plan may
include but are not limited to:
         A.    Permanent storm water detention ponds that provide extended
detention of the water volume;
         B.    Flow attenuation by use of open vegetated swales and natural
depressions;
         C.    Onsite infiltration of runoff;
         D.   Sequential systems that combine several practices;
         E.    Permanent conservation easements, preferably with the easement
being held by a third party with no vested interest in ever seeing the property
developed;
         F.   Natural channel design for drainage-ways;
         G.    Bioengineering in drainage-ways;
         H.    Recreating floodplains;
         I.    Chemical and biological filters in storm sewer inlets;
         I    Sand filters;
         K.    Allowing roof water from buildings to run across lawn areas to
remove pollutants;
         L.    Onsite sewage disposals system replacement or conversion to
sanitary sewers;
         M.    Low-impact development design;
         N.    Countryside development design meeting the criteria of the
Western Reserve Resource Conservation and Development Area;
         O.    Aquatic benches in retention basins and ponds.
      (7)   Technical Basis: The plan will contain a statement of the rationale
utilized to select the BMPs used to control pollution and to maintain and
protect water quality.
   (f)   Development Sites One Acre or Larger: A development site that disturbs
one or more acres of land shall identify:
      (1)   Storm Water Detention: The post - construction BMP(s) chosen must
be able to detain storm water runoff for protection of the stream channels,
stream erosion control, and improved water quality.
      (2)   Structural BMPs: Structural ( designed) post - construction storm
water treatment practices shall be incorporated into the permanent drainage
system for the site.
      (3)   Properly Sized BMPs: The BMP(s) chosen must be sized to treat the
water quality volume ( WQv) and ensure compliance with Ohio' s water quality
standards in OAC Chapter 3745-1. The WQv shall be equivalent to the volume of
runoff from a 0.75 -inch rainfall and shall be determined according to the
following equation: WQv = C * P * A /12 where: WQv = water quality volume in
acre -feet C = runoff coefficient appropriate for storms less than one inch
( either using Table 1 or the following formula: C= 0.858i — 0.78i2 + 0.774i +
0.04 where i = fraction of post - construction impervious area) P = 0.75 inch
precipitation depth A = area draining into the BMP in acres.
Table 1 Runoff Coefficients Based on the Type of Land Use   
 
Land Use                                           Runoff Coefficient
Industrial and Commercial                          0.8
High Density Residential (> 8 dwellings/acre)      0.5
Medium Density Residential (4 to 8 dwellings/acre) 0.4
Low Density Residential (< 4 dwellings/acre)       0.3
Open Space and Recreational Areas                  0.2
 
      (4)   Where the land use will be mixed, the runoff coefficient should be
calculated using a weighted average. For example, if 60 percent of the
contributing drainage area to the storm water treatment structure is low
density residential, 30 percent is high density residential, and 10 percent is
open space, the runoff coefficient is calculated as follows 0.6)( 0. 3) + (0.3)
(0.5) + (0.1)(0.2) = 0.35.
      (5)   An additional volume equal to 20 percent of the WQv shall be
incorporated into the BMP for sediment storage and reduced infiltration
capacity. The BMPs will be designed according to the methodology included in
the Ohio Rainwater and Land Development manual, ODOT post - construction storm
water standards, or other manual that is acceptable to Ohio EPA.
      (6)   The BMPs listed in Table 2 below shall be considered standard BMPs
approved for general use. However, the City may limit the use of some of these
BMPs. BMPs shall be designed such that the drain time is long enough to provide
treatment, but short enough to provide storage available for successive
rainfall events and avoid the creation of nuisance conditions. The outlet
structure for the post - construction BMP must not discharge more than the
first half of the WQv in less than one third of the drain time.

   *   Dry basins must include forebay and micropool each sized at 10 percent
of the WQv.
   **   Provide both a permanent pool and an EDv above the permanent pool, each
sized at 0. 75 WQv.
   +   Extended detention shall be provided for the full WQv above the
permanent water pool.
   ^   A The WQv shall completely infiltrate within 48 hours so there is no
standing or residual water in the BMP.
   #   Pocket wetlands must have a wet pool equal to the WQv, with 25 percent
of the WQv in a pool and 75 percent in marshes. The EDv above the permanent
pool must be equal to the WQv.
      (7)   The owner may request approval from the City Engineer to use
alternative structural post- construction BMPs if the owner can demonstrate, in
a way that is acceptable to Ohio EPA rules and regulations, that the
alternative BMPs are equivalent in effectiveness to those listed in Table 2
above. The use of alternative or vender supplied post-construction BMPs should
be limited to redevelopment projects where justification is provided that the
traditional BMPs in Table 2 are technically and economically infeasible.
      (8)   Construction activities shall be exempt from this condition if it
can be demonstrated that the WQv is provided within an existing structural
post- construction BMP that is part of a larger common plan of development or
sale or if structural post-construction BMPs are addressed in a regional or
local storm water management plan. A municipally operated regional storm water
BMP can be used as a post-construction BMP provided that the BMP can detain the
WQv from the entire drainage area and release it over a 24- hour period upon
written permission from the City Engineer.
      (9)   For redevelopment projects ( i. e., developments on previously
developed property), post - construction practices shall either ensure a 20
percent net reduction of the site impervious area, provide for treatment of at
least 20 percent of the WQv, or a combination of the two. Where projects are a
combination of new development and redevelopment, the total WQv that must be
treated shall be calculated by a weighted average based or acreage, with the
new development at 100 percent WQv and redevelopment at 20 percent WQv.
      (10)   Site Description:
         A.    The prior land uses of the site;
         B.    The nature and type of construction activity (e.g., low density
residential, shopping mall or highway);
         C.   Total area of the site and the area of the site that is expected
to be disturbed (i.e., grubbing, clearing, excavating, filling or grading,

wetlands, springs, lakes, ponds, rivers and streams (including intermittent
streams with a defined bed and bank);
         D.    Conservation easements;
         E.    Other sensitive natural resources and areas receiving runoff
from the development;
         F.    The existing and proposed topography shown in the appropriate
contour intervals as determined by the City Engineer (generally one -foot
contours are used);
         G.    The location and description of existing and proposed drainage
patterns and facilities, including any allied drainage facilities beyond the
development area and the larger common plan of development or sale;
         H.    Existing and proposed watershed boundary lines, direction of

   (g)   Easements: Future access to all permanent vegetative and mechanical
post- construction water quality conservation practices (BMPs) and other areas,
as required by the City Engineer, shall be secured by means of perpetual
easements.
      (1)   The easements shall be recorded in the name of the City and, in
single- family residential developments, the homeowners association. Recorded
easements must provide for City access.
      (2)   Such easements shall be not less than 25 feet in width, in addition
to the width of the ditch, channel, or other facility it is to serve. Further,
an easement of this type shall be provided on one side of the flood control or
storm drainage ditch, channel, or similar-type facility.
      (3)   Access along the initial drainage system shall be by means of
easements. Such easements shall not be less than 25 feet in width, with a
minimum 10 -foot width on either side of the centerline.
      (4)   Access adjacent to storage facilities shall consist of a 25 -foot
easement in the case of detention (dry) basins, and a 25-foot easement with a
25-foot level bench in the case of retention (wet) basins, measured from the
top of the bank, and shall include the storage facility itself.

maintained into perpetuity. Water quality basins will not be constructed in any
permanent or intermittent stream channel.
   (n)   Flexibility:  These standards are general guidelines and shall not
limit the right of the City Engineer to impose at any time additional and more
stringent requirements nor shall the standards limit the right of the City
Engineer to waive, in writing, individual requirements. If the City Engineer
waives, in writing, individual requirements the owner will provide the City
Engineer with the information and documentation required to assure Ohio EPA
that the waived requirement will not degrade water quality.
   
   (o)   Redevelopment Projects: Sites that have been previously developed
where no post- construction BMPs were installed shall either ensure a 20
percent net reduction of the site impervious area, provide for treatment of at
least 20 percent of the WQv, or a combination of the two. A one-for-one credit
towards the 20 percent net reduction of impervious area can be obtained through
the use of pervious pavement or green roofs. Where projects are a combination
of new development and redevelopment, the total WQv that must be treated shall
be calculated by a weighted average based on acreage, with new development at
100 percent and redevelopment at 20 percent WQv.
   (p)   Alternative Actions:  Where the City Engineer determines that site
constraints exist in a manner that compromises the intent of this regulation to
improve the management of storm water runoff as established in this regulation,
practical alternatives may be used to result in an improvement of water quality
and a reduction of storm water runoff. Such alternatives must be in
keeping with the intent and likely cost of those measures that would otherwise
be required to meet the objectives of this section. All practical alternatives 
shall be implemented within the drainage area of the proposed development
project unless specifically authorized in writing by the City Engineer.
   (q)   Implementation of Off-site Storm Water Management Practices:  The use
of any off-site post-construction BMPs requires written approval from Ohio EPA

practice to be deferred where, in the City Engineer's judgment, such proper
construction or installation is not immediately necessary for the protection of
the public health and safety; and where the prior installation or construction
of such improvement would constitute an undue hardship on the owner because in
the case of new vegetation or weather conditions, or because in the case of
concrete, building construction could cause cracking and excessive wear and
tear on new structures. In such event, the City shall require a security bond,
escrow account, certified check or cash to guarantee that such deferred
improvements will be properly constructed or installed within an agreed
specified time, but not to exceed six months after the final acceptance.
