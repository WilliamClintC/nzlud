his or her public and private functions, the City Council may
suspend the City Council President from office for a period of
time not to exceed 59 days, after affording an opportunity to be

an important responsibility, trust or matter of integrity. The
proceedings may be conducted in a peremptory manner, but
the Council President shall be entitled to written notice of such
proceedings not less than 24 hours prior to the vote, unless the

President may be suspended by a two-thirds majority of the full
authorized membership of the City Council. The City Council
President shall be entitled to vote in the matter.

public or private nature, which demonstrate a failure to fulfill
high ethical standards in matters public or private if such
matters involve an important responsibility, trust or matter of
integrity. The proceedings may be conducted in a peremptory
manner, but the Council President shall be entitled to written
notice of such proceedings not less than seven days prior to the
vote. After providing an opportunity to be heard consistent
with due process rights, and upon proof by a preponderance of
evidence that good cause has been shown to remove, the
Council President may be removed from office by a two-thirds
majority of the full authorized membership of the City Council.
The City Council President shall be entitled to vote in the
§ 5-20 PATERSON CODE § 5-20
1:26
matter. In the event of removal, the Vice President shall serve
the balance of the unexpired term of office.

office shall not affect said Councilperson's right to continue as
an elected member of the City Council.

President. Upon the arrival of the President or Vice President, the
Temporary President shall forthwith relinquish the chair upon
conclusion of the business immediately before the Council.
I. Rule 10, Opening roll call. Before proceeding with the business of the

thereupon adjourn the meeting until the next day, unless, by
unanimous agreement, those members present select another hour
or day.

otherwise provided. If a member while speaking is called to order,
he shall cease speaking until the question of order is determined by
the presiding officer, and if in order, he shall be permitted to
proceed.

an ordinance or resolution shall have the privilege of closing the
debate, although he may have already spoken thereon at its
moving.

his vote. Each member of the Council shall be allowed two minutes

might tend to extend a conflagration and should be repaired, removed or
destroyed, the Construction Official shall give notice to the owner of any
land affected thereby of the contemplated repair, removal or destruction of
such building, wall or structure.
§ 157-3. Form of notice.
The notice required by § 157-2 shall contain a description of the property
affected, sufficiently definite in terms to identify the same, as well as
the manner in which such repair, removal or destruction is to be carried
out, and a notice that unless such building, wall or structure is repaired,

municipality will proceed with such repair, removal or destruction or cause
the same to be repaired, removed or destroyed under the provisions of this
article and the statutes made and provided, and that the cost of such repair,
removal or destruction shall be charged against the property affected as a
municipal lien.
§ 157-4. Manner and sufficiency of service of notice.
The notice required by § 157-2 may be served upon the owner resident in

On the failure of the owner of such property to comply with the terms
of such notice required to be given under this article, the Construction

the ascertainment that the same was properly made and correct and so
confirmed by the Council, the same shall be filed in the office of the City
Clerk who shall record the same in a book to be kept for that purpose
and who shall certify the amount to the Revenue Collections Director to be
charged upon the books of the City against the lands on which the building,
wall or structure was repaired or from which removed or destroyed. Such
charge with interest thereon shall forthwith become a lien on the premises
and shall be added and form a part of the taxes next to be assessed and
levied upon such lands and be collected in the same manner as other taxes.

In addition to the provisions of §§ 157-1 to 157-6 of this article, buildings,

party in interest.

to be dangerous by reason of bad condition of walls, floors, construction or
otherwise shall be held to be unsafe, and the Construction Official, besides
proceeding as provided in the preceding section, shall also affix a notice
of the dangerous character of the structure to a conspicuous place on the
§ 157-4 PATERSON CODE § 157-8
153:344
exterior of such building. Any person removing such notice so affixed shall
be liable to a penalty as provided in § 157-10 of this article.

condition perilous to life and property is not complied with immediately, the
Construction Official may order any building, structure, premises or part
thereof to be vacated, and in case any person neglects or refuses to vacate

§ 157-16. Consequence of failure to comply with orders.

the main entrance to any building so closed a placard with the following
words: "This building is unfit for human habitation or occupancy or use;

credits or if the total sum of such costs exceeds the total of such credits,
a detailed statement of the aforesaid costs and the amount so due shall

Jersey and shall be secured in such manner as may be directed by such
court. The proceeds shall be disbursed according to the order or
judgment of such court to the persons found entitled thereto by final
order or judgment of the court. Any owner or party in interest may,

in a summary manner in the Superior Court of New Jersey to contest
the reasonableness of the amount or the accuracy of the costs set forth
in the lien certificate.
C. In addition to assessing the costs of removal or demolition as a lien
against the premises, the Council may, by resolution, enforce the
payment of such assessment, together with interest, as a debt of the
owner of the premises and authorize the institution of an action at law
for the collection thereof in the Superior Court or County District Court.

(3) At least one installment of property taxes remains unpaid and

of the residents of the area in close proximity to the property,

measures to remedy the conditions.
B. Exceptions.
(1) A property which contains both residential and nonresidential
space may be considered abandoned pursuant to N.J.S.A. 55:19-78
et seq., so long as 2/3 or more of the total net square footage of the

Paterson for the purpose of establishing an abandoned property list.

identified, the tax block and lot number, the name of the owner of

may add properties to the abandoned property list at any time, and may
delete properties at any time when he or she finds that the property no
longer meets the definition of an abandoned property.
B. An abandoned property shall not be included on the abandoned
property list if the rehabilitation is being performed in a timely manner,
as evidenced by building permits issued and diligent pursuit of
rehabilitation work authorized by those permits. A property on which
an entity other than the City of Paterson has purchased or taken
assignment from the City of a tax sale certificate which has been placed
on the abandoned list may be removed if the owner of the certificate
pays all municipal taxes and liens due on the property within 30 days
after the property is placed on the list; provided, however, that if the
owner and the certificate fails to initiate foreclosure proceedings within
six months after the property was first placed on the list, the property
shall be restored to the abandoned property list in accordance with the
provisions of N.J.S.A. 55:19-103.
C. The public officer shall establish the abandoned property list and any
additions or deletions thereto by authorizing the publication of the list
in the official newspaper of the City of Paterson, which publication shall
include public notice, and within 10 days after publication, shall send a
notice, by certified mail, return receipt requested, and by regular mail,
to the owner of record of every property included on the list. The
published and mailed notice shall identify property determined to be
abandoned setting forth the owner of record, if known, the tax lot and
block number and street address. The public officer, in consultation
with the Tax Collector, shall also send out a notice by regular mail to
any mortgagee, servicing organization, or property tax processing
organization that receives a duplicate copy of the tax bill pursuant to
N.J.S.A. 54:4-64(d). When the owner of record is not known for a
particular property and cannot be ascertained by the exercise of
reasonable diligence by the Tax Collector, notice shall not be mailed but
instead shall be posted on the property in the manner as provided in
N.J.S.A. 40:48-2.7. The mailed or posted notice shall indicate the factual
basis for the public officer's finding that the property is abandoned, as
that term is defined herein and in N.J.S.A. 55:19-54, and shall specify
the information relied upon in making such finding. In all cases, a copy
of the mailed or posted notice shall also be filed by the public officer in
the office of the Passaic County Clerk. This filing shall have the same
force and effect as a formal notice under N.J.S.A. 2A:15-6. The notice
shall be captioned with the name of the City of Paterson as "Plaintiff"
and the name of the property owner as "Defendant," as though an
action had been commenced by the City against the owner.
D. An owner or lienholder may challenge the inclusion of his property on
the abandoned property list by appealing that determination to the
public officer within 30 days of the owner's receipt of the certified
§ 157-37 PATERSON CODE § 157-37
153:358
§ 157-38. Removal of property from abandoned property list.
notice or 40 days from the date upon which the notice was sent. An
owner whose identity was not known to the public officer shall have
40 days from the date upon which notice was published or posted,
whichever is later, to challenge the inclusion of a property on the
abandoned property list. For good cause shown, the public officer
shall accept a late filing of an appeal. Within 30 days of receipt of a
request for an appeal of the findings contained in the notice, the public
officer shall schedule a hearing for redetermination of the matter. Any
property included on the list shall be presumed to be an abandoned
property unless the owner, through his submission of an affidavit or
certification asserting that the property is not an abandoned property,
can demonstrate that the property was erroneously included on the
list. The affidavit or certification shall be accompanied by supporting
documentation such as, but not limited to, photographs, repair invoices,
bills and construction contracts. The sole ground for appeal shall be
that the property in question is not abandoned property, as that term is
defined in N.J.S.A. 55:19-54. The public officer shall decide any timely
filed appeal within 10 days of the hearing on the appeal and shall
promptly, by certified mail, return receipt requested, and by regular
mail, notify the property owner of the decision and reasons therefor.
E. The property owner may challenge an adverse determination of an
appeal with the public officer pursuant to Subsection D of this section
by instituting, in accordance with the New Jersey Court Rules, a
summary trial proceedings in the Superior Court, Passaic County. Such
action shall be instituted within 20 days of the date of notice of decision
mailed by the public officer. The sole ground for appeal and new
hearing before the Superior Court shall be that the property in question
is not an abandoned property, as that term is defined in N.J.S.A.
55:19-54. The failure to institute an action of appeal on a timely basis
shall constitute a jurisdictional bar to challenging the adverse
determination, except that, for good cause shown, the Court may
extend the deadline for instituting the action.
F. The public officer shall promptly remove any property from the
abandoned property list that has been determined by the public officer
or on appeal not to be abandoned and may, in his discretion, remove
properties from said list whenever he deems such removal appropriate
under the circumstances.
G. The abandoned property list shall become effective, and the City of
Paterson shall have the right to pursue any legal remedy with respect to
the properties on the list, at any time after at least one property has
been placed on the list and following the expiration of the period for
appeal with respect to that first property or upon the denial of an
appeal brought by the property owner of that first property.
A. An owner may request removal of his or her property from the
abandoned properties list prior to the sale of the tax sale certificate by
§ 157-37 BUILDERS AND CONTRACTORS § 157-38
153:359
§ 157-39. Sale of restricted tax liens.
paying all taxes and City liens due, including interest and penalties,
and:

conditions because of which the property has been determined to
be abandoned pursuant to N.J.S.A. 55:19-54 and by posting cash or
a bond to cover the cost of any environmental cleanup required on
that property, evidenced by a certification by a licensed engineer
retained by the owner and reviewed and approved by the public
officer, stating that the cash or bond adequately covers the cost of
the cleanup.
(2) By demonstrating to the satisfaction of both the public officer and
the City Council that the conditions rendering the property
abandoned have been remediated in full; provided, however, that
where the public officer finds that the owner is actively engaged in
remediating the conditions because of which the property was
determined to be abandoned as evidenced by significant
rehabilitation activity on the property, the public officer may grant
an extension of time of not more than 120 days for the owner to
complete all work, during which time no further proceedings will
be taken against the property owner.
B. If the owner has posted cash or a bond in order to have a property
removed from the abandoned property list and the conditions because
of which the property was determined to be abandoned have not been
fully remediated within one year of the date of posting the cash or bond,
or in the case of a property which required a remediation of any known
or suspected or threatened contaminants, if the owner has failed to
enter into a memorandum of agreement with the New Jersey
Department of Environmental Protection or an administrative consent
order, as the case may be, or if an agreement or order is in effect but the
owner has failed to perform the remediation in conformance with the
agreement or order, then the cash or bond shall be forfeited to the City
which shall use the cash or bond and any interest which has accrued
thereon for the purpose of demolishing or rehabilitating the property or
performing the environmental remediation. Any funds remaining after
the property has been demolished, rehabilitated or cleaned up shall be
returned to the owner.
A. Notwithstanding the provisions of N.J.S.A. 54:5-19 or the provisions of
any other law to the contrary, if a property is included on the abandoned
property list and the property taxes or other City liens due on the
property are delinquent for six or more quarters as of the date of
expiration of the right to appeal the property's inclusion on the list, or, if
an appeal has been filed, as of the date that all opportunities for appeal
of inclusion on the list have been exhausted, then the tax lien on the
property may be sold in accordance with the procedures of the Tax Sale
§ 157-38 PATERSON CODE § 157-39
153:360
Law, N.J.S.A. 54:5-1 et seq., or on the 90th day following the expiration
of that time of appeal or final determination on an appeal.
B. The City of Paterson may, at its option, require that the sale of tax sale
certificates or any subsequent assignment or transfer of a tax sale
certificate held by the City be subject to the express condition that the
purchaser or assignee shall be obliged to perform and conclude any
rehabilitation or repairs necessary to remove the property from the
abandoned property list pursuant to N.J.S.A. 55:19-55 and to post a
bond in favor of the City to guarantee the rehabilitation or repair of the
property. The public officer may waive a requirement to post a bond
imposed by the City for any purchaser, assignee or transferee of a tax
sale certificate that provides the documentation acceptable to the
public officer that the purchaser, assignee or transferee is a qualified
rehabilitation entity as defined in N.J.S.A. 55:19-80. The cost of
rehabilitation and repairs and the cost of the bond shall be added to the
amount required to be paid by the owner for redemption of the
property. The purchaser, assignee or transferee of the tax sale
certificate who is required to rehabilitate and repair the property shall
be required to file the appropriate affidavits with the Tax Collector,
pursuant to N.J.S.A. 54:5-62, representing the amounts of monies
expended periodically toward the rehabilitation or repair of the
property. A purchaser, assignee or transferee shall be entitled to
interest on the amounts expended, as set forth in the affidavits, at the
delinquent rate of interest for delinquencies in excess of $1,500 in
effect for the time period when the amounts were expended, pursuant
to N.J.S.A. 54:4-67. The tax sale certificate purchaser, assignee or
transferee, with the authority of the City of Paterson, shall be permitted
to enter in and upon the property for the purposes of appraising the
costs of rehabilitation and repair and to perform all other acts required
to guarantee the completion of the rehabilitation or repair of the
property. No rehabilitation or repair works shall be commenced,
however, until proof of adequate liability insurance and an
indemnification agreement, holding the City of Paterson harmless, has
been filed with the public officer.
C. If the City of Paterson acquired the tax sale certificate for a property on
the abandoned property list, then, upon 10 days' written notice to the
property owner and any mortgagee as of the date of the filing the notice
pursuant to N.J.S.A. 55:19-55, the City shall be permitted to enter upon
the property and remediate any conditions that caused the property to
be included on the abandoned property list. No remediation shall be
commenced, however, if, within that ten-day period, the owner or
mortgagee has elected to perform that remediation itself; it shall be
required to post bond in favor of the City in order to ensure
performance. The amount and conditions of the bond shall be
determined by the public officer.
D. The cost of remediation incurred by the City of Paterson, as so certified
by the entity incurring the cost upon completion of the remediation,
§ 157-39 BUILDERS AND CONTRACTORS § 157-39
153:361
§ 157-40. Special tax sale and criteria for bidders.
shall constitute a lien upon the property first in time and right to any
other lien, whether the other lien was filed prior to or after the filing
of any lien by the City, except for City taxes, liens and assessments and
any lien imposed pursuant to the Spill Compensation and Control Act,
N.J.S.A. 58:10-23.11 et seq., together with any interest thereon. The
certification of the cost shall be filed and recorded as a lien by the entity
incurring the cost with the Passaic County Clerk.
E. The clearance, development, redevelopment, or repair of the property
being maintained as an abandoned property pursuant to this article
shall be considered a public purpose and public use for which the power
of eminent domain may be lawfully exercised.
A. The City of Paterson may hold special tax sales with respect to those
properties eligible for tax sale pursuant to N.J.S.A. 54:5-19 which are
also on the abandoned property list.
B. The public officer, with the advice and consent of the City Council, shall
establish criteria for eligibility to bid on properties at the sale, which
may include, but need not be limited to:
(1) Documentation of the bidder's ability to rehabilitate or otherwise
reuse the property consistent with the City's plans and regulations;
commitments by the bidder to rehabilitate or otherwise reuse the
property, consistent with the City's plans and regulations;
(2) Commitments by the bidder to take action to foreclose on the tax
lien by a date certain; and
(3) Such other criteria as the public officer, with the advice and
consent of the City Council, may determine are necessary to ensure
that the properties to be sold will be rehabilitated or otherwise
reused in a manner consistent with the public interest.
C. The public officer, with advice and consent of the City Council, may
establish minimum bid requirements for a special tax sale that are less
than the full amount of the taxes, interest and penalties due, to help
ensure that the properties will be rehabilitated or otherwise utilized in
a manner consistent with the public interest.
D. The public officer, with advice and consent of the City Council, may
combine properties in said special tax sale into bid packages, and
require that bidders place a single bid on each package, rejecting any
and all bids on individual properties that are submitted.
E. The public officer, with advice and consent of the City Council, may sell
said properties subject to the provision that, if the purchaser fails to
carry out any commitment that has been set forth as a condition of sale
or misrepresents any material qualification that has been established as
a condition of eligibility to bid pursuant thereto, then the properties and
§ 157-39 PATERSON CODE § 157-40
153:362
§ 157-41. Expedited action to foreclose right of redemption.
§ 157-42. Abandoned property status during expedited foreclosure.
any interest thereto acquired by the purchaser shall revert to the City,
and any amount paid by the purchaser at the special tax sale shall be
forfeited to the City.
F. In the event there are two or more qualified bidders for any property or
bid package in a special tax sale, the City may designate the
unsuccessful qualified bidder whose bid was closest to the successful
bid as an eligible purchaser. In the event that the selected purchaser of
that property or bid package fails to meet any of the conditions of sale
established by the City pursuant to this section and his or her interest in
the property or properties reverts to the City, the City may
subsequently designate the entity previously designated as an eligible
purchaser as the winning bidder for the property or properties, and
assign the tax sale certificates to that entity on the basis of that entity's
bid at the special tax sale, subject to the terms and conditions of the
special tax sale.
G. The City of Paterson shall provide notice of a special tax sale pursuant
to N.J.S.A. 54:5-26. The notice shall include any special terms of sale
established by the City pursuant to this section. Nothing shall prohibit
the City from holding a special tax sale on the same day as a standard or
accelerated tax sale.
A. When a person or entity other than the City of Paterson acquires a tax
sale certificate for a property on the abandoned property list tax sale,
the purchaser may institute an action to foreclose the right of
redemption at any time after the expiration of just six months following
the date of the sale of the tax sale certificate.
B. When the City of Paterson is the purchaser at tax sale of any property
on the abandoned property list pursuant to N.J.S.A. 54:5-34, an action to
foreclose the right of redemption may be instituted in accordance with
the provisions of N.J.S.A. 54:5-157(b).
C. After the foreclosure action is instituted, the right to redeem shall exist
and continue to exist until barred by the judgment of the Superior
Court; provided, however, that no redemption shall be permitted except
where the owner:
(1) Posts cash or bond equal to the cost of remediating the conditions
because of which the property was determined to be abandoned
pursuant to N.J.S.A. 55:19-36, as determined by the Court; or
(2) Demonstrates to the Court that the conditions because of which the
property was determined to be abandoned have been remediated in
full.
§ 157-40 BUILDERS AND CONTRACTORS § 157-42
153:363
§ 157-43. Summary action for control and possession of abandoned
property.
A. If an entity other than the City of Paterson has purchased or taken
assignment from the City of a tax sale certificate on a property that has
not been legally occupied for a period of six months, that property shall
not be added to the abandoned property list under the following limited
circumstances:
(1) The owner of the certificate has continued to pay all City taxes and
liens on the property in the tax year when due.
(2) The owner of the certificates takes action to initiate foreclosure
proceedings within six months after the property is eligible for
foreclosure pursuant to either N.J.S.A. 54:5-86(a) or (b), as
appropriate, and diligently pursues foreclosure proceedings in a
timely fashion thereafter.
B. A determination that a property is abandoned under the provisions of
this article and N.J.S.A. 55:19-78 et seq., shall not constitute a finding
that the use of the property has been abandoned for the purposes of
municipal zoning or land use regulation.
C. Upon the request of a purchaser or assignee of a tax sale certificate
seeking to bar the right of redemption on an abandoned property
pursuant to N.J.S.A. 54:5-86(b), the public officer or the Tax Collector
shall, in a timely fashion, provide the requestor with a certification that
the property fulfills the definition of an abandoned property according
to the criteria established in N.J.S.A. 55:19-81 and 55:19-82.
D. Nothing in this chapter shall preclude the City from addressing
concerns regarding the condition of the property through the City of
Paterson property maintenance hearing process, established by
Chapter 157 of the City Code, irrespective of any ongoing foreclosure
proceedings.
A. A summary action or other action to transfer possession and control of
abandoned property in need of rehabilitation to the City of Paterson
may be brought by the City in the Superior Court, Passaic County. If the
Court shall find that the property is abandoned and that the owner or
party in interest has failed to submit and initiate a rehabilitation plan,
then the Court may authorize the City to take possession and control of
the property and to develop its own rehabilitation plan for the property.
B. Where the City has been granted possession and control, the City may
commence and maintain those further proceedings for the
conservation, protection or disposal of the property, or any part thereof,
that are required to rehabilitate the property, recoup the cost and
expenses of rehabilitation and for the sale of the property; provided,
however, that the Court shall not direct the sale of the property if the
§ 157-42 PATERSON CODE § 157-43
153:364
owner applies to the Court for reinstatement of control and possession
of the property pursuant to N.J.S.A. 55:19-92.
C. Failure by the owner, mortgage holder or lienholder to submit a plan for
rehabilitation to the City, obtain appropriate construction permits or, in
the alternative, submit formal applications for funding the cost of
rehabilitation to local, state or federal agencies providing that such
funding within the initial six-month period shall be deemed clear
evidence that the owner has failed to take any action to further
rehabilitation of the property.
D. An owner may defend against a complaint filed pursuant to N.J.S.A.
55:19-84 by submitting a plan for the rehabilitation and reuse of the
property which is the subject of the complaint and by posting a bond
equal to 125% of the amount determined by the public officer or the
Court to be the projected cost of rehabilitation.
E. Any plan submitted by an owner to defend against a complaint shall be
submitted within 60 days after the complaint has been filed, unless the
court provides the owner with an extension of time for good cause
shown. A plan submitted by an owner pursuant to this section shall
include, but not be limited to:
(1) A detailed financial feasibility analysis, including documentation of
the economic feasibility of the proposed reuse, including operating
budgets or resale prices, or both, as appropriate;
(2) A budget for the rehabilitation of the property, including sources
and uses of funds, based on the terms and conditions of realistically
available financing, including grants and loans;
(3) A timetable for the completion of rehabilitation and reuse of the
property, including milestones for performance of major steps
leading to and encompassing the rehabilitation and reuse of the
property; and
(4) Documentation of the qualifications of the individuals and firms
that will be engaged to carry out the planning, design, financial
packaging, construction, and marketing or rental of the property.
F. Where the Court approves the rehabilitation plan of the owner or other
party in interest, then it may appoint the public officer to act as monitor
of compliance and progress. If the owner fails to carry out any step in
the approved plan, then the City may apply to the Court to have the
posted bond forfeited, to transfer possession of the building to the City
to complete the rehabilitation plan, and to grant authorization to use
the bond proceeds for the rehabilitation. The owner or other party in
interest shall provide quarterly reports to the public officer on its
activities and progress toward rehabilitation and reuse the property.
G. If an owner is unsuccessful in defending against a complaint filed
pursuant to N.J.S.A. 55:19-84, the mortgage holder or lienholder may
§ 157-43 BUILDERS AND CONTRACTORS § 157-43
153:365
§ 157-44. City rehabilitation or designation of qualified
rehabilitation entity.
seek to be designated in possession of the property by submitting a
plan and posting bond meeting the same condition as set forth in
N.J.S.A. 55:19-87. The plan must be submitted within 60 days following
the Court's rejection of the owner's plan, unless the Court provides
the mortgage holder or lienholder with an extension of time for good
cause shown. If the Court approves any such mortgage holder's or
lienholder's plan, it shall designate that party to be in possession of the
property for purposes of ensuring its rehabilitation.
H. The mortgage holder or lienholder, as the case may be, shall provide
quarterly reports to the Court and the public officer on its activities and
progress toward rehabilitation and reuse of the property. If the
mortgage holder or lienholder fails to carry out any material step in the
approved plan, then the public officer shall notify the Court, which may
order the posted bond forfeit, grant the City possession of the property,
and authorize the City to use the proceeds of the bond for rehabilitation
of the property.
I. Any sums incurred or advanced for the purpose of rehabilitating the
property by a mortgage holder or lienholder granted possession of a
property, including Court costs and reasonable attorney's fees, may be
added to the unpaid balance due to that mortgage holder or lienholder,
with interest calculated at the same rate set forth in the note or security
agreement; or in the case of a tax lienholder, at the statutory interest
rate for subsequent liens.
J. If no mortgage holder or lienholder meets the conditions of N.J.S.A.
55:19-88, then the City may submit a plan to the Court which conforms
to the provisions of N.J.S.A. 55:19-87. Such plan shall designate
whether the City or a qualified rehabilitation entity shall undertake the
rehabilitation plan in accordance with the provisions of N.J.S.A.
55:19-90.
A. The public officer, with advice and consent of the City Council, may
designate a qualified rehabilitation entity for the purpose of exercising
the City's rights where that designation will further the rehabilitation or
reuse of the property consistent with the City's plans and objectives.
B. Regardless of whether the City exercises its rights directly or the public
officer designates a qualified rehabilitation entity pursuant to this
section, while in possession of a property, the City shall maintain,
safeguard, and maintain insurance on the property. Notwithstanding
the City's possession of the property, the owner of the property shall not
be relieved of any civil or criminal liability or any duty imposed by
reason of acts or omissions of the owner.
C. The Court may approve the borrowing of funds by the City of Paterson
to rehabilitate the property and may grant a lien or security interests
§ 157-43 PATERSON CODE § 157-44
153:366
§ 157-45. Procedure for City to place liens, obtain title and sell
property.
with priority over all other liens or mortgages other than municipal
liens. Prior to granting this lien priority, the Court must find as follows:
(1) The City sought to obtain the necessary financing from the senior
lienholder which declined to provide such financing on reasonable
terms.
(2) The City sought to obtain a voluntary subordination from the senior
lienholder which refused to provide such subordination.
(3) Lien priority is necessary in order to induce another lender to
provide financing on reasonable terms. No lien authorized by the
Court shall take effect unless recorded with the Clerk of Passaic
County.
D. Where the City has designated a qualified rehabilitation entity to act on
its behalf, the qualified rehabilitation entity shall provide quarterly
reports to the public officer on its activities and progress toward
rehabilitation and reuse of the property. The City or qualified
rehabilitation entity, as the case may be, shall provide such reports to
the Court as the Court determines to be necessary. If the Court finds
that the City or its designee has failed to take diligent action toward
rehabilitation of the property within one year from the grant of
possession, then the Court may request the City to designate another
qualified rehabilitation entity to exercise its rights, or if the City fails to
do so, may terminate the order of possession and return possession and
control of the property to its owner.
E. The City of Paterson shall file notice of completion with the Court, and
shall also service a copy on the owner and any mortgage holder or
lienholder, at such time as the City has determined that no more than
six months remain to the anticipated date on which rehabilitation will
be complete. This notice shall include an affidavit of the public officer,
attesting that the rehabilitation is anticipated to be completed within
six months, and a statement setting forth the actions as it plans to
undertake consistent with the plan.
A. The public officer, with the approval of the Court, may place a lien on
the property to cover any costs of the City in connection with any
proceeding under N.J.S.A. 55:19-78 et seq., incurred prior to the grant
by the Court of an order of possession, which may include costs
incurred to stabilize or secure the property to ensure that it can be
rehabilitated in a cost-effective manner. Any such lien shall be
considered a City lien for the purposes of N.J.S.A. 54:5-9, with the rights
and status of a City lien pursuant thereto.

Ord. No. 15-026; amended 12-20-2016 by Ord. No. 16-087]
B. Where the City seeks to gain title to the property, it shall purchase the
property for fair market value on such terms as the Court shall approve,
and may place the proceeds of the sale in escrow with the Court.
C. The Court may authorize the City of Paterson to sell the property free
and clear of liens, claims and encumbrances, in which event all such
liens, claims and encumbrances shall be transferred to the proceeds of
sale with the same priority as existed prior to resale in accordance with
the provision of this section, except that municipal liens shall be paid at
settlement. The proceeds of the purchase of the property shall be
distributed as set forth in N.J.S.A. 55:19-97.
D. Upon approval by the Court, the City shall sell the property on such
terms and at such price as the Court shall approve, and may place the
proceeds of the sale in escrow with the Court. The Court shall order a
distribution of the proceeds of the sale after paying Court costs in the
order of priority set forth in N.J.S.A. 55:19-97.
E. With exception of the holding of special tax sales pursuant to N.J.S.A.
55:19-101, the remedies available under N.J.S.A. 55:19-78 et seq., shall
be available to the City with respect to any abandoned property,
whether or not the City has established an abandoned property list and
whether or not the property at issue has been included on any such list.
A. A lienholder, mortgage holder or mortgagee (collectively "creditor"),
serving a summons and complaint in an action to foreclose on a
mortgage on residential property, shall, within 10 days of serving the
summons and complaint, notify the Municipal Clerk that a summons

exterior of the vacant and abandoned residential property. The
Municipal Clerk shall provide a copy of the notice to the Public Officer.
C. In the event the creditor that has served a summons and complaint in

residential property which is pending in Superior Court shall provide to
the Municipal Clerk, within 30 days, a listing of all residential
properties in the City of Paterson for which the creditor has foreclosure

Municipal Clerk shall provide a copy of the listing to the Public Officer.
E. By designating an authorized agent under the provisions of this section,
the owner consents to receive any and all notices of code violations
concerning the registered vacant property and all process in any court
proceeding or administrative enforcement proceeding brought to
enforce code provisions concerning the registered building by service
of the notice or process on the authorized agent. Any owner who has
designated an authorized agent under the provisions of this section
shall be deemed to consent to the continuation of the agent's
designation for the purposes of this section until the owner notifies the
City of Paterson in writing of a change of the authorized agent.
F. Any creditor who fails to designate a registered agent under the
provisions of this section shall further be deemed to consent to receive,
by posting on the building, in plain view, and by service of notice at the
last known address of the owner of the property on record within the
City by regular and certified mail, any and all notices of code violations
and all process in an administrative proceeding brought to enforce code
provisions concerning the property.
G. A creditor located in the State of New Jersey may designate itself as an

A. A public officer, or any other local official responsible for administration
of any property maintenance or public nuisance code, is authorized to
issue a notice to the creditor filing the summons and complaint in an
action to foreclose, if the public officer or other authorized municipal
official determines that the creditor has violated the ordinance by
failing to provide for the care, maintenance, security, and upkeep of the
exterior of the property. Such notice shall require the person or entity
to correct the violation within 30 days of receipt of the notice, or within
10 days of receipt of the notice if the violation presents an imminent
threat to public health and safety.
B. A creditor found by the municipal court of the municipality in which the

case any fines shall commence 11 days following receipt of the notice.
C. An out-of-state creditor found by the municipal court of the municipality
in which the property subject to the ordinance is located, or by any
other court of competent jurisdiction, to be in violation of the
requirement to appoint an in-state representative or agent pursuant to
the ordinance shall be subject to a fine of $2,500 for each day of the

Certificate of Re-Rental Approval
[Adopted 12-18-1979 by Ord. No. 79-111 as Ch. 14, Art. 6, of the
1979 Revised General Ordinances of Paterson]
§ 175-1. Statement of policy.
§ 175-2. Definitions.
The following terms, whenever used or referred to in this article, shall have
the following respective meanings for the purposes of this article, unless a
different meaning clearly appears from the context:
DIVISION  The Division of Community Improvements in the Department
of Community Development.
DWELLING  Any building or structure rented or offered for rent to one or
more tenants for family residential units.
HOUSING SPACE  Includes that portion of a dwelling rented or offered
for rent for living and dwelling privileges, services, furnishings, furniture,
equipment, facilities and improvements connected with the use or
occupancy of such portion of the real property, save that the term "housing
space" shall not apply to a two-family dwelling in which one housing space
is occupied by the owner of such dwelling and the other housing space is
rented or altered for rent.
MINOR VIOLATION  A departure from Chapter 271, Housing-Property
Maintenance, which still leaves the housing space in substantial compliance
with such chapter.
A. The City of Paterson is committed to the preservation of good housing
and the enhancement of high-quality neighborhood environments, and
in this regard the governing body finds the rental of housing space in
dwellings to be an appropriate focus of policymaking.
B. Further, the rental of housing space in dwellings in the City is an
important area of concern to the governing body in consideration of the
fact that the majority of households in the City occupy rented housing
space.
C. Under the police powers granted to the City and in order to protect the
health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the City, it is necessary to
regulate the circumstances under which housing space may be rented.
D. Whereas existing programs have not kept pace with the need for code
enforcement, an appropriate opportunity to intervene in the downward
cycle of housing deterioration is presented on the re-renting of a
housing space; therefore, this article makes provision for code
enforcement through requiring the obtaining of a certificate of re-rental
approval in each instance of the re-rental of housing space. [Amended
12-19-1995 by Ord. No. 95-068]
§ 175-1 BUILDINGS, NUMBERING OF § 175-2
169:383
SERVICE  The provision of electric power, heat, hot water, maintenance,
painting, elevator service, air conditioning, storm windows, screens,
superintendent service and any other benefit, privilege or facility connected

A. A certificate of re-rental approval shall be obtained from the Division of
Community Improvements, Department of Community Development, by
the landlord of every dwelling which is subject to the provisions of this
article immediately prior to allowing a new tenant to take possession of
a housing space.
B. The inspection mentioned in the following section must be conducted
while the housing space is vacant. In no case shall an inspection be
considered as immediately prior to a new tenant's possession if it is
conducted more than 30 days prior to such new tenant's possession.
A. The required certificate of re-rental approval shall be granted in
respect of any housing space within a dwelling only after such housing
space shall have been physically inspected to ascertain its compliance
with Chapter 271, Housing-Property Maintenance.
B. The inspection shall be carried out within three business days of the
request for a certificate of re-rental approval. If such inspection is not
completed by 4:00 p.m. of the afternoon of the third business day after
the inspection is requested, the landlord shall consider himself to have
received a temporary certificate of re-rental approval and may permit a
tenant to occupy the housing space until the inspection is completed.
All time computations under this article shall be made in compliance
with R. 1:3-1 of Rules Governing the Courts of the State of New Jersey.
C. The Division, at the request of a landlord, shall inspect any housing
space on an expedited basis within one business day of receipt of the
request, provided that an expedited inspection is needed by the
landlord to avoid loss of rental and the need for such expedited
inspection is not due to a lack of diligence on the part of the landlord. In
determining whether to supply an expedited inspection, the Division
shall consider the application for an expedited inspection submitted by
the landlord which shall contain the landlord's certification under oath:
(1) Stating the housing space is needed for occupancy by a tenant
before the passing of three working days.
(2) Giving the name and address of the tenant.
(3) Stating the day on which the tenant needs occupancy.

article shall be reported to the landlord on the day they are known by
first class mail or in person if the landlord presents himself at the

(3) Discourage criminal activities, especially drug-related criminal
activities and violent crime, in the said crowds.
B. Based on residents' complaints and Paterson Police records, the
Municipal Council finds as follows:
(1) Retail food establishments and other businesses in the street areas
set forth below provide a haven for criminal activities, and these
activities are difficult to control while these establishments remain
open.
(2) Crowds of juveniles, young adults and others are attracted to the
street areas set forth below in part by retail fast food
establishments and other businesses that remain open during the
late-night hours.
(3) Encouraged by the presence of retail food establishments and
other businesses, the said unruly crowds congregate on the main
streets and may spill over into parking lots and side streets.
(4) The said unruly crowds create a disturbance in the neighborhood
which prevents residents from sleeping and walking the streets and
from enjoying the peace and quiet of their homes.

179:393
§ 181-2. General hours; terms defined; alcoholic beverages;
exceptions; specified street areas.
(5) The said unruly crowds cause residents and pedestrians to fear for
their personal safety, thus causing an increase in the need for
police presence and calls for police service.
(6) The presence of all-night food establishments and retail sales and
services businesses has increased the volume of noise in these
neighborhoods as a result in the increase of automobile and
pedestrian traffic. The increase in automobile traffic is
accompanied by loud radios, car horns and running automobile
engines; the increase in pedestrian traffic by loud belligerent
behavior, fights and general commotion on the streets.
(7) The all-night operation of restaurants and retail sales and services
businesses has left the streets in these areas covered with debris
from food wrappings, bottles, cans and decomposing food products.

possible that one detector will provide coverage for multiple bedrooms.
If in order to comply with the code, a required detector is to be installed
in the kitchen, the detector must be a photoelectric-activated detector
as opposed to an ionization detector. An acceptable alternative to using
the photoelectric detector would be to install a standard ionization-type
detector inside that bedroom on the ceiling.

In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and
provisions for:
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public
health, safety, and general welfare.
B. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in
areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and

areas. Uses that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise
protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss.
A. To protect human life and health;
B. To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
C. To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
D. To minimize prolonged business interruptions;

determination made by the Construction Official in the
enforcement or administration of this chapter.
(3) Those aggrieved by the decision of the Zoning Board of
Adjustments, or any taxpayer, may appeal such decision to the New
Jersey Superior Court.
(4) In passing upon such applications, the Zoning Board of
Adjustments shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant
factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and:
(a) The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
(b) The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
(c) The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual
owner;
(d) The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community;
(e) The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
(f) The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
(g) The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
(h) The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive
plan and floodplain management program of that area;
(i) The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
(j) The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave
action, if applicable, expected at the site; and

§ 219-15 PATERSON CODE § 219-15
212:450
§ 219-16. General standards for flood hazard reduction.
In all areas of special flood hazards the following standards are required:
(6) The Construction Official shall maintain the records of all appeal
actions, including technical information, and report any variances
to the Federal Insurance Administration upon request.
B. Conditions for variances.
(1) Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of 1/2 acre or less
in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing
structures constructed below the base flood level, providing the
items in § 219-15A(4) have been fully considered. As the lot size
increases beyond the 1/2 acre, the technical justification required
for issuing the variance increases.
(2) Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued
designation as an historic structure and the variance is the
minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design
of the structure.
(3) Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would
result.
(4) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard,
to afford relief.
(5) Variances shall only be issued upon:
(a) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
(b) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
(c) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on
or victimization of the public as identified in § 219-15A(4), or
conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
(6) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk
resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.
A. Anchoring.
§ 219-15 FILMING § 219-16
212:451
(1) All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the
structure.
(2) All manufactured homes shall be anchored to resist flotation,
collapse or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include,
but are not to be limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to
ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state
and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.
B. Construction materials and methods.
(1) All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood
damage.
(2) All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed using methods and practices that minimize flood
damage.
C. Utilities.
(1) All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system;
(2) New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed
to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems
and discharge from the systems into floodwaters;
(3) On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid
impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding;
and
(4) Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air-conditioning
equipment and other service facilities shall be designed and/or
located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating
within the components during conditions of flooding.
D. Subdivision proposals.
(1) All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage;
(2) All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems located and
constructed to minimize flood damage;
(3) All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to
reduce exposure to flood damage; and
(4) Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision
proposals and other proposed development which contain at least
50 lots or five acres (whichever is less).
§ 219-16 PATERSON CODE § 219-16
212:452
§ 219-17. Specific standards for flood hazard reduction.
In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data have
been provided as set forth in § 219-7, Basis for establishing areas of special
flood hazard, or in § 219-14B, Use of other base flood data, the following
standards are required:
E. Enclosure openings. All new construction and substantial
improvements having fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that
are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in
an area other than a basement and which are subject to flooding shall
be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on
exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs
for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered
professional engineer or architect or must meet or exceed the following
minimum criteria: a minimum of two openings having a total net area of
not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area
subject to flooding shall be provided. The bottom of all openings shall
be no higher than one foot above grade. Openings may be equipped
with screens, louvers, or other covering or devices, provided that they
permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.
A. Residential construction. New construction and substantial
improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor,
including basement, elevated to or above base flood elevation; Require
within any AO Zone on the municipality's FIRM that all new
construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure
shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated above the
highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in
feet (at least two feet if no depth number is specified); and require
adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes to guide
floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.
B. Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential
structure shall either have the lowest floor, including basement,
elevated to the level of the base flood elevation; or require within any
AO Zone on the municipality's FIRM that all new construction and
substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial or other
nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor, including
basement, elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as
the depth number specified in feet (at least two feet if no depth number
is specified); and require adequate drainage paths around structures on
slopes to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures;
or together with the attendant utilities and sanitary facilities shall:
(1) Be floodproofed so that below the base flood level the structure is
watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of
water;
§ 219-16 FILMING § 219-17
212:453
§ 219-18. Floodways.
Located within areas of special flood hazard established in § 219-7 are areas
designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area
due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles,
and erosion potential, the following provisions apply:
Chapter 223
FLORISTS, RETAIL
GENERAL REFERENCES
Peddling and soliciting  See Ch. 367.
(2) Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy; and
(3) Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that
the design and methods of construction are in accordance with
accepted standards of practice for meeting the applicable
provisions of this subsection. Such certification shall be provided to
the official as set forth in § 219-14C(2).
C. Manufactured homes.
(1) Manufactured homes shall be anchored in accordance with
§ 219-16A(2).
(2) All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved
within an area of special flood hazard shall be elevated on a
permanent foundation such that the top of the lowest floor is at or
above the base flood elevation.
A. Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, and other development unless a technical evaluation
demonstrates that encroachment shall not result in any increase in
flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
B. If Subsection A is satisfied, all new construction and substantial
improvements must comply with §§ 219-16 through 219-18.
C. In all areas of special flood hazard in which base flood elevation data
has been provided and no floodway has been designated, the
cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with
all other existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the
water surface elevation of that base flood more than two-tenths of a foot
at any point.

ARTICLE I
Administration and Enforcement
§ 271-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known as the "Minimum Properties Standards Code
for All Structures and Properties" and is herein referred to as the "Housing-
Property Maintenance Code" or "this code."
§ 271-2. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to protect the public health, safety and
welfare in buildings and on the premises as hereinafter provided by:
§ 271-3. Applicability.
The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all structures and premises
which are now or may become in the future substandard with respect
to structure, premises, protection against fire hazard, equipment or
maintenance, inadequate provisions for light and air, lack of proper heating,
unsanitary conditions, overcrowding or other conditions which may be
deemed to constitute a menace to the safety, health or welfare of their
occupants except as provided in § 271-8. The existence of such conditions,
factors or characteristics adversely affects public safety, health and welfare
and leads to the continuation, extension and aggravation of urban blight.
Adequate protection of the public, therefore, requires the establishment
and enforcement of these minimum standards.
§ 271-4. Compliance required.
Every portion of a building or premises used or intended to be used shall
comply with the provisions of this chapter, irrespective of when such
building shall have been constructed, altered or repaired, except as
hereinafter provided.
§ 271-5. Application of uniform construction codes.115
Any alterations to buildings or changes of use therein which may be caused
directly or indirectly by the enforcement of this chapter shall be done in
accordance with applicable sections of the uniform construction codes.
A. Establishing minimum standards for basic equipment and facilities for
light, ventilation, space heating and sanitation; for safety from fire; for
space, use and location; for safe and sanitary maintenance; and for
cooking equipment in all structures now in existence.
B. Fixing the responsibilities of owners, operators and occupants of all
structures.
C. Providing for administration, enforcement and penalties.

§ 271-1 HEATING § 271-6
267:499
§ 271-6. Application of zoning provisions.116
Nothing in this chapter shall permit the establishment or conversion of
a multifamily dwelling in any zone except where permitted by the zoning
law, nor the continuation of such nonconforming use in any zone except as
provided therein.
§ 271-7. More stringent provisions to prevail.
Except as provided in § 271-8, in any case where a provision of this chapter
is found to be in conflict with a provision of any zoning, building, fire,
safety or health ordinance or code of this municipality existing on the
effective date of this chapter, the provision which establishes the higher
standard for the promotion and protection of the safety and health of the
people shall prevail. In any case where a provision of this chapter is found
to be in conflict with a provision of any other ordinance or code of this
municipality existing on the effective date of this chapter which establishes
a lower standard for the promotion and protection of the safety and health
of the people, the provisions of this chapter shall prevail, and such other
ordinances or codes are hereby declared to be repealed to the extent that
they may be found in conflict with this chapter.
§ 271-8. Existing buildings.
This chapter establishes minimum requirements for the initial and
continued occupancy of all buildings and structures and does not replace
or modify requirements otherwise established for the construction, repair,
alteration or use of buildings, equipment or facilities except as provided in
this chapter.
§ 271-9. Existing remedies.
Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to abolish or impair existing
remedies of the municipality or its officers or agencies relating to the
removal or demolition of any buildings which are deemed to be dangerous,
unsafe or unsanitary.
§ 271-10. Enforcement officer designated.
It shall be the duty and responsibility of the Coordinator of Community
Improvements to enforce the provisions of this chapter as herein provided.
§ 271-11. Coordination of enforcement.
Inspection of premises and the issuing of orders in connection therewith
under the provisions of this chapter shall be the exclusive responsibility of
the Department of Community Improvements, Housing Bureau. Wherever,
in the opinion of the Building Official, it is necessary or desirable to have
inspections of any condition by any other department, he shall arrange for

this to be done in such manner that the owners or occupants of buildings
shall not be subjected to visits by numerous inspectors nor to multiple
or conflicting orders. No order for correction of any violation under this
chapter shall be issued without the approval of the Building Official; and it
shall be the responsibility of that official before issuing any such order to
determine that it has the concurrence of any other department or official of
the government concerned with any matter involved in the case in question.
§ 271-12. Administrative liability.
Except as may otherwise be provided by the statute or local law or
ordinance, no officer, agent or employee of the municipality charged with
the enforcement of this chapter shall render himself personally liable for
any damage that may accrue to persons or property as a result of any act
required or permitted in the discharge of his duties under this chapter. No
person who institutes or assists in the prosecution of a criminal proceeding
under this chapter shall be liable to damages hereunder unbelieving that
the person accused or prosecuted was guilty of any unlawful act or
omission. Any suit brought against any officer, agent or employee of the
municipality, as a result of any act required or permitted in the discharge of
his duties under this chapter, shall be defended by the legal representative
of the municipality until the final determination of the proceedings therein.
§ 271-13. Inspections; right of entry; interference.
A. The Building Official shall make or cause to be made inspections to
determine the conditions of all structures and premises in order to
safeguard the safety, health and welfare of the public under the
provisions of this chapter. The Building Official is authorized to enter
any structure or premises at any reasonable time for the purpose of
performing his duties under this chapter. The owner, occupant or
operator of every structure or premises or the person in charge thereof
shall give the Building Official free access thereto and to all parts
thereof and to the premises on which it is located at all reasonable
times for the purpose of such inspection, examination and survey.
B. It shall be unlawful for any person to refuse entrance to or to impede an
inspector or officer authorized under this chapter in the performance of
his duties, and every such inspector or officer shall have the right to
enter, examine and survey all premises, grounds and structures and
every part thereof at all reasonable times upon display of proper
identification.
C. If any owner, occupant or other person in charge of a structure subject
to the provisions of this chapter refuses, impedes, inhibits, interferes
with, restricts or obstructs entry and free access to every part of the
structure or premises where inspection authorized by this chapter is
sought, the administrative authority may seek, in a court of competent
jurisdiction, an order that such owner, occupant or other person in
charge cease and desist with such interference.

discretion who shall be informed of the contents thereof or by sending a
copy thereof by mail to his last known address or, if the letter with the copy
is returned showing it has not been delivered to him, by posting a copy
thereof in a conspicuous place in or about the structure affected by the
notice.
§ 271-16. Contents of notice of violation.
Whenever the Building Official determines that there has been or is a
violation or that there are reasonable grounds to believe that there has been
or is a violation of any provision of this chapter, he shall give notice of such
violation or alleged violation to the person or persons responsible therefor.

Development Ordinance128 which, in its discretion, seem
reasonable and within the general purposes and intent of the rules,

peculiar to his land, the literal enforcement of one (1) or more parts
of this chapter will exact undue hardship on him.

deny site plans, conditional uses and N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70(c)
variances simultaneously with its review of a subdivision plat

longest period for Board action shall apply and further provided
that public notice, when required, shall make mention of each type
of approval sought.
C. Zoning Board of Adjustment. The Zoning Board of Adjustment shall
have the power to grant subdivision approval to the same extent and
subject to the same restrictions as the Planning Board whenever the

variance pursuant to N.J.S.A. 4O:55D-70(d).

§ 297-28. Completion of improvements prior to final approval.
No final plat shall be approved by the Planning Board until the completion
of all such required improvements has been certified to the City Council
by the City Engineer, unless the subdivider shall have filed with the city a
performance guaranty as hereinafter provided.
§ 297-29. Performance guaranties.
A. The subdivider shall file with the city a performance guaranty sufficient
in amount not to exceed one hundred twenty percent (120%) of the cost
of all required improvements or uncompleted portions thereof as
estimated by the City Engineer pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.4 for

uncompleted improvements on or before an agreed date. The City
Engineer shall prepare an itemized cost estimate of the improvements
covered by the performance guaranty, which itemized cost estimate
shall be appended to each performance guaranty posted by the obligor.
Such performance guaranty may be in the form of a performance bond
which shall be issued by a bonding or surety company approved by the
Planning Board; a certified check, returnable to the subdivider after full
compliance; cash pursuant to the provisions of N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.3; an
irrevocable letter of credit pursuant to the requirements of N.J.S.A.
40:55D-53.5; or any other type of surety approved by the Corporation
Counsel as to form, sufficiency and execution. At least ten percent
(10%) of said guaranty shall be made in cash. Such performance
guaranty shall run for a period to be fixed by the Planning Board but in
no case for a term of more than three (3) years.
B. The time allowed for installation of improvements may be extended by
resolution of the City Council. As a condition or as part of any such
extension, the amount of any performance guaranty shall be increased
or reduced, as the case may be, to an amount not to exceed one
hundred twenty percent (120%) of the cost of the installation, as
determined by the Municipal Engineer according to N.J.S.A.
40:55D-53.4 as of the time of the passage of the resolution.
C. Uncompleted and unsatisfactorily completed improvements.
(1) Upon substantial completion of all required street improvements
and utility improvements and the connection of the same to the
public system, the obligor on the performance guaranty may
request of the governing body, in writing, by certified mail
§ 297-27 PATERSON CODE § 297-29
297:582
addressed in care of the City Clerk, that the City Engineer prepare,
in accordance with the itemized cost estimate prepared by the
City Engineer pursuant to Subsection A, a list of all uncompleted
and unsatisfactorily completed improvements. If such a request
is made, the obligor shall send a copy of the request to the City
Engineer. The request shall indicate which improvements have
been completed and which improvements remain uncompleted in
the judgment of the obligor. Thereafter, the City Engineer shall
inspect all improvements covered by the request and shall file a
detailed list and report, in writing, with the governing body and
shall also send a copy thereof to the obligor not later forty-five (45)
days after receipt of the obligor's request.
(2) The list prepared by the City Engineer shall state in detail with
respect to each improvement determined to be incomplete or
unsatisfactory the nature and extent of the incompleteness or the
nature and extent of and remedy for the unsatisfactory state of
each completed improvement determined to be unsatisfactory. The
report prepared by the City Engineer shall identify each
improvement determined to be complete and satisfactory together
with a recommendation as to the amount of reduction to be made in
the performance guaranty relating to the completed and
satisfactory improvement in accordance with the itemized cost
estimate prepared pursuant to Subsection A.
D. Approval of the complete and satisfactory improvements and approval
of a reduction in the performance guaranty.
(1) The Municipal Council, by resolution, shall either approve the
improvements determined to be complete and satisfactory by the
City Engineer or reject any of these improvements and shall
approve and authorize the amount of reduction to be made in the
performance guaranty relating to the improvements accepted, in
accordance with the itemized cost estimate prepared by the City
Engineer pursuant to Subsection A. This resolution shall be
adopted not later than forty-five (45) days after receipt of the list
and report prepared by the City Engineer. Upon adoption of the
resolution by the City Council, the obligor shall be released from all
liability pursuant to its performance guaranty with respect to those
approved improvements except for that portion adequately
sufficient to secure completion or correction of the improvements
not yet approved, provided that thirty percent (30%) of the amount
of the performance guaranty posted may be retained to ensure
completion and acceptability of all improvements.
(2) If the City Engineer fails to send or provide the list and report as
requested by the obligor pursuant to Subsection C within forty-five
(45) days from receipt of the request, the obligor may apply to a
court in a summary manner for an order compelling the City
Engineer to provide the list and report within a stated time. If the
city fails to approve or reject the improvements determined by the
§ 297-29 LAND SUBDIVISION § 297-29
297:583
Municipal Engineer to be complete and satisfactory or reduce the
performance guaranty for the complete and satisfactory
improvements within forty-five (45) days from the receipt of the
City Engineer's list and report, the obligor may apply to the court
in a summary manner for an order compelling, within a stated
time, approval of the complete and satisfactory improvements and
approval of a reduction in the performance guaranty for the
approvable complete and satisfactory improvements in accordance
with the itemized cost estimate prepared by the City Engineer
pursuant to Subsection A.
(3) In the event that the obligor has made a cash deposit with the city
or approving agency as part of the performance guaranty, any
partial reduction granted in the performance guaranty pursuant to
this subsection shall be applied to the cash deposit in the same
proportion as the original cash deposit bears to the full amount of
the performance guaranty.
E. If any portion of the required improvements is rejected, the approving
agency may require the obligor to complete or correct such
improvements and, upon completion or correction, the same procedure
of notification, as set forth in this section, shall be followed.
F. The obligor shall reimburse the municipality for all reasonable
inspection fees paid to the City Engineer for the foregoing inspection of
improvements, provided that the city may require of the developer a
deposit for the inspection fees in an amount not to exceed, except for
extraordinary circumstances, the greater of five hundred dollars
($500.) or five percent (5%) of the cost of improvements, which cost
shall be determined pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.4. For those
developments for which the reasonably anticipated fees are less than
ten thousand dollars ($10,000.), fees may, at the option of the
developer, be paid in two (2) installments. The initial amount deposited
by a developer shall be fifty percent (50%) of the reasonably anticipated
fees. When the balance on deposit drops to ten percent (10%) of the
reasonably anticipated fees because the amount deposited by the
developer has been reduced by the amount paid to the Municipal
Engineer for inspection, the developer shall deposit the remaining fifty
percent (50%) of the anticipated inspection fees. For those
developments for which the reasonably anticipated fees are ten
thousand dollars ($10,000.) or greater, fees may, at the option of the
developer, be paid in four (4) installments. The initial amount deposited
shall be twenty-five percent (25%) of the reasonably anticipated fees.
When the balance on deposit drops to ten percent (10%) of said fees
because the amount deposited by the developer has been reduced by
the amount paid to the City Engineer for inspection, the developer shall
make additional deposits of twenty-five percent (25%) of the reasonably
anticipated fees. The City Engineer shall not perform any inspection if
sufficient funds to pay for the inspections are not on deposit.

If the required improvements have not been installed or corrected in
accordance with the performance guaranty, the obligor and surety, if any,
shall be liable thereon to the city for the reasonable cost of the
improvements not installed or corrected and, either prior to or after receipt
of the proceeds thereof, the city may complete such improvements. Such
completion or correction shall be subject to the public bidding requirements
of the Local Public Contracts Law (N.J.S.A. 40A:11-1 et seq.).
§ 297-31. Maintenance guaranty.
For all improvements not owned by a governmental agency or public utility
and not covered by a maintenance guaranty to another governmental
agency, a maintenance guaranty shall be posted with the city by the
subdivider for a period not to exceed two (2) years after final acceptance of
the improvements, in an amount not to exceed fifteen percent (15%) of the
cost of the improvements, which cost shall be determined by the Municipal
Engineer according to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.4.
§ 297-32. Standard requirements.

lots shall begin at such extra width line, and all setbacks shall be
measured from such line.
E. Where there is a question as to the suitability of a lot or lots for their
intended use due to factors such as rock formations, flood conditions or
similar circumstances, the Planning Board may, after investigation,
withhold approval of such lots.

Criminal Gang Loitering
[Adopted 5-10-2006 by Ord. No. 06-040]
§ 315-1. Procedures for police officers.
Whenever a police officer observes an individual whose actions or conduct
gives the officer reasonable cause to believe that person is a member of a
criminal street gang engaged in gang loitering with one or more persons
in any public place designated under § 315-2 of this article, the police
officer shall, subject to all applicable procedures promulgated by the Police
Director.
§ 315-2. Designation of areas; protection of rights.
A. Inform all such persons that they are engaged in gang loitering within
an area in which loitering by groups containing criminal street gang
members is prohibited;
B. Order all such persons to disperse and remove themselves from the
designated area at which the order was issued;
C. Inform those persons that they will be subject to arrest if they fail to
obey the order promptly or engage in further loitering; within the next
three hours, within the designated place at which the order was issued.
A. The Police Director shall, by written directive, designate areas of the
City in which the Police Director has determined that enforcement of
this article is necessary because criminal gang loitering has enabled
criminal street gangs to establish control over identifiable areas in
order to intimidate others from entering those areas or to conceal
illegal activities in detriment to the public good and safety. Prior to
making a determination under this subsection, the Police Director shall
consult, as he/she deems appropriate, with persons who are
knowledgeable about the effects of gang activity in areas in which this
article may be enforced. Such persons may include, but need not be
limited to, members of the City of Paterson Police Department with
special training and/or experience related to criminal street gangs,
elected and appointed officials of the areas, community-based
organizations, and members of the CPAC community groups. The Police
Director shall develop and implement procedures for the periodic
review and update of designations made under this subsection.
B. The Police Director shall, by written directive, promulgate policy and
procedures to prevent the enforcement of this section against persons
who are engaged in collective advocacy activities that are protected by
the Constitution of the United States or the State of New Jersey.

D. Personal or commercial vehicular music amplification or reproduction
equipment shall not be operated in such a manner that is plainly
audible at a distance of 50 feet in any direction from the operator
between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m.
A. Violation of any provision of this chapter shall be cause for a notice of
violation (NOV) or a notice of penalty assessment (NOPA) document to
be issued to the violator by the Noise Control Officer or Noise Control
Investigator.
B. Any person who violates any provision of this chapter shall be subject to
a civil penalty for each offense of not more than the maximum penalty
pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:49-5, which is $2,000 as of December 2014. If
the violation is of a continuing nature, each day during which it occurs
shall constitute an additional, separate, and distinct offense.
C. Upon identification of a violation of this chapter, the Noise Control
Officer or Noise Control Investigator shall issue an enforcement
document to the violator. The enforcement document shall identify the
condition or activity that constitutes the violation and the specific
provision of this chapter that has been violated. It shall also indicate
whether the violator has a period of time to correct the violation before
a penalty is sought.
D. If the violation is deemed by the Noise Control Officer or Noise Control
Investigator to be a minor violation (as defined in § 337-3 of this
chapter), an NOV shall be issued to the violator.
(1) The document shall indicate that the purpose of the NOV is
intended to serve as a notice to warn the responsible party/violator
of the violation conditions in order to provide them with an
opportunity to voluntarily investigate the matter and voluntarily
take corrective action to address the identified violation.
§ 337-11 PATERSON CODE § 337-12
325:646
(2) The NOV shall identify the time period (up to 90 days), pursuant to
the Grace Period Law, N.J.S.A. 13:1D-125 et seq., where the
responsible party's/violator's voluntary action can prevent a formal
enforcement action with penalties issued by the Health
Department of the City of Paterson. It shall be noted that the NOV
does not constitute a formal enforcement action, a final agency
action or a final legal determination that a violation has occurred.
Therefore, the NOV may not be appealed or contested.
E. If the violation is deemed by the Noise Control Officer or Noise Control
Investigator to be a non-minor violation, the violator shall be notified
that if the violation is not immediately corrected, an NOPA with a civil
penalty of not more than the maximum penalty allowed pursuant to
N.J.S.A. 40:49-5, which is $2,000 as of December 2014, will be issued. If
a non-minor violation is immediately corrected, an NOV without a civil
penalty shall still be issued to document the violation. If the violation
occurs again (within 12 months of the initial violation), an NOPA shall
be issued, regardless of whether the violation is immediately corrected
or not.
F. The violator may request from the Noise Control Officer or Noise
Control Investigator, an extension of the compliance deadline in the
enforcement action. The Noise Control Officer or Noise Control
Investigator shall have the option to approve any reasonable request for

C. Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to protect the health of the
residents of Paterson by establishing requirements to disclose the
presence of any potentially dangerous lead paint found at the time of
inspection to any proposed occupants of the premises. Disclosure will
allow those occupants to make informed judgments in order to protect
vulnerable occupants against the hazards of lead paint. Lead paint is
especially dangerous to children as it can impact the growth and
development of a child's brain and central nervous system.
A. Owner-occupied single-family dwellings and/or premises.
B. Any premises newly constructed after 1978. This means that no part of
the structure was in existence in 1978 or earlier.

premises on the Lead Safe Housing Registry.

by the owner of every dwelling and accessory structure subject to the
provisions of this chapter immediately prior to allowing occupancy or
possession of the dwelling and accessory structure by a tenant.
B. In no case shall an inspection be considered as immediately prior to a
new tenancy if it is conducted more than 365 days prior to the new

tenant without a new inspection within 365 days of the last inspection,
upon request by the owner and payment of a fee of $25.

to allowing occupancy or possession of the dwelling and accessory
structure by a tenant.
D. The owner of the premises being inspected shall be responsible for

items, as the inspector requires. In the event that the owner of the
premises does not provide necessary access to the premises, the
inspector is required to presume that lead paint is present in the
inaccessible area, and will issue a written report to that effect. Any
necessary reinspection will require an additional payment of full
inspection fees.
E. In the event that any premises are inspected twice within a five-year
period, and it is determined that there is no lead paint in the
components tested, and if reasonable access has been provided, then
the Division of Health shall issue a certificate of inspection which is
valid for a period of five years. During this five-year period, the
premises so inspected shall not require an additional certificate of
inspection before a re-rental certificate may be issued by the City of
Paterson. Upon expiration of this five-year period, a new inspection will
be required under the terms of this chapter.
A. The required certificate of inspection shall be issued only after the
premises shall have been physically inspected by a Division of Health
inspector to ascertain whether lead paint exists at the premises.
B. Upon inspection for re-rental of an apartment or portion of a
multifamily home, the inspector shall also inspect not only the unit
being rented but also the common areas of the building and any
accessory structures. The inspector shall also have the right, at his
§ 351-2 OUTDOOR CAFES § 351-4
349:659
§ 351-5. Inspection fees.
discretion, to inspect any other rental or dwelling unit within the same
building, the cost of the inspections to be assessed to the owner
pursuant to § 351-5. In the event that lead-based paint is present, the
inspector shall also have the right, at his discretion, to inspect all other
dwelling units on the premises and all accessory structures, the cost of
the inspections to be assessed to the owner pursuant to § 351-5.

Paterson, Division of Health.
(1) Any such application shall include the name(s) and address(es) of
the proposed tenants for re-rentals.

subject to this chapter, including but not limited to owner-occupied
single-family homes, may request that an inspection be performed
pursuant to this section and receive a copy of the results of the
inspection. However, request of the voluntary inspection does not
obligate the owner of the buildings to obtain a certificate of inspection.
A. A request for lead paint inspection to the Division shall be accompanied

of the Division of Recreation within thirty (30) days from the filing of the

contracts contribute to the PCAI a certain sum per worker hour projected
to be worked on the project. The PCAI is hereby authorized to adopt this fee
consistent with the laws of the State of New Jersey and the Code of the City
of Patterson. This contractor contribution rate shall be calculated according
to a formula to be determined by the PCAI that takes into account the cost
of operating a preapprenticeship program such that there will be adequate
funding to ensure the graduation of workers sufficient to perform 20% of
the work hours projected for each public construction contract, and also
to provide adequate funding to cover the costs of monitoring compliance

Passaic County Building Trades Council and the Carpenters Union.
E. Preparatory services. The PCAI shall ensure that the selected

subcontractor subject to the provisions of this chapter shall submit to
the City of Paterson a completed certified declaration of compliance
§ 373-3 PROPERTY REGISTRATION § 373-6

form as part of its proposal in response to a request for proposals and
in order to meet the City specifications. The completed declaration of
compliance form shall be made part of the executed contract and shall

enforce this chapter shall be recommended by the PCAI and
enacted by ordinance of the City Council. The City shall
withhold funds from any final payment due to covered
contractors in an amount sufficient to cover unpaid fees or
potential penalties for shortfalls regarding the apprenticeship
requirements of this chapter. Such fines and penalties shall be
not less than 3% nor more than 10% of the total price of the
contract in question.
(2) Notice and hearing. In the event the City has good cause to believe
that any contractor or subcontractor has failed to comply with the
provisions of this chapter, said contractor or subcontractor shall be
given written notice and afforded an opportunity for a hearing
before the Municipal Council before the imposition of the sanctions
set forth in this section.

RENT LEVELING
§ 381-1. Statement of policy. [Amended 6-18-1985 by Ord. No.
85-055]
The governing body of the City of Paterson does hereby declare that:
A. An emergency exists within the City of Paterson with respect to the
rental of housing space in dwellings.
B. This emergency has been created by housing demolitions, deterioration
of a substantial portion of the existing housing stock, insufficient new
housing construction, increased cost of construction and finance and
growing inflation. This has caused high rents and a substantial and
increasing shortage of rental housing accommodations for families of
low and moderate income.
C. Unless residential rents of tenants are regulated and controlled, such
emergency and the further inflationary pressures resulting therefrom
will produce serious threats to the public health, safety and general
welfare of the citizens of the City of Paterson.
D. The fear of being evicted without just cause and being forced to seek
housing in such a market discourages tenants from complaining about
exorbitant increases in rent and about the continued deterioration of
housing, and this fear thus contributes to these harmful conditions; this
warrants legislative action by the governing body.
E. Legislative action by the governing body shall serve the interests of:
(1) Tenants, in terms of assuring their occupancy of well-maintained
and improved housing at fair and reasonable levels of rent.
(2) Landlords, in terms of assuring them as far as possible rentals
which will yield a fair return on their investments while affording
them the opportunity to make expenditures designed to upgrade
the quality of the housing stock.
(3) The City of Paterson, in terms of assuring the maintenance of the
fiscal well-being of the City to the extent that this well-being is
based on the taxing of real property and on the welfare of tenants
and landlords as well as on the preservation of good housing and
the enhancement of neighborhoods.
F. Except as otherwise set forth, it is the intent of this chapter to exercise
control over rents in existing housing stock to the maximum extent,
excluding control over federally and state subsidized housing.
G. Under the police powers granted to the City of Paterson and in order to
protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the City of

Leveling Board may accept or reject the fair market value set forth in an
appraisal and shall set forth the reasons for said action.

H. The costs of proposed capital improvements may be included in the
overall amount required to be spent in order to qualify for a substantial
rehabilitation exemption from rent leveling if such capital
improvements are part of the overall rehabilitation work to be done
pursuant to the application for such exemption. Any such capital

rehabilitation exemption may not also at any time qualify for a capital
improvement rental increase under § 381-16 of this chapter. [Amended

I. All applications for substantial rehabilitation exemptions from rent
leveling pending prior to the effective date of this amendatory section of
this chapter as well as the amended §§ 381-11A(5) and 381-13 of this
chapter shall be considered under the within definition of substantially
rehabilitated residential structures. Such pending applications are
exempt from the filing fee requirement of § 381-13 of this amended
chapter and may be considered for exemption from rent leveling,
notwithstanding that the work for the proposed exemption had been
completed prior to the decision of the RLA. Such applications shall be
processed in such a manner as to comply as closely as possible with the
aforesaid amendatory sections of this chapter. [Amended 12-19-1995
by Ord. No. 95-068]
A. The property owner shall submit an application to the RLA in such form
as the RLA may require, together with a fee of $50 per apartment with a
minimum fee of $200, prior to the rendering of a decision by the Rent
Leveling Administrator (hereinafter "RLA") to preliminarily approve or
disapprove an application for a substantial rehabilitation exemption
from rent leveling. The application shall set forth the manner in which
the exemption request complies with the requirements of the pertinent
sections of this chapter as to the nature of and the need for the
rehabilitation work and in detail as to the expenditures for such work.
The application must specify the defects or deteriorated areas to be
worked on and describe the nature of any improvements to the
essential service systems to be included in the work and shall include
such other information and documentation as may be deemed relevant
and necessary by the RLA. [Amended 3-9-2004 by Ord. No. 04-017;
11-9-2010 by Ord. No. 10-075]
B. At the time of such application, the property owner will provide the RLA
with the disclosure of rental registration information required pursuant
to § 381-4K(1) of this chapter for all or part of the immediately
proceeding three-year period for which no such information has been
filed with the RLA. If the current owner has owned the subject property
for less than said three-year period, he or she shall provide the required
information for their period of ownership. In the event that three years
§ 381-12 PROPERTY REGISTRATION § 381-13
371:731
of rental registration information is unavailable due to a change in
ownership of the subject property, good faith efforts shall be made by
the current owner to obtain the required information, but if the same is
found to be wholly or partially unobtainable, despite evidence of such
good faith efforts, this requirement may be waived by the RLA to the
extent that the information is not available.
C. The application, certified to be true, must also contain a schedule of
current and proposed estimated range of initial rents for the units to be
rehabilitated. Within five days of filing of the application, a copy of the
application and rent schedule along with notice of the tenant's right to
object must also be submitted by the applicant to the affected tenants,
simultaneously by certified mail, return receipt requested, and regular
mail. Proof of service of the same in the form of the certified mail
receipt card or affidavit of mailing by regular mail and certified mail,
return receipt requested, must be filed with the RLA. The tenants have
35 days from such mailing service of notice to file any objections in
writing to the substantial rehabilitation application with the RLA who
shall investigate and consider the validity of these objections in
determining the eligibility of the application for a substantial
rehabilitation exemption. The validity of any such objections shall be
considered and evaluated by the RLA under the standards of § 381-12 of
this chapter.
D. The RLA shall, within 60 days of receipt of the completed application,
render a decision and notice all affected parties of such decision as to
the preliminary eligibility of the property or portion thereof for a
substantial rehabilitation exemption. Such decision shall include
findings and reasons as to which items of rehabilitation work were
approved or rejected under the pertinent section(s) of this chapter.
E. In the event that either the landlord and/or tenant(s) object to the
determination of the RLA, an appeal of the decision must be filed within
20 days of the date of the notice of decision by either party with the RLA
for a hearing before the Rent Leveling Board (hereinafter "RLB"). Such
appeals shall set forth the reasons upon which the appeal is based. The
hearing of such appeal must be held and a decision rendered within 45
days of the filing of the appeal or else the determination of the RLA
shall stand as valid. Any appeal from such decision of the RLB or RLA in
cases where the RLB does not render a timely decision must be made to
the City Council within 15 days of the notice of such decision of the RLB
or within 15 days of the expiration of the forty-five-day appeal period if
the RLB does not render a timely decision.
F. Following a decision of preliminary approval of an exemption, the
property owner must advise the RLA of any changes in the
rehabilitation work or cost of such work as such changes may result in a
reversal or revision of the preliminary approval. The RLA shall decide
whether or not any such changes affect the preliminary approval and
advise all affected parties of his or her findings, in writing, with reasons
for the same, and such decision may be appealed to the RLB.

G. Upon completion of the rehabilitation work following a decision in favor
of preliminary eligibility for an exemption, the property owner shall
submit to the RLA proof of approvals of all required governmental
inspections as well as proof of the actual work completed and the
amount actually spent for such work for the purpose of receiving final
approval for an exemption from rent leveling. If such items are
submitted and are consistent with the application and preliminary
approval of exemption, implementation of rent increases may occur
pursuant to Subsection H of this section. The failure to produce any
such approvals of governmental inspections, variations between the
completed work and the proposed work included in the application
which the RLA determines adversely affects part or all of the exemption
status and the actual expenditure of less than the amount required by
§ 381-12 to qualify for such exemption shall result in disapproval of all
or part of the rent leveling exemption. The RLA shall advise all affected
parties of his or her findings, in writing, as to final approval or
disapproval for the exemption, with reasons for the same, and such
decision may be appealed to the RLB.
H. Upon final approval of a substantial rehabilitation exemption from rent
leveling, the initial rents charged for any exempted rehabilitated
structure or portion thereof shall be in accordance with the schedule of
proposed estimated rents submitted with the original application and
may be put into effect only upon compliance with the provisions of any
existing leases and with state statutes governing landlord tenant law.
After an initial rent increase exempted from this chapter, two additional
exempted rent increases may, at the option of the property owner, be
effectuated annually thereafter in the two years immediately
succeeding the year of the initial exempted increase.
I. Any landlord whose substantial rehabilitation application for exemption
from rent leveling has been approved must accept rent subsidy
program participation from existing tenants in the affected building
who are eligible for such program.
J. No tenant shall be evicted from any dwelling unit for the purpose of
effecting rehabilitation work pursuant to this chapter, and the RLA shall
have the authority to determine if any coercion was used to remove
tenants in order to do such work. If it is determined that prior to the
preliminary or final approval of a substantial rehabilitation exemption
such coercion was used, the RLA shall deny the entire application.
A. Rent increases.
(1) Every landlord without recourse to the Board or Administrator may
annually request of a tenant an increase in rent which shall not be
greater than 5%, or 3 1/2% for head of household tenants 65 years

(3) Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, no landlord under this
section shall request or receive more than one rental increase
during any twelve-month period for the same apartment. The
allowable annual increase will not be permitted, if the dwelling is
not in substantial compliance and/or if the landlord has not met the
registration requirements as specified in this chapter. [Added
3-28-2017 by Ord. No. 17-022]
B. The provisions of Subsection A above shall apply until such time as a
cost of housing index has been established for the City and which has
been adopted by ordinance of the City.
C. The establishment and adoption of a cost of housing index for the City
shall not be valid unless said index shall have taken into account the

of the public advertisement of such index.155
A. A landlord may apply to the Administrator for a rental increase for
capital improvements or for increased or improved services. The
landlord shall compute the average cost of the improvements or
services per year of useful life by dividing the cost of the computed
capital improvements of services by the number of years of useful life of
the improvements or services and as agreed to by the Board or
Administrator as to the reasonable duration of such improvements or
services. The landlord shall apportion the average cost of the completed

spaces only, then the cost of the improvements or services shall be
surcharged to only these units.

whatever repairs are deemed necessary to correct a decrease in
services, the landlord may petition, upon completion of 75% or more of

Bills to users whose charges are based on actual water consumption
(volume account on the Rate Schedule) shall be based on 1/4 of the user's
actual use in the preceding calendar year. A credit or extra charge shall be
rendered to such users in the first quarter of each year to account for overor
underpayments due to differences between actual and estimated use.
§ 407-30. Disconnection of service for nonpayment; reconnection.
In the event of nonpayment of any sewerage service charge for a period
of 90 days after the date when such charge becomes delinquent, the City
may cause the service to be discontinued and the same shall not be restored
until full payment has been made of all outstanding charges and penalties
thereon plus the actual costs of disconnecting and reconnecting the service
connection. Discontinuation of service, however, shall not abrogate the
right of the City to use whatever remedies are permitted by law to collect
outstanding charges and penalties.

require documentation signed by a health care professional indicating
that the paid sick time was necessary; however, an employer may not
require that the documentation explain the nature of the illness.

attempt to exercise, any right protected under this chapter.
B. No person shall retaliate against an employee because the employee

amount of paid sick time, and the terms of its use under this chapter;

sick time unlawfully withheld.
§ 412-9. Employer records.
Employers shall allow the Agency reasonable access to records and to
monitor compliance with the requirements of this Act. An employer's failure

convincing evidence otherwise.

of the City of their rights under this Act and to publicize online and in
other media the names of employers who violate this Act.

as a condition of providing paid sick time under this chapter. If an

confidential and shall not be disclosed by the employer except to the
affected employee or with the permission of the affected employee.

§ 433-1. Scope and purpose.
A. Policy statement. Flood control, groundwater recharge and pollutant
reduction through nonstructural or low-impact techniques shall be
explored before relying on structural BMPs. Structural BMPs should be
integrated with nonstructural stormwater management strategies and
proper maintenance plans. Nonstructural strategies include both
environmentally sensitive site design and source controls that prevent
pollutants from being placed on the site or from being exposed to
stormwater. Source control plans should be developed based upon
physical site conditions and the origin, nature and anticipated quantity
or amount of potential pollutants. Multiple stormwater management
BMPs may be necessary to achieve the established performance
standards for water quality, quantity and groundwater recharge.
B. Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to establish minimum
stormwater management requirements and controls for major
development, as defined in § 433-2.
C. Applicability.
(1) This chapter shall be applicable to all site plans and subdivisions
for the following major developments that require preliminary or
final site plan or subdivision review:

undertaken by the City of Paterson.
D. Compatibility with other permit and ordinance requirements.
Development approvals issued for subdivisions and site plans pursuant
to this chapter are to be considered an integral part of development
approvals under the subdivision and site plan review process and do not
relieve the applicant of the responsibility to secure required permits or
approvals for activities regulated by any other applicable code, rule, act
or ordinance. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of
this chapter shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the
promotion of the public health, safety and general welfare. This chapter
is not intended to interfere with, abrogate or annul any other
ordinances, rule or regulation, statute or other provision of law except
that, where any provision of this chapter imposes restrictions different

(a) Where the Municipal Engineer agrees that this standard would
cause inadequate hydraulic performance that could not
practicably be overcome by using additional or larger storm
drain inlets that meet these standards;
(b) Where the flows are conveyed through any device (e.g., end of
pipe netting facility, manufactured treatment device, or a catch

(d) Where the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection determines, pursuant to the New Jersey Register of
Historic Places Rules at N.J.A.C. 7:4-7.2(c), that action to meet
this standard is an undertaking that constitutes an
encroachment or will damage or destroy the New Jersey
Register listed historic property.

(1) To the maximum extent practicable, the standards in Subsection F
and G shall be met by incorporating nonstructural stormwater
§ 433-4 SPITTING § 433-4
431:845
management strategies set forth in this subsection into the design.
The applicant shall identify the nonstructural measures
incorporated into the design of the project. If the applicant
contends that it is not feasible for engineering, environmental,

surface to collect stormwater from that surface into a
storm drain or surface water body under that grate:
[a] The New Jersey Department of Transportation
(NJDOT) bicycle safe grate, which is described in
Chapter 2.4 of the NJDOT Bicycle Compatible
Roadways and Bikeways Planning and Design
Guidelines (April 1996); or
[b] A different grate, if each individual clear space in that

2.0 inches across the smallest dimension.
(c) This standard does not apply:
[1] Where the review agency determines that this standard
would cause inadequate hydraulic performance that could
not practicably be overcome by using additional or larger
storm drain inlets that meet these standards;
§ 433-4 SPITTING § 433-4
431:847
[2] Where flows from the water quality design storm as
specified in Subsection G(1) are conveyed through any
device (e.g., end-of-pipe netting facility, manufactured
treatment device, or a catch basin hood) that is designed,
at a minimum, to prevent delivery of all solid and floatable
materials that could not pass through one of the following:
[a] A rectangular space 4 5/8 inches long and 1 1/2 inches
wide (This option does not apply for outfall netting
facilities); or
[b] A bar screen having a bar spacing of 0.5 inches.
[3] Where flows are conveyed through a trash rack that has
parallel bars with one-inch spacing between the bars, to
the elevation of the water quality design storm as specified
in Subsection G(1); or
[4] Where the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection determines, pursuant to the New Jersey
Register of Historic Places Rules at N.J.A.C. 7:4-7.2(c), that
action to meet this standard is an undertaking that
constitutes an encroachment or will damage or destroy the
New Jersey Register listed historic property.
(4) Any land area used as a nonstructural stormwater management
measure to meet the performance standards in Subsections F and
G shall be dedicated to a government agency, subjected to a
conservation restriction filed with the appropriate County Clerk's
office, or subject to an approved equivalent restriction that ensures
that measure or an equivalent stormwater management measure
approved by the reviewing agency is maintained in perpetuity.
(5) Guidance for nonstructural stormwater management strategies is
available in the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management
Practices Manual. The BMP Manual may be obtained from the
address identified in § 433-7, or found on the Department's Web
site at www.njstormwater.org.
F. Erosion control, groundwater recharge and runoff quantity standards.
(1) This subsection contains minimum design and performance
standards to control erosion, encourage and control infiltration and
groundwater recharge and control stormwater runoff quantity
impacts of major development.
(a) The minimum design and performance standards for erosion
control are those established under the Soil Erosion and
Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq. and
implementing rules.
§ 433-4 PATERSON CODE § 433-4
431:848
(b) The minimum design and performance standards for
groundwater recharge are as follows:
[1] The design engineer shall, using the assumptions and
factors for stormwater runoff and groundwater recharge
calculations at § 433-5, either:
[a] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis that the site and its stormwater management
measures maintain 100% of the average annual
preconstruction groundwater recharge volume for the
site; or
[b] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis that the increase of stormwater runoff volume
from preconstruction to postconstruction for the twoyear
storm is infiltrated.
[2] This groundwater recharge requirement does not apply to
projects within the urban redevelopment area, or to
projects subject to Subsection F(1)(b)[3] below.
[3] The following types of stormwater shall not be recharged:
[a] Stormwater from areas of high pollutant loading. High
pollutant loading areas are areas in industrial and
commercial developments where solvents and/or
petroleum products are loaded/unloaded, stored, or
applied, areas where pesticides are loaded/unloaded
or stored; areas where hazardous materials are
expected to be present in greater than reportable
quantities as defined by the United States
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR
302.4; areas where recharge would be inconsistent
with Department approved remedial action work plan
or landfill closure plan and areas with high risks for
spills of toxic materials, such as gas stations and
vehicle maintenance facilities; and
[b] Industrial stormwater exposed to source material.
"Source material" means any material(s) or
machinery, located at an industrial facility that is
directly or indirectly related to process,
manufacturing or other industrial activities, which
could be a source of pollutants in any industrial
stormwater discharge to groundwater. Source
materials include, but are not limited to, raw
materials, intermediate products, final products,
waste materials, by-products, industrial machinery
and fuels, and lubricants, solvents, and detergents
that are related to process, manufacturing, or other
industrial activities that are exposed to stormwater.
§ 433-4 SPITTING § 433-4
431:849
[4] The design engineer shall assess the hydraulic impact on
the groundwater table and design the site so as to avoid
adverse hydraulic impacts. Potential adverse hydraulic
impacts include, but are not limited to, exacerbating a
naturally or seasonally high water table so as to cause
surficial ponding, flooding of basements, or interference
with the proper operation of subsurface sewage disposal
systems and other subsurface structures in the vicinity or
downgradient of the groundwater recharge area.
(c) In order to control stormwater runoff quantity impacts, the
design engineer shall, using the assumptions and factors for
stormwater runoff calculations at § 433-5, complete one of the
following:
[1] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
that for stormwater leaving the site, postconstruction
runoff hydrographs for the two-, ten-, and one-hundredyear
storm events do not exceed, at any point in time, the
preconstruction runoff hydrographs for the same storm
events;
[2] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
that there is no increase, as compared to the
preconstruction condition, in the peak runoff rates of
stormwater leaving the site for the two-, ten-, and onehundred-
year storm events and that the increased volume
or change in timing of stormwater runoff will not increase
flood damage at or downstream of the site. This analysis
shall include the analysis of impacts of existing land uses
and projected land uses assuming full development under
existing zoning and land use ordinances in the drainage
area;
[3] Design stormwater management measures so that the
postconstruction peak runoff rates for the two-, ten-, and
one-hundred-year storm events are 50%, 75% and 80%,
respectively, of the preconstruction peak runoff rates. The
percentages apply only to the postconstruction
stormwater runoff that is attributable to the portion of the
site on which the proposed development or project is to be
constructed. The percentages shall not be applied to
postconstruction stormwater runoff into tidal flood hazard
areas if the increased volume of stormwater runoff will not
increase flood damages below the point of discharge; or
[4] In tidal flood hazard areas, stormwater runoff quantity
analysis in accordance with Subsection F(1)(c)[1], [2] and
[3] above shall only be applied if the increased volume of
stormwater runoff could increase flood damages below the
point of discharge.
§ 433-4 PATERSON CODE § 433-4
431:850
(2) Any application for a new agricultural development that meets the
definition of major development in § 433-2 shall be submitted to the
appropriate Soil Conservation District for review and approval in
accordance with the requirements of this section and any
applicable Soil Conservation District guidelines for stormwater
runoff quantity and erosion control. For the purposes of this
section, "agricultural development" means land uses normally
associated with the production of food, fiber and livestock for sale.
Such uses do not include the development of land for the
processing or sale of food and the manufacturing of agriculturally
related products.
G. Stormwater runoff quality standards.
(1) Stormwater management measures shall be designed to reduce the
postconstruction load of total suspended solids (TSS) in stormwater
runoff by 80% of the anticipated load from the developed site,
expressed as an annual average. Stormwater management
measures shall only be required for water quality control if an
additional 1/4 acre of impervious surface is being proposed on a
development site. The requirement to reduce TSS does not apply to
any stormwater runoff in a discharge regulated under a numeric
effluent limitation for TSS imposed under the New Jersey Pollution
Discharge Elimination System (NJPDES) rules, N.J.A.C. 7:14A, or in
a discharge specifically exempt under a NJPDES permit from this
requirement. The water quality design storm is 1.25 inches of
rainfall in two hours. Water quality calculations shall take into
account the distribution of rain from the water quality design
storm, as reflected in Table 1. The calculation of the volume of
runoff may take into account the implementation of nonstructural
and structural stormwater management measures.

(2) For purposes of TSS reduction calculations, Table 2 below presents
the presumed removal rates for certain BMPs designed in
accordance with the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management
Practices Manual. The BMP Manual may be obtained from the
address identified in § 433-7, or found on the Department's Web
site at www.njstormwater.org. The BMP Manual and other sources
of technical guidance are listed in § 433-7. TSS reduction shall be
calculated based on the removal rates for the BMPs in Table 2
below. Alternative removal rates and methods of calculating
removal rates may be used if the design engineer provides
documentation demonstrating the capability of these alternative
rates and methods to the review agency. A copy of any approved
alternative rate or method of calculating the removal rate shall be
provided to the Department at the following address: Division of
Watershed Management, New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection, PO Box 418, Trenton, New Jersey, 08625-0418.
(3) If more than one BMP in series is necessary to achieve the required
eighty-percent TSS reduction for a site, the applicant shall utilize
the following formula to calculate TSS reduction:
R = A + B - (AXB)/100
Where:
R = Total TSS percent load removal from application of both
BMPs.
A = The TSS percent removal rate applicable to the first BMP.
B = The TSS percent removal rate applicable to the second BMP.

(4) If there is more than one on-site drainage area, the eighty-percent
TSS removal rate shall apply to each drainage area, unless the
runoff from the subareas converge on site, in which case the
removal rate can be demonstrated through a calculation using a
weighted average.
(5) Stormwater management measures shall also be designed to
reduce, to the maximum extent feasible, the postconstruction
nutrient load of the anticipated load from the developed site in
stormwater runoff generated from the water quality design storm.
In achieving reduction of nutrients to the maximum extent feasible,
the design of the site shall include nonstructural strategies and
structural measures that optimize nutrient removal while still
achieving the performance standards in Subsections F and G.
(6) Additional information and examples are contained in the New
Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual, which may
be obtained from the address identified in § 433-7.
(7) In accordance with the definition of FW1 at N.J.A.C. 7:9B-1.4,
stormwater management measures shall be designed to prevent
any increase in stormwater runoff to waters classified as FW1.
(8) Special water resource protection areas shall be established along
all waters designated Category One at N.J.A.C. 7:9B, and perennial
or intermittent streams that drain into or upstream of the Category
One waters as shown on the USGS Quadrangle Maps or in the
County Soil Surveys, within the associated HUC14 drainage area.
These areas shall be established for the protection of water quality,
aesthetic value, exceptional ecological significance, exceptional
recreational significance, exceptional water supply significance,
and exceptional fisheries significance of those established Category
One waters. These areas shall be designated and protected as
follows:
(a) The applicant shall preserve and maintain a special water
resource protection area in accordance with one of the
following:
[1] A three-hundred-foot special water resource protection
area shall be provided on each side of the waterway,
measured perpendicular to the waterway from the top of
the bank outwards or from the center line of the waterway
where the bank is not defined, consisting of existing
§ 433-4 SPITTING § 433-4
431:853
vegetation or vegetation allowed to follow natural
succession is provided.
[2] Encroachment within the designated special water
resource protection area under Subsection G(8)(a)[1]
above shall only be allowed where previous development
or disturbance has occurred (for example, active
agricultural use, parking area or maintained lawn area).
The encroachment shall only be allowed where the
applicant demonstrates that the functional value and
overall condition of the special water resource protection
area will be maintained to the maximum extent
practicable. In no case shall the remaining special water
resource protection area be reduced to less than 150 feet
as measured perpendicular to the top of bank of the
waterway or center line of the waterway where the bank is
undefined. All encroachments proposed under this
subsection shall be subject to review and approval by the
Department.
(b) All stormwater shall be discharged outside of and flow through
the special water resource protection area and shall comply
with the Standard for Off-Site Stability in the Standards For
Soil Erosion and Sediment Control in New Jersey, established
under the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A.
4:24-39 et seq.
(c) If stormwater discharged outside of and flowing through the
special water resource protection area cannot comply with the
Standard For Off-Site Stability in the Standards for Soil
Erosion and Sediment Control in New Jersey, established under
the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et
seq., then the stabilization measures in accordance with the
requirements of the above standards may be placed within the
special water resource protection area, provided that:
[1] Stabilization measures shall not be placed within 150 feet
of the Category One waterway;
[2] Stormwater associated with discharges allowed by this
section shall achieve a ninety-five-percent TSS
postconstruction removal rate;
[3] Temperature shall be addressed to ensure no impact on
the receiving waterway;
[4] The encroachment shall only be allowed where the
applicant demonstrates that the functional value and
overall condition of the special water resource protection
area will be maintained to the maximum extent
practicable;
§ 433-4 PATERSON CODE § 433-4
431:854
§ 433-5. Calculation of stormwater runoff and groundwater
recharge.
[5] A conceptual project design meeting shall be held with the
appropriate Department staff and Soil Conservation
District staff to identify necessary stabilization measures;
and
[6] All encroachments proposed under this section shall be
subject to review and approval by the Department.
(d) A stream corridor protection plan may be developed by a
regional stormwater management planning committee as an
element of a regional stormwater management plan, or by a
municipality through an adopted municipal stormwater
management plan. If a stream corridor protection plan for a
waterway subject to Subsection G(8) has been approved by the
Department of Environmental Protection, then the provisions
of the plan shall be the applicable special water resource
protection area requirements for that waterway. A stream
corridor protection plan for a waterway subject to Subsection
G(8) shall maintain or enhance the current functional value
and overall condition of the special water resource protection
area as defined in Subsection G(8)(a)[1] above. In no case shall
a stream corridor protection plan allow the reduction of the
special water resource protection area to less than 150 feet as
measured perpendicular to the waterway subject to this
subsection.
(e) Subsection G(8) does not apply to the construction of one
individual single-family dwelling that is not part of a larger
development on a lot receiving preliminary or final subdivision
approval on or before February 2, 2004, provided that the
construction begins on or before February 2, 2009.
A. Stormwater runoff shall be calculated in accordance with the following:
(1) The design engineer shall calculate runoff using one of the
following methods:
(a) The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS)
methodology, including the NRCS Runoff Equation and
Dimensionless Unit Hydrograph, as described in the NRCS
National Engineering Handbook Section 4 - Hydrology and
Technical Release 55 - Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds;
or
(b) The Rational Method for peak flow and the Modified Rational
Method for hydrograph computations.
(2) For the purpose of calculating runoff coefficients and groundwater
recharge, there is a presumption that the preconstruction condition
§ 433-4 SPITTING § 433-5
431:855
of a site or portion thereof is a wooded land use with good
hydrologic condition. The term "runoff coefficient" applies to both
the NRCS methodology at Subsection A(1)(a) and the Rational
and Modified Rational Methods at Subsection A(1)(b). A runoff
coefficient or a groundwater recharge land cover for an existing
condition may be used on all or a portion of the site if the design
engineer verifies that the hydrologic condition has existed on the
site or portion of the site for at least five years without interruption
prior to the time of application. If more than one land cover has
existed on the site during the five years immediately prior to the
time of application, the land cover with the lowest runoff potential
shall be used for the computations. In addition, there is the
presumption that the site is in good hydrologic condition (if the
land use type is pasture, lawn, or park), with good cover (if the
land use type is woods), or with good hydrologic condition and
conservation treatment (if the land use type is cultivation).
(3) In computing preconstruction stormwater runoff, the design
engineer shall account for all significant land features and
structures, such as ponds, wetlands, depressions, hedgerows, or
culverts, that may reduce preconstruction stormwater runoff rates
and volumes.
(4) In computing stormwater runoff from all design storms, the design
engineer shall consider the relative stormwater runoff rates and/or
volumes of previous and impervious surfaces separately to
accurately compute the rates and volume of stormwater runoff
from the site. To calculate runoff from unconnected impervious
cover, urban impervious area modifications as described in the
NRCS Technical Release 55  Urban Hydrology for Small
Watersheds and other methods may be employed.
(5) If the invert of the outlet structure of a stormwater management
measure is below the flood hazard design flood elevation as defined
at N.J.A.C. 7:13, the design engineer shall take into account the
effects of tailwater in the design of structural stormwater
management measures.
B. Groundwater recharge may be calculated in accordance with the
following:

§ 433-6. Standards for structural stormwater management
measures.
A. Standards for structural stormwater management measures are as
follows:
(1) Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed to
take into account the existing site conditions, including, for
example, environmentally critical areas, wetlands, flood-prone
areas, slopes, depth to seasonal high water table, soil type,
permeability and texture, drainage area and drainage patterns, and
the presence of solution-prone carbonate rocks (limestone).
(2) Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed to
minimize maintenance, facilitate maintenance and repairs, and
ensure proper functioning. Trash racks shall be installed at the
intake to the outlet structure as appropriate, and shall have parallel
bars with one-inch spacing between the bars to the elevation of the
water quality design storm. For elevations higher than the water
quality design storm, the parallel bars at the outlet structure shall
be spaced no greater than 1/3 the width of the diameter of the
orifice or 1/3 the width of the weir, with a minimum spacing
between bars of one inch and a maximum spacing between bars of
six inches. In addition, the design of trash racks must comply with
the requirements of § 433-8D.
(3) Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed,
constructed, and installed to be strong, durable, and corrosion
resistant. Measures that are consistent with the relevant portions
of the residential site improvement standards at N.J.A.C. 5:21-7.3,
5:21-7.4, and 5:21-7.5 shall be deemed to meet this requirement.
(4) At the intake to the outlet from the stormwater management basin,
the orifice size shall be a minimum of 2 1/2 inches in diameter.
(5) Stormwater management basins shall be designed to meet the
minimum safety standards for stormwater management basins at
§ 433-8.
B. Stormwater management measure guidelines are available in the New
Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual. Other
stormwater management measures may be utilized, provided the
design engineer demonstrates that the proposed measure and its
design will accomplish the required water quantity, groundwater
recharge and water quality design and performance standards
established by § 433-4 of this chapter.
C. Manufactured treatment devices may be used to meet the requirements
of § 433-4 of this chapter, provided the pollutant removal rates are
verified by the New Jersey Corporation for Advanced Technology and
certified by the Department.

serve to bar the holder from being eligible to receive any additional

being used on a regular basis. Nothing in this subsection shall be
construed to waive the registration, inspection or insurance provisions
of this Part 1 or any other provision.

ARTICLE III ADMINISTRATION & ENFORCEMENT
§300-1 APPLICATION FOR A ZONING PERMIT, CONSTRUCTION PERMIT AND CERTIFICATE OF
OCCUPANCY
§300-1.1 Zoning Permit, Construction Permit and Certificate of Occupancy.
A. Zoning Permit. No building or structure shall be erected, moved, extended, or altered, nor shall
any excavation, demolition or other land improvement take place without a Zoning Permit
issued by the Zoning Officer. No Zoning Permit shall be issued in the City of Paterson unless that
action is in complete conformity with this, and all other applicable ordinances, statutes and
regulations. Application for the issuance of a Zoning Permit shall be made to the Zoning Officer.
B. Construction Permit. No Construction Permit shall be granted without submission of a Zoning
Permit issued by the Zoning Officer.
C. Certificate of Occupancy. It shall be unlawful to use or occupy or to permit the use or occupancy
of any building, structure or premises, or both, or part thereof hereafter created, erected,
changed, converted, altered or enlarged in its use or structure unless a Zoning Permit has been
issued by the Zoning Officer certifying that the proposed use conforms to the requirements of
this Ordinance. The Director of Community Improvements is responsible for the issuance of
Building Permits and Certificates of Occupancy following the issuance of a Zoning Permit by the
Zoning officer.
§300-1.2 Application Materials.
The following application materials shall be submitted to the Zoning Officer in support of a request for a
Construction Permit or a Certificate of Occupancy:
A. Two (2) copies of the appropriate application form, signed by the applicant.
B. Two (2) copies each of the following information on one or more drawings:
1. Survey of the property.
2. All materials required for issuance of a Construction Permit or Certificate of Occupancy,
as applicable.
3. A diagram of a proposed sign containing the information required for a sign permit as
specified in this Ordinance.
§300-1.3 Decision by Zoning Officer.
A. The Zoning Officer shall issue or deny a Zoning Permit within ten (10) business days of a request
therefor. The Zoning Officer is usually the first municipal official whom the typical property
owner meets in the process of making an application to do something with his property. The
City of Paterson, Land Development Ordinance Administration and Enforcement
46
Municipal Land Use Law requires applicants to file, with the Zoning Officer, for a Zoning Permit.
In this ordinance, the Zoning Permit is defined as a document signed by the Zoning Officer
which:
1. Is required as a condition precedent to the commencement of a use, change of a use, or
the erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, conversion or installation of a
structure or building and;
2. Acknowledges that such use, structure or building complies with the provisions of this
ordinance or variance therefrom duly authorized by the Planning Board or the Zoning
Board of Adjustment.
B. The basic purpose of a Zoning Permit is to assure that the proposed use, construction or
alteration will be in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance. A Building Permit shall be
granted only following approval of a Zoning Permit. Certificates of Occupancy are also required
to indicate specific certification of compliance with the Uniform Construction Code of the State
of New Jersey following completion of construction. The Certificate of Occupancy is concerned
with construction details of the building and assurance that it is constructed and, in the case of
rental units, maintained in compliance with the State Construction Code or applicable state,
health and safety regulations. The Zoning Permit looks to the location and use of the building in
light of the requirements to the Zoning and Land Development Ordinance and certifies that such
location and use (1) is permitted or (2) that it exists as a non-conforming use and/or nonconforming
structure or (3) is permitted by the terms of a variance.
C. Upon the filing of a completed application for a Zoning Permit, the Zoning Officer shall
determine whether the proposed use is permitted or not, and whether a development
application is required to be submitted to the Planning Board or Zoning Board of Adjustment. A
Zoning Permit application for a use not specifically listed as permitted in a particular zone
district shall be denied and it shall be the duty of the Zoning Officer to specify what sections of
the ordinance are involved and what approvals and/or variances would be required before a
Zoning Permit could be issued. Such specifications of approvals and/or variances listed on the
permit application shall be submitted to the Planning Board or Zoning Board of Adjustment, as
applicable, for consideration of the development application.
§300-2 REVIEWS BY APPROVING AGENCIES
§300-2.1 Further Application.
If, after the receipt of a denied application for a Zoning Permit, the applicant wishes to pursue his
proposal for development, he shall make application to the Planning Board or the Zoning Board of
Adjustment, as applicable, through the Division of Planning and Zoning.
City of Paterson, Land Development Ordinance Administration and Enforcement
47
§300-2.2 Direct Application.
An applicant may file an application for development directly with the Zoning Board of Adjustment or
the Planning Board through the Division of Planning and Zoning without prior application to the Zoning
Officer, provided that an application made under the provisions of this subsection shall make mention of
each and every type of review sought. This provision does not waive the requirement of obtaining a
Zoning Permit in the event the party is granted approval by either Board.
§300-2.3 Pre-Submission Conference; Informal Review.
A. Applicants are encouraged to participate in a pre-submission conference with a member of the
Division of Planning and Zoning, either in person, by agent or by attorney. The purpose of the
conference shall be to evaluate the proposal for the type of reviews required and to insure that
the developer applicant receives, and understands the requirements and expectations with
respect to, all proper application materials. No statement or representation by either the
applicant or the Division of Planning and Zoning at the time of pre-submission conference shall
be binding or final.
B. At the request of the developer, the Planning Board shall grant an informal review of a concept
plan for a development for which the developer intends to prepare and submit an application
for development. The amount of any fees for such an informal review shall be a credit toward
fees for review of the application for development. The developer shall not be bound by any
concept plan for which review is requested, and the planning board shall not be bound by any
such review.
§300-2.4 Application Material.
The following information shall be submitted for all types of approval sought. Checklist for submissions
to the Paterson Planning Board and Paterson Zoning Board of Adjustment for Site Plan, Minor
Subdivision, Major Subdivision, Conditional Use, "C" Variance and "D" Variance approvals are described

form, or the Final Plat Details and Requirements form (found in Appendix A), where applicable,

elimination of specific checklist details or requirements. The Planning Board or Board of
Adjustment, as the case may be, shall have the power and authority to waive or eliminate
specific checklist details and requirements that are not deemed necessary to make an informed
decision as to whether the requirements necessary for approval of an application have been
met. The applicant shall submit all materials and information as set forth herein and all other
applicable local and state ordinances and codes.
§300-2.5 Proof of Payment of Taxes Required.
Notwithstanding any potentially conflicting provisions of this Ordinance of the City of Paterson (Code of
the City of Paterson - Chapter 297), the applicant for any development application, at the time of filing
of said application, shall file with the Planning Board or the Board of Adjustment a certification of the
Tax Collector that all municipal taxes and/or assessments have been paid and are current with respect
to the property for which the application is made. In the event taxes and/or assessments on the subject
property are unpaid, the applicant may submit a written request to the Planning Board or Board of
Adjustment that any approval on said development application be subject to the payment of taxes
and/or assessments. For good cause, the appropriate Board may waive the requirement of proof of
payment as a condition of completeness of the application. However, in such instance, the Board shall
condition any approval of the development application upon prompt payment of the full amount of
unpaid taxes and/or assessments. In the event the Board shall condition any approval of the
development application upon prompt payment of the full amount of unpaid taxes and/or assessments,
the applicant shall have no right to proceed with the development until all such taxes and/or
assessments have been paid and are made current.

B. When deemed necessary by a municipal agency, an applicant shall be responsible to reimburse

consultants when an application is of a nature beyond the scope of the expertise of the
professionals normally utilized by the City, and/or other purposes under the provisions of P. L.
1975 c. 291 et. seq.). The City shall be entitled to be reimbursed for the review of applications
by such outside consultants, both as to completeness and content; for the review and
preparation of documents such as, but not limited to: resolutions, developers agreements and
necessary correspondence with applicant or applicants professionals; meetings; and all
communication and all time spent reviewing the application submittals. The only cost that shall

applicant with notice of the insufficient balance requesting that the applicant post a deposit to
the account in an amount agreed upon by the City or the approving authority and the applicant.
D. No Zoning Permits, Building Permits, Certificates of Occupancy or any other types of permits
may be issued with respect to any approved application for development until all bills for
reimbursable services have been received by the City from professional personnel rendering
services in connection with such applicant and payment has been made. However, the
appropriate maps or permits may be signed and permits released or issued, if the applicant shall
have deposited with the City an amount agreed upon by the applicant and the City likely to be
sufficient to cover all reimbursable items; and upon posting said deposit with the City. If the
amount of the deposit exceeds the actual costs as approved for payment by the governing body,
the developer shall be entitled to a return of the excess deposit, together with such interest as
allowed by N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.1; but if the charges submitted and approved by the governing
body exceed the amount of the deposit, the developer shall be liable for payment of such
deficiency.

proceedings; and
5. Actual out-of-pocket expenses of outside professionals or consultants.

deposits by the State, in an account bearing interest at the minimum rate currently paid by the
institution or depository on tine or savings deposits. The municipality shall notify the applicant
in writing of the name and address of the institution or depository in which the deposit is made
and the amount of the deposit. The municipality shall not be required to refund an amount of
interest paid on a deposit that does not exceed $100 for the year. If the amount of interest
exceeds $100, that entire amount shall belong to the applicant and shall be refunded to him by
the municipality annually or at the time the deposit is repaid or applied to the purposes for
which it was deposited, as the case may be; except that the municipality may retain for
administrative expenses a sum equivalent to no more than 33-1/3% of that entire amount,
which shall be in lieu of all other administrative and custodial expenses. All sums not actually so
City of Paterson, Land Development Ordinance Administration and Enforcement

expended shall be refunded to the applicant within 90 days after the final decision by the

municipal agency for whom said services were performed.
H. The Chief Financial Officer shall prepare and send to the applicant a statement which shall
include an accounting of funds listing all deposits, interest earnings, disbursements and the
cumulative balance of the escrow account. This information shall be provided on a quarterly
basis if monthly charges are $1,000 or less, or on a monthly basis if monthly charges exceed
$1,000.
I. The following close out procedures shall apply to all deposits and escrow accounts established
under the provisions of N.J.S.A. 40:55D-1 et seq. and shall commence after the approving
authority has granted final approval and signed the subdivision plat or site plan, in the case of
application review escrows and deposits, or after the improvements have been approved in
accordance with N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53, in the case of improvements inspection escrows and
deposits. The applicant shall send written notice by certified mail to the Chief Financial Officer of
the municipality and the approving authority and to the relevant municipal professional, that
the application or the improvements, as the case may be, are completed. After receipt of such
notice, the professional shall render a final bill to the Chief Financial Officer of the municipality
within thirty (30) days and shall send a copy simultaneously to the applicant. The Chief Financial
Officer of the municipality shall render a written final accounting to the applicant on the uses to

40:55D-53.1 shall be refunded to the developer along with the final accounting.
J. All professional charges for review of an application for development, review and preparation of
documents or inspection of improvements shall be reasonable and necessary, given the status
and progress of the application or construction. Review fees shall be charged only in connection
with an application for development presently pending before the approving authority or upon
review of compliance with the conditions of approval, or review of requests for modification or
amendment made by the applicant. A professional shall not review items that are subject to

1. General standards
A. The following standards, and the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation
and Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings, promulgated pursuant to 16 U.S.C.A.
Sec. 470a, shall guide the Commission's and Planning Board's decision making
concerning all applications and approvals described herein.
(1) New additions, exterior alterations, or infill new construction shall not destroy
historic materials that characterize the property. The new work shall be
City of Paterson, Land Development Ordinance Administration and Enforcement
104
differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale
and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its
environment.
(2) New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in
such a manner that if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of
the designated historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.
(3) Construction of historic designs that were never built shall not be undertaken.
(4) New additions, alterations or construction in a historic landscape shall be
visually differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the historic
character of the landscape.
(5) Replacement of missing historic plant material or vegetation features shall be
substantiated by documentary or physical evidence. The replacement plant
material or features shall match the historic appearance, function and where
possible, species or variety.
(6) A property shall be used for its historic purpose, or shall be placed in a new use
that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the property and
its environment.
(7) The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The
removal of historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that
characterize a property shall be avoided.
(8) Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time, place and use.
Changes that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding
conjectural features or historic features from other properties shall be avoided.
(9) Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired historic
significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved.
(10)Distinctive materials, features, finishes and construction techniques or examples
of craftsmanship that characterize a property shall be preserved.
(11)Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where the
severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new
feature shall match the old in design, color, texture and other visual qualities
and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features shall be
substantiated by documentary or physical evidence.
(12)Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause damage to
historic materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of structures, if
appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means possible.
(13)Significant archaeological resources shall be protected and preserved. If such
resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures shall be undertaken.
City of Paterson, Land Development Ordinance Administration and Enforcement
105
(14)The Development Design Standards in Article IV in the Land Use Ordinance to
the extent deemed appropriate by the Commission.
2. Standards for protection
A. Before applying protective measures, which are generally of a temporary nature and
imply future historic preservation work, an analysis of the actual or anticipated threats
to the property shall be made.
B. Protection shall safeguard the physical condition or environment of a property or
archaeological site from further deterioration or damage caused by weather or other
natural, animal or human intrusions.
C. If any historic material or architectural features are removed, they shall be properly
recorded, and, if possible, stored for future study or reuse.
3. Standards for stabilization
A. Stabilization shall reestablish the structural stability of a property through the
reinforcement of load bearing members or by arresting material deterioration leading to
structural failure. Stabilization shall also reestablish weather resistant conditions for a
property.
B. Stabilization shall be accomplished in such a manner that it detracts as little as possible
from the property's appearance. When reinforcement is required to reestablish
structural stability, such work shall be concealed wherever possible so as not to intrude
upon or detract from the aesthetic and historical quality of the property, except where
concealment would result in the alteration or destruction of historically significant
material or spaces.
4. Standards for new construction
A. In considering whether to approve or disapprove an application for new construction on
a designated historic site or in a designated historic district, the Commission shall be
guided by standards of the Secretary of the Interior and the following visual
compatibility standards.
B. New construction need not replicate historic older buildings or structures, but may
reflect contemporary design standards so long as the design and construction is
compatible with surrounding historic structures. Building height, width, mass and
proportion affect the degree of compatibility between the old and the new.
(1) Site and Setting: A developer intending to utilize historic resource as a part of a
development must consider the context of the resource's original site by
honoring the original historic intention of the resource and integrating it
respectfully into the new development
(2) Building Height: Height should be visually compatible with adjacent buildings.
The apparent physical size, scale and height should relate to existing resources.
City of Paterson, Land Development Ordinance Administration and Enforcement
106
(3) Openings on Frontal Facades: The width and height of windows, doors, and
entries must harmonize in scale and proportion with the width and height of
windows, doors, and entries of buildings and structures of historic significance
in the surrounding environment.
(4) Relationship of Vacant Land to Buildings/Structures: The relationship of a
building or structure to the vacant land between and adjoining buildings or
structures should not violate the existing spatial relationship of historically
significant structures to the vacant land between said structural projects.
(5) Relationship of Major Exterior Building Materials: The major exterior building
materials on the facade of a building or on a structure should reflect the
predominant major building materials existent on the facades of historically
significant buildings and on structures in the surrounding environment.
(6) Roof Forms: The roof form and slope of a building or structure is a major
element in the visual image of the building. Therefore designers must take care
to honor the existing historic roof forms and slopes in consideration of new
construction so as not to violate the aesthetic harmony of the whole
streetscape.
(7) Continuity in Site Elements: site elements such as retaining walls, fences and
landscaping shall be aesthetically consistent with existing site elements in
adjacent historic structures.
(8) Scale of Buildings: Scale of buildings and structures shall be in scale with existing
adjacent buildings and structures.
(9) Signage: Signs which are out of keeping with the character of the existing
streetscape shall not be used. In addition to overall signage standards found
under Article V, additional signage standards for historic preservation review are
found under Article V, Section 500-8.6/E.
5. Standards for relocation
A. A permit to relocate a designated historic site or an improvement in a designated
historic district, must receive five (5) favorable votes, i.e., the majority of the
Commission membership.
B. In considering whether to approve or disapprove an application for a permit for the
relocation of a designated historic site or improvement in a designated historic district,
the Commission shall be guided by the following considerations:
(1) Whether the historic character and aesthetic interest in the building, structure
or object contributes to its present setting;
(2) Whether there are definite plans for the area to be vacated and what the effect
of those plans on the character of the surrounding area will be,
City of Paterson, Land Development Ordinance Administration and Enforcement
107
(3) Whether the building, structure, or object can be moved without significant
damage to its physical integrity; and
(4) Whether the proposed relocation area is compatible with the historical and
architectural character of the building, object or structure.
C. Additional Requirements. If the Commission has approved the relocation of a historic
site, the Commission may also require archaeological and architectural documentation
and / or monitoring of either or both of the existing site and the new site where the
building is to be moved as a condition for approval. Copies of all professional reports
generated from these activities will be filed with the Commission, the City of Paterson
Free Public Library and the Passaic County Historical Society. The scope of services for
such a report will be determined by the Commission in consultation with its staff and
other qualified consultants.
6. Standards for demolition
A. A permit to demolish a designated historic site or an improvement in a designated
historic district must receive five (5) favorable votes, i.e., the majority of the
Commission membership.
B. In considering whether to approve or disapprove an application for a permit to demolish
a designated historic site or an improvement in a designated historic district, the
Commission shall be guided by the following considerations:
(1) Its historic architectural and aesthetic significance;
(2) Its use;
(3) Its importance to the City and the extent to which its historic or architectural
value is such that its removal would be detrimental to the public interest;
(4) The extent to which it is of such old, unusual or uncommon design,
craftsmanship, texture or material that it could not be reproduced or could be
reproduced only with great difficulty;
(5) The probable impact of its removal upon the ambience of the historic district;
(6) The structural soundness and integrity of the building so as to comply with the
requirements of the State Uniform Construction Code;
(7) The effect on the remaining portion of building, structure, site, object or
landscape feature in cases of partial demolition.
(8) In the event that a structure is unsafe or unsound so as to pose a danger to
health or safety, the Emergency Powers section of this Section shall be used.
(9) If an application to demolish is denied, and the applicant desires to appeal the
decision, the applicant shall follow the appeal process detailed herein for denial
of a permit.
City of Paterson, Land Development Ordinance Administration and Enforcement
108
(10)In cases of questionable structural integrity or soundness, whether
opportunities for investigation and remediation have been pursued and
exhausted.
C. Additional Requirements. If the Commission has approved a demolition for a historic
site, the Commission may require archaeological and architectural documentation and /
or monitoring of the demolition as a condition for approval. Such activities shall be
compliant with cultural resource and archaeological practices required for compliance
with the NJ State Historic Preservation Office standards for data recovery and
documentation, and shall culminate in a professional report of all activities, including
mapping, inventory and disposition of cultural resources discovered or collected. Copies

necessary to prevent the destruction.
§300-14 PERFORMANCE AND MAINTENANCE GUARANTEES
§300-14.1 Performance Guarantees.
A. As condition of final site plan approval or prior to the recording of a final subdivision plat, the
applicant shall file with the City a performance guarantee sufficient in amount not to exceed one
hundred twenty percent (120%) of the cost of all required improvements or uncompleted
portions thereof as estimated by the City Engineer pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.4 for
improvements deemed necessary or appropriate, including streets, grading, pavement, gutters,
curbs, sidewalks, street lighting, shade trees, surveyors monuments, water mains, culverts,
storm sewers, sanitary sewers or other means of sewerage disposal, drainage structures,
erosion control and sedimentation control devices, and public improvements of open space and
in the case of site plans only, on-site improvements and landscaping. The City Engineer shall
prepare an itemized cost estimate of the improvements covered by the performance guarantee,
which itemized cost shall be appended to each performance guarantee posted by the obligor.
The City shall not require that more than ten percent (10%) of said guarantee shall be made in
cash. The form and sufficiency of the guarantee shall be subject to approval of the City Attorney.
Performance guarantees shall be expressly conditioned upon the developer's full compliance
City of Paterson, Land Development Ordinance Administration and Enforcement
112
with all City ordinances and regulations governing the installation of improvements and utilities
and faithful performance of the terms of any developer's agreement with the City.
B. The time allowed for installation of improvements may be extended by resolution of the City
Council. As a condition or as part of any such extension, the amount of any performance
guarantee shall be increased or reduced, as the case may be, to an amount not to exceed one
hundred twenty percent (120%) of the cost of the installation, as determined by the Municipal
Engineer according to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.4 as of the time of the passage of the resolution.
C. If the required improvements have not been installed or corrected in accordance with the
performance guarantee, the obligor and surety, if any, shall be liable thereon to the City for the
reasonable cost of the improvements not installed or corrected and, either prior to or after
receipt of the proceeds thereof, the city may complete such improvements. Such completion or
correction shall be subject to the public bidding requirements of the Local Public Contracts Law
(N.J.S.A. 40A:11-1 et seq.).
D. Approval of a reduction in the performance guarantee
1. Upon substantial completion of all required street improvements (except top course)
and appurtenant utility improvements and the connection of the same to the public
system, the obligor on the performance guarantee may request of the governing body,
in writing, by certified mail addressed in care of the City Clerk, that the City Engineer
prepare, in accordance with the itemized cost estimate prepared by the City Engineer
and appended to the performance guarantee, a list of all uncompleted and
unsatisfactorily completed improvements. If such a request is made, the obligor shall
send a copy of the request to the City Engineer. The request shall indicate which
improvements have been completed and which improvements remain uncompleted in
the judgment of the obligor. Thereupon, the City Engineer shall inspect all
improvements covered by the request and shall file a detailed list and report in writing,
with the governing body and shall also send a copy thereof to the obligor not later than
forty-five (45) days after receipt of the obligor's request.
2. The list prepared by the City Engineer shall state in detail with respect to each
improvement determined to be incomplete or unsatisfactory the nature and extent of
the incompleteness or the nature and extent of and remedy for the unsatisfactory state
of each completed improvement determined to be unsatisfactory. The report prepared
by the City Engineer shall identify each improvement determined to be complete and
satisfactory together with a recommendation as to the amount of reduction to be made
in the performance guarantee relating to the completed and satisfactory improvement
in accordance with the itemized cost estimate prepared by the City Engineer and
appended to the performance guarantee.
E. Approval of complete and satisfactory improvements.
1. The City Council, by resolution, shall either approve the improvements determined to be
complete and satisfactory by the City Engineer or reject any of these improvements and
City of Paterson, Land Development Ordinance Administration and Enforcement
113
shall approve and authorize the amount of reduction to be made in the performance
guarantee relating to the improvements accepted, in accordance with the itemized cost
estimate prepared by the City Engineer and appended to the performance guarantee.
This resolution shall be adopted not later than forty-five (45) days after receipt of the
list and report prepared by the City Engineer. Upon adoption of the resolution by the
City Council, the obligor shall be released from all liability pursuant to its performance
guarantee with respect to those approved improvements except for that portion
adequately sufficient to secure completion or correction of the improvements not yet
approved, provided that thirty percent (30%) of the amount of the performance
guarantee posted may be retained to ensure completion and acceptability of all
improvements. For the purpose of releasing the obligor from liability pursuant to its
performance guarantee, the amount of the performance guarantee attributable to each
approved improvement shall be reduced by the total amount for each such
improvement, in accordance with the itemized cost estimate prepared by the municipal
engineer and appended to the performance guarantee pursuant to subsection a. of this
section, including any contingency factor applied to the cost of installation. If the sum of
the approved improvements would exceed 70 percent of the total amount of the
performance guarantee, then the municipality may retain 30 percent of the amount of
the total performance guarantee to ensure completion and acceptability of all
improvements, as provided above.
2. If the City Engineer fails to send or provide the list and report as requested by the
obligor within forty-five (45) days from receipt of the request, the obligor may apply to a
court in a summary manner for an order compelling the City Engineer to provide the list
and report within a stated time. If the city fails to approve or reject the improvements
determined by the Municipal Engineer to be complete and satisfactory or reduce the
performance guarantee for the complete and satisfactory improvements within fortyfive
(45) days from the receipt of the City Engineer's list and report, the obligor may
apply to the court in a summary manner for an order compelling, within a stated time,
approval of the complete and satisfactory improvements and approval of a reduction in
the performance guarantee for the approvable complete and satisfactory improvements
in accordance with the itemized cost estimate prepared by the City Engineer and
appended to the performance guarantee.
3. In the event that the obligor has made a cash deposit with the city or approving agency
as part of the performance guarantee, then any partial reduction granted in the
performance guarantee pursuant to this subsection shall be applied to the cash deposit
in the same proportion as the original cash deposit bears to the full amount of the
performance guarantee.
F. If any portion of the required improvements is rejected, the approving agency may require the
obligor to complete or correct such improvements and, upon completion or correction, the
same procedure of notification, as set forth in this section, shall be followed.
City of Paterson, Land Development Ordinance Administration and Enforcement
114
G. To the extent that any of the improvements have been dedicated to the City on the subdivision
plat or site plan, the City Council shall be deemed upon the release of any performance
guarantee required, to accept dedication for public use of streets or roads and any other
improvements made thereon according to site plans and subdivisions plats approved by the
Board, provided that such improvements have been inspected and have received final approval
by the City Engineer.
§300-14.2 Maintenance Guarantees.
A. As condition of final site plan approval or prior to the recording of a final subdivision plat, the
applicant shall post a maintenance guarantee with the City Council for a period not to exceed
two (2) years after final acceptance of the improvements, in an amount not to exceed fifteen
percent (15%) of the cost of the improvements, which cost shall be determined by the Municipal
Engineer according to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.4.
B. The form and sufficiency of the maintenance guarantee shall be approved by the City Attorney.
The maintenance guarantee for an improvement shall be posted upon final release by the City
Council of the performance guarantee for that improvement and shall be expressly conditioned
upon the maintenance by the developer of such improvement for a period of two (2) years, and
particularly shall guarantee the remedy of any defects in such improvement which occur during
that period.
§300-14.3 Development in Stages
In the event that final approval is by stages or sections of development, the provisions of this section
shall be applied by stage or section.
§300-14.4 Utilities or Improvements of Other Governmental Agencies or Public Utilities
In the event that other governmental agencies or public utilities will automatically own the utilities to be
installed or the improvements are covered by a performance or maintenance guarantee to another
governmental agency, no performance or maintenance guarantee, as the case may be, shall be required
by the City.
§300-14.5 Acceptance of Guarantee
The City Council shall accept a performance guarantee or maintenance guarantee which is an
irrevocable letter of credit if it:
City of Paterson, Land Development Ordinance Administration and Enforcement
115

ARTICLE IV DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS AND DESIGN STANDARDS
§400-1 PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY
A. This Article is intended to encourage future development in the City that contributes in a
positive manner to the character of the City's built environment. The development design
standards contained in this Article supplement the minimum zoning requirements (e.g., use,
building setback, building mass, lot coverage, etc.) set forth in Article V, Zoning, in that they
address the appearance, character, layout and design of future development in a more detailed
manner than is addressed by minimum zoning requirements. The standards are intended to
result in better designed and more attractive development in the City; to provide applicants a
better understanding of acceptable design in the City; and to provide the City's land use review
boards (Planning Board or Zoning Board of Adjustment) with an objective set of standards upon
which to review the appearance, design and site layout of future development proposals.
B. Development proposals shall follow the development design standards contained in this Article
to the greatest extent possible. The reviewing board shall review all development proposals
against these development design standards to ensure compliance therewith. Deviations from
requirements of this Article shall be permitted via design waiver granted by the reviewing
board.
C. Where applicable, the Residential Site Improvement Standards, as amended from time to time,
shall apply.
§400-2 DESIGN STANDARDS
§400-2.1 General Residential Design Standards.
A. The design and layout of buildings shall provide an aesthetically pleasing design that is
compatible with the character of surrounding development, unless the existing pattern is
contrary to other standards in this Article. To the extent possible, new residential development
within an existing neighborhood shall be consistent and compatible with the housing units in the
adjacent area in terms of building proportions and mass, building height, building materials and
color, roof designs, porch design, entrance design, window design and placement, and
architectural style. New development within existing neighborhoods shall incorporate any
distinctive architectural characteristics of the neighborhood.
B. A clear and attractive architectural design theme shall be established and shall be continued
throughout the development. Groups of related buildings shall be designed to present a
harmonious appearance in terms of building silhouette, architectural style and scale; massing of
building form; surface material, finish and texture; decorative features; window and doorway
proportions, entry way placement and location, signage and landscaping.
C. Infill development shall continue the prevailing site layout of properties in the surrounding
neighborhood unless the existing pattern (e.g., parking in the front yard) is contrary to other
City of Paterson, Land Development Ordinance Development Requirements and Design Standards
117
standards in this Article. For example, infill development shall follow the existing pattern of
parking lot locations (e.g., parking to the rear of the building) that is characteristic of the
neighborhood.
D. All additions, alterations and accessory buildings shall be compatible with the principal structure
in terms of design and material and shall share a common architectural theme.
E. All buildings shall be designed so as to have attractive, finished appearances visible from all
public spaces and streets. Where sides and rear of a building would be visible from a public
space or street, such side and rear elevations shall present a finished and attractive architectural
appearance. Such rear and side elevations shall incorporate the design theme and architectural
features (e.g., windows, siding, shutters and other facade treatment) of the primary or front
facade. Such sidewalls shall have consistent proportion of openings (doors and windows) to
solid wall as the front and rear walls. However, to the extent possible, the front of buildings (i.e.,
the side that offers the primary access into the building) shall face the street. Positioning
buildings so that the side or rear of buildings are oriented towards the street shall be
discouraged.
F. Monotonous uninterrupted expanses of walls shall be avoided. Recesses, projections, columns,
openings, ornamentation materials and colors shall be used as texture and detail.
G. Buildings shall be set back from the street in a manner that is consistent with that existing in the
area. For example, large setbacks that are inconsistent with the existing street wall shall be
avoided.
H. Building entries, porches, windows and other openings shall be compatible in location, scale and
pattern to other structures on the street.
I. A clear differentiation of public-vs-private space shall be encouraged along the street line. The
use of low decorative steel, tubular steel, wrought iron or brick fencing shall be encouraged to
accomplish this. The use of chain-link, board-on-board or other such unattractive and/or solid
fencing shall not be encouraged. As required in Article V, no fencing in the front yard shall
exceed 4 feet in height.
J. Entries shall be well-defined and visible from the road, right-of-way or parking area serving the
building. All entryways shall be properly illuminated so as to provide appropriate security, and to
allow easy identification of each individual unit address.
K. Fences or walls enclosing individually owned or controlled outdoor space shall be consistent
throughout the development and shall compliment the architecture and design of the buildings.
L. Mechanical equipment whether mounted on the roof or ground shall be screened from view. All
screening devices shall be compatible with the architecture and color of the structures. If roof
mounted, mechanical equipment shall be located below the highest vertical element of the
building where feasible.
M. Window security grates shall be as inconspicuous and as complementary to the facade as
possible and shall be encouraged only on first floor windows.
City of Paterson, Land Development Ordinance Development Requirements and Design Standards
118
N. The types and arrangements of units shall be varied to allow the maximum range of building
configurations within the development. Not more than 1/3 of the buildings shall have identical
floor plans.
O. Fire escapes shall be constructed only against the side or rear wall of a building and shall be
located and/or screened so as not to distract from the appearance of such buildings.
P. No more than 50% of the first floor facade that is facing the street shall be devoted to garages
or carports. Where garages must be located facing streets, they shall be minimized by recessing
the garage entrance within the building facade or through the use of other architectural
techniques to make the garage entrance less conspicuous.
Q. All roofs on principal buildings in association with one, two-story, multi-family, garden
apartment and townhouse developments shall be pitched. Flat roofs shall not be permitted.
Roof design shall be consistent with that exhibited in the existing block or neighborhood where
appropriate. Roof design shall be an integral part of the overall building design. Hipped or
gabled roofs are encouraged with roof slopes comparable to surrounding structures.
R. To the extent feasible, off-street parking shall be placed to the rear and/or side of buildings.
However, where conditions dictate otherwise or where the reviewing board determines that
parking in the front yard would be appropriate, off-street parking and/or interior drives
associated therewith may be placed in a required front yard provided that such parking and/or
interior drives is separated from the front line street distance of 3 feet and screened from the
street by a solid natural screen, high decorative wall, or combination thereof, at least 2 feet but
no more than 4 feet in height. As required in Article V, off-street parking areas in association
with one and two family dwellings shall not be permitted in the required front yard.
S. Private outdoor space in the front yard shall be fenced or otherwise separated from public
space. The use of decorative steel, tubular steel, wrought iron or brick fences shall be
encouraged in lieu of standard chain-link or board-on-board fencing in front yards.
T. Where entire or significant portions of blocks are being redeveloped, or where elsewhere
feasible, shared parking and the use of alleys for access to off-street parking spaces and/or
garages shall be pursued.
U. Trash containers and outdoor storage areas shall be screened from public streets, pedestrian
areas and neighboring properties. The screen shall be designed to be compatible with the
architectural character of the development and shall be constructed as durable material and
shall have solid walls and doors.
V. To the extent possible, all public utilities and related facilities shall be located underground. In
such event that they cannot be installed underground, facilities such as pumping stations or
transformers shall be enclosed in buildings or effectively screened with an evergreen hedge
and/or fencing as approved by the Board.
W. Exposed concrete block (cinder block) or other such masonry units shall not be permitted as an
exposed surface in residential zones. Split face, ribbed, scored and glazed masonry units, or an
City of Paterson, Land Development Ordinance Development Requirements and Design Standards
119
approved equal, with integral color, are permitted. Nothing in this section shall be construed as
to limiting brick, brick face, stone or other similar materials.
X. Plumbing vents, dryer vents, rooftop vents and all other protrusions shall be finished, coated or
painted to blend in with the general color of the roof and/or siding as the case may be.
Y. Provisions shall be made for stormwater drainage, sanitary sewage and utilities. All such
installations shall be connected with an approved system and shall be adequate for all present
and probable future development and shall be made according to the standard requirements
and specifications of the city.
Z. Residential development shall also comply with the applicable design standards (e.g., off-street
parking, landscaping, lighting, signage, etc.) enumerated below.
§400-2.2 General Non-Residential Design Standards.
A. Unless the existing pattern in the surrounding area is contrary to other standards in this Article,
the design and layout of buildings shall provide an aesthetically pleasing design that is
compatible with the character of surrounding development. To the extent possible, new
commercial development within an existing commercial area shall be consistent and compatible
with buildings in the adjacent area in terms of building setbacks, building mass, building height,
building materials and color, roof designs, entrance design, window design and placement, and
architectural style. New development within existing commercial areas shall incorporate any
architectural characteristic distinctive of the area.
B. Infill development shall continue the prevailing site layout of properties (e.g., building
placement, parking lot placement) in the surrounding area unless the existing pattern is contrary
to other standards in this Article (e.g., buildings setback a distance from the street with parking
in front yard along the street).
C. The architectural design of non-residential uses shall, to the maximum extent possible, avoid the
appearance of clutter by integrating mechanical, electrical, storage structures, loading facilities,
chimneys, smokestacks, etc., into the general architectural concept for the site.
D. Non-residential developments consisting of two (2) or more buildings, whether individually
owned or owned by separate entities, shall maintain a consistent design theme including
building silhouette, architectural style and scale; massing of building form; surface material,
finish and texture; decorative features; window and doorway proportions, entry way placement
and location, signage and landscaping) throughout the development. Within this overall design
theme, individual buildings may be differentiated by size, shape, detailing and fenestration.
E. Buildings shall be designed so as to have attractive, finished appearances from all public spaces
and streets. Where sides and rear of a building would be visible from a public space or street,
such side and rear elevations shall present a finished and attractive architectural appearance.
Such rear and side elevations shall incorporate the architectural features of the primary or front
facade.
City of Paterson, Land Development Ordinance Development Requirements and Design Standards
120
F. Blank walls shall be avoided. Facade articulations such as windows, trellises, recesses, arcades,
openings, ornamentation, changes of material, landscaping and/or other such features shall be
used to lessen the impact of blank walls.
G. All rooftop equipment shall be screened from view by materials of the same nature as the main
structure. If feasible, mechanical equipment shall be located below the highest vertical element
of the building.
H. All additions, alterations and accessory buildings shall be compatible with the principal structure
and design and material and shall share a common architectural theme.
I. In commercial structures, at least 50 percent of the ground floor facade area shall be fully or
partially transparent for visibility from the sidewalk, with at least 30% fully transparent glass. On
corner lots, the secondary storefront facade shall be consistent with the alignment, location and
amount of glazing of the primary storefront window facade.
J. Building entrances shall be clearly defined and highly visible. Primary access to buildings shall be
from the front, facing the street. Where necessary and appropriate, the rear and/or side of the
building shall be enhanced to provide public access from parking lots and service alleys.
K. Where entire or significant portions of blocks are being redeveloped, or where elsewhere
feasible, shared parking shall be pursued.
L. In developments providing loading areas, service and loading areas shall be separated from
main circulation and parking areas and away from public streets.
M. Window security gates shall be encouraged to be placed on the inside of the entrance door and
display window panels. Window security gates shall be of open mesh design except the lowest 1
foot which may be of solid design and shall be as inconspicuous and as complementary to the
facade as possible. The use of decorative designs in store front security gates shall be
encouraged.
N. Fire escapes shall be constructed only against the side of the rear wall of the building and shall
be located and/or screened so as not to distract from the appearance of such buildings.
O. All public utilities and related facilities shall be located underground. In such event that they
cannot be installed underground, facilities such as pumping stations or transformers shall be
enclosed in buildings or effectively screened with an evergreen hedge and/or fencing as
approved by the Board.

§500-2 ZONING DISTRICT REGULATIONS
§500-2.1 Purpose and Intent of Zoning Districts.
In addition to the general purposes of this Ordinance as set forth in §100-2, the following specific intent
for the establishment of each of the City's zoning districts are set forth below:
A. R-1 One Family Residential District: The intent of the R-1 One Family Residential District is to
provide for low-density single-family residential development, together with other uses such as
places of worship, recreational facilities, schools and other such permitted uses that are typically
located in residential neighborhoods. Certain accessory uses that are customarily incidental to
single-family residences and that are compatible with low density residential surroundings are
permitted as well.. All other uses, including higher density residential uses (i.e., townhouses,
two family dwellings and all multi-family dwellings), and business, industrial and other nonresidential
uses are strictly prohibited. No new construction of such prohibited land uses, nor
conversion of residential dwellings into such prohibited land uses, is permitted to occur with the
R-1 District. In-fill development consisting of single-family homes and/or other permitted uses
that preserve the low-rise and low-density character of the existing neighborhood is
encouraged.
B. R-2 Low Medium Density Residential District: The intent of the R-2 Low Medium Density
Residential District is to permit single and two family dwellings at the low to medium densities
permitted in the district, together with such uses as places of worship, recreational facilities,
schools and other such permitted uses that are typically located in residential neighborhoods.
Certain accessory uses that are customarily incidental to one and two-family residences and that
are compatible with low to medium density residential surroundings are permitted as well. It is
the further intent of this district to preserve the existing neighborhood character and the quality
of the physical environment in these areas of the City. In keeping with this intent, higher density
residential uses (i.e., townhouses and all kinds of multiple-family dwellings), as well as business,
industrial and other non-residential uses are strictly prohibited. No new construction of such
prohibited land uses, nor conversion of residential dwellings into such prohibited land uses, is
City of Paterson, Zoning Ordinance Chapter 500 Zoning
136
permitted to occur with the R-2 District. In fill development consisting of single-family homes,
two-family homes and/or other permitted uses that preserve the existing density, pattern, scale,
and building height of the existing neighborhood is encouraged.
C. R-3 High Medium Density Residential District: The R-3 High Medium Density Residential District
is designed to permit more intensive residential use of land than permitted in the R-1 and R-2
Districts, with various types of dwellings being permitted, including townhouses, garden
apartment developments and low rise apartment buildings. Population is maintained in the
medium range, while building height is kept low enough to be generally compatible with oneand
two-family residential development (i.e., high-rise apartment building are strictly
prohibited). Certain low-intensity, nonresidential uses that are not permitted in the lower
density residential districts, but that are appropriately located in higher density residential area
(e.g., funeral homes, long term care facilities, and small scale professional offices) are permitted
in the R-3 District. In addition, neighborhood retail and personal service uses that are located on
corner lots along major roads are permitted in order to serve the needs of the surrounding
neighborhoods. However, all other business, industrial and other non-residential uses are
strictly prohibited from this district. No new construction of such prohibited land uses, nor
conversion of existing buildings into such prohibited land uses, is permitted to occur with the R-
3 District. In-fill development consisting of the permitted residential and non-residential uses
and that preserve the character, density and scale of the existing neighborhood is encouraged.
D. R-4 High Density Residential District: The R-4 High Density Residential District is designed to
permit high-rise apartment buildings as well as the residential uses permitted in the R-3 District.
Various types and sizes of residential accommodations, for ownership or rental, would thereby
be provided to meet the needs of the different age and family groups in the City. This district
should be located near major thoroughfares for good accessibility. Like the R-3 District, certain
low-intensity, non-residential uses that are not permitted in the lower density residential
districts, but that are appropriately located in higher density residential area (e.g., funeral
homes, long-term care facilities, and small-scale professional offices) are permitted in the R-4
District. However, all other business, industrial and other non-residential uses are strictly
prohibited. No new construction of such prohibited land uses, nor conversion of existing
buildings into such prohibited land uses, is permitted to occur with the R-4 District. However, infill
development consisting of the permitted residential and non-residential uses that preserves
and/or improves the character, density and scale of existing development is encouraged.
E. B-1 Neighborhood Business District: The intent of the B-1 Neighborhood Business District is to
provide low-intensity, neighborhood scale retail and personal service businesses that supply the
everyday needs of residents in immediately surrounding neighborhoods. The district permits
operations that provide a convenience to area residents, such as neighborhood-scale food
stores, personal service businesses, delicatessens, pharmacies and similar retail establishments
designed to sell goods to patrons primarily residing in immediately surrounding neighborhoods,
as opposed to larger-scale businesses and industrial uses that are prohibited in this district, in
order to maintain a neighborhood atmosphere and prevent traffic congestion.
City of Paterson, Zoning Ordinance Chapter 500 Zoning
137
F. B-2 Community Business District: The intent of the B-2 Community Business District is to provide
sufficient space in appropriate locations for a wide variety of commercial and service activities,
serving a wider area than the B-1 District. The district is intended to consist primarily of
businesses involved in the rendering of services or selling of goods or merchandise primarily
oriented towards residents of the City of Paterson as a whole (i.e., generally larger scale and
more specialized retail establishments than permitted in the B-1 District such as auto supply
stores, book stores, clothing and shoe stores, sporting goods stores and supermarkets), as well
as other commercial uses that are not permitted in the B-1 District, including gasoline filling
stations, automobile repair, hotels and motels, car washes and drive-through restaurants.
However, more intensive and larger scale commercial uses (e.g., motor vehicle sales
establishments, boat and marine showrooms and sales, building supply stores and home
maintenance supply centers), businesses that are primarily involved in the rendering of sales or
service to other businesses (e.g., business services and wholesale establishments), as well as
warehousing and light industrial uses are not permitted in the B-2 District. This district is located
normally at the conveyance of or along major thoroughfares where a general mixture of
commercial and service activity now exists, but which uses are not characterized by extensive
warehousing or frequent heavy truck activity.
G. B-3 General Business District: The intent of the B-3 General Business District is to provide a
wider and more intensive range of business and service activities than permitted in the B-1 and
B-2 districts. The permitted uses would generate larger volumes of vehicular traffic, would need
more off-street parking and loading, and would require more planning to integrate such districts
with adjacent residential areas. Commercial uses engaged in the selling of goods, merchandise
or services to patrons from a wider region (e.g., boat and marine showrooms and sales, building
supply stores and home maintenance supply centers) are permitted in the B-3 District, as are
motor vehicle sales establishments and businesses that are primarily involved in the rendering
of sales or service to other businesses (e.g., business services and wholesale establishments).
However, with the exception of indoor warehousing, industrial uses are prohibited from this
district. Since the district is intended to encourage economic development and since the
intensity and types of land uses permitted in the B-3 District are not as compatible with
residential areas as the preceding commercial zones, residential uses are prohibited from the B-
3 District (with the exception of apartments above stores and artist live-work quarters).
H. B-4 Central Business District: The purpose of this district is to foster the development of a
vibrant, pedestrian-friendly, and accessible downtown that is the center of commerce and civic
activity. The Central Business District is intended to function as a local and regional destination
for business, retail, education, governmental services, entertainment, and transportation. The B-
4 Central Business District is intended to encompass the retail, service, educational,
governmental and office core of the City's historic downtown area, and permits a wide variety of
such uses in a high intensity urban context. Uses that are not consistent with the intent of the
Central Business District (e.g., industrial uses, warehousing, low density residential
development) are prohibited. However, infill development and redevelopment consisting of
uses permitted in the district, that are consistent with the intended character, density and scale
City of Paterson, Zoning Ordinance Chapter 500 Zoning
138
of development, and that otherwise add to the Central Business District's role as a local and
regional destination for business, retail, education, governmental services, entertainment, and
transportation are encouraged. The B-4 district includes the designated Downtown Commercial
Historic District within its boundaries as well.
I. MU Mixed Use District: The MU Mixed Use District is intended to permit a mixture of
commercial and industrial uses in appropriate locations in accordance with the City's Master
Plan. This district is intended to create an environment for effective integration and mutual
support among the nonresidential activities and to promote more viable economic development
and higher land values. Further development of residences is prohibited in this district to
protect homes from the adverse effects of the light industrial and intensive commercial uses
permitted in the district and to conserve the supply of land for such uses.
J. I-1 Light Industrial District: The intent of the I-1 Light Industrial District is to provide for a wide
variety of light manufacturing, fabricating, processing, wholesale, distribution and warehousing
uses in a setting conducive to public health, economic stability and growth, and protection from
blight and nonindustrial encroachment. The regulations are designed to permit operations in a
clean and quiet manner and to protect adjacent district uses and industries within the district.
Further development of residences is prohibited in this district to protect homes from the
adverse effects of industries and to conserve the supply of industrial land for industrial uses.
Further, in order to avoid bringing the general public into the district, to protect commercial
establishments from the adverse effects of industry and to conserve the supply of land for
industrial uses, most commercial uses are prohibited from the I-1 District.
K. I-2 Heavy Industrial District: The intent of the I-2 Heavy Industrial District is to provide land for
more intense types of industrial and manufacturing uses excluding those with nuisance
characteristics. While the mapping of this district unavoidably includes some residential
buildings, future construction of dwellings in such districts is prohibited in order to protect
homes from the adverse effects of industries and to conserve the supply of industrial land for
industrial uses. Further, in order to avoid bringing the general public into the district and in
order to protect commercial establishments from the adverse effects of industry, most
commercial uses are prohibited from the I-2 District.
L. GFHD Great Fall Historic District: The intent of the GFHD Great Falls Historic District is to
safeguard the heritage and history of the City of Paterson by preserving the cultural, social,
economic, and architectural elements of this historic area of the City; to maintain and develop
an appropriate and harmonious setting for the architecturally and historically significant
buildings, structures and places in the City; to improve property values and strengthen the City's
economy; to foster civic beauty and appreciation for the City's heritage; and to promote the use
of historically and architecturally significant sites primarily for the education, pleasure and
general enhancement of the citizens of Paterson and its visitors. The District was created to stop
the demolition of the historic mill buildings in the area and to highlight elements of Paterson's
industrial past and encourage rehabilitation. The Great Falls Historic District still has numerous
attractive mill buildings that could be converted to market rate housing that attract a variety of
City of Paterson, Zoning Ordinance Chapter 500 Zoning
139
income groups to the area special emphasis should be made for market rate housing in this area
(in addition to existing income-regulated housing). In addition, the District encourages
restaurants, stores and other uses and attractions that highlight the natural resource of the
Great Falls, the architectural and historic character of the area and that encourage more tourism
and activity in the area. Specific design requirements are intended to preserve the architectural
integrity of the buildings and layout.
M. H-1 Hospital Zone-1: The H-1 Hospital Zone-1 is specifically designed to meet the needs of the
hospital for future expansion. In this zone, the existing land use types of one and two family
homes are permitted uses and the existing hospital, its expansion and related medical uses to
support a public purpose institution, are permitted by conditional use/site plan approval
procedures. Under this zoning, the existing R-2, one and two-family residential character is
retained and reinforced while encouraging the orderly development or land uses which support
the hospital in rendering an important institutional service under specific conditions and
requirements designed to be harmonious with the existing physical character. The boundaries of
the zoning district have been drawn to allow the reasonable future expansion of the hospital
and the development of related medical uses around the hospital. Any future expansion or
development of such uses should therefore be conducted within the confines of the hospital
zone, not within adjoining residential d istricts.
N. PUID Planned Unit Industrial Development District: The PUID Planned Unit Industrial
Development District is intended to encourage the development of industrial acreage under an
overall development plan, to encourage imagination and innovation in such development
planning to the end that Paterson will have industrial areas offering a variety of structural types,
site arrangements with well integrated facilities and services. It is further intended to permit
greater flexibility in the design than would be required through the strict application of standard
zoning and subdivision regulations.
O. I-T Industrial Transition District: The intent of the IT Industrial Transition District is to provide
flexible and expanded opportunities for the future re-use and redevelopment of existing
industrial buildings and sites previously designated in the industrial zoning districts to promote
the transition of existing industrial areas which are in a state of decline or flux as a result of the
changes in the economic industrial base to a broader based, mixed use zoning district. Industrial
uses will be permitted to continue and expand, but other new non-industrial uses will be
permitted under certain conditions to allow the resurgence of formerly zoned industrial areas
into viable and vibrant areas through redevelopment and integrated design measures.
P. R/C-3 High Medium Density Mixed Use District: The R/C-3 District is intended to permit more
intensive residential use than the R-1 or R-2 districts while also allowing neighborhood retail and
professional offices in a mixed use setting. Neighborhood retail uses are allowed in this district
to serve the residents of the surrounding neighborhood. The R/C-3 District is designed to permit
these types of uses together in a scale that is consistent with the R-2 District.

visual effects of WTSFs and protect the natural features, historic character, and aesthetics of the City by
careful siting, design, buffering and screening of WTSFs; limit the total number of WTSFs to be
constructed in the City to the minimum number of WTSFs necessary to provide adequate coverage
within the City; maximize the use of any proposed site by encouraging co-location and multiple use of
WTSFs to the extent reasonably permissible; encourage the siting of WTSFs on existing or other planned
or approved WTSFs; encourage the use of alternative technologies that eliminate the need for new or
additional WTSFs in the City; and, limit new WTSFs to existing nonresidential buildings and areas zoned
for industrial uses where the siting of a WTSF within the City is proven to be necessary.
City of Paterson, Zoning Ordinance Chapter 500 Zoning
181
The following standards and requirements shall apply to all WTSFs. All applications for a WTSF shall be
accompanied by such written narratives, visual analyses, technical reports, site plans and other
materials as determined necessary by the Board having jurisdiction (the Board) in order to demonstrate
that the WTSF would fulfill all of the purposes and meets all of the requirements of this section. No
conditional use approval shall be granted unless the Board makes the findings in writing that the
application fulfills all of the purposes and meets all of the requirements of this section.
A. Use. Except as provided hereinafter, no WTSF shall be located, constructed or maintained on
any building, structure or land area in the City of Paterson, except in conformity with the
requirements of this section and all other applicable regulations. Any alteration of an existing

B. Demonstration of Need and Master Plan. The operator(s) of the wireless telecommunication
service shall submit a copy of their Federal Communications Commission (FCC) license and shall
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Board that there is a public need for each such WTSF at
the location(s) proposed by the Applicant to provide adequate coverage in the City of Paterson.
The Board may hire a qualified professional or recognized authority to review and report on the
information and conclusions contained in the application materials, the cost of which shall be
reimbursed by the Applicant. Such demonstration shall include the preparation of existing
coverage and gap plans and a master plan of proposed service that:
1. Consist of multi-color signal level propagation plots at not less than 5 dBm intervals to -
100 dBm at standard USGS scaled drawings, including information such as, but not
limited to, topography and elevations, existing buildings, streets, existing WTSFs and
other similarly tall structures, tile propagation plots, radial propagation plots and drive
propagation plot data, and identification of all of the relevant system design parameters
of all existing, approved or proposed WTSFs which may affect or provide service within
the City. Separate signal level propagation plots shall be required for each existing,
planned, approved and proposed WTSF; and
2. Demonstrate that existing, or other planned or approved WTSFs, do not and cannot be
modified to provide adequate coverage to the City; and
3. Minimize the number of such WTSFs within the City; and
4. Maximize co-location and shared use of existing public utility and WTSFs; and
5. Identify all existing and proposed WTSFs that impact the service area covering the City
and that identify all proposed and other locations considered for such WTSF; and
6. Analyze feasible alternatives, including alternative sites, construction and transmission
technologies, to reasonably minimize the visual and other adverse impacts.
C. Location and Access. WTSFs shall be located in accordance with the following order of

priority location before considering the next lower priority and shall demonstrate such analyses
to the satisfaction of the reviewing board:
City of Paterson, Zoning Ordinance Chapter 500 Zoning
182
1. Co-location on an existing or other planned or approved WTSFs within an Industrial
District, PUID or MU District that eliminates the need for new or additional WTSFs in the
City.

MU District.
3. Construction of a new monopole tower within an Industrial District, PUID or MU District.
4. Co-location on an existing or other planned or approved WTSFs within a Business or
Hospital District that eliminates the need for new or additional WTSFs in the City.
5. Placement of new WTSF on an existing structure within a Business or Hospital District.
6. Construction of a new monopole tower within a Business or Hospital District.
7. Co-location on an existing or other planned or approved WTSFs within a R-3 or R-4
District that eliminates the need for new or additional WTSFs in the City.
8. Placement of new WTSF on an existing structure within a R-3 or R-4 District.
9. Construction of a new monopole tower within a R-3 or R-4 District.
10. Co-location on an existing or other planned or approved WTSFs within 2,000 feet of a
public park, school or place of worship that eliminates the need for new or additional
WTSFs in the City.
11. Placement of new WTSF on an existing structure within 2,000 feet of a public park,
school or place of worship.
12. Construction of a new monopole tower within 2,000 feet of a public park, school or
place of worship.
In reviewing a particular application for a WTSF, the Board may require placement at a lower priority
location if it determines that the location, design and appearance of the WTSF at such location would
protect and preserve the aesthetic qualities and residential characteristics of the City of Paterson, the
safety and welfare of its citizens, and would otherwise further the intent and purpose of this section to
the same or greater degree than placement of the WTSF at a higher priority location. However, wireless
telecommunication service facilities shall in no circumstance be permitted in a R-1, R-2 District or in the
Great Falls Historic District.
D. Co-Location Requirements.
1. Any application for a WTSF shall include a statement and appropriate documentation
demonstrating to the satisfaction of the Board that to the extent relevant to provide
wireless telecommunication service (WTS) in the City that is the subject of such
application, all reasonable efforts have been made to co locate such WTSF on all other
existing, planned or approved sites with communication antennas which would
eliminate the need for new or additional WTSFs in the City. A proposal for a WTSF shall
not be approved unless the Board finds that the antenna planned for the proposed
WTSF cannot be accommodated on an existing or approved WTSF or a structure within a
City of Paterson, Zoning Ordinance Chapter 500 Zoning
183
1.5-mile search radius of the proposed WTSF due to one or more of the following
reasons:
a. The antenna would exceed the structural capacity of the existing or approved
WTSF or structure, as certified by a licensed professional engineer, and the
existing or approved WTSF or structure cannot be reinforced, modified, or
replaced to accommodate the planned or equivalent antenna at a reasonable
cost.
b. The antenna would cause interference materially impacting the function of
other existing or approved antenna at the WTSF or structure as certified by a
qualified professional or other recognized authority and the interference cannot
be prevented at a reasonable cost.
c. Existing or approved WTSFs and structures within the 1.5-mile search radius
cannot accommodate the antenna at a height necessary to function reasonably
or to provide adequate coverage to the intended service area as certified by a
qualified professional or other recognized authority.
d. Other reasons that make it infeasible to locate the antenna upon an existing or
approved WTSF or structure.
2. All WTSFs shall be designed, structurally, electrically, and in all respects, to
accommodate both the applicant's antennas and base equipment and comparable
antennas and base equipment for at least four (4) additional licensed carriers. WTSFs
must be designed to allow for future rearrangement of antennas upon the WTSF and to
accept antennas mounted at varying heights. The Board may reduce the number of
licensed carriers required to be accommodated for just cause and consistent with the
purposes of this section and the Zoning Ordinance.
3. As a condition of conditional use approval, the applicant shall be required to provide a
written agreement, in recordable form, and prepared to the satisfaction of the Board
Attorney, acknowledging that the applicant, and its successors in interest, shall be
required to allow the co- location of all other future wireless telecommunication service
WTSFs unless otherwise unreasonably limited by technological, structural or other
engineering considerations and expressly stating that it shall negotiate in good faith for
shared use of the proposed WTSF by other WTS providers in the future. The issuance of
any approval for a WTSF, shall commit the new WTSF owner and its successors in
interest to:
a. Respond in a timely comprehensive manner to a request for information from a
potential shared-use applicant.
b. Negotiate in good faith concerning future requests for shared use of the WTSF
by other WTS providers.
c. Allow shared use of the new WTSF if another WTS provider agrees in writing to
pay charges.
City of Paterson, Zoning Ordinance Chapter 500 Zoning
184
d. Relocate antennas on the WTSF as necessary to accommodate co-location of
additional licensed service providers, to provide adequate coverage, or to
minimize the height or other avoidable impacts of the WTSF.
E. Setbacks. Unless otherwise modified by the Board in an effort to accommodate the purposes of
this Section, free-standing WTSFs shall be located not less than:
1. Two (2) times the otherwise applicable setback requirements for principal structures for
the district in which the property is located; or the height of the WTSF, whichever shall
be greater.
2. A WTSF's setback may be reduced by the Board to allow the integration of a WTSF into
an existing or proposed building or structure.
3. It shall be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Board that the proposed WTSF is set
back adequately to prevent damage or injury resulting from ice fall or debris resulting
from failure of a WTSF or any part thereof, and to avoid and minimize all other impacts
upon adjoining properties.
F. Height Limitations. Notwithstanding the following height limitations, in no case shall a WTSF
exceed the minimum height reasonably necessary to accomplish the purpose it is proposed to
serve.
1. The height of any antennas, or other associated equipment, structurally mounted as
part of a WTSF shall not exceed by more than fifteen (15) feet the highest point of the
existing structure on which such antennas or equipment are affixed.
2. The maximum height of free-standing WTSF is limited to 100 feet above the ground
upon which the antenna is placed. The ground elevation may not be raised to increase
the height of the WTSF.
3. Height limitations may be waived by the Board when the antenna is mounted on an
existing building or structure or to accommodate collocation.
G. Design and Visual Mitigation.
1. Unless otherwise permitted by the Board, WTSFs shall only be permitted on, in or
attached to existing or approved buildings or structures by use of stealth technologies,
(e.g., architecturally screened roof-mounted antennas, antennas integrated into
architectural elements, and WTSFs designed not to look like a conventional WTSF but
like something else existing in the community, such as light poles, power poles, flag
poles, and trees or materials).

mixed uses, uses with different parking requirements occupying the building or premises, or in
the case of the joint use of a building or premises by more than one use having the same parking
requirements, the parking spaces required shall equal the sum of the requirements of the
various uses computed separately, except that parking requirements for permitted accessory
retail and service uses and apartment buildings with 100 or more dwelling units or hotels, may
be reduced by the following percentages where it is found shared parking is likely to occur as a
result of patrons utilizing several of the uses comprising the development in a single visit or
where variations in peak demand for parking spaces would occur between different uses:
1. Retail sales, offices, service establishments: 50%
2. Restaurants and dining rooms: 60%
3. Ballroom, banquet hall, meeting rooms: 70%
E. "Land-Banking" of Parking Spaces. Where the Board reviewing a plan for development
determines, in connection with its review of such plan, that less than the required number of
parking or loading spaces will satisfy the intent of this chapter because of the unique nature of
the proposed use, variations in the probable time of maximum use by joint users or for any
other reason, the Board may waive or "landbank" the improvement of up to 1/3 of the total
number of spaces as required by this Chapter, subject to the following regulations:
1. Since this section does not reduce the number of required spaces (instead it allows the
reviewing board to allow less than the required number of spaces to be constructed), it
shall be demonstrated on the plan that sufficient area remains for the future provision
of the total number of spaces required. The site plan shall clearly indicate both that
portion of the parking area to be initially improved and that portion of the required
spaces proposed to be "land-banked."
2. The site plan shall provide for adequate drainage, lighting and landscaping of both the
initial and "land-banked" future parking areas.
3. The "land-banked" parking area shall be landscaped in accordance with this ordinance.
Such unimproved or "landbanked" spaces shall be maintained as additional landscaped
area until and unless required for parking or loading use.
4. Written guarantees, satisfactory to the Attorney to the Board having jurisdiction, shall
be submitted by the applicant, insuring the improvement of such spaces within six
months of the date of written notice to the property owner by the Board having
jurisdiction stating that all or a portion of such spaces have been determined to be
necessary and shall be constructed.
City of Paterson, Zoning Ordinance Chapter 500 Zoning
198
5. An application for site plan approval shall be required in the event there is a proposed
change of use that requires more total parking spaces than was required on the plan
involving the "landbanking" of parking spaces.
F. Parking, Storage and Other Use Restrictions.
1. A parking area shall not be used for the sale, repair, dismantling or servicing of any
vehicles, equipment, materials or supplies.
2. No major recreational equipment shall be parked or stored on any lot in a residential
district except in a carport or enclosed building or behind the nearest portion of a
building to a street, provided, however, that such equipment may be parked anywhere
on residential premises not to exceed 24 hours during loading or unloading. No such
equipment shall be used for living, sleeping, or housekeeping purposes when parked or
stored on a residential lot, or in any location not approved for such use. For purposes of

such equipment or not. No such recreational equipment shall be stored or parked within
any residential district other than that lot upon which the principal residence structure
of the owner of the recreational equipment is located. No such recreational equipment

not be parked or stored on any residentially used or zoned property other than in
completely enclosed buildings.
5. The rental or leasing of parking spaces within parking lots for non-residential uses shall
only be permitted when the site exceeds the off-street parking requirement for the site,
with the number of spaces that are rented or leased limited to the extra (i.e., over that
required for the site) number of parking spaces provided on the site.
G. Rental or Leasing of Parking Spaces in Residential Districts. The rental or leasing of accessory
parking spaces in the rear of a residentially zoned lot is permitted, provided that:
1. It is found by the Planning Board that such rental or leasing of parking spaces is essential
to the public interest as evidenced by a serious need for off-street parking facilities and
as being not detrimental to the surrounding neighborhood.
2. The spaces are in addition to those already provided to meet the off-street parking
requirements of the lot. The rental or leasing spaces shall equal more than 25 percent of
the required parking spaces for that lot, or not more than 2 spaces when located on a
one or two family lot.

§500-11 FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION
§500-11.1 Statutory Authorization
The legislature of the State of New Jersey in N.J.S.A. 40:48-1 et- seq. has delegated the responsibility to
local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the Municipal Council of the City of Paterson, New Jersey
does ordain as follows:
§500-11.2 Findings of Facts.
A. The flood hazard areas of Paterson are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life
and damage to property, health and safety hazards, disruption to commerce and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of
the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
City of Paterson, Zoning Ordinance Chapter 500 Zoning
217
B. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood
hazards that increase flood heights and velocities, and when inadequately anchored, damage
uses in other areas. Uses that are inadequately flood proofed, elevated or otherwise protected
from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss.
§500-11.3 Statement of Purpose.
It is the purpose of this Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by
provisions designed:
A. To protect human life and health.
B. To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects.
C. To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally
undertaken at the expense of the general public.
D. To minimize prolonged business interruptions.
E. To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric,
telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard.
F. To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the secondary use and development of areas
of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas.
G. To insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard.
H. To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard and who contribute to such
conditions assume responsibility for their actions.
§500-11.4 Method of Reducing Flood Losses.
In order to accomplish its purpose, this Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance includes methods and
provisions for:
A. Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water
or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or
velocities.
B. Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that serve such uses, be protected
against flood damage at the time of initial construction.
C. Controlling the alteration of natural flood plains, stream channels, and natural protective
barriers that help accommodate or channel floodwaters.
D. Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development that may increase flood damage.
City of Paterson, Zoning Ordinance Chapter 500 Zoning
218
E. Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers that may increase flood hazards in
other areas.

area, is hereby incorporated as part of this article as if fully set forth herein.
C. Penalties for Noncompliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located,
extended, converted, altered without full compliance with the terms of this Flood Damage
Prevention Ordinance Failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of
conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall constitute a
misdemeanor. Any person who violates this Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance or fails to
comply with any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined not more than
$1,000 or imprisoned for not more than 30 days, or both, for each violation, and in addition shall
pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the City

Damage Prevention Ordinance is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on
scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions.
Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This Flood Damage Prevention
Ordinance does not imply that land outside the area of special flood hazards or uses permitted
with such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This Flood Damage Prevention
Ordinance shall not create liability on the part of the City of Paterson, any officer of employee
thereof or the federal insurance administration, for any flood damages that result from reliance
on this Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance or any administrative decision lawfully made

to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base
flood level, providing items (a-k) in Section 500-11.7.D.4 have been fully
considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical
justification required for issuing the variance increases.
b. Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of
structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State
inventory of historic places, without regard to the procedures set forth in the
remainder of this section.
City of Paterson, Zoning Ordinance Chapter 500 Zoning
225
c. Variances shall not be issued within any designated flood way if any increases in
flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
d. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the
minimum necessary, consideration the flood hazard, to afford relief.
e. Variances shall only be issued upon: (i) a showing of good and sufficient cause;
(ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional
hardship to the applicant; and (c) a determination that the granting of the
variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public
safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or
victimization of the public as identified in Section 500-11.7.D.4, or conflict with
existing local laws or Ordinances.
f. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that
the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below
the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be
commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.
§500-11.8 Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction.
A. Anchoring
1. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse, or late movement of the structure.
2. All manufactured homes shall be anchored to resist flotation, collapse or lateral
movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not to be limited to, use of over
the top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is an addition to applicable
state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.
B. Utilities.
1. All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or
eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system;
2. New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or
eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharge from the systems
into floodwaters;

Cablevision, the company shall have the right to request from the City
lawful amendments to its franchise that relieve it of burdens which
create the unfair competitive situation. Should the company seek such

studio.
C. The City agrees that Cablevision shall retain the right to use the PEG
access channel, or portion thereof, for non-PEG access programming,
during times when the City is not utilizing the channel for purposes of
providing PEG access programming. In the event that the company uses
said PEG access channel for the presentation of such other
programming, the PEG programming shall remain the priority use, and
the company's rights with respect to using the channel for non-PEG
programming shall be subordinate to the City's provision of PEG access

access studio and require a minimum of five participants. The company
shall not be obligated to provide more than 20 hours of training per

this payment to the City, Cablevision will no longer be responsible for
such productions and will turn over these duties exclusively to the
City's control.
I. Cablevision shall pay the City of Paterson $340,000 in annual
compensation for the duration of this franchise for the continued use of
the City's real property at 76-80 North Barclay Street and to help fund
the acquisition, construction, equipping and operation of a new public
access studio/technology center for use by the residents of the City at
75-81 Ellison Street or other designated location during the term of this

on customer bills in the same manner that Cablevision's current lease
payments are reflected, or as otherwise permitted under law.
Concomitant with this ordinance, the City and Cablevision shall enter
into a modified site lease for the North Barclay Street location and

made available for public inspection. The PVSC shall have the right to
forward such request to an appropriate state or federal agency for a
determination as to whether the information submitted is in fact a trade
secret. All information shall be held confidential until a determination is
made by an appropriate federal and/or state agency(ies). Also, all
determinations of confidentiality will be on an item-by-item basis such

shall the physical or chemical characteristics of a user's industrial
waste be classified as a trade secret.
B. The industrial user or his representative shall have the right to require
that anyone not directly employed by the PVSC sign a confidentiality

Sewerage Construction and Sewer Use
§ A505-9. Approval of plans for construction of connections.
§ A505-10. Application for change in use of sewer.
If a person who is not an industrial user contemplates a modification to the
use of an existing sanitary sewer such that the user intends to introduce
industrial wastes or discharge more than the equivalent of twenty-five
thousand (25,000) gallons per day of sanitary waste, a sewer connection
application shall be submitted to the PVSC and, if required, a permit issued
prior to the commencement of the discharge. The discharge of industrial or
sanitary wastes without a sewer connection permit, as stated in this section,
constitutes a violation of these Rules and Regulations.
A. Direct connection to PVSC facility. No person, other than employees of
the PVSC or persons contracted to do work for the PVSC shall connect
directly to or cause to be connected directly to or alter or cause to be
altered any PVSC-owned sewer, sewage pumping station or other
facility without first filing an application to construct a connection and
obtaining approval of the construction plans from the Chief Executive
Officer. This application is in addition to the sewer connection
application required in § A505-18.
B. Connection to municipally owned collection systems. No person shall
connect to or cause to be connected to or alter or cause to be altered
any municipally owned sewer, sewage pumping plant or other facility
without first obtaining approval of the sewerage construction plans as
required by local ordinances. A PVSC sewer connection application
shall be submitted as required by § A505-18.

or existing industrial users who desire to commence operations at a new
facility within the PVSC sewer district shall apply for and receive a sewer
connection permit, temporary permit or letter of authorization, as the case
may be, prior to the commencement of operations at the new facility.

any time, the PVSC shall issue a permit only after the user either procures
title to the property or signs a lease agreement with the property owner.
§ A505-13. Temporary authority granted to existing industrial
users.
All industrial users discharging wastes directly or indirectly to the PVSC
treatment works prior to the effective date of these Rules and Regulations
are hereby granted temporary authority to discharge these wastes. This
temporary authority shall expire ninety (90) days after the adoption of these
Rules and Regulations unless prior to that date the discharger has filed an
application for a sewer connection permit pursuant to §§ A505-11, A505-16
and A505-18 of these Rules and Regulations. In such a case, this temporary
authority shall expire on the date the sewer connection permit is issued.
Any person discharging pursuant to the temporary authority provided for
hereby is subject to all provisions of these Rules and Regulations, and
such authority may be suspended or revoked in accordance with the terms
and provisions set forth in §§ A505-20 and A505-21 of these Rules and

notify the Chief Executive Officer within fourteen (14) days of any change in
ownership or corporate structure where such change affects responsibility
for compliance with these Rules and Regulations.
§ A505-18. Application for sewer connection permit, temporary
permit or letter of authorization.
A. Permits shall normally be issued for a period of five (5) years. A permit
may be issued for a period of less than five (5) years if the Chief
Executive Officer determines that a five-year permit is not needed.
B. A letter of authorization shall be issued for a period not to exceed one
(1) year. Prior to the expiration of this period, the user shall notify the
PVSC if authorization is required beyond the one (1) year authorized.

period not to exceed one (1) additional year. At the end of this second
period, the discharge shall either cease or be subject to a sewer
connection permit.

treat and dispose of the industrial wastes. The Chief Executive Officer
shall make a determination within ninety (90) days of receipt of all

endangerment to the environment or which threatens to interfere with
the operation of the PVSC treatment works.
C. Any user notified of a suspension of his permit shall immediately cease
and desist the discharge of all wastes regulated by that permit. In the
event of a failure of the industrial user to comply voluntarily with the
suspension order, the Chief Executive Officer shall take such steps as
are reasonably necessary to ensure compliance.
D. Any suspended user may file with the Chief Executive Officer a request
for a hearing with the Commissioners. Such a request shall not stay the
suspension. In the event of such request, the Commissioners shall,
within fourteen (14) days of the receipt by the Chief Executive Officer of
such request, hold a hearing on the suspension and shall either confirm
or revoke the action of the Chief Executive Officer. Reasonable notice of
the hearing shall be given to the suspended user as provided for in
§ A505-3. At this hearing, the suspended user may appear personally or
through counsel, cross-examine witnesses and present evidence in his
own behalf.
E. In the event that the Commissioners fail to meet within the time set
forth above or fail to make a determination within seventy-two (72)
hours after the close of the hearing, the order of suspension shall be
stayed until a determination is made either confirming or revoking the
action of the Chief Executive Officer.
F. The Chief Executive Officer shall reinstitute the permit upon proof of
satisfactory compliance with all discharge requirements. The PVSC
counsel may, upon recommendation of the Chief Executive Officer,
commence and prosecute such legal actions as may be appropriate to
enforce the provisions of this section.
A. The Commissioners may revoke any permit upon a finding that the user
has demonstrated a refusal, inability or failure to take reasonable steps

§ A505-22. Prohibited industrial wastes.
No person shall discharge or deposit or cause or allow to be discharged or
deposited into the treatment works or public sewer any waste which causes
or contains the following:
to comply with any of the provisions of these Rules and Regulations.
No revocation shall be ordered until a hearing has been held by the
Commissioners, where the user shall have the right to be represented
by counsel, cross-examine witnesses and present evidence in his own
behalf. Notice of the hearing shall be given to the user and to the
municipality wherein the user is located, in accordance with § A505-3,
at least fifteen (15) days prior to the date of the hearing.
B. Any user whose permit has been revoked shall immediately cease and
desist all discharge of wastes regulated by that permit. The Chief
Executive Officer may disconnect or permanently block from the public
sewer the connection of any user whose permit has been revoked if
such action is necessary to ensure compliance with the order or
revocation.
C. Before the discharge of wastes may be commenced by the user, he must
apply for and receive a new permit, pay all charges, penalties and such
other sums as may be owed and comply with the conditions contained in
any signed consent order or judgment. Costs incurred by the PVSC and
municipality in revoking the permit and disconnecting the connection
shall be paid by the user before a new permit is issued.
A. Explosive wastes. Wastes in such quantity which may create a fire or
explosion hazard to the treatment works, collection system or to the
operation of the system, including but not limited to wastewater with a
closed cup flash point of less than one hundred forty degrees
Fahrenheit (140° F.) or sixty degrees Centigrade (60° C.) using the test
methods specified in 40 CFR 261.21. Additional quantitative limitations
on explosive wastes are specified in Appendix B.191
B. Corrosive wastes. Wastes in such quantity which will cause corrosion or
deterioration of the treatment works. Unless a higher limit is otherwise
stated in the sewer connection permit issued to a user, all wastes shall
have a pH not less than five (5). Unless otherwise stated in the sewer
connection permit, all wastes shall have a pH not more than ten point
five (10.5). Prohibited materials include but are not limited to acids,
sulfides, concentrated chloride or fluoride compounds, etc.
C. Solids or viscous wastes. Solids or viscous wastes in amounts which
would cause obstruction to the flow in a sewer or otherwise interfere
with the proper operation of the treatment works. Prohibited materials

chapter.
§ A505-21 PASSAIC VALLEY SEWERAGE § A505-22
A505:1047
include but are not limited to uncomminuted garbage, bones, hides or
fleshings, cinders, sand, stone or marble dust, glass, etc.
D. Oils and grease.
(1) Petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oil or products of mineral
oil origin in amounts that will cause interference or pass-through.
(2) Any industrial wastes containing floatable fats, wax, grease or oils.
(3) Any industrial wastes containing more than one hundred (100)
milligrams per liter of petroleum-based oil or grease.
E. Noxious materials.
(1) Pollutants which result in the presence of toxic gases, vapors or
fumes within the POTW in a quantity that may cause acute worker
health and safety problems.
(2) Noxious liquids or gases which, in sufficient quantity, either singly
or by interaction with other wastes, are capable of creating a public
nuisance or hazard to life or are or may be sufficient to prevent
entry into a sewer for its maintenance and repair.
F. Radioactive wastes. Radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-life or
concentration that they do not comply with regulations or orders issued
by the appropriate authority having control over their use and which
will or may cause damage or hazards to the treatment works or
personnel operating the system.
G. Interference. Any waste, including oxygen demanding wastes (BOD,
etc.), released in a discharge at a flow rate and/or pollutant
concentration which an industrial user knows or has reason to know
will interfere with the PVSC treatment works.
H. Excessive discharge rate. Industrial wastes discharged in a slug or such
volume or strength so as to cause a treatment process upset and
subsequent loss of treatment efficiency.
I. Heat.
(1) Any discharge in excess of one hundred fifty degrees Fahrenheit
(150° F.) [sixty-five degrees Centigrade (65° C.)].
(2) Heat in amounts which would inhibit biological activity in the PVSC
treatment works resulting in a treatment process upset and
subsequent loss of treatment efficiency.
J. Unpolluted waters. Any unpolluted water, including but not limited to
cooling water and uncontaminated stormwater, which will increase the
hydraulic load on the treatment system, except as approved by the
PVSC.
§ A505-22 PATERSON CODE § A505-22
A505:1048
§ A505-23. Compliance with pretreatment standards; more
stringent standards to apply; baseline monitoring reports.
K. Dilution water. Any water added for the purpose of diluting wastes
which would otherwise exceed applicable maximum concentration
limits.
L. Violations. Wastes which cause the PVSC treatment plant to violate its
NJPDES permit, applicable receiving water standards, permit
regulating sludge which is produced during treatment or any other
permit issued to the PVSC.
M. Ultrahazardous toxics. Those wastes designated by the EPA as
sufficiently toxic that they shall not be discharged to the sanitary sewer
in any concentrations.
N. Trucked pollutants. Any trucked or hauled pollutants, except at
discharge points designated by the Chief Executive Officer, and only
after approval is issued by the PVSC.
O. Groundwater. Any groundwater, whether contaminated or
uncontaminated, unless specifically authorized by the PVSC.
P. Stormwater. Any stormwater, whether contaminated or
uncontaminated, unless specifically authorized by the PVSC.
A. No person shall discharge, deposit or cause or allow to be discharged or
deposited into the treatment works or public sewer any waste which
violates any pretreatment standard. As pretreatment standards for
toxic or other hazardous pollutants are promulgated by the USEPA for a
given industrial category, all industrial users within that category shall
conform to the USEPA timetable as well any numeric limitations
imposed by the USEPA. When the PVSC adopts a local limit that affects
the discharge from any user, that limitation shall apply to the affected
user. The failure of the PVSC to modify the applicable permit prior to its
listed expiration date shall not exempt the user from compliance.
B. In addition, a user shall comply with any more stringent standards or
limits as determined by the PVSC, NJDEP or USEPA. The PVSC may
impose case-by-case limitations on individual permittees using its best
professional judgment when necessary to prevent the upset or
interference with the PVSC treatment process or pass-through of
pollutants which may impair its ability to meet effluent, sludge or air
pollution limits or to protect treatment plant worker health and safety.
The PVSC may also adjust the local limits to permit emission trading as
described in Appendix B, Section B-104.192
C. When PVSC local pretreatment limits become effective, except as
modified herein, all affected users shall submit baseline monitoring

reports, compliance schedules and compliance reports as described in
the Federal General Pretreatment Regulations, 40 CFR 403.12, and
Appendix B.193 All affected users shall submit a baseline monitoring
report, as defined in 40 CFR 403.12(b) and (c), except that this report
shall be submitted to the PVSC within ninety (90) days of the effective
date. The PVSC may, for a compelling reason, modify the requirements
contained in the federal regulations on a case-by-case basis, in order
to address an individual situation. Local pretreatment limitations
established by the PVSC shall be contained in Appendix B.
A. If, for any reason, the discharge from a user does not comply with or
will be unable to comply with any prohibitions or limitations contained
in these Rules and Regulations, municipal ordinance or the permit, the
user shall notify the Chief Executive Officer within two (2) hours after
becoming aware of the incident so that corrective action may be taken
to protect the treatment works.
B. An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for
noncompliance if the following requirements are met. A user who
wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate,
through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs or other
relevant evidence, that:
(1) An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
(2) The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operations
and maintenance procedures; and
(3) The user has submitted the following information to the PVSC
within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset,
except that a written submission must be provided within five (5)
days if the information is provided verbally:
(a) A description of the indirect discharge and cause of the
noncompliance.
(b) The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and time,
or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is
expected to continue.
(c) Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
C. The industrial user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall
have the burden of proof. The user shall control production on all

§ A505-26. Industrial waste reporting.
discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with the
prohibitions or limitations upon reduction, loss or failure of its
pretreatment facility until it is restored or an alternative method of
treatment is provided. This requirement shall apply to the situation
where, among other things, the primary source of power to the
pretreatment facility is reduced, lost or fails.
A. A pretreatment facility or device may be required by the Chief
Executive Officer to treat or monitor industrial wastes prior to
discharge to the public sewer or PVSC treatment works. Where
pretreatment or construction necessary to control or monitor wastes is
required, prior to the issuance of or as prescribed in the permit,
schematics, detailed plans and specifications, process descriptions and
other pertinent data or information relating to such pretreatment
facility or device shall first be filed with the Chief Executive Officer.
Such filing shall not exempt the user nor the facility from compliance
with any applicable code, ordinance, rule, regulation or order of any
governmental authority or from these Rules and Regulations. Any
subsequent alterations or additions to such pretreatment or flowcontrol
facilities shall not be made without notice to the PVSC and,
where required, submission of detailed plans and specifications.
B. If inspection of pretreatment facilities and devices by authorized
personnel of the PVSC reveals such systems are not installed or
operating in conformance with the plans and procedures submitted to
the PVSC or are not operating in compliance with the effluent
limitations required by the PVSC, the industrial user shall make those
modifications necessary to meet those requirements. All pretreatment
systems judged by the Chief Executive Officer to require engineering
design shall have plans prepared and signed by an engineer of suitable
discipline. If pretreatment or control of waste flows is required, such
facilities shall be maintained in good working order and operated as
efficiently as possible by the owner or operator at his own cost and
expense, subject to the requirements of these Rules and Regulations
and all other applicable codes, ordinances and laws.
A. Unless a different schedule is specified in the permit, each affected user
shall submit a user charge self-monitoring report monthly on forms
provided or specified by the PVSC. Each report shall be due twenty-one
(21) days after the reporting period ends. If the 21st day falls on a
Saturday, Sunday or PVSC holiday, then the report shall be due on the
next PVSC workday following. A report shall be submitted for each
outlet as specified in the permit.
B. If a user fails to submit a user charge self-monitoring report as required
by his permit, the Chief Executive Officer shall estimate the use for that
§ A505-24 PASSAIC VALLEY SEWERAGE § A505-26
A505:1051
period. Estimates for reports due in October may be made within five
(5) working days after the due date. If a user fails to submit a user
charge self-monitoring report and the Chief Executive Officer estimates
the usage for that period, this estimate shall become the current year
actual usage for that period, and no adjustment shall be made. In
addition, no adjustments shall be made to the next year estimated
usage if the estimate is prepared using this method.
C. Each user whose permit requires him to do so shall submit a periodic
pretreatment discharge monitoring report on forms provided or
specified by the PVSC. These reports are due thirty-five (35) days after
the reporting period ends.
D. The pretreatment discharge monitoring report may include but, at the
discretion of the Chief Executive Officer, shall not be limited to nature
of processes, volume, rates of flow, mass discharge emission rate,
production quantities, hours or days of operation, concentrations of
pollutants or other information necessary to demonstrate compliance
with applicable pretreatment limitations.
E. All industrial users subject to Federal Categorical Pretreatment
Standards shall, at a minimum, comply with the reporting requirements
contained in 40 CFR 403.12 and subsequent revisions, including but not
limited to baseline monitoring reports, compliance progress reports,
compliance date reports and periodic self-monitoring reports.
F. Individual analytical results for BOD, TSS or any other parameter as
required by the permit shall be reported on the date that the sample
was removed from the sampling device for analysis. (For example, if a
sampling device drew a sample from 8:00 a.m. Monday to 8:00 a.m.
Tuesday and it was removed on Tuesday for analysis, then the sample
would be dated Tuesday).
G. Any user may meet the due date requirement for submission of a report
by submitting the document via facsimile or electronic data submission,
provided that the document is received at the PVSC administrative
offices between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. on any date up to
and including the due date. In addition, a hard copy of this same report
shall be due within four (4) days of the transmission of the facsimile or
electronic data submission. The hard copy shall also contain a notation
indicating the date and time the report was transmitted via facsimile or
electronic data submission. Failure to submit the hard copy within four
(4) days specified shall result in the report being considered as not
having been received and shall constitute a violation of these Rules and
Regulations.
H. The following procedure shall be used when reporting analytical
results:
(1) The pollutant limit will define the precision, or number of digits to
the right or left of the decimal point, to be reported.
§ A505-26 PATERSON CODE § A505-26
A505:1052
§ A505-27. Industrial waste monitoring.
(2) Calculated results shall be rounded off to the same precision as
defined for that pollutant in the limit.
(3) Zeros in the pollutant limit are included in order to determine the
precision.
(4) The following procedure shall be followed when rounding off
results:
(a) Round off by dropping digits that are irrelevant. If the digit 6,
7, 8 or 9 is to be dropped, increase the preceding digit by one
(1) unit.
(b) If the digit 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 is to be dropped, do not alter the
preceding digit.
(c) If the digit 5 is to be dropped, round off the preceding digit to
the nearest even number (2.25 becomes 2.2 while 2.35
becomes 2.4).
I. The PVSC shall, by resolution, define key fields on various periodic
report forms. These key fields must be accurate at the time the report is
received at the PVSC. Errors or omissions in any key field will subject
the permittee to mandatory minimum fines. This fine is in addition to
any other fine to which the permittee may be subject. If the PVSC
returns an incomplete report to a permittee with a request that it be
completed and resubmitted to the PVSC, the permittee shall be subject
to a fine for a late report as defined in Appendix C194 if the corrected
report is not received within the time period specified. Appendix C
contains the fine schedule.
A. All industrial users who discharge or propose to discharge waste to the
PVSC treatment works shall maintain such records as are necessary to
demonstrate compliance with the requirements of these Rules and
Regulations, any permit and any applicable State or Federal
Pretreatment Standards or requirements.
B. Such records shall be made available upon request by the Chief
Executive Officer. All such records relating to compliance with
pretreatment standards shall be made available to officials of the
NJDEP and officials of the USEPA upon demand. A summary of such
data indicating the industrial user's compliance with these Rules and
Regulations shall be prepared and submitted to the Chief Executive
Officer as designated in the permit, utilizing forms contained in
Appendix D.195
194. Editor's Note: Appendix C, Fines, is included at the end of this chapter.
195. Editor's Note: The forms are available at the office of the City Clerk.
§ A505-26 PASSAIC VALLEY SEWERAGE § A505-27
A505:1053
C. Each designated industrial user shall install, at his own cost and
expense, suitable monitoring equipment to facilitate the accurate
observation, sampling and measurement of industrial wastes. Such
equipment shall be kept safe, secured from unauthorized entry or
tampering and accessible at all times. Except as provided for in
Subsection E, monitoring equipment shall be calibrated as
recommended by the manufacturer, except that LEL recorders shall be
calibrated daily and pH recorders shall be calibrated at least weekly,
whichever is more frequent.
D. Notwithstanding the requirements of §§ A505-24 and A505-25, a user
shall notify the PVSC as soon as possible, but in no case later than two
(2) hours from becoming aware of it, if a sampling, monitoring,
recording or other device required in accordance with these Rules and
Regulations becomes inoperable. Unless modified by the PVSC, the user
shall submit a written report to the PVSC, Attention: Industrial and
Pollution Control Department, within five (5) working days of the
occurrence, detailing what occurred, why it happened, what will be
done to correct the problem and a date when the problem will be
corrected. If corrective action is expected to take more than two (2)
months from the date of the occurrence, the user shall submit monthly
progress reports until such times as the problem is corrected. This
provision shall not apply during flow meter calibration or to other
instrument calibrations that do not exceed thirty (30) minutes.
E. An industrial user who claims a lower discharge volume than is
indicated by his water consumption, due to retention of water in his
product, discharge to a storm sewer, river or ditch, a higher
evaporation rate than is allowed by the PVSC or for other reasons, shall
provide the PVSC with an acceptable method for accurately
determining his discharge volume to the sanitary sewer. An industrial
user with more than one (1) discharge point to the sanitary sewer shall
provide the PVSC with accurate discharge volumes for each outlet. In
the event that the PVSC determines that said volumes are not accurate,
the Chief Executive Officer may require the installation of flow
measuring equipment. Unless this requirement is modified by the
individual permit, flow measuring devices, used in determination of
effluent volumes and which are required to be installed in accordance
with Subsection C, shall be calibrated annually, or more frequently if
recommended by the manufacturer. The PVSC may require a user to
notify the PVSC at least seven (7) days prior to any flow meter
calibration.
F. When more than one (1) industrial user can discharge into a common
sewer, the Chief Executive Officer may require installation of separate
monitoring equipment for each industrial user. When there is a
significant difference in wastewater constituents and characteristics
produced by different operations of a single industrial user, the Chief
Executive Officer may require that separate monitoring facilities be
installed for each separate discharge.

§ A505-28. Compliance determination; sampling; inspections;
certification of nonuse.
§ A505-29. Analyses of industrial wastes.
A. Compliance determinations with respect to any permit prohibitions and
limitations may be made by the PVSC on the basis of instantaneous
grab samples, sequential samples or composite samples of the waste
stream or on vapors emanating from the waste stream. Sequential or
composite samples may be taken over a twenty-four-hour period or
even a longer or shorter time span, as deemed necessary by the Chief
Executive Officer, to meet the needs of specific circumstances.
B. The PVSC may inspect the monitoring facilities of an industrial user at
any time to determine compliance with the requirements of these Rules
and Regulations as specified in § A505-4. In any event, the PVSC shall
conduct at least one (1) inspection and sampling visit per calendar year
at each permittee, excluding those users issued a temporary permit or
letter of authorization.
C. An industrial user may demonstrate compliance with a categorical
pretreatment limit by certifying nonuse only if permitted in the
applicable regulation. A user may demonstrate compliance with a state
or local limit by certifying nonuse, as described herein, unless
prohibited by the applicable regulations. Prior to claiming nonuse, the
user shall analyze at least three (3) separate, daily composite samples
for the regulated pollutants over a two-week period. The user shall then
submit the result of the analyses with the following statement in its next
required report. The statement shall read: "I certify under penalty of
law that this document and all attachments were prepared under my
direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed to assure
that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information
submitted. Based on my inquiry of the persons who manage the system
or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the
information submitted, to the best of my knowledge, information and
belief, is true, accurate and complete. I am aware that there are
significant penalties for submitting false information, including the
possibility of fine and imprisonment, for knowing violations."
[403.6(a)(2)(ii) revised by 53 FR 40610, October 17, 1988]
D. The PVSC will accept the certification described in Subsection C above,
provided that the concentration of the affected pollutants is at or below
the threshold value specified in Appendix B, Table B-2.196 The industrial
user shall continue to submit this certification for each subsequent
monitoring period during which it applies, using the wording as
described above.

A. Laboratory analysis of industrial waste samples shall be performed by
laboratories certified by the NJDEP in wastewater analyses for the
parameters to be analyzed. Test procedures identified in 40 CFR 136,
Test Procedures for the Analysis of Pollutants, shall be utilized for all
analyses.
B. All laboratory procedures, other than those permitted by 40 CFR 136,
shall be considered as alternate procedures. The Chief Executive
Officer may permit an industrial user to substitute an alternate
procedure, provided that the USEPA had previously approved use of the
method by the laboratory performing the analysis and a suitable
application had been submitted to the PVSC. Acceptable comparability
data shall be included in the application.
C. Sample collection, handling and preservation techniques contained in
40 CFR 136 shall be followed for all parameters. Samples shall be
maintained within the range of one degree Centigrade (1° C.) to four
degrees Centigrade (4° C.) while being collected, after collection and
during transport to the laboratory for analysis. Suitable logs and/or
records shall be maintained at the monitoring station and at the
analyzing laboratory to demonstrate proper temperature control.
A. Industrial wastes shall be sampled and analyzed by the user for user
charge and, where required, pretreatment. The frequency of sampling
and analysis shall be specified in the permit and shall be based on
frequencies contained in federal, state and local regulations. The Chief
Executive Officer may increase the frequency on a temporary basis if
deemed necessary to verify data submitted by the user or to aid in
determining the user's compliance with these Rules and Regulations.
B. If a permittee analyzes his industrial wastes for parameters not
required in the permit or at a greater frequency than specified in the
permit, these results shall also be included in the periodic monitoring
reports submitted to the PVSC.
A. In order to fulfill its responsibilities under federal and state laws and
regulations, the PVSC shall develop and implement an enforcement
response plan (ERP), hereinafter referred to as the "plan." The plan
shall be incorporated into the PVSC Rules and Regulations by a
resolution of the Commissioners and shall be subject to modification as
needed in order to keep it consistent with federal and/or state laws and
regulations. This plan shall contain detailed procedures indicating how
the PVSC will investigate and respond to instances of user
noncompliance.

(2) Notify the PVSC of any new or changes in identification for
industrial, large commercial or tax-exempt users.
(3) Establish and implement procedures for the billing and collection
of the applicable charges from each industrial, large commercial
and tax-exempt user.
(4) Remit total municipal assessment to the PVSC.

§ A505-35. Calculation of user charges.
(6) Make records available to the PVSC for compliance review.
A. Except for those municipalities that have adopted an alternative
method, the user charge for the residential/small commercial class shall
be based on the assessed valuation for the property as maintained in
the applicable municipal tax records. Each municipality may, with the
prior approval of the PVSC, adopt an alternate method, much as direct
billing, provided that it complies with applicable federal and state
regulations.
B. The user charge for the industrial users shall be based on the user's
actual volume and strength contribution to the PVSC treatment works
during each measurement year. Strength shall be determined by the
total suspended solids (TSS) and five-day biochemical oxygen demand
(BOD5) analytical test methods. Where the Chief Executive Officer
determines that an alternative method is necessary, other test methods
will be employed to determine the equivalent BOD. A direct billed user
shall also receive a credit for any ad valorem tax which may be paid as
follows: In those municipalities which collect user charges from
residential/small commercial users through ad valorem taxes, industrial
and large commercial users will pay a portion of their user charge
through their ad valorem taxes. In these municipalities, the direct billed
user will receive a credit against the user charge for payments included
in his ad valorem taxes.
C. The user charge for the large commercial users shall be based on the
user's actual volume discharged during each measurement year and
residential strength standards as determined periodically by the Chief
Executive Officer.
D. Each nonindustrial tax-exempt user shall be placed in one (1) of four (4)
classes based on volume for the purpose of determining their user
charge. The user charge for the largest class shall be based on the
user's actual volume discharged and residential strength standards for
BOD and TSS, as determined periodically by the Chief Executive
Officer. Actual volume shall be determined by the volume consumed
during the measurement year, as closely as can be reasonably
determined.
E. The user charge for the remaining three (3) tax-exempt classes shall be
based on the average volume consumed by a representative number of
users within that class. Residential strength standards, as determined
periodically by the Chief Executive Officer, shall be used to determine
BOD and TSS contribution. All tax-exempt users in each of these three
(3) classes shall receive the same user charge. Users shall be moved
from one class to another based on the actual volume data as
determined by the Chief Executive Officer. The Chief Executive Officer
shall review the average volume consumed data every two (2) years and
recommend adjustments to the average volume consumed figures. The

§ A505-36. Payment of user charges.
§ A505-37. Change of user class.
In order for each municipality to keep the PVSC informed of all new or
changed users, the following shall be submitted to the PVSC in a timely
manner:
Commissioners shall, by resolution every two (2) years, set volume
standards to apply to each of the four (4) classes of nonindustrial, taxexempt
users.
A. The PVSC shall calculate the user charges to be paid by the direct billed
users as follows:
(1) The user charge shall be estimated in advance for each calendar
year.
(2) The estimated user charge shall be modified by an adjustment from
the prior year (except in the first year of the implementation of the
user charge system).
(3) During each measurement year, industrial and other designated
users shall submit quarterly self-monitoring reports to the PVSC.
These reports will provide data to enable the PVSC to calculate the
actual usage for that measurement year. This will also apply where
PVSC calculates the actual usage because a user fails to supply the
self-monitoring report.
(4) The current year actual usage shall be compared to the current
year estimated usage, and any difference shall result in an
adjustment to that year and be applied to the next year's estimated
usage as explained in Subsection A(2) above.
B. The PVSC shall prepare invoices and mail to each municipality four (4)
times a year. Full payment is due on February 1, May 1, August 1 and
November 1. The collection from each user within the municipality shall
be the responsibility of that municipality. According to New Jersey State
law, interest will be accrued at twelve percent (12%) per annum on the
unpaid principal.
C. Municipalities shall not modify the PVSC portion of the user charge
assessed to an individual user. The Chief Executive Officer shall have
the right to review municipal records to ensure that proper collections
are being made. Records shall be maintained for at least three (3)
years.
A. The name and address.
B. The name and telephone number of the contact official.
C. Times when the facility is open and when the contact official is present.

by the PVSC to review the application or request. If a determination is
made that a permit of any type is not required, a portion of the
application fee shall be refunded to the user. The PVSC may by
resolution revise the schedule of fees to be paid and refunded.
B. Upon the effective date of this subsection, all users that are issued a
permit of any type shall pay a permit fee to the PVSC. This fee will
offset, in whole or in part, the administrative costs incurred by the
PVSC to monitor the permittee's compliance with the PVSC Rules and
Regulations, as well as state and federal regulations, from the effective
date of the permit until the permit, temporary permit or letter of
authorization expires, is terminated or is revoked. The PVSC may by
resolution revise the schedule of permit fees to be paid. A new permit
fee shall be paid for each subsequent permit renewed. The permit fee
