   (A)   General principles underlying the Code of Ethics.



      (1)   The stability and proper operation of democratic
representative government depend upon public confidence in the integrity of
the government and upon responsible exercise of the trust conferred by the
people upon their elected officials.



      (2)   Governmental decisions and policy must be made and
implemented through proper channels and processes of the governmental
structure.



      (3)   Board members must be able to act in a manner that
maintains their integrity and independence, yet is responsive to the
interests and needs of those they represent.



      (4)   Board members must always remain aware that at various
times they play different roles:



         (a)   As advocates, who strive to advance the legitimate
needs of their citizens;



         (b)   As legislators, who balance the public interest
and private rights in considering and enacting ordinances, orders and
resolutions; and



         (c)   As decision-makers, who arrive at fair and
impartial quasi-judicial and administrative determinations.



      (5)   Board members must know how to distinguish among these
roles, to determine when each role is appropriate, and to act accordingly.



      (6)   Board members must be aware of their obligations to
conform their behavior to standards of ethical conduct that warrant the trust
of their constituents. Each official must find within his or her own
conscience the touchstone by which to determine what conduct is appropriate.



   (B)   Code of Ethics. The purpose of this Code of Ethics is to
establish guidelines for ethical standards of conduct for the City Council
and to help determine what conduct is appropriate in particular cases. It
should not be considered a substitute for the law or for a Council member’s
best judgment.

§ 30.01  ACCESS TO CITY RECORDS AND PROPERTY.



   (A)   City Council members shall conduct the affairs of the Board in
an open and public manner. Compliance with all applicable laws governing open
meetings and public records, will be recognized and that doing so is an
important way to be worthy of the public’s trust. Local government records
belong to the public and not to individual Council members, the Board or city
employees.



   (B)   In order to ensure strict compliance with the laws concerning
openness, Council members should make clear that an environment of
transparency and candor is to be maintained at all times in the government
unit. The city will prohibit unjustified delays in fulfilling public record
requests. The City Council shall take deliberate steps to make certain that
any closed sessions held by the Board are lawfully conducted and that such
sessions do not stray from the purpose for which they are called.



   (C)   No person shall remove any city property or any record,
document, book or paper belonging to the city, from the office or place where
it properly belongs without the authority of the custodian of records, except
on written order from the City Council, the City Manager or a court of
competent jurisdiction.

§ 30.02  MUNICIPAL RECORDS RETENTION AND DISPOSITION SCHEDULE.



   (A)   The records retention and disposition schedule and retention
periods governing the records series listed herein are hereby approved. In
accordance with the provision of G.S. Chs. 121 and 132, it is agreed that the
records do not and will not have further use or value for official business,
research or reference purposes after the respective retention periods
specified herein and are authorized to be destroyed or otherwise disposed of
by the agency or official having custody of them without further reference to
or approval of either party to this agreement. However, records subject to
audit or those legally required for ongoing official proceedings must be
retained until released from such audits or official proceedings,
notwithstanding the instructions of this schedule. Public records, including
electronic records not listed in this schedule, are not authorized to be
destroyed.



   (B)   This local government agency and the Department of Cultural
Resources agree that certain records series possess only brief
administrative, fiscal, legal, research and reference value. These records
series have been designated by retention periods which allow these records to
be destroyed when “administrative value ends”. The local government
agency hereby agrees that it will establish and enforce internal policies
setting minimum retention periods for the records that Cultural Resources has
scheduled with the disposition instruction “destroy when administrative
value ends”. If a municipality does not establish internal policies and
retention periods, the municipality is not complying with the provisions of
this retention schedule and is not authorized by the Department of Cultural
Resources to destroy the records with the disposition instruction “destroy
when administrative value ends”.



   (C)   It is further agreed that these records may not be destroyed
prior to the time periods stated; however, for sufficient reason they may be
retained for longer periods. This schedule is to remain in effect from the
date of approval until it is reviewed and updated.



   (D)   The attached schedule is adopted by reference as if set out at
length herein. A copy of this schedule is available for inspection at the
city offices.

would provide a consistent nationwide approach for federal, state, local and
tribal governments to work together more effectively and efficiently to
prevent, prepare for, respond to and recover from domestic incidents,
regardless of cause, size or complexity. The NIMS standardized procedures for
managing personnel, communications, facilities and resources will improve the
city’s ability to utilize federal funding to enhance local and state agency
readiness, maintain first responder safety and streamline incident management
processes. The Incident Command System components of NIMS are already an
integral part of various incident management activities throughout the city,
including current emergency management training programs.



   (B)   Scope or authority. The city hereby adopts the National
Incident Management System (NIMS) as established under HSPD 5 as its system

(Res. 2010-1-19, passed 5-25-2010)



EXTENSION OF MAINS BEYOND CITY



§ 51.030  STATEMENT OF POLICY.



   (A)   An adequate supply of potable water is an increasingly
difficult and expensive commodity to provide citizens. The individual
well-being of its residents and the commercial and industrial vitality of an
area indirectly depends upon the availability of a useable water supply.



   (B)   Likewise, the wastewater treatment system is designed to treat
and dispose sewage in a safe and sanitary means. When the treatment and
disposal is conducted properly, the contamination of the groundwater supply
and the threat of health hazards in populated areas is minimized.



   (C)   The city is dedicated to the premise that the water and sewer
systems have been paid for substantially by the citizens of the city and,
therefore, should be judiciously used to enhance the well-being of all its
citizens.



   (D)   The city intends to follow a program of aggressive orderly
growth without the over-extension of the resources which could result in a
long-term devastating effect upon the municipality. The city intends to
comply with its growth policies as enumerated in the Whiteville Land Use
Plan. The city will attempt to provide water service to all existing homes
and new homes not currently served on existing open and dedicated streets
within the constraints of money and budgets. The priority for new services
will be less than for existing customers.



   (E)   Furthermore, the city intends to cooperate with the county
where at all possible on any program which will mutually benefit both
governments and their citizens. The city will continue to strive to improve
all services in all areas which will compliment the city’s quality of life
without endangering the city’s fiscal responsibility.



   (F)   All existing and future users within the city limits or its
existing service area may be served by the city subject to the availability
of capacity.



(2009 Code, § 51.25)  (Ord. passed 6-25-1991)



§ 51.031  PLANNING AND EXTENSION OF WATER AND SEWER SYSTEMS.



   The planning and extension of the water and sewer systems shall be
accomplished in accordance with the following general policies.



   (A)   Each developer of land, whether subdivided or not, shall be
responsible for all costs associated with the extension of water and sewer
service including rights-of-way costs.



   (B)   All water and sewer service extensions costs in and to
subdivisions shall be borne by the subdivider in accordance with the city’s
subdivision regulations.



   (C)   All water and sewer extension plans and installations shall
meet the specifications of the city. The city shall be authorized to inspect
at any time the installation of all water and sewer extensions which are to
be connected to the city’s facilities and all fees for the inspections
shall be borne by the owner or developer.



   (D)   All water and sewer lines, mains and applicable laterals
connected to the city’s facilities shall be dedicated to the city and
accepted by the city.



   (E)   The city shall be responsible for the maintenance, operation
and control of all water and sewer facilities when  owned and operated by
the city.



   (F)   It is preferred that all water discharge into the sewer system
be purchased from the city.



(2009 Code, § 51.26)  (Ord. passed 6-25-1991)



§ 51.032  INITIATION OF PROJECTS WITHIN THE CORPORATE LIMITS.



   There are three methods by which water and sewer extensions can be
accomplished.



   (A)   On petition by residents.



      (1)   Water and/or sewer line extensions may be made upon
receipt of a petition requesting the improvements. The petition shall be
signed by at least 50% in number of the owners of property who also own at
least 50% of the lineal feet of frontage of the lands abutting the proposed
improvements. One hundred percent of the improvements shall be financed by
special assessments against the benefitted property utilizing the procedures
set forth in G.S. Ch. 160A, Article 10.



      (2)   The city shall assess 100% of the full cost of the water
and/or sewer improvements against the abutting property owner. City property
shall be assessed just like any other property owner. The city shall adopt
from time to time a maximum price per foot for water and/or sewer lines which
shall be assessed against abutting property. Where the size of the property
exceeds the normal building lot size in a particular zoning district, the
city may adopt an acreage fee to assess the benefitted property owner in
addition to the front foot rate. In any event, the maximum front foot rate
and the acreage fee shall be applied uniformly to all projects approved by
the City Council. These fees shall be in addition to normal tap fees, usage
charges or impact fees which the city may have already adopted.



      (3)   The city by action of the City Council may amend, modify
or repeal the maximum assessment rate and the acreage fee at any time.



      (4)   All petitions for improvements shall specify that the
assessments shall be paid in three years plus interest to be determined by
the City Council.



   (B)   On application by property owners.



      (1)   Any property owner, owners or developer desiring to have
water or sanitary sewer services extended to and along any public streets or
other public way shall apply in writing to the city requesting the water
and/or sewer service. The application shall contain plans in sufficient
detail in order to allow the City Council to determine the adequate size of
facilities necessary for the proposed extension.



      (2)   Upon approval of the extension plans by the City
Council, the property owner or developer shall be responsible for providing
100% of the full cost of the water and/or sewer improvements including all
approved pump stations, lift stations and fire hydrants between the owner’s
property and the city’s water and/or sewer system.



      (3)   If public right-of-way is not available, the property
owner or developer shall obtain the necessary rights-of-way and/or easements
in favor of the city.



      (4)   All contracts for the installation of water and/or sewer
lines and the construction and installation of same shall be subject to the
inspection and approval by the city and its Engineer, and the fee for the
inspection shall be borne by the owner or developer.



   (C)   Action by City Council.



      (1)   In the event that the City Council determines that a
proposed water and/or sewer project is both necessary and in the public
interest of the citizens of the city, the city may undertake the proposed
extension of services on its own motion.



      (2)   In such case, no assessments will be levied against
abutting property; however, all owners of property abutting the improvements
shall be required to pay a fee equivalent to the amount which would have been
assessed as a condition to connection to the water and/or sewer improvements.



      (3)   The fee charged shall be a maximum price per front foot.
Where the size of the property exceeds the normal building lot size in a
particular zoning district, the city may require the payment of an acreage
fee in addition to the maximum front foot rate.



      (4)   These fees shall be in addition to the normal tap on
fees and usage charges which the city has already adopted.



(2009 Code, § 51.27)  (Ord. passed 6-25-1991)



§ 51.033  INITIATION OF PROJECTS OUTSIDE THE CORPORATE LIMITS.



   (A)   The city may permit extension of water and/or sewer service
outside the city’s corporate limits.



   (B)   The following provisions shall apply:



      (1)   All requests for extension of water and/or sewer service
shall be in writing;



      (2)   The applicant shall agree to the provisions of §§
51.031 and 51.032; and



      (3)   The application (or request) for service shall include a
petition from the owner requesting annexation or, if not practical, a
statement setting forth the reasons why annexation would not be practical.
The City Council shall have the authority to waive this requirement when, in
its opinion, annexation would not be practical, legally possible or would not
be in the best interest of the city.



(2009 Code, § 51.28)  (Ord. passed 6-25-1991)



§ 51.034  EXTENSIONS MADE BY OTHER GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY.



   (A)   In the event that the city shall permit an extension of its
water and/or sewer line at the request of and expense of any other
governmental unit, including the county, the extensions shall be at the sole
expense of the party requesting the extensions. Expenses are to include, but
not be limited to, all labor and materials, engineering fees, any and all
sums required for rights-of-way and/or easements and any and all cost
incidental to the extensions.



   (B)   Upon completion of the water and/or sewer lines, the
improvements shall be dedicated to the city. If requested by the governmental
unit, properties served by the water and/or sewer lines extension shall pay
to the governmental unit an assessment or payment in lieu of assessment as
established by that governmental unit’s extension policy. In any event, the
fee collected shall not be less than the prevailing assessment or payment
would have been had the city installed the improvements. The city shall
charge the user the normal tap fee or using charges which the city may have
already adopted.



(2009 Code, § 51.29)  (Ord. passed 6-25-1991)



§ 51.035  OVERSIZED IMPROVEMENTS; REIMBURSEMENT.



   (A)   When it is in the best interest of the citizens of the city
that oversized water and/or sewer lines be extended from the existing
municipal system, the City Council may agree to pay the difference of the
cost of construction to serve the area requesting service and the costs of
future areas of construction for such to be served with the lines
accommodating the increased volume. If any oversized facility is feasible,
then a reimbursement agreement shall be entered into between the city and
each party installing water and/or sewer. Only those water and sewer lines,
fire hydrants, lift stations and pumping stations as may be expressly
referred to and covered by a written contract between the party(ies) and the
city shall be considered.



   (B)   The cost of installing all lines on property being connected
to and the cost of installing all lines between the property being developed
and the existing lines of the city shall be borne by the owner, developer or
party being so connected.



   (C)   Oversize improvement costs subject to reimbursement shall be:



      (1)   The actual cost of water lines larger than six inches,
sewer lines larger than eight inches, all approved fire hydrants, pumping
stations and lift stations between property being developed and the
facilities of the city and which are so located as to serve other properties,
but only to the extent of the extra cost incurred by installing lines larger
than needed to serve the property developed;



      (2)   The cost of lines within property being developed which
will serve other properties and are of a size in excess of six inches for
water and eight inches for sewer, but only to the extent of the extra cost
incurred by installing lines larger than needed to serve the property
developed; and



      (3)   The proportionate cost of lines of any size to which
direct service connections may be made to property other than that of the
initial developer.



   (D)   All reimbursements for oversize improvement costs set forth in
items in divisions (C)(1) and (C)(2) above shall be made from water and/or
sewer acreage charges collected by the city from properties initially or
subsequently served by lines installed under a reimbursement agreement.
Reimbursement costs due from acreage fees under an oversize improvements
agreement shall be paid by the city to the developer within 30 days following
the end of each quarter from any collections made during that quarter. All
reimbursement for costs for division (C)(3) above shall be made only from
appropriate front foot charges.



   (E)   Only actual costs of the lines together with all necessary
fire hydrants, pumping stations and lift stations shall be included in the
calculations of costs subject to reimbursement. No interest on cost pending
reimbursement shall be permitted.



   (F)   No reimbursement of any costs shall be made more than ten
years after the day of acceptance by the city of the lines installed under an
oversized improvement agreement.



   (G)   Acreage charges collected from properties served by lines
installed under reimbursement agreement shall be applied so as to satisfy any
claims under the different agreements in the order in which the agreements
were executed.

      (2)   Industrial waste survey information will be used to
develop user-specific local limits when necessary to ensure that the POTW’s
maximum allowable headworks loading are not exceeded for particular
pollutants of concern. User-specific local limits for appropriate pollutants
of concern shall be included in wastewater permits. The POTW Director may
impose mass based limits in addition to, or in place of, concentration based
limits.



   (D)   State requirements. State requirements and limitations on
discharges shall apply in any case where they are more stringent than federal
requirements and limitations or those in this subchapter.



   (E)   Right of revision. The city reserves the right to establish
limitations and requirements which are more stringent than those required by
either state or federal regulation if deemed necessary to comply with the
objectives presented in § 51.050 or the general and specific prohibitions in
division (A) above, as is allowed by 40 C.F.R. § 403.4.



   (F)   Dilution. No user shall ever increase the use of process water
or, in any way, attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete
substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations
contained in the national categorical pretreatment standards, unless
expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard, or in any other
pollutant-specific limitation developed by the city or state.



   (G)   Pretreatment of wastewater.



      (1)   Pretreatment facilities. Users shall provide wastewater
treatment as necessary to comply with this subchapter and wastewater permits
issued under § 51.054(B) and shall achieve compliance with all national
categorical pretreatment standards, local limits and the prohibitions set out
in division (A) above within the time limitations as specified by EPA, the
state or the POTW Director, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities
necessary for compliance shall be provided, operated and maintained at the
user’s expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and
operating procedures shall be submitted to the city for review, and shall be
approved by the POTW Director before construction of the facility. The review
of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the user from
the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an
effluent acceptable to the city under the provisions of this subchapter. Any
subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation
shall be reported to and be approved by the POTW Director prior to the
user’s initiation of the changes.



      (2)   Additional pretreatment measures.



         (a)   Whenever deemed necessary, the POTW Director may
require users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate
that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate
and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage waste streams from
industrial waste streams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to
protect the POTW and determine the user’s compliance with the requirements
of this subchapter.



         (b)   The POTW Director may require any person

the combined waste stream formula set out in 40 C.F.R. § 403.6(e);



         (e)   Measurement of pollutants. The categorical
pretreatment standards applicable to each regulated process.



            1.   The results of sampling and analysis
identifying the nature and concentration, and/or mass, where required by the
standard or by the POTW Director, of regulated pollutants in the discharge
from each regulated process. Instantaneous, daily maximum and long- term
average concentrations, or mass, where required, shall be reported. The
sample shall be representative of daily operations and shall be analyzed in
accordance with procedures set out in division (J) below.



            2.   Sampling must be performed in accordance with
procedures set out in division (K) below and 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(b) and (g),
including 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(g)(4).



         (f)   Certification. A statement, reviewed by the
user’s current authorized representative as defined in § 51.051 and
certified by a qualified professional, indicating whether pretreatment
standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not, whether
additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or additional pretreatment is
required to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements;



         (g) Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or
O&M will be required to meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest
schedule by which the user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or
O&M. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the
compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment standard. A
compliance schedule pursuant to this section must meet the requirements set
out in division (B) below; and



         (h)   Signature and certification. All baseline
monitoring reports must be signed and certified in accordance with §
51.054(B)(3).



   (B)   Compliance schedule progress reports. The following conditions
shall apply to the compliance schedule required by division (A)(2)(g) above.



      (1)   The schedule shall contain progress increments in the
form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to
the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the
user to meet the applicable pretreatment standards (such events include, but
are not limited to, hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final
plans, executing contracts for major components, commencing and completing
construction, and beginning and conducting routine operation).



      (2)   No increment referred to above shall exceed nine months.



      (3)   The user shall submit a progress report to the POTW
Director no later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the
final date of compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied
with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if
appropriate, the steps being taken by the user to return to the established
schedule.



      (4)   In no event shall more than nine months elapse between
such progress reports to the POTW Director.



   (C)   Reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard,
deadline. Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with
applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source
following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any
user subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to
the POTW Director a report containing the information described in divisions
(A)(2)(d) through (A)(2)(f) above. For users subject to equivalent mass or
concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures in 40
C.F.R. § 403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the
user’s long-term production rate. For all other users subject to
categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant
discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report
shall include the user’s actual production during the appropriate sampling
period. All compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance
with § 51.054(B)(3).



   (D)   Periodic compliance reports. Municipalities may sample and
analyze user discharges in lieu of requiring the users to conduct sampling
and analysis.



      (1)   All significant industrial users shall, at a frequency
determined by the POTW Director but in no case less than once every six
months, submit a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants
in the discharge which are limited by pretreatment standards and the
applicable flows for the reporting period. Sampling and analysis must be
performed in accordance with procedures set out in divisions (J) and (K)
below. All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in
accordance with § 51.054(B).



      (2)   If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this
section monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the POTW
Director, using the procedures prescribed in divisions (J) and (K) below, the
results of this monitoring shall be included in the report.



   (E)   Reports of changed conditions. Each user must notify the POTW
Director of any planned significant changes to the user’s operations or
system which might alter the nature, quality or volume of its wastewater at
least 30 days before the change. See division (F)(4) below for other
reporting requirements.



      (1)   The POTW Director may require the user to submit such
information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition,
including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under
§ 51.054(B).



      (2)   The POTW Director may issue a wastewater discharge
permit under § 51.054(B) or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit
under § 51.054(B) in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed
conditions.



      (3)   For purposes of this requirement, significant changes
include, but are not limited to, flow increases of 20% or greater, and the
discharge of any previously unreported pollutants.



   (F)   Reports of potential problems.



      (1)   In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited
to, accidental discharges, discharges of a non-routine, episodic nature, a
non-customary batch discharge or a slug load as defined in § 51.051, that
may cause potential problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately
telephone and notify the POTW Director of the incident. This notification
shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and
volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user.



      (2)   Within five days following such discharge, the user
shall, unless waived by the POTW Director, submit a detailed written report
describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the
user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not
relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage or other liability which may be
incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources or any other
damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of
any fines, penalties or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this
subchapter.



      (3)   A notice shall be permanently posted on the user’s
bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in
the event of a discharge described in division (F)(1) above. Employers shall
ensure that all employees, who may cause such a discharge to occur, are
advised of the emergency notification procedure.



      (4)   All SRN are required to notify the POTW immediately of
any changes at its facility affecting the potential for spills and other
accidental discharge, discharge of a non-routine, episodic nature, a
non-customary batch discharge or a slug load as defined in § 51.051.



   (G)   Reports from unpermitted users. All users not required to
obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the
POTW Director as the POTW Director may require.



   (H)   Notice of violation/repeat sampling and reporting.



      (1)   If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation,
the user must notify the POTW Director within 24 hours of becoming aware of
the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and
submit the results of the repeat analysis to the POTW Director within 30 days
after becoming aware of the violation. If allowed by the POTW Director, the
user is not required to resample:



         (a)   If the POTW Director monitors at the user’s
facility at least once a month; or



         (b)   If the POTW Director samples between the user’s
initial sampling and when the user receives the results of this sampling.



      (2)   If the POTW Director does not require the user to
perform any self-monitoring and the POTW sampling of the user indicates a
violation, the POTW Director shall repeat the sampling and obtain the results
of the repeat analysis within 30 days after becoming aware of the violations,
unless one of the following occurs:



         (a)   The POTW Director monitors at the user’s
facility at least once a month;



         (b)   The POTW Director samples the user between their
initial sampling and when the POTW receives the results of this initial
sampling; or



         (c)   The POTW Director requires the user to perform
sampling and submit the results to the POTW Director within the 30-day
deadline of the POTW becoming aware of the violation.



   (I)   Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste. The city
prohibits the discharge of any hazardous wastes without notification and
approval of the POTW Director.



      (1)   Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste
shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director,
and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the
POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous
waste under 40 C.F.R. Part 261. Such notification must include the name of
the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 C.F.R. Part 261, the EPA hazardous
waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch or other). If the
user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to
the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to
the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an
identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an
estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the waste
stream discharge during the calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of
constituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged during the
following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days
after the discharge commences. Any notification under this division (I)(1)
need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharge. However,
notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under division (E)
above. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to
pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment
standards under the self-monitoring requirements of divisions (A), (C) and
(D) above.



      (2)   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of division
(I)(1) above, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15
kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes
as specific in 40 C.F.R. §§ 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than
15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any
quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 C.F.R. §§ 261.30(d)
and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during
which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do
not require additional notification.



      (3)   In the case of any new regulation under § 3001 of RCRA
identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any
additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the POTW
Director, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and
state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within
90 days of the effective date of such regulations.



      (4)   In the case of any notification made under this section,
the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume
and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to
be economically practical.



      (5)   This provision does not create a right to discharge any
substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this subchapter, a
permit issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.



   (J)   Analytical requirements. All pollutant analyses, including
sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit
application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques
prescribed in 40 C.F.R. Part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable
categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 C.F.R. Part 136 does not contain
sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and
analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by EPA.



   (K)   Grab and composite sample collection.



      (1)   All wastewater samples. All wastewater samples must be
representative of the user’s discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow
measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean and maintained
in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its
monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user
to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge.



      (2)   Grab samples. Grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide,
total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, volatile organic compounds, and any
other pollutants as required by 40 C.F.R. Part 136. The POTW shall determine
the number of grabs necessary to be representative of the user’s discharge.
See 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(g)(5) for additional grab sample number requirements
for BMR and 90 day compliance reports. Additionally, the POTW Director may
allow collection of multiple grabs during a 24-hour period which are
composited prior to analysis as allowed under 40 C.F.R. Part 136.



      (3)   Composite samples. All wastewater composite samples
shall be collected with a minimum of hourly aliquots or grabs for each hour
that there is a discharge. All wastewater composite samples shall be
collected using flow proportional composite collection techniques, unless
time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the
POTW Director. When



authorizing time-proportional composites or grabs, the samples must be
representative and the decision to allow the alternative sampling must be
documented.



   (L)   Timing. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted
on the date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid,
into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date
of receipt of the report shall govern.



   (M)   Record keeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of
this subchapter shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying,
all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities
required by this subchapter and any additional records of information
obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent
of such requirements. Records shall include the date, exact place, method and
time of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates
analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical
techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records
shall remain available for a period of at least three years. This period
shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning
the user or the city, or where the user has been specifically notified of a
longer retention period by the POTW Director.



   (N)   Electronic reporting. The POTW Director may develop procedures
for receipt of electronic reports for any reporting requirements of this
subchapter. Such procedures shall comply with 40 C.F.R. Part 3. These
procedures shall be enforceable under § 51.058.



(2009 Code, § 51.40)  (Ord. passed 2-27-2007)



§ 51.056  COMPLIANCE MONITORING.



   (A)   Monitoring facilities.



      (1)   The city requires the user to provide and operate at the
user’s own expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling and
flow measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage systems. The
monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user’s premises, but
the city may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue
hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public
street or sidewalk area and located so that it will not be obstructed by
landscaping or parked vehicles.



      (2)   There shall be ample room in or near such sampling
manhole or facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for
analysis. The facility, sampling and measuring equipment shall be maintained
at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the
user.



      (3)   Whether constructed on public or private property, the
sampling and monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the
requirements of the city and all applicable local construction standards and
specifications. Construction shall be completed within 90 days following
written notification by the city.



   (B)   Inspection and sampling. The city will inspect the facilities
of any user to ascertain whether the purpose of this subchapter is being met
and all requirements are being complied with. Persons or occupants of
premises where wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the city,
approval authority and EPA or their representative ready access at all
reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection,
sampling, records examination and copying or in the performance of any of
their duties. The city, approval authority and EPA shall have the right to
set up on the user’s property such devices as are necessary to conduct
sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations. Where
a user has security measures in force which would require proper
identification and clearance before entry into their premises, the user shall
make necessary arrangements with their security guards so that upon
presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the city, approval
authority and EPA will be permitted to enter, without delay, for the purposes
of performing their specific responsibilities. Denial of the POTW
Director’s approval authority’s, or EPA’s, access to the user’s
premises shall be a violation of this subchapter. Unreasonable delays may
constitute denial of access.



   (C)   Search warrants. If the POTW Director, approval authority, or
EPA has been refused access to a building, structure or property, or any part
thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may
be a violation of this subchapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or
sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program of the city
designed to verify compliance with this subchapter or any permit or order
issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare
of the community, then the POTW Director, approval authority or EPA may seek
issuance of a search warrant from the court having jurisdiction within the
city.



(2009 Code, § 51.41)  (Ord. passed 2-27-2007)  Penalty, see § 51.999



§ 51.057  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.



   (A)   Information and data on a user obtained from reports,
questionnaires, permit applications, permits and monitoring programs and from
inspections shall be available to the public or other governmental agency
without restriction unless the user specifically requests and is able to
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the POTW Director that the release of such
information would divulge information, processes or methods of production
entitled to protection as trade secrets of the user. Any such request must be
asserted at the time of submission of the information or data.



   (B)   When requested by the person furnishing a report, the portions
of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not
be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available
upon written request to governmental agencies for uses related to this
subchapter, the national pollutant discharge elimination system (NPDES)
permit, non-discharge permit and/or the pretreatment programs; provided,
however, that such portions of a report shall be available for use by the
state or any state agency in judicial review or enforcement proceedings
involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and
characteristics will not be recognized as confidential information.



   (C)   All records relating to compliance with pretreatment standards
shall be made available to officials of the approval authority and EPA upon
request.



(2009 Code, § 51.42)  (Ord. passed 2-27-2007)



§ 51.058  ENFORCEMENT.



   (A)   Administrative remedies.



      (1)   Notification of violation. Whenever the POTW Director
finds that any industrial user has violated or is violating this subchapter,
wastewater permit or any prohibition, limitation or requirements contained
therein or any other pretreatment requirement, the POTW Director may serve
upon such a person a written notice stating the nature of the violation.
Within 30 days from the date of this notice, an explanation for the violation
and a plan for the satisfactory correction thereof shall be submitted to the
city by the user. Submission of this plan does not relieve the discharger of
liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice
of violation.



      (2)   Consent orders. The POTW Director is hereby empowered to
enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other
similar documents establishing an agreement with the person responsible for
the noncompliance. Such orders will include specific action to be taken by
the discharger to correct the noncompliance within a time period also
specified by the order. Consent orders shall have the same force and effect
as an administrative order issued pursuant to division (A)(4) below.



      (3)   Show cause hearing.



         (a)   The POTW Director may order any industrial user
who causes or is responsible for an unauthorized discharge, has violated this
subchapter or is in noncompliance with a wastewater discharge permit to show
cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken. In the event the
POTW Director determines that a show cause order should be issued, a notice
shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the hearing,
the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request
that the user show cause why this proposed enforcement action should not be
taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by registered
or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten days before the
hearing. Service may be made on any agent or officer of a corporation.



         (b)   The POTW Director shall review the evidence
presented at the hearing and determine whether the proposed enforcement
action is appropriate.



         (c)   A show cause hearing under this section is not a
prerequisite to the assessment of a civil penalty under division (B) below
nor is any action or inaction taken by the POTW Director under this section
subject to an administrative appeal under § 51.054(B)(8).



      (4)   Administrative orders. When the POTW Director finds that
an industrial user has violated or continues to violate this subchapter,
permits or orders issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment requirement the
POTW Director may issue an order to cease and desist all such violations and
direct those persons in noncompliance to do any of the following:



         (a)   Immediately comply with all requirements;



         (b)   Comply in accordance with a compliance time
schedule set forth in the order;



         (c)   Take appropriate remedial or preventive action in
the event of a continuing or threatened violation; or



         (d)   Disconnect unless adequate treatment facilities,
devices or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated
within a specified time period.



      (5)   Emergency suspensions.



         (a)   The POTW Director may suspend the wastewater
treatment service and/or wastewater permit when such suspension is necessary
in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may
present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of
persons or the environment, interferes with the POTW or causes the POTW to
violate any condition of its NPDES or non-discharge permit.



         (b)   Any user notified of a suspension of the
wastewater treatment service and/or the wastewater permit shall immediately
stop or eliminate the contribution. A hearing will be held within 15 days of
the notice of suspension to determine whether the suspension may be lifted or
the user’s waste discharge permit terminated. In the event of a failure to
comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the POTW Director shall take
such steps as deemed necessary including immediate severance of the sewer
connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system or endangerment
to any individuals. The POTW Director shall reinstate the wastewater permit
and the wastewater treatment service upon proof of the elimination of the
noncompliant discharge. The industrial user shall submit a detailed written
statement describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures
taken to prevent any future occurrence to the POTW Director prior to the date
of the above-described hearing.



      (6)   Termination of permit or permission to discharge.



         (a)   The POTW Director may revoke a wastewater
discharge permit or permission to discharge for good cause, including, but
not limited to, the following reasons:



            1.   Failure to accurately report the wastewater
constituents and characteristics of his or her discharge;



            2.   Failure to report significant changes in
operations, or wastewater constituents and characteristics;



            3.   Refusal of reasonable access to the user’s
premises for the purpose of inspection or monitoring; or



            4.   Violation of conditions of the permit or
permission to discharge, conditions of this subchapter, or any applicable
state and federal regulations.



         (b)   Noncompliant industrial users will be notified of
the proposed termination of their wastewater permit and will be offered an
opportunity to show cause under division (A) above why the proposed action
should not be taken.



   (B)   Other available remedies. Remedies, in addition to those
previously mentioned in this subchapter, are available to the POTW Director
who may use any single one or combination against a noncompliant user.
Additional available remedies include, but are not limited to the following.



      (1)   Criminal violations. The District Attorney for the
applicable judicial district may, at the request of the city, prosecute
noncompliant users who violate the provisions of G.S. § 143-215.6B. (Note:
Under North Carolina law, it is a crime to negligently violate any term,
condition or requirement of a pretreatment permit, or negligently fail to
apply for a pretreatment permit, issued by local governments (G.S. §
143-215.6B(f)), to knowingly and willfully violate any term, condition or
requirement of a pretreatment permit, or knowingly and willfully fail to
apply for a pretreatment permit, issued by local governments (G.S. §
143-215.6B(g)), to knowingly violate any term, condition or requirement of a
pretreatment permit issued by local governments, or knowingly fail to apply
for a pretreatment permit, knowing at the time that a person is placed in
imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury, (G.S. § 143-215.6B(h)),
and to falsify information required under G.S. Ch. 143, Article 21 (G.S. §
143-215.6B(i)).)



      (2)   Injunctive relief. Whenever a user is in violation of
the provisions of this subchapter or an order or permit issued hereunder, the
POTW Director, through the City Attorney, may petition the Superior Court of
Justice for the issuance of a restraining order or a preliminary and
permanent injunction which restrains or compels the activities in question.



      (3)   Water supply severance. Whenever an industrial user is
in violation of the provisions of this subchapter or an order or permit
issued hereunder, water service to the industrial user may be severed and
service will only recommence, at the user’s expense, after it has
satisfactorily demonstrated ability to comply.



      (4)   Public nuisances. Any violation of the prohibitions or
effluent limitations of this subchapter or of a permit or order issued
hereunder, is hereby declared a public nuisance and shall be corrected or
abated as directed by the POTW Director. Any person(s) creating a public
nuisance shall be subject to the provisions of the appropriate ordinances of
the city governing such nuisances, including reimbursing the POTW for any
costs incurred in removing, abating or remedying said nuisance.



   (C)   Remedies nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in this
section are not exclusive. The POTW Director may take any, all or any
combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of
pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the city’s
enforcement response plan. However, the POTW Director may take other action
against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the POTW Director
is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any
noncompliant user.

§ 51.060  AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS.



   (A)   Upset.



      (1)   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an
action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if
the requirements of division (A)(2) below are met.



      (2)   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense
of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous
operating logs or other relevant evidence that:



         (a)   An upset occurred and the user can identify the
cause(s) of the upset;



         (b)   The facility was at the time being operated in a
prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation
and maintenance procedures; and



         (c)   The user has submitted the following information
to the POTW Director within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this
information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within
five days):



            1.   A description of the indirect discharge and
cause of noncompliance;



            2.   The period of noncompliance, including exact
dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance
is expected to continue; and



            3.   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce,
eliminate and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.



      (3)   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to
establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.



      (4)   Users will have the opportunity for a judicial
determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for
noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards.



      (5)   Users shall control production of all discharges to the
extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment
standards upon reduction, loss or failure of its treatment facility until the
facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This
requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary
source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails.



   (B)   Prohibited discharge standards defense. A user shall have an
affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for
noncompliance with the general prohibitions in § 51.052(A)(1) or the
specific prohibitions in § 51.052(A)(2)(b), (c) and (e) through (g) if it
can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge,
alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass
through or interference and that either:



      (1)   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and
the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the
pass through or interference; or



      (2)   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change
substantially in nature or constituents from the user’s prior discharge
when the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the
case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or
disposal requirements.



   (C)   Bypass.



      (1)   A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not
cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it
also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These
bypasses are not subject to the provision of divisions (C)(2) and (C)(3)
below.



      (2)   (a)   If a user knows in advance of the need for a
bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the POTW Director, at least ten days
before the date of the bypass, if possible.



         (b)   A user shall submit oral notice to the POTW
Director of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment
standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A
written submission shall also be provided within five days of this time the
user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a
description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass,
including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected,
the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned
to reduce, eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The POTW
Director may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral
report has been received within 24 hours.



      (3)   (a)   Bypass is prohibited, and the POTW Director may
take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:



            1.   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of
life, personal injury or severe property damage;



            2.   There were no feasible alternatives to the
bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of
untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime.
This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have
been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent
a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or
preventive maintenance; and



            3.   The user submitted notices as required under
division (C)(2) above of this section.



         (b)   The POTW Director may approve an anticipated
bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the POTW Director
determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in division (C)(3)
above.

§ 51.076  DEFINITIONS.



   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall
apply unless the context indicates or requires a different meaning.



   COOKING ESTABLISHMENTS. Those establishments primarily engaged in
activities of preparing, serving or otherwise making available for
consumption foodstuffs and that use one or more of the following preparation
activities: cooking by frying (all methods), baking (all methods), grilling,
sautéing, rotisserie cooking, broiling (all methods), boiling, blanching,
roasting, toasting or poaching. Also included are infrared heating, searing,
barbecuing and any other food preparation activity that produces a hot,
non-drinkable food product in or on a receptacle that requires washing.



   FATS, OILS AND GREASE. Organic polar compounds derived from animal
and/or plant sources that contain multiple carbon chain triglyceride
molecules. These substances are detectable and measurable using analytical
test procedures established in 40 C.F.R. Part 136, as may be amended from
time to time. All are sometimes referred to herein as GREASE.



   GREASE TRAP OR INTERCEPTOR. A device for separating and retaining
waterborne grease complexes prior to the wastewater exiting the trap and
entering the sanitary sewer collection and treatment system. These devices
also serve to collect settlable solids, generated by and from food
preparation activities, prior to the water exiting the trap and entering the
sanitary sewer collection and treatment system. GREASE TRAPS AND INTERCEPTORS
are sometimes referred to herein as GREASE INTERCEPTORS.



   MINIMUM DESIGN CAPABILITY. The design features of a grease interceptor
and its ability or volume required to effectively intercept and retain grease
from grease-laden wastewaters discharged to the public sanitary sewer.



   NON-COOKING ESTABLISHMENTS. Those establishments primarily engaged in
the preparation of precooked foodstuffs that do not include any form of
cooking. These include cold dairy and frozen foodstuffs preparation and
serving establishments.



   USER. Any person, including those located outside the jurisdictional
limits of the city, who contributes, causes or permits the contribution or
discharge of wastewater into the POTW, including persons who contribute the
wastewater from mobile sources, such as those who discharge hauled wastewater.



(2009 Code, § 51.66)  (Ord. passed 8-14-2007)



§ 51.077  GREASE INTERCEPTOR MAINTENANCE, RECORD KEEPING AND GREASE REMOVAL.



   (A)   Grease interceptors shall be installed by users as required by
the Director or Building Inspector. Grease interceptors shall be installed at
the user’s expense, when the user operates a cooking establishment. Grease
interceptors may also be required in non-cooking or cold diary and frozen
foodstuffs establishments and other industrial or commercial establishments
when they are deemed necessary by the Director for the proper handling of
liquid wastes containing grease. No user shall allow wastewater discharge
concentration from subject grease interceptor to exceed 100 milligrams per
liter, as identified by EPA Method 1664 and defined in § 51.052(C). All
grease interceptors shall be of a type, design and capacity approved by the
Director or Building Inspector and shall be readily and easily accessible for
user cleaning and city inspection. All out-of-building grease interceptors
shall have a slotted filter installed on the outlet pipe, designed to reduce
grease concentrations. All the grease interceptors shall be serviced and
emptied of accumulated waste content as required in order to maintain minimum
design capability or effective volume of the grease interceptor, but not less
often than every 60 days. Users who are required to pass water through a
grease interceptor shall:



      (1)   Provide for a minimum hydraulic retention time of 24
minutes at actual peak flow or 12 minutes at the calculated theoretical peak
flow rate as predicted by the Uniform Plumbing Code fixture criteria, between
the influent and effluent baffles with 20% of the total volume of the grease
interceptor being allowed for sludge to settle and accumulate, identified
hereafter as a “sludge pocket”;



      (2)   Remove any accumulated grease cap and sludge pocket as
required, but at intervals of not longer than 60 days or less as to be
determined by the establishment’s grease loading in compliance with the
grease trap inspector at the users’ expense. Grease interceptor shall be
kept free of inorganic solid materials such as grit, rocks, gravel, sand,
eating utensils, cigarettes, shells, towels, rags and the like which could
settle into this pocket and thereby reduce the effective volume of the grease
interceptor;



      (3)   Accept the following conditions: if any skimmed or
pumped wastes or other materials removed from grease interceptor are treated
in any fashion on-site and reintroduced back into the grease interceptor as
an activity of and after the on-site treatment, the user shall be responsible
for the attainment of established grease numerical limit consistent with and
contained in this division (A) on all discharges of wastewater from the
grease interceptor into the city’s sanitary sewer collection and treatment
system;



      (4)   Operate the grease interceptor in a manner so as to
maintain the device such that attainment of the grease limit is consistently
achieved. CONSISTENT shall mean any wastewater sample taken from the grease
interceptor shall be subject to terms of numerical limit attainment described
in this division (A). If an establishment desires, because of documented
space constraints, an alternate to an out-of-building grease interceptor, the
request for an alternative location shall contain the following information:



         (a)   Location of city sewer main and easement in
relation to available exterior space outside building; and



         (b)   Existing plumbing at or in a site that uses common
plumbing for all services at that site.



      (5)   Understand and agree that the use of biological
additives as a grease degradation agent is conditionally permissible, upon
prior written approval by the Director. Any establishment using this method
of grease abatement shall maintain the trap or interceptor in such a manner
that attainment of the grease wastewater discharge limit, as measured from
the trap’s outlet, is consistently achieved;



      (6)   Understand and agree that the use of automatic grease
removal systems is conditionally permissible, upon prior written approval by
the Director, the Building Inspector of the city and the County Department of
Health. Any establishment using this equipment shall operate the system in
such a manner that attainment of the grease wastewater discharge limit, as
measured from the unit’s outlet, is consistently achieved; and



      (7)   Understand and agree that the Director, in consultation
with the Building Inspector, reserves the right to make determinations of
grease interceptor adequacy and need, base on review of all relevant
information regarding grease interceptor performance, facility site and
building plan review and to require repairs to, or modification or
replacement of the traps.



   (B)   The user shall submit a copy of the receipt for each pumping
event no later than ten days after trap has been pumped to:



 

Grease Trap Inspector/Pretreatment Coordinator

P.O. Box 607

Whiteville, N.C. 28472



 



   (C)   The user shall also maintain a written record of trap
maintenance for three years. All the records will be available for inspection
by the city at all times.



   (D)   No non-grease laden sources are allowed to be connected to
sewer lines intended for grease interceptor service.



   (E)   Establishments that are required by this subchapter to install
and maintain approved grease interceptors shall have a period of one year
following the adoption of this subchapter to comply with the installation
requirements. No establishment shall be exempt from the discharge limits
defined in this subchapter or §§ 51.050 through 51.062 and shall be subject
to enforcement procedures stipulated in §§ 51.058 and 51.999 upon violation.



   (F)   Access manholes, with a minimum diameter of 24 inches, shall
be provided over each chamber and sanitary tree. The access manholes shall
extend at least to finished grade and be designed and maintained to prevent
water inflow or infiltration. The manholes shall also have readily removable
covers to facilitate inspection, grease removal and wastewater sampling
activities.



   (G)   The city shall be allowed access to all grease interceptors
for inspection and sampling activities.



   (H)   Failure to achieve limits on grease discharges from grease
interceptors or an obstruction of a city sewer main(s) occurs that causes a
sewer overflow to the extent that an impact on the environment is realized
and that the overflow or failure of the sanitary sewer collection system to
convey sewage can be attributed in part or in whole to an accumulation of
grease in the city’s sewer main(s), shall result in enforcement action by
the city, as stipulated in the city’s industrial pretreatment enforcement
plan and §§ 51.050 through 51.062, against the generator or contributor of
the grease.



(2009 Code, § 51.67)  (Ord. passed 8-14-2007)  Penalty, see § 51.999



§ 51.999  PENALTY.



   (A)   Generally.  Any person violating any provision of this
chapter, for which no other penalty is provided, shall be subject to the
penalty provisions of § 10.99.



   (B)   Civil penalties.



      (1) Any user who is found to have failed to comply with any
provision of §§ 51.050 through 51.062, or the orders, rules, regulations
and permits issued hereunder, may be fined up to $25,000 per day per
violation. Penalties between $10,000 and $25,000 per day per violation may be
assessed against a violator only if:



         (a)   For any class of violation, only if a civil
penalty has been imposed against the violator within the five years preceding
the violation; or



         (b)   In the case of failure to file, submit or make
available, as the case may be, any documents, data or reports required by
§§ 51.050 through 51.062, or the orders, rules, regulations and permits
issued hereunder, only if the POTW Director determines that the violation was
intentional and a civil penalty has been imposed against the violator within
the five years preceding the violation.



      (2)   In determining the amount of the civil penalty, the POTW
Director shall consider the following:



         (a)   The degree and extent of the harm to the natural
resources, to the public health, or to public or private property resulting
from the violation;



         (b)   The duration and gravity of the violation;

§ 74.01  PURPOSE.



   The purpose of this chapter is to provide a means of travel that is not
only convenient and safe, but conserves resources and protects the
environment. Golf carts, if properly used, are effective ways to travel for
short distances within the city. However, to ensure the public safety and
welfare, the operation of golf carts must not only comply with state
regulations regarding vehicles, but should comply with special safety
regulations intended to protect the operator and passengers in a vehicle that
is primarily designed for operation on a golf course or recreational
purposes. This chapter establishes the basic, minimum standards of care to be
used by the operators of golf carts on public roads, streets and highways.
Likewise, the public safety requires that golf carts, used as a means of
transportation, must also meet certain minimum safety standards that can only
be assured through a system of registration and inspection. The registration
and inspection of golf carts is required in order to protect the public
health, safety and welfare.

§ 74.02  DEFINITIONS.



   For purposes of this section, those definitions set out in G.S. §
20-4.01 shall also apply throughout this chapter. A GOLF CART is defined as a
vehicle designed and manufactured for operation on a golf course for sporting
or recreational purposes and that is not capable of exceeding 20 mph. The
definition is republished here for convenience, only, and the definition set
out in G.S. § 20-4.01(12), as amended from time to time, is controlling for
all purposes.

owner a notice of intent to destroy the dog. The owner may appeal this
intended action by filing a written request for appeal with the City Manager
as specified in division (C) of this section.

business days, or if the owner does not request an appeal within the time
limit provided, the dog shall be deemed abandoned and shall be disposed of in

§ 82.07  SOUND MEASUREMENT PROCEDURES.



   (A)   For the purpose of determining decibels (dB(A)) as referenced
in this chapter, the noise shall be measured on the “A-weighting scale slow
response” on a sound level meter of standard design and quality having
characteristics established by the American National Standards Institute.



   (B)   When the Noise Control Officer determines that insufficient
prima facie evidence exists for establishing a noise violation case, the
investigating officer will use a sound-level meter to measure the sound
level. Sound measurements shall be conducted at that time, day or night, when
the suspect noise source is emitting sound.



   (C)   The following procedures shall be utilized in the sound
measurement process.



      (1)   The sound measurement equipment shall have been
calibrated.



      (2)   Prior to obtaining the sound sample, the sound level
meter shall be set to the “A” weighted network at slow response.



      (3)   The omni-directional microphone shall be set in an
approximate 70-degree position, approximately four feet from the ground or
floor, facing the noise source while recording the meter’s instantaneous
response (reading) observed at consecutive ten-second intervals, taking ten
to 15 sample readings.



      (4)   No individual other than the operator of the sound meter
shall be within ten feet of the sound level meter during the measurement
process.

§ 82.08  CHRONIC NOISE PRODUCERS.



   (A)   The purpose of this section is to establish a collaborative
process through which the city and the owner/manager/occupant of a property
that has been identified as a chronic source of objectionable noise will
develop and implement a noise mitigation plan intended to bring the noise to
acceptable levels. A chronic noise producer is a location that, because of
the sound generated by or at the location, is an annoyance to adjacent or
nearby residences, lodgings, schools, businesses or other places where people
may congregate with a reasonable expectation of undisturbed activity. An
establishment may be a chronic noise producer without having violated other
provisions of this chapter.



   (B)   The Chief of Police (or designee) may designate the
owner/manager/occupant of the location as a chronic noise producer. In making
such a determination, among other factors, the following shall be taken into
consideration:



      (1)   The number and frequency of valid noise complaints;



      (2)   The proximity and physical relationship between the
location and the complaining location(s);



      (3)   The severity of the sound events, both observed or
measured;



      (4)   The times and days of the week of sound events;



      (5)   The location’s history of cooperation and efforts to
alleviate the problem; and



      (6)   The history and context of the location, including
whether the sound producing activity predates the occupation of the
complaining locations and/or whether the sound producing location is located
in what is generally recognized as an entertainment area.



   (C)   Upon designation as a chronic noise producer, the Chief of
Police shall inform the location owner/manager/occupant of the location and
that it has been referred to the Chronic Noise Mitigation Committee.



      (1)   The city’s Safety Committee shall serve as the Chronic
Noise Mitigation Committee (“Committee”) for the purposes of this
section. The Committee may request and consider the input of city staff
and/or external experts with expertise in the type of location and/or noise
under review.



      (2)   The Committee shall schedule a meeting with
representatives of the location to review the information that formed the
basis for the designation and any additional information concerning the noise
produced at the location.



      (3)   Following the meeting, the Committee shall determine
whether a mitigation plan is warranted. If determined warranted, the

§ 87.05  JUNKED MOTOR VEHICLE REGULATED; REMOVAL AUTHORIZED.



   (A)   It shall be unlawful for the registered owner or person
entitled to the possession of a junked motor vehicle, or for the owner,
lessee or occupant of the real property upon which a junked motor vehicle is
located to leave or allow the vehicle to remain on the property after the
vehicle has been ordered removed.



   (B)   It shall be unlawful to have more than one junked motor
vehicle, as defined herein, on the premises of public or private property.
Single, permitted junked motor vehicle must strictly comply with the location
and concealment requirements of this section.



   (C)   It shall be unlawful for any owner, person entitled to the
possession of a junked motor vehicle or for the owner, lessee or occupant of
the real property upon which a junked motor vehicle is located to fail to
comply with the locational requirements or the concealment requirements of
this section.



   (D)   Subject to the provisions of division (E) below, upon
investigation, the Planning Department may order the removal of a junked
motor vehicle as defined in this subchapter after finding in writing that the
aesthetic benefits of removing the vehicle outweigh the burdens imposed on
the private property owner. The finding shall be based on a balancing of the
monetary loss of the apparent owner against the corresponding gain to the
public by promoting or enhancing community, neighborhood or area appearance.
The following among other relevant factors may be considered:



      (1)   Protection of property values;



      (2)   Promotion of tourism and other economic development
opportunities;



      (3)   Indirect protection of public health and safety;



      (4)   Preservation of the character and integrity of the
community; and



      (5)   Promotion of the comfort, happiness and emotional
stability of area residents.



   (E)   Permitted concealment or enclosure of junked motor vehicle:



      (1)   One junked motor vehicle. In its entirety, can be
located in the rear yard as defined by the city’s zoning ordinance if the
junked motor vehicle is entirely concealed from public view from a public
street and from abutting premises by an acceptable covering;



      (2)   Concealment. The Planning Department has the authority
to determine whether any junked motor vehicle is adequately concealed as
required by this provision. The covering must remain in good repair and must
not be allowed to deteriorate; and/or



      (3)   More than one junked motor vehicle. Any other junked
motor vehicle(s) must be kept in a garage or building structure that provides
a complete enclosure so that the junked motor vehicle(s) cannot be seen from
a public street or abutting property. A garage or building structure means
either a lawful, nonconforming use or a garage or building structure erected
pursuant to the lawful issuance of a building permit and which has been
constructed in accordance with all Zoning and Building Code regulations.

PRE-TOWING NOTICE REQUIREMENTS.



   (A)   Except as set forth in § 87.07, an abandoned, nuisance or
junked vehicle which is to be removed shall be towed only after notice to the
registered owner or person entitled to possession of the vehicle. In the case
of a nuisance vehicle or a junked motor vehicle, if the names and mailing
addresses of the registered owner or person entitled to the possession of the
vehicle, or the owner, lessee or occupant of the real property upon which the
vehicle is located can be ascertained in the exercise of reasonable
diligence, the notice shall be given by first-class mail. The person who
mails the notice(s) shall retain a written record to show the name(s) and
address(es) to which mailed, and the date mailed. If the names and addresses
cannot be ascertained or if the vehicle to be removed is an abandoned motor
vehicle, notice shall be given by affixing on the windshield or some other
conspicuous place on the vehicle, a notice indicating that the vehicle will
be removed by the city on a specified date (no sooner than seven days after
the notice is affixed). The notice shall state that the vehicle will be
removed by the city on a specified date, no sooner than seven days after the
notice is affixed or mailed, unless the vehicle is moved by the owner or
legal possessor prior to that time to private property in a manner not in
violation of this subchapter.



   (B)   With respect to abandoned vehicles on private property,
nuisance vehicles and junked motor vehicles to which notice is required to be
given, if the registered owner or person entitled to possession does not
remove the vehicle but chooses to appeal the determination that the vehicle
is abandoned, a nuisance vehicle or in the case of a junked motor vehicle
that the aesthetic benefits of removing the vehicle outweigh the burdens, the
appeal shall be made to the City Manager within ten days of receipt of the
notice, and further proceedings to remove the vehicle shall be stayed until
the appeal is heard and decided.

   (A)   The requirement that notice be given prior to the removal of
an abandoned, nuisance or junked motor vehicle may, as determined by the
authorizing official, be omitted in those circumstances where there is a
special need for prompt action to eliminate traffic obstructions or to
otherwise maintain and protect the public safety and welfare.



   (B)   The findings shall, in all cases, be entered by the
authorizing official in the appropriate daily records.

notice includes:



      (1)   Vehicles abandoned on the streets. For vehicles left on

         (b)   Parked in violation of an ordinance prohibiting or
restricting parking;



         (c)   Parked in a no-stopping or standing zone;

restrictions imposed under code sections; or



         (g)   Parking in designated fire lanes.



      (2)   Other abandoned or nuisance vehicles. With respect to
abandoned or nuisance vehicles left on city-owned property other than the
streets and highways, and on private property, the vehicles may be removed
without giving prior notice only in those circumstances where the authorizing
official finds a special need for prompt action to protect and maintain the
public health, safety and welfare. By way of illustration and not of
limitation, the circumstances include vehicles blocking or obstructing
ingress or egress to businesses and residences, vehicles parked in such a
location or manner as to pose a traffic hazard, and vehicles causing damage
to public or private property.

notice, including the information set forth in divisions (A)(1) through
(A)(5) above, shall also be mailed to the registered owner’s last known
address, unless this notice is waived in writing by the vehicle owner or his
or her agent. If the vehicle is registered in North Carolina, notice shall be
given within 24 hours. If the vehicle is not registered in the state, notice
shall be given to the registered owner within 72 hours from the removal of
the vehicle.



   (C)   Whenever an abandoned, nuisance or junked motor vehicle is
removed, and the vehicle has no valid registration or registration plates,
the authorizing city official shall make reasonable efforts, including
checking the vehicle identification number, to determine the last known
registered owner of the vehicle and to notify him or her of the information
set forth in divisions (A)(1) through (A)(5) above.

entitled to a hearing for the purpose of determining probable cause existed
for removing the vehicle. A request for hearing must be filed in writing with
the county magistrate designated by the Chief District Court Judge to receive
the hearing requests. The magistrate will set the hearing within 72 hours of
receipt of the request, and the hearing will be conducted in accordance with

   At any stage in the proceedings, including before the probable cause
hearing, the owner may obtain possession of the removed vehicle by paying the
towing fee, including any storage charges or by posting a bond for double the
amount of the fees and charges to the tow truck operator or towing business
having custody of the removed vehicle. Upon regaining possession of a

§ 91.03  FILMING GUIDELINES.



   (A)   Notification of affected businesses and residents. All local
businesses and/or residents which will be burdened or affected by the
activity must be contacted immediately after approval of the film permit or
at least seven days before filming or related activities are scheduled to
proceed, whichever is longer. The production company must furnish the city

inconvenient hours and the like.



   (B)   Traffic-control, street closures and police/fire services.
Approval must be obtained from the city and, if applicable, the North
Carolina Department of Transportation when film activity will obstruct the
flow of vehicular traffic or call for a street closing.



      (1)   Traffic control shall be handled by off-duty city police
officers who shall be paid by the production company. Unless specifically
described and approved in the film permit, intermittent traffic holding
patterns should last no longer than three minutes.

additional day of filming. In addition to the permit fee, there are charges
associated with the use of certain city services, vehicles and personnel.



   (F)   Violations. Any violation of the conditions set forth in the
film permit, any local ordinance or the requirements of the City Building
Inspector or City Engineer may result in the cancellation of the permit by
the city. Should the film permit be cancelled, the company shall then be
required to cease all filming activities and remove all equipment and
personnel from the premises. Further violations of any local ordinance shall
constitute a misdemeanor, as described in § 10.99 of this code of ordinances.



   (G)   Insurance. In the event city property will be used during the
filming, the city will require adequate insurance coverage for claims arising
from bodily injury and/or property damage which may arise directly or

§ 92.01  PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.



   (A)   The City Council does hereby find that:



      (1)   It is the intent of Council in enacting this chapter to
recognize free speech rights for all citizens while at the same time
protecting the coexistent rights for all citizens to enjoy safe and
convenient travel in public spaces free from intimidating conduct, threats,
and harassment that stem from certain types of abusive solicitation, that may
occur at particular settings and contexts;



      (2)   Council finds that there are numerous forms of
solicitation that are not in and of themselves inherently threatening or
aggressive, including vocal requests for a donation; carrying or displaying a
sign requesting donations; shaking or jingling a cup of change; and ringing a
bell in compliance with any applicable noise ordinance;



      (3)   However, Council finds that there has been an increase
in aggressive solicitation in the city, which threatens the security,
privacy, and freedom of movement of both residents and visitors; and



      (4)   Council also finds that the presence of solicitors in
certain specific areas (such as, but not limited to near to adjacent to
automatic teller machines, adjacent to sidewalk cafes, and in public parking
areas) create reasonable concerns by citizens objectively worried about their
privacy, freedom of movement, and personal security; and



      (5)   Council further finds that certain solicitation impedes
the orderly flow of pedestrian and vehicular traffic that leads to concerns
regarding traffic and public safety, particularly in congested roadways and
sidewalks (to include highly traveled areas, or small traffic medians).



      (6)   This chapter is not intended to impermissibly limit an
individual's right to exercise free speech associated with solicitation;
rather it aims to impose specific time, place, and manner restrictions on
solicitation and associated conduct in certain limited circumstances; namely,
aggressive panhandling, panhandling at locations or times deemed particularly
threatening and dangerous, and/or panhandling in places where people are a
"captive audience" and there is a wish to avoid or reduce a threat of
inescapable confrontations; and



      (7)   In promulgating this chapter, Council seeks to impose
regulations that are narrowly tailored to serve the aforementioned
significant government interests.



   (B)   The purpose of this section is to regulate certain behavior to
preserve the public order, to protect the citizens of Whiteville and to
ensure the safe and uninterrupted passage of both pedestrian and vehicular
traffic, without unconstitutionally impinging upon protected speech,
expression or conduct.

§ 92.02  DEFINITIONS.



   AGGRESSIVE BEGGING, PANHANDLING or SOLICITATION. Includes the following
forms of conduct:



      (1)   Confronting someone in a way that would cause a
reasonable person to fear bodily harm;



      (2)   Accosting an individual by approaching or speaking to
the individual or individuals in such a manner as would cause a reasonable
person to fear imminent harm or the commission of a criminal act upon his or
her person, or upon property in his or her immediate possession;



      (3)   Touching someone without his or her consent;

§ 92.03  PASSIVE BEGGING, PANHANDLING, CHARITABLE AND POLITICAL
SOLICITATION: WHEN REGULATED.



   Passive panhandling, begging, charitable or political solicitation
permitted except where expressly prohibited. The City Council finds that
PASSIVE PANHANDLING, BEGGING, CHARITABLE OR POLITICAL SOLICITATION as defined
in § 92.02 should be treated as speech protected under the First Amendment
unless other well-grounded governmental concerns are implicated. Accordingly,
passive panhandling, begging, charitable or political solicitation is
permitted throughout the jurisdiction except as prohibited in §§ 92.05 and
92.06; however provided is that passive panhandling, begging, charitable or
political solicitation is permitted on small traffic medians within the
Columbus County Historic Courthouse square.

SOLICITATION PROHIBITED.



   Aggressive panhandling, begging, charitable and political solicitation
prohibited. No person shall engage in aggressive panhandling, begging,

§ 92.05  REGULATION OF PANHANDLING, BEGGING, CHARITABLE AND POLITICAL
SOLICITATION IN AREAS WITH SPECIFIC PERSONAL SAFETY AND PRIVACY CONCERNS.



   (A)   Regulated locations. Both passive and aggressive panhandling,
begging, charitable and political solicitation activities are regulated in
the following areas that give rise to specific personal safety and privacy
concerns as defined in § 92.02:



      (1)   Areas with heightened personal security concerns as
previously defined; and



      (2)   Areas with heightened privacy considerations as
previously defined.



   (B)   Prohibition. Neither aggressive nor passive panhandling,
begging, charitable and political solicitation shall be conducted in areas

   (A)   Areas regulated. Areas regulated by this section include those
defined as AREAS WITH HEIGHTENED PUBLIC SAFETY CONCERNS as defined in §
92.02.



   (B)   Findings. The City Council finds as follows:



      (1)   Public safety. Both aggressive and passive begging,
panhandling, charitable or political solicitation on small traffic medians
and traffic medians located on high speed and high volume traffic corridors
as identified in this chapter give rise to an increased risk of injury to
solicitors on medians, traffic congestion, and traffic accidents that may
affect drivers or solicitors.



      (2)   The city assumes no responsibility for persons engaging
in aggressive or passive begging, panhandling, charitable and political
solicitation activities within the city limits.



   (C)   Prohibitions.



      (1)   Generally. Both passive and aggressive begging,
panhandling, charitable and political solicitation shall be restricted in
areas with heightened public safety concerns as defined in § 92.02.



      (2)   Exceptions. The City Council may identify limited
periods each year in which these prohibitions should not be enforced as a
result of particularly pressing governmental concerns related to such
activities.



   (D)   Charitable initiatives. The Council may designate certain days
a year as days on which these prohibitions shall not apply in order to allow
effective solicitation for designated charities.



   (E)   Election activities. The Council may designate certain days a
year as days on which these prohibitions shall not apply in order to allow
effective political communications in connection with local, state, and
federal elections.



   (F)   Accommodations. In the event that the City Council designates
days as exceptions from this chapter's requirements, it may also adopt a
documented public safety plan to reduce risks to public safety that might
otherwise arise.



   (G)   Comparable treatment. To the extent that the City Council
adopts exceptions to the prohibitions set forth in § 92.06 (E)  and (F),
relating to charitable initiatives and election activities, such exceptions
shall extend to all parties otherwise covered by the provisions of this
chapter relating to begging, panhandling, charitable and political
solicitation.

§ 92.20  DOOR-TO-DOOR ACTIVITIES PROHIBITED.



   (A)   Peddler, solicitor, and seller of merchandise means any person
who shall sell, offer for or expose for sale, or who shall trade, deal or

from place to place or by indiscriminately approaching individuals.

thereof, within the city without first having been requested or invited to do
so by the owner or occupant, for the purpose of advertising, peddling, or

county, nor to any bona fide charitable, education, religious, cultural or
governmental institution or organization when the proceeds of the sales are
used directly for the charitable purpose of the institution or organization.
Students that attend a public or private school and who conduct door-to-door
solicitations or donations for school activities are exempted.

   Violators are subject to the issuance of a notice of violation,
subjecting the violator to a civil penalty of $100, which penalty may provide

CURFEW FOR MINORS



§ 100.15  PURPOSE.



   Because minors are particularly vulnerable to being induced to
participate in drug abuse and other criminal activities during the nighttime;
and because there is a need to protect businesses and other persons from
vandalism and other types of criminal activities frequently committed by
minors; and because it is important that parents be encouraged to take an
active role in the proper upbringing of their children, this section will
assist custodians of minor children in the difficult task of child rearing
and the city in regulating those activities which are detrimental to the
health, safety and welfare of its citizens and to the peace and dignity of
the city.

§ 151.01  STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.



   The Legislature of the State of North Carolina has in G.S. Ch. 143,
Article 21, Part 6; G.S. Ch. 160A, Article 19, Parts 3, 5 and 8; and Ch.
160A, Article 8, delegated to local governmental units the responsibility to
adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety and general
welfare of its citizenry.



(2009 Code, § 151.01)  (Ord. passed 5-23-2006)



§ 151.02  FINDINGS OF FACT.



   (A)   The flood prone areas within the jurisdiction of the city are
subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life, property,
health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health,
safety and general welfare.



   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities
and by the occupancy in flood prone areas of uses vulnerable to floods or
other hazards.



(2009 Code, § 151.02)  (Ord. passed 5-23-2006)



§ 151.03  STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.



   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions within flood prone areas by provisions designed to:



   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety
and property due to water or erosion hazards or that result in damaging
increases in erosion, flood heights or velocities;



   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
that serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of
initial construction;



   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels
and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of
flood waters;



   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging and all other development
that may increase erosion or flood damage; and



   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to
other lands.



(2009 Code, § 151.03)  (Ord. passed 5-23-2006)



§ 151.04  OBJECTIVES.



   The objectives of this chapter are:



   (A)   To protect human life and health;



   (B)   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood
control projects;



   (C)   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated
with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;



   (D)   To minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions;



   (E)   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities (i.e.,
water and gas mains, electric, telephone, cable and sewer lines, streets and
bridges) that are located in flood prone areas;



   (F)   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound
use and development of flood prone areas; and



   (G)   To ensure that potential buyers are aware that property is in
a special flood hazard area.

other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The ACTUAL START
means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on
a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles,
the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or
the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction
does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor
does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it
include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the
erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the
property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as

   (A)   This chapter in part comes forward by re-enactment of some of
the provisions of the flood damage prevention ordinance enacted May 10, 1988,
as amended, and it is not the intention to repeal but rather to re-enact and
continue to enforce without interruption of such existing provisions, so that
all rights and liabilities that have accrued thereunder are reserved and may
be enforced. The enactment of this chapter shall not affect any action, suit
or proceeding instituted or pending. All provisions of the flood damage
prevention ordinance of the city enacted on May 10, 1988, as amended, which
are not reenacted herein are repealed.



   (B)   Nothing herein contained shall require any change in the
plans, construction, size or designated use of any development or any part
thereof for which a floodplain development permit has been granted by the
Floodplain Administrator or his or her authorized agents before the time of
passage of this chapter; provided, however, that when construction is not
begun under such outstanding permit within a period of six months subsequent
to the date of issuance of the outstanding permit, construction or use shall
be in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.

   (C)   Certification requirements.



      (1)   Elevation certificates.



         (a)   An elevation certificate (FEMA Form 81-31) is
required prior to the actual start of any new construction. It shall be the
duty of the permit holder to submit to the Floodplain Administrator a
certification of the elevation of the reference level, in relation to mean
sea level. The Floodplain Administrator shall review the certificate data
submitted. Deficiencies detected by such review shall be corrected by the
permit holder prior to the beginning of construction. Failure to submit the
certification or failure to make required corrections shall be cause to deny
a floodplain development permit.



         (b)   An elevation certificate (FEMA Form 81-31) is
required after the reference level is established. Within seven calendar days
of establishment of the reference level elevation, it shall be the duty of
the permit holder to submit to the Floodplain Administrator a certification
of the elevation of the reference level, in relation to mean sea level. Any
work done within the seven-day calendar period and prior to submission of the
certification shall be at the permit holder’s risk. The Floodplain
Administrator shall review the certificate data submitted. Deficiencies
detected by such review shall be corrected by the permit holder immediately
and prior to further work being permitted to proceed. Failure to submit the
certification or failure to make required corrections shall be cause to issue
a stop work order for the project.



         (c)   A final as-built elevation certificate (FEMA Form
81-31) is required after construction is completed and prior to certificate
of compliance/occupancy issuance. It shall be the duty of the permit holder
to submit to the Floodplain Administrator a certification of final as-built
construction of the elevation of the reference level and all attendant
utilities. The Floodplain Administrator shall review the certificate data
submitted. Deficiencies detected by such review shall be corrected by the
permit holder immediately and prior to certificate of compliance/occupancy
issuance. In some instances, another certification may be required to certify
corrected as-built construction. Failure to submit the certification or
failure to make required corrections shall be cause to withhold the issuance
of a certificate of compliance/occupancy.



      (2)   Floodproofing certificate. If nonresidential
floodproofing is used to meet the regulatory flood protection elevation
requirements, a floodproofing certificate (FEMA Form 81-65), with supporting
data and an operational plan, is required prior to the actual start of any
new construction. It shall be the duty of the permit holder to submit to the
Floodplain Administrator a certification of the floodproofed design elevation
of the reference level and all attendant utilities, in relation to mean sea
level. Floodproofing certification shall be prepared by or under the direct
supervision of a professional engineer or architect and certified by same.
The Floodplain Administrator shall review the certificate data and plan.
Deficiencies detected by such review shall be corrected by the applicant
prior to permit approval. Failure to submit the certification or failure to
make required corrections shall be cause to deny a floodplain development
permit. Failure to construct in accordance with the certified design shall be
cause to withhold the issuance of a certificate of compliance/occupancy.



      (3)   Certification required. If a manufactured home is placed
within Zones A, AO, AE or A1-30 and the elevation of the chassis is more than
36 inches in height above grade, an engineered foundation certification is
required per § 151.41(A)(3).



      (4)   Prior to issuance. If a watercourse is to be altered or
relocated, a description of the extent of watercourse alteration or
relocation; a professional engineer’s certified report on the effects of
the proposed project on the flood-carrying capacity of the watercourse and
the effects to properties located both upstream and downstream; and a map
showing the location of the proposed watercourse alteration or relocation
shall all be submitted by the permit applicant prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit.



      (5)   Certification exemptions. The following structures, if
located within Zone A, AO, AE or A1-30, are exempt from the
elevation/floodproofmg certification requirements specified in divisions
(C)(1) and (C)(2) above;



         (a)   Recreational vehicles meeting requirements of §
151.41(A)(6)(a);



         (b)   Temporary structures meeting requirements of §

find that the building or development is in violation of the flood damage
prevention chapter, they shall issue an order in writing to the owner,
requiring the owner to remedy the violation within a specified time period,
not less than 60 calendar days, nor more than 180 calendar days. Where the
Floodplain Administrator finds that there is imminent danger to life or other
property, he or she may order that corrective action be taken in such lesser
period as may be feasible.



   (D)   Appeal. Any owner who has received an order to take corrective
action may appeal the order to the local elected governing body by giving
notice of appeal in writing to the Floodplain Administrator and the Clerk
within ten days following issuance of the final order. In the absence of an
appeal, the order of the Floodplain Administrator shall be final. The local
governing body shall hear an appeal within a reasonable time and may affirm,
modify and affirm, or revoke the order.



   (E)   Failure to comply with order. If the owner of a building or
property fails to comply with an order to take corrective action for which no
appeal has been made or fails to comply with an order of the governing body
following an appeal, the owner shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be
punished at the discretion of the court.

the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C. § 1334.



(2009 Code, § 151.50)  (Ord. passed 5-23-2006)



§ 151.41  SPECIFIC STANDARDS.



   (A)   In all special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation
(BFE) data has been provided, as set forth in §§ 151.07 or 151.27(K) and
(L), the following provisions, in addition to § 151.40, are required.



      (1)   Residential construction. New construction and
substantial improvement of any residential structure (including manufactured
homes) shall have the reference level, including basement, elevated no lower
than the regulatory flood protection elevation, as defined in § 151.05.



      (2)   Nonresidential construction. New construction and
substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential
structure shall have the reference level, including basement, elevated no
lower than the regulatory flood protection elevation, as defined in §
151.05. Structures located in A, AE and A1-30 Zones may be floodproofed to
the regulatory flood protection elevation in lieu of elevation provided that
all areas of the structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, below the regulatory flood protection elevation are watertight
with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, using
structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. For AO Zones, the
floodproofing elevation shall be in accordance with § 151.45(B)(3). A
registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the
standards of this division (A)(2) are satisfied. Such certification shall be
provided to the Floodplain Administrator as set forth in § 151.26(C), along
with the operational and maintenance plans.



      (3)   Manufactured homes.



         (a)   New or replacement manufactured homes shall be
elevated so that the reference level of the manufactured home is no lower
than the regulatory flood protection elevation, as defined in § 151.05.



         (b)   Manufactured homes shall be securely anchored to
an adequately anchored foundation to resist flotation, collapse and lateral
movement, either by engineer certification, or in accordance with the most
current edition of the State of North Carolina Regulations for Manufactured
Homes adopted by the Commissioner of Insurance pursuant to G.S. §
143-143.15. Additionally, when the elevation would be met by an elevation of
the chassis 36 inches or less above the grade at the site, the chassis shall
be supported by reinforced piers or engineered foundation. When the elevation
of the chassis is above 36 inches in height, an engineering certification is
required.



         (c)   All enclosures or skirting below the lowest floor
shall meet the requirements of divisions (A)(4)(a), (A)(4)(b) and (A)(4)(c)
below.



         (d)   An evacuation plan must be developed for
evacuation of all residents of all new, substantially unproved or
substantially damaged manufactured home parks or subdivisions located within
flood prone areas. This plan shall be filed with and approved by the
Floodplain Administrator and the local Emergency Management Coordinator.



      (4)   Elevated buildings. Fully enclosed area, of new
construction and substantially improved structures, which is below the lowest
floor:



         (a)   Shall not be designed or used for human
habitation, but shall only be used for parking of vehicles, building access
or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the
premises. Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow
for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance
equipment (standard exterior door), or entry to the living area (stairway or
elevator). The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be finished
or partitioned into separate rooms, except to enclose storage areas;



         (b)   Shall be constructed entirely of flood resistant
materials below the regulatory flood protection elevation;



         (c)   Shall include, in Zones A, AO, AE and A1-30, flood
openings to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on walls by
allowing for the entry and exit of flood waters. To meet this requirement,
the openings must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect
or meet or exceed the following minimum design criteria;



            1.   A minimum of two flood openings on different
sides of each enclosed area subject to flooding;



            2.   The total net area of all flood openings must
be at least one square inch for each square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding;



            3.   If a building has more than one enclosed
area, each enclosed area must have flood openings to allow flood waters to
automatically enter and exit;



            4.   The bottom of all required flood openings
shall be no higher than one foot above the adjacent grade;



            5.   Flood openings may be equipped with screens,
louvers or other coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic
flow of flood waters in both directions; and



            6.   Enclosures made of flexible skirting are not
considered enclosures for regulatory purposes, and, therefore, do not require
flood openings. Masonry or wood underpinning, regardless of structural
status, is considered an enclosure and requires flood openings as outlined
above.



      (5)   Additions/improvements.



         (a)   Additions and/or improvements to pre-FIRM
structures when the addition and/or improvements in combination with any
interior modifications to the existing structure are:

structure and the addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards
for new construction.



         (b)   Additions to post-FIRM structures with no
modifications to the existing structure other than a standard door in the
common wall shall require only the addition to comply with the standards for
new construction.



         (c)   Additions and/or improvements to post-FIRM
structures when the addition and/or improvements in combination with any
interior modifications to the existing structure are:



            1.   Not a substantial improvement, the addition
and/or improvements only must comply with the standards for new construction;
and



            2.   A substantial improvement, both the existing
structure and the addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards
for new construction.



         (d)   Where an independent perimeter load-bearing wall
is provided between the addition and the existing building, the addition(s)
shall be considered a separate building and only the addition must comply
with the standards for new construction.



      (6)   Recreational vehicles. Recreational vehicles shall
either:



         (a)   Be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days and
be fully licensed and ready for highway use (a recreational vehicle is ready
for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the
site only by quick disconnect type utilities and has no permanently attached
additions); or



         (b)   Meet all the requirements for new construction.



      (7)   Temporary nonresidential structures. Prior to the
issuance of a floodplain development permit for a temporary structure, the

hurricane or immediately upon flood warning notification);



         (d)   A copy of the contract or other suitable
instrument with the entity responsible for physical removal of the structure;
and



         (e)   Designation, accompanied by documentation, of a
location outside the special flood hazard area, to which the temporary
structure will be moved.



      (8)   Accessory structures. When accessory structures (sheds,
detached garages and the like) are to be placed within a special flood hazard
area, the following criteria shall be met:



         (a)   Accessory structures shall not be used for human
habitation (including working, sleeping, living, cooking or restroom areas);



         (b)   Accessory structures shall not be
temperature-controlled;



         (c)   Accessory structures shall be designed to have low
flood damage potential;



         (d)   Accessory structures shall be constructed and
placed on the building site so as to offer the minimum resistance to the flow
of flood waters;



         (e)   Accessory structures shall be firmly anchored in
accordance with § 151.40(A);



         (f)   All service facilities such as electrical shall be

         (g)   Flood openings to facilitate automatic
equalization of hydrostatic flood forces shall be provided below regulatory
flood protection elevation in conformance with division (A)(4)(c) above.



   (B)   An accessory structure with a footprint less than 150 square
feet that satisfies the criteria outlined above does not require an elevation
or floodproofing certificate. Elevation or floodproofing certifications are
required for all other accessory structures in accordance with § 151.26(C).



(2009 Code, § 151.51)  (Ord. passed 5-23-2006)



§ 151.42  STANDARDS FOR FLOODPLAINS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD
ELEVATIONS.



   Within the special flood hazard areas designated as Approximate Zone A
and established in § 151.07, where no base flood elevation (BFE) data has
been provided by FEMA, the following provisions, in addition to §§ 151.40
and 151.41, shall apply.



   (A)   No encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements or new development shall be permitted within a
distance of 20 feet each side from top of bank or five times the width of the
stream, whichever is greater, unless certification with supporting technical
data by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that
such encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during
the occurrence of the base flood discharge.



   (B)   The BFE used in determining the regulatory flood protection
elevation shall be determined based on one of the following criteria set in
priority order.



      (1)   If base flood elevation (BFE) data is available from
other sources, all new construction and substantial improvements within such
areas shall also comply with all applicable provisions of this chapter and
shall be elevated or floodproofed in accordance with standards in §
151.27(K) and (L).



      (2)   All subdivision, manufactured home park and other
development proposals shall provide base flood elevation (BFE) data if
development is greater than five acres or has more than 50 lots/manufactured
home sites. Such base flood elevation (BFE) data shall be adopted by
reference per § 151.07 to be utilized in implementing this chapter.



      (3)   When base flood elevation (BFE) data is not available
from a federal, state or other source as outlined above, the reference level
shall be elevated to or above the regulatory flood protection elevation, as
defined in § 151.05.

   (A)   Areas designated as floodways or non-encroachment areas are
located within the special flood hazard areas established in § 151.07. The
floodways and non-encroachment areas are extremely hazardous areas due to the
velocity of flood waters that have erosion potential and carry debris and
potential projectiles.



   (B)   The following provisions, in addition to standards outlined in
§§ 151.40 and 151.41, shall apply to all development within such areas.



      (1)   No encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements and other developments shall be permitted unless it
has been demonstrated that:



         (a)   The proposed encroachment would not result in any
increase in the flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood, based
on hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard
engineering practice and presented to the Floodplain Administrator prior to
issuance of floodplain development permit; or



         (b)   A conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) has
been approved by FEMA. A letter of map revision (LOMR) must also be obtained
upon completion of the proposed encroachment.



      (2)   If division (A) above of this section is satisfied, all
development shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction
provisions of this chapter.



      (3)   No manufactured homes shall be permitted, except
replacement manufactured homes in an existing manufactured home park or
subdivision, provided the following provisions are met:



         (a)   The anchoring and the elevation standards of §
151.41(A)(3); and



         (b)   The no encroachment standard of division (B)(1)
above of this section.



(2009 Code, § 151.54)  (Ord. passed 5-23-2006)



§ 151.45  STANDARDS FOR AREAS OF SHALLOW FLOODING (ZONE AO).



   (A)   Located within the special flood hazard areas established in
§ 151.07 are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have
special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet
where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding
is unpredictable and indeterminate.



   (B)   In addition to § 151.40, all new construction and substantial
improvements shall meet the following requirements.



      (1)   The reference level shall be elevated at least as high
as the depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), in
feet, plus a freeboard of two feet, above the highest adjacent grade; or at
least two feet above the highest adjacent grade plus a freeboard of two feet
if no depth number is specified.



      (2)   Nonresidential structures may, in lieu of elevation, be
floodproofed to the same level as required in division (A) above so that the
structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, below
that level shall be watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the
passage of water and with structural components having the capability of
resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy.
Certification is required as per §§ 151.26(A)(3) and 151.41(A)(2).



      (3)   Adequate drainage paths shall be provided around
structures on slopes, to guide flood waters around and away from proposed
structures.



(2009 Code, § 151.55)  (Ord. passed 5-23-2006)



§ 151.99  PENALTY.



   Violation of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with

   (A)   Inspections of work in process. The Inspection Department
shall inspect all buildings and structures and work therein for which a
permit of any kind has been issued as often as necessary in order to
determine whether the work complies with this chapter and the appropriate
codes. When deemed necessary by the appropriate inspector, materials and
assemblies may be inspected at the point of manufacture or fabrication, or
inspections may be made by approved and recognized inspection organizations.
However, no approval shall be based upon reports of the organizations, unless
the same are in writing and certified by a responsible officer of the
organization. All holders of permits, or their agents, shall notify the
Inspection Department and the appropriate inspector at each of the following
stages of construction, so that approval may be given before work is
continued.



      (1)   Foundation inspection. To be made after trenches are
excavated and the necessary reinforcement and forms are in place, and before
concrete is placed. Drilled footings, piles and similar types of foundations
shall be inspected as installed.



      (2)   Framing inspection. To be made after all structural
framing is in place and all roughing-in of plumbing and electrical and
heating has been installed, after all fire blocking, chimneys, bracing and
vents are installed, but before any of the structure is enclosed or covered.
Poured-in-place concrete structural elements shall be inspected before each
pour of any structural member.



      (3)   Fireproofing inspection. To be made after all areas
required to be protected by fireproofing are lathed, but before the
plastering or other fireproofing is applied.



      (4) Final inspection. To be made after the building or structure
has all doors hung and fixtures set and is ready for occupancy, but before
the building is occupied.



   (B)   Calls for inspection. Request for inspections may be made to
the office of the Inspection Department or to the appropriate inspector. The
Inspection Department shall make inspections as soon as practicable after
requests are made, therefore, provided the work is ready for inspection at
the time the request is made.



      (1)   Reinspections may be at the convenience of the
Inspector. No work shall be inspected until it is in proper and completed
condition ready for inspection. All work which has been concealed before the
inspection and approval shall be uncovered at the request of the Inspector
and placed in condition for proper inspection. Approval or rejection of the
work shall be furnished by the appropriate Inspector in the form of a notice
posted on the building or given to the permit holder or his or her agent.



      (2)   Failure to call for inspections or proceeding without
approval at each stage of construction shall be deemed a violation of this
chapter.



   (C) Street or alley lines. Where the applicant for a permit proposes to
erect any building or structure on the line of any street, alley or other
public place, he or she shall secure a survey of the line of the street,
alley or other public place adjacent to the property upon which the building
or structure is to be erected, before proceeding with construction of the
building or structure. It shall be the duty of the Building Inspector to see
that the building does not encroach upon the street, alley or other public
place.



   (D)   Certificates of compliance. At the conclusion of all work done
under a permit, the appropriate Inspector shall make a final inspection, and
if he or she finds that the completed work complies with all applicable state
and local laws and with the terms of the permit, he or she shall issue a

      (2)   Notice of such hearing shall also be given to at least
one of the persons signing a petition relating to such dwelling. Any person
desiring to do so may attend such hearing and give evidence relevant to the
matter being heard.



   (B)   Procedure after hearing.



      (1) After the holding of a hearing under this division (B), the
officer shall state in writing his or her determination whether the dwelling
or dwelling unit is unfit for human habitation, and, if so, whether it is
deteriorated or dilapidated.



      (2)   If the officer determines that the dwelling or dwelling
unit is deteriorated, he or she shall state in writing his or her findings of
fact in support of such determination, and shall issue and cause to be served
upon the owner thereof an order directing and requiring the owner to repair,
alter or improve such dwelling or dwelling unit to comply with the minimum
standards of fitness established by this chapter within a specified period of
time, not to exceed 90 days. Such order may also direct and require the owner

dilapidated, he or she shall state in writing his or her findings of fact to
support such determination, and shall issue and cause to be served upon the

the owner of any deteriorated dwelling or dwelling unit shall fail to comply
with an order of the officer to repair, alter or improve, or to vacate and
close the same within the time specified therein, the officer may submit to
the City Council at its next regular meeting a resolution directing the City
Attorney to petition the Superior Court for an order directing such owner to
comply with the order of the officer.



      (2)   In rem remedy. After the failure of an owner of a
deteriorated or dilapidated dwelling or dwelling unit to comply with an order

which the appeal is based. Upon the filing of any notice of appeal under this
division (D)(1), the officer shall forthwith transmit to the City Council all
the papers constituting the record upon which the decision appealed from was
made. When an appeal is from a decision of the officer refusing to allow the
person aggrieved thereby to do any act, his or her decision shall remain in
force until modified or reversed. When an appeal is from a decision of the
officer requiring the person aggrieved to do any act, the appeal shall have
the effect of suspending the requirement until the hearing by the City
Council unless the officer certifies to the Council, after the notice of
appeal is filed with him or her, that, by reason of the facts stated in the
certificate (a copy of which shall be furnished the appellant), a suspension
of this requirement would cause imminent peril to life or property; in which
case, the requirement shall not be suspended except by a restraining order.
Such a restraining order may be granted for due cause shown upon not less
than one day’s written notice to the officer, by the City Council, or by a
court of record upon petition made pursuant to division (E) below.



      (2)   Hearing. The City Council shall fix a reasonable time
for the hearing of all appeals under this chapter, shall give due notice to
all the parties and shall render its decision within a reasonable time. Any
party may appear in person or by agent or attorney. The City Council may
reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the decision or order
appealed from and may make such decision and order as in its opinion ought to
be made in the matter; and, to that end, it shall have all the posers of the
officer, but the concurring vote of four-fifths of the members of the City
Council shall be necessary to reverse or modify any decision or order of the
officer. The City Council shall have the power also in passing upon appeals,
when practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships would result from
carrying out the strict letter of this chapter to adapt the application of
the chapter of the necessities of the case to the end that the spirit of the
chapter shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured and substantial
justice done.

persons may be made by publication in a newspaper having general circulation

§ 154.068  TREES.



   It is recommended that street trees be planted in all subdivisions. The
planting of street trees is considered a responsibility of the subdivider, as
well as good business practice. Street trees are a protection against
excessive heat and glare and enhance the attractiveness and value of the
property. The Planning Board will assist the subdivider in the location of
trees and identification of species to use under varying conditions. Trees
should be planted inside the property lines where they are less subject to
injury, decrease the chance of motor accidents and enjoy more favorable
conditions for growth. Trees initially found on a building lot by the
developer or owner shall not be harmed, except for those on the immediate
building site and driveway area, or unless the new owner of the lot specifies
in writing the removal of all or part of the trees.

by the posting of a performance or surety bond in sufficient amount to assure
the completion of all required improvements. For any bond, there shall be
submitted with the plat a certification by the City Manager as to the
sufficiency of the bond offered, usually 125% of the contract amount.

   (A)   The City Council shall require a bond guaranteeing street
construction, curbs, gutters, sidewalks, drainage facilities and water and
sewer lines against defects for one year. The improvements must be accepted
or rejected within 60 days following their installation. This bond shall be
in the amount determined by the City Manager and shall be in cash or be made
by a surety company authorized to do business in the state.

   (D)   Grades. Unless necessitated by exceptional topography and
subject to the approval of the City Engineer and Planning Board, street
grades shall not be more than 10% nor less than 0.3% on any street.



      (1)   Grades approaching intersections shall not exceed 5% for
a distance of not less than 100 feet from the centerline of the intersection.



      (2)   Street grades shall be established wherever practicable
in such a manner as to avoid excessive grading, the promiscuous removal of
ground cover and tree growth and general leveling of the topography.



      (3)   All changes in street grades shall be connected by
vertical curves of a minimum length equivalent in feet to 15 times the
algebraic difference in the rates of grades for major and minor
thoroughfares, and one-half this minimum for all other streets.



   (E)   Radii of curvature. Where a street centerline deflection of
more than ten degrees occurs, a curve shall be introduced having a radius of
curvature on the centerline of not less than the following:



      (1)   Major thoroughfare: 500 feet;



      (2)   Minor thoroughfare: 300 feet; and



      (3)   Minor street: 150 feet.



   (F)   Tangents. A tangent of not less than 100 feet shall be
provided between reverse curves on all streets.



   (G)   Intersections. Street intersections shall be laid out in the
following manner.



      (1)   Streets shall intersect as nearly as possible at right
angles, and no street shall intersect any other street at an angle of less
than 75 degrees.



      (2)   Intersections with major thoroughfares shall be at least
800 feet apart, measured from centerline to centerline. This requirement may
be waived by the Planning Board if the requirement would prevent a property
owner fronting on a major thoroughfare from having access to the facility.



      (3)   Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 125
feet shall be prohibited when the jog lies wholly within the subdivision, and
shall be avoided wherever possible on the exterior boundary of the
subdivision.



      (4)   Property lines at street intersections shall be rounded
with a minimum radius of 20 feet.



   (H)   Cul-de-sac. Permanent dead-end streets or cul-de-sacs shall be
no longer than 400 feet. In general, streets with one end permanently closed
shall be avoided unless the design of the subdivision and the existing or
proposed street system in the surrounding area clearly indicate that a
through street is not essential in the location of the proposed cul-de-sac.



   (I)   Alleys. The Planning Board may require the subdivider to
construct alleys in commercial or industrial zoning districts. When so
required, or proposed by the subdivider, alleys shall conform to the
following specifications:



      (1)   Right-of-way width: 20 feet;



      (2)   Property line radius at alley intersections: 15 feet; and



      (3)   Minimum radius to centerline when deflection angle of
more than ten degrees occurs: 35 feet.



   (J)   Street names. Street names shall be subject to the approval of
the Planning Board, and new names shall not duplicate or be similar to
existing street names. Existing street names, however, shall be projected
where appropriate.

Penalty, see § 10.99



§ 154.086  BLOCKS.



   Minimum design standards for blocks in subdivisions in the city shall
be as follows.



   (A)   Proposed use. Blocks shall be laid out with special
consideration given to the type of land use proposed within the block.



   (B)   Length. Blocks shall not exceed 1,000 feet in length nor shall
they be less than 400 feet in length, as measured from centerline to
centerline.



   (C)   Width. Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two
tiers of lots of appropriate depth, except where otherwise required to
separate residential development from through traffic.



(2009 Code, § 154.61)  (Ord. passed 5-1-1972)  Penalty, see § 10.99



§ 154.087  LOTS AND SETBACKS.



   Minimum design standards for lots and setbacks in subdivisions in the
city shall be as follows.



   (A)   Size. All lots shall conform to the dimensional and area
requirements of the Zoning Code.



   (B)   Setbacks. All lots shall conform to the building setback and
yard requirements of the Zoning Code.



   (C)   Access. Every lot shall abut a public street which has a
minimum right-of-way width of at least 50 feet.



   (D)   Orientation. Side lot lines shall normally be perpendicular or
radial to street right-of-way lines.



   (E)   Lots. Residential lots which are not served by the municipal
sewer and water systems or other community water and sewer systems approved
by the State Board of Health and Department of Water and Air Resources, shall
be no less than 100 feet wide at the building setback line and no less than
20,000 square feet in area.

Penalty, see § 10.99



§ 154.088  EASEMENTS.



   These requirements shall apply both inside the corporate limits and
within one mile in all directions of the corporate limits.



   (A)   Utility easements. The subdivider shall convey easements to
the city for both underground and overhead utility installation where needed.
Easements shall be at least 15 feet wide and shall be centered along rear or
side lot lines. Wider easements may be required if the topography along the
proposed right-of-way is such that maintenance equipment cannot reasonably
operate within the minimum 15 foot wide easement.



   (B)   Drainage easements. Where a subdivision is traversed by a
watercourse, drainageway, channel or stream, there shall be provided a storm
water easement or drainage right-of-way conforming substantially with the
lines of the watercourses and of any further width or construction, or both,
as will be adequate for the purpose. Lakes, ponds, watercourses and the land
immediately adjacent thereto shall be considered for maintenance by the city
only if sufficient land is dedicated as a public recreation area or park, or
if the area constitutes a necessary part of the drainage control system. The
city reserves the right to reject any intended dedications.



   (C)   Public facilities. In the event that a proposed park,
recreation area, school or other public or community service facility shown
on any part of the officially adopted Comprehensive Plan for the city is
located in whole or part within a proposed subdivision, the Planning Board
and City Council shall require that the subdivider grant to the city an
option to purchase the land for public use. Purchase options so granted shall
be executed in favor of the city for a period of 18 months from the date of
final plat approval. Options so granted must be fully exercised and
consummated within 18 months of the date of final plat approval; otherwise,
they shall become null and void.



   (D)   Pedestrian easements or walkways. Pedestrian easements or
walkways shall be provided through the interior of blocks where the Planning
Board determines they are needed. Pedestrian easements shall be at least ten
feet wide and shall be laid out along front, side or rear property lines.

(2009 Code, § 155.001)  (Ord. passed 10-27-1992)



§ 155.002  INTENT.



   It is the general intent of the chapter to:



   (A)   Regulate and restrict the use of all structures and lands
within the city limits and the extraterritorial jurisdiction, adopted October
27, 1992;



   (B)   Regulate and restrict lot coverage, population density and
distribution, and the location and size of all structures within the city
limits and the extraterritorial jurisdiction; and



   (C)   Regulate development so as to accomplish the following:



      (1)   Secure safety from fire, flooding, panic and other
dangers;



      (2)   Provide adequate light, air, sanitation drainage;



      (3)   Further the appropriate use of land and conservation of
natural resources;



      (4)   Obtain the wise use, conservation, development and

(2009 Code, § 155.002)  (Ord. passed 10-27-1992)



§ 155.003  INTERPRETATION.



   In interpreting and applying the provisions of this chapter, those
provisions shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of
the public safety, health, convenience, prosperity and general welfare. It is
not intended by this chapter to interfere with, abrogate or annul any
easements, covenants or other agreements between parties; provided, however,
that where this chapter imposes a greater restriction upon the use of
buildings or premises, or upon the height of buildings, or requires larger
open spaces than are imposed or required by other ordinances, rules,
regulations or by easements, covenants or agreements, the provisions of this
chapter shall govern. Likewise, where other ordinances, easements, covenants
or other agreements impose additional or greater restrictions than those
regulations set forth herein, the more restrictive regulations shall have
precedence.



(2009 Code, § 155.003)  (Ord. passed 10-27-1992)



§ 155.004  PROVISION AND REPLACEMENT OF OFFICIAL ZONING MAP.



   (A)   Official zoning map. The city is hereby divided into zones, or
districts, as shown on the official zoning map which, together with all
explanatory matter thereon, is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be
a part of this chapter. The official zoning map shall be identified by the
signature of the Mayor of the city attested by the City Clerk, and bearing
the seal of the city. No changes of any nature shall be made on the official
zoning map or matter shown thereon except in conformity with the procedures
set forth in this chapter. Regardless of the existence of copies of the
official zoning map which may from time to time be made or published, the
official zoning map located in the City Building Inspector’s office shall
be the final authority as to the current zoning status of land and water
areas, buildings and other structures in the city and its extraterritorial
area.



   (B)   Replacement of official zoning map. In the event that the
official zoning map becomes damaged, destroyed, lost or difficult to
interpret because of the nature or number of changes and additions, the City
Council may, by resolution, adopt a new official zoning map which shall
supersede the prior official zoning map. The new official zoning map may
correct drafting or other errors or omissions in the prior official zoning
map, but no correction shall have the effect of amending the original
official zoning map. The new official zoning map shall be identified by the
signature of the Mayor, attested by the City Clerk and bearing the seal of
the city. Unless the prior official zoning map has been lost, or has been
totally destroyed, the prior map or any significant parts thereof remaining,
shall be preserved, together with all available records pertaining to its
adoption or amendment.

GENERAL PROVISIONS



§ 155.015  INTRODUCTION.



   The proper regulation of the use of certain structures, lands and
water, only through the use of the zoning districts contained within this
chapter, is neither feasible nor adequate. Therefore, the following
restrictions and regulations, which shall be applied in addition to the
district regulations, are necessary to accomplish the intent of this chapter.



(2009 Code, § 155.010)  (Ord. passed 10-27-1992)



§ 155.016  JURISDICTION.



   The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all structures, land,
water and air within the jurisdiction of the city, including the permissible
extraterritorial areas of the city as duly adopted and described by the City
Council on October 27, 1992. The description is included herein by reference

ESTABLISHMENT OF JURISDICTION AND
ZONING DISTRICTS



§ 155.030  LOCATIONS AND BOUNDARIES OF DISTRICTS.



   (A)   The locations and boundaries of each of the zoning districts
shall be shown on the map accompanying this chapter and made a part hereof
entitled “Official Zoning Map, City of Whiteville and Surrounding Area”
dated October 27, 1992, and adopted by the City Council. The zoning map, and
all the notations, references and amendments thereto and other information
show, are hereby made a part of this chapter. The zoning map shall be kept on
file in the office of the City Building Inspector and shall be available for
inspection by the public.



   (B)   The boundaries of the districts, as are shown upon the map
attached to this chapter, are hereby adopted. The provisions of this chapter
governing within each type of district the use of land and buildings, height
of buildings, building site areas, sizes of yards around buildings and other
matters as are hereinafter set forth, are hereby established and declared to
be in effect upon all land included within the boundaries of each and every
district as shown upon the map.



   (C)   Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of any
of the aforesaid districts as shown on the zoning map, the following rules
shall apply.



      (1)   Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately
following street right-of-way lines, alley right-of-way lines or the lines
extended, these lines shall be construed to be the boundaries.



      (2)   Where a district boundary divides a lot, the location of
the boundary, unless the same is indicated by dimensions on the zoning map,
shall be 150 feet from the nearest street which it parallels.



      (3)   Whenever a single lot two acres or less in size is
located within two or more different zoning districts, the district
regulations applicable to the district within the larger portion of the lot
lies shall apply to the entire lot.



      (4)   Boundaries indicated as approximately following city
corporate limits shall be construed as following the city corporate limits.



      (5)   Boundaries indicated as following railroad lines shall
be construed to be midway between the main tracts.



      (6)   Boundaries indicated as following shorelines shall be
construed to follow the shorelines, and in the event of change in the
shoreline shall be construed as moving with the actual shoreline; boundaries
indicated as approximately following the centerlines of streams, rivers,
canals, lakes or other bodies of water shall be construed to follow the
centerlines.



      (7)   Where physical or cultural features existing on the
ground are at variance with those shown on the official zoning map, or in
other circumstances not covered by divisions (C)(1) through (C)(6) above, the
Board of Adjustment shall interpret the district boundaries.



(2009 Code, § 155.030)  (Ord. passed 10-27-1992)



ZONING DISTRICTS



§ 155.045  DISTRICT CLASSES.



   For the purpose of this chapter, the city and its extraterritorial
jurisdiction is divided into the following classes of zones.



   (A)   RA-20 Residential District. The RA-20 Residential District is
established as a district in which the principal use of land is for low
density residential and agricultural purposes and is located outside the city
limits. The regulations of this district are intended to protect the
agricultural sections of the community from an influx to render it
undesirable for farms and future development, and to ensure that residential
developments dependent upon septic tank systems for sewage disposal will
occur at sufficiently low densities to ensure a healthful environment.
Minimum residential lot sizes shall be 20,000 square feet.



   (B)   R-20 Residential District. The R-20 Residential District is
established as a district in which the principal use of the land is for
single-family residences. The regulations of this district are intended to
protect existing residential areas with minimum lot sizes of 20,000 square
feet and to encourage, in selected portions of the incorporated area, the
subdivision of undeveloped property into lots with a minimum of 20,000 square
feet.



   (C)   R-12 Residential District. The R-12 Residential District is
established as a district which the principal use of land is for
single-family residences. The regulations of this district are intended to
discourage any use which, because of its character, would substantially
interfere with the development of single-family residences in the district
which would be detrimental to the quiet residential nature of the areas
included within this district. Minimum residential lot sizes shall be 12,000
square feet.



   (D)   R-6 Residential District. The R-6 Residential District is
established as a district in which the principal use of land is for
single-family residences. The regulations of this district are intended to
provide areas of the community for those persons desiring relatively small
residential lots and duplex structures in relatively high density
neighborhoods. The regulations are intended to discourage any use which,
because of its character, would interfere with the residential nature of this
district. Minimum residential lot sizes shall be 6,000 square feet.



   (E)   R-6MF Residential District. The R-6MF Residential District is
established as a district in which the principal use of land is for
multi-family use. The regulations for this district are intended to provide
areas for multi-family use for up to ten units per acre, provided height,
setback, parking and buffers are provided. These districts shall be located
near higher intensity land uses (commercial, office and institutional uses)
and away from lower density uses such as the RA-20 and R-20 Districts.
Minimum single-family residential lot sizes shall be 6,000 square feet.



   (F)   R-6MHP Manufactured Home Park. The R-6 Manufactured Home Park
District is established as a district in which the principal use of the land
is for manufactured home parks which complies with the requirements
established under Note 6 of § 155.066(F).



   (G)   O & I Office and Institutional District. This district is
established as certain land areas with structures that provide office space
for professional services and for certain institutional functions and
residential accommodations, usually medium or high density in nature. Except
for commodities directly associated with the operation of a professional
office, the display of goods and commodities is prohibited. The district is
normally small and may include older homes undergoing conversion. This
district is usually situated between business and residential districts, and
the regulations are designed to permit development of the permitted functions
and still protect and be compatible with nearby residential districts.



   (H)   I-1 Light Industrial District. The I-1 Industrial Light
District is established as a district in which the principal use of land is
for industries which can be operated in a relatively clean and quiet manner
and which will not be obnoxious to adjacent residential, business or office
and institutional districts. The regulations are designed to prohibit the use
of land for heavy industry which should be properly segregated and to
prohibit any other use which would substantially interfere with the
development of industrial establishments in the district.



   (I)   I-2 Heavy Industrial District. The I-2 Heavy Industrial
District is established as a district in which the principal use of land is
for heavy industries that by their nature may create some nuisance and which
are not properly associated with nor compatible with residential, business,
office and institutional and light industrial districts.



   (J)   B-1 Central Business District. The regulations for this
district are designed to permit a concentrated development of business uses
within the central portion of the city.



   (K)   B-2 Neighborhood Business District. The B-2 Neighborhood
Business District is established as a district in which the principal use of
land is for commercial and service uses to serve the surrounding residential
districts.



   (L)   B-3 Highway Serving Business District. These districts are
generally located on the major radials leading into and around the developed
area and provide for retailing goods and services to the passing motorists
and local residents. Because these commercial areas are subject to public
view, which is a matter of important concern to the whole community, they
should provide and appropriate appearance, ample parking and designed to
minimize traffic congestion.



   (M)   B-4 Retail/Office Complex. The regulations for this district
are designed to permit a concentrated development of retail businesses and
offices within the corporate limits of the city. The districts shall be
limited to those areas in the city where concentrated development occurred
prior to the adoption of a Zoning Code and existing and/or planned uses do
not conform to the more restrictive business defined in the chapter.



   (N)   O-S Open Space District. The Open Space District is
established as a district in which the primary use of the land is
predominantly reserved for flood control, future thoroughfare right-of-way,
public recreation, community facility sites, airport approaches, natural or
human-made bodies of water, forests and other similar open space uses. In
promoting the general purpose of this chapter, the specific intent of this
section is:



      (1)   To encourage the preservation of, and continued use of,
the land for conservation purposes;



      (2)   To prohibit residential, commercial and industrial use
of the land, and to prohibit any other use which would substantially
interfere with the preservation of this district; and



      (3)   To encourage the discontinuance of uses that would not
be permitted as uses in the district.



(2009 Code, § 155.045)  (Ord. passed 10-27-1992)  Penalty, see § 155.999



§ 155.046  BONA FIDE FARM EXEMPTION.



   This chapter shall in no way regulate, restrict, prohibit or otherwise
deter any bona fide farm and its related uses within the extraterritorial
jurisdiction; except that in case of conversion of the uses to
nonagricultural or non-farm purposes, a zoning certificate shall be procured,
and the new use must comply with all regulations for the district in which it
is situated. Within the corporate limits, vegetative crop production shall be
exempt from the provisions of this chapter.



(2009 Code, § 155.046)  (Ord. passed 10-27-1992)



§ 155.047  USE.



   No building or land shall hereafter be used or occupied and no building
or part thereof shall be erected, moved or structurally altered except in
conformity with the uses and dimensional regulations of this chapter, or
amendments thereto, for the district in which it is located.



(2009 Code, § 155.047)  (Ord. passed 10-27-1992)  Penalty, see § 155.999



§ 155.048  ONLY ONE MAIN BUILDING; ONE MAIN USE ON LOT; ORIENTATION OF A
BUILDING.



   In all districts, every main building hereafter erected or altered
shall be located on a separate lot, as defined in this chapter, and in no
case shall there be more than one main building and permitted accessory
building on the lot nor more than one main use (that is, commercial,
industrial or residential) per building and lot; provided that this
requirement shall not apply to uses that are permitted by the table of
permitted uses (§§ 155.065 through 155.067) within the same zoning district
and located in the same building, nor to motels or manufactured home parks,
nor to planned developments approved by the City Council, nor to a bona fide
farm use. In the case of applications for double occupancy permits involving
a residential use and a nonresidential use of the same building in an O-I
District, where the Building Inspector, or his or her authorized agents, deem
that an above-normal safety hazard exists due to the storage of chemicals or
explosive commodities, the applications shall be forwarded to the Board of
Adjustment for a determination of whether or not a safety hazard exists which
would create a substantial detriment to the proposed residential occupancy.
Residential occupancy of that building shall be prohibited.



(2009 Code, § 155.048)  (Ord. passed 10-27-1992)  Penalty, see § 155.999



§ 155.049  MINIMUM YARDS.



   The minimum yards or other open spaces required by this chapter,
including those provisions regulating intensity of use, for each and every
building hereafter erected or structurally altered shall not be encroached
upon or considered as meeting the yard or open space requirements or the
intensity of use provisions for any other building.



(2009 Code, § 155.049)  (Ord. passed 10-27-1992)



§ 155.050  LOT SUBDIVISION.



   No lot shall hereafter be so reduced in area as to cause any open space
required by this chapter to be less in any dimension than is herein required
by the minimum yard requirements of the zone in which the lot in question is
situated.



(2009 Code, § 155.050)  (Ord. passed 10-27-1992)  Penalty, see § 155.999



§ 155.051  IMPROVEMENTS BOND.



   (A)   No final certificate of occupancy/compliance for a commercial,
residential or manufactured home park will be issued until all required site
improvements have been completed.



   (B)   In lieu of completion of all required site improvements, the
developer of the planned group may enter into a contract with the city
providing for the installation of city improvements within a designated
period of time. Performance of the contract shall be secured by a cash or
surety bond which will cover the total estimated cost of the improvements as
determined by the city; provided, however, that the bond may be waived by the
City Council within its discretion.



(2009 Code, § 155.051)  (Ord. passed 10-27-1992)



§ 155.052  PARKING, STORAGE, OR USE OF MAJOR RECREATIONAL EQUIPMENT.

motorized dwellings, tent trailers and the like, and cases or boxes used for
transporting recreational equipment, whether occupied by the equipment or not.



   (B)   Major recreational equipment may be stored in a residential
district on the same lot as the permanent residence of the owner of the major
recreational equipment. No such equipment shall be used for living, sleeping
or housekeeping purposes when parked or stored on a residential lot, or in
any location not approved for the use.

1-22-2013)



DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS



§ 155.080  DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.



   (A)   If either public water or sewer is available: 15,000 square
feet.



   (B)   Side yard provided but not required. Where any side yard is
provided, though not required, the same shall be not less than three and
one-half feet.



      (1)   Corner lots. Relative to a corner lot, a side yard
setback consisting of one-half of the distance of the required front yard
setback up to a maximum of 20 feet shall be maintained between the
prospective building and the side street. This requirement shall not be
applied so as to reduce the building width of a residentially zoned corner
lot of record at the time of passage of this chapter to less than 30 feet,
nor to prohibit the erection of any accessory building where this requirement
cannot reasonably be complied with as determined by the Board of Adjustment.



      (2)   Miscellaneous exceptions. Steps, fire escapes,
stairways, balconies and chimneys only project into a minimum yard not more
than four feet as measured from the adjoining exterior wall, and an
unenclosed porch may project into the required front or rear yard not more
than ten feet.



      (3)   Features. Sills, cornices, buttresses, ornamental
features and similar items may project into a required yard not more than 30
inches.



      (4)   Carports. Carports open on three sides may encroach on a
side yard to a distance of not less than five feet from a side lot line,
except on the street side yard of a corner lot where the setback shall be
one-half of the distance of the required front yard setback up to a maximum
of 20 feet. Storage areas may be constructed across the rear of a carport
open on three sides that encroaches on a side yard, provided the storage area
shall not contain more than 72 square feet nor constitute more than 18% of
the area contained in the carport, whichever is less.



      (5)   Accessory buildings. Detached garages and accessory
buildings to residential uses may be constructed in the rear yard provided
they are located no closer than five feet, zero inches to any adjoining lot
line, except on the street side yard of a corner lot where the setback shall
be one-half of the distance of the required front yard setback up to a
maximum of 20 feet.



      (6)   Front yard setbacks for prior lots of record. If a
vacant lot is adjacent to a lot where an existing dwelling is located which
is constructed less than the required minimum front yard setback, the
required minimum front yard setback for the vacant lot shall not be less than
the existing front yard setback for the adjacent dwelling. In cases where
existing dwellings are located on both sides of the vacant lot, and each is
constructed less than the required minimum front yard setback, the required
minimum front yard setback for the vacant lot shall not be less than the
average of the two existing dwellings.



   (C)   Minimum required additional side yard for each additional
dwelling unit in excess of two in the principal structure.

feet. In cases where a side yard, not required, is provided, it shall be at
least five feet in width.



   (G)   Abutting residential zones to commercial or industrial uses
must maintain a visual buffer. The buffer shall be a compact evergreen hedge
or other type of evergreen foliage, or shall be a combined fence and
shrubbery screen, the former facing the residential use. It must be a minimum
of six feet in height. Where a vegetative buffer is provided, the buffer
shall be a minimum width of three feet. All buffers should be six inches off
of the property line.



      (1)   Fences and walls. Fences not exceeding a height of four
feet shall be exempt from the yard and building setback line requirements of
this chapter. Fences not exceeding a height of six feet to be erected only in
side or rear yards shall be exempt from the yard and building setback line
requirements of this chapter, provided that no fence exceeding a height of
four feet will be constructed within 15 feet to any street. In all cases, the
corner visibility provisions of this chapter shall be observed.



      (2)   Open fence. Only conforming industrial and business land
uses (with the exception of an O & I Zone) may have a solid or open fence or

to the corner of nonresidential lots which are characterized by a street
intersection.

CONDITIONAL USES



§ 155.095  OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE.



   (A)   Permitted conditional uses add flexibility to this chapter.
Subject to high standards of planning and design, certain property uses are
allowed in the several districts where those uses would not otherwise be
applicable. By means of controls exercised through the conditional use permit
procedures, property uses which would otherwise be undesirable in certain
districts can be developed to minimize any bad effects they might have on
surrounding properties.



   (B)   Approval of a conditional use permit is made the duty of the
City Council based on review and recommendation of the Planning Board.



   (C)   The uses for which conditional use permits are required are
listed in this section, along with a detailed description of the procedures
which must be followed in the approval of each permit. Uses specified in this
section shall be permitted only upon the issuance of a conditional use permit.



(2009 Code, § 155.105)  (Ord. passed 10-27-1992)



§ 155.096  PROCEDURE FOR CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS APPROVAL.



   (A)   Conditional permits may be issued by the City Planning
Director after approval by the City Council, for the uses as designated in
the table of regulations for conditional uses and after Planning Board review
and recommendations. The petition for a conditional use permit and the
accompanying plans shall be submitted to the City Building Inspector at least
three weeks prior to the regular monthly Planning Board meeting at which it
is to be heard. The application shall include all of the requirements
pertaining to it as specified in this subchapter. The Planning Board shall
forward the application and its recommendations to the City Council within 30
days after its review of the application. On receiving the application and
the recommendations of the Planning Board, the City Council shall give notice
of and conduct a public hearing as required by §§ 155.305 through 155.310.
At the public hearing, all interested persons shall be permitted to testify.
The City Council may request a meeting with the Planning Board pertaining to
the conditional use permit requested. The City Council shall consider the
application and the recommendations of the Planning Board, and may approve or
deny the requested conditional use permit. The City Council must follow
quasi-judicial procedures when approving conditional use permits. A simple
majority vote is required for action on a conditional use permit. Vacant
seats and disqualified members are not to be counted when calculating the
majority.



   (B)   The conditional use permit, if approved, shall include
approval of plans as may be required. In approving the permit, the City
Council shall find:



      (1)   The use will not materially endanger the public health,
safety or general welfare if located where proposed and developed according
to the plan as submitted and approved;



      (2)   The use meets all required conditions;



      (3)   The use will not adversely affect the use or any
physical attribute of adjoining or abutting property, or that the use is a
public necessity; and



      (4)   The location and character of the use, if developed
according to the plan as submitted and approved, will be in harmony with the
area in which it is to be located.



   (C)   In approving the conditional use permit, the Planning Board
may recommend, and the City Council may designate, such conditions in
addition and in connection therewith as will, in its opinion, assure that the
use in its proposed location will be harmonious with the area in which it is
proposed to be located and with the spirit of this chapter. Site-specific
conditions in zoning districts must be limited to those required for
conformance to the city’s development plan, applicable ordinances and/or to
address project impacts. All additional conditions shall be entered in the
minutes of the meeting at which the conditional use permit is granted and
also on the conditional use permit approving, and on the approved plans
submitted therewith. All conditions of the conditional use permit shall be
binding on the original applicant, the heirs, successors and assigns. In
order to ensure that the conditions and requirements for each conditional use
permit will be fulfilled, the petitioner for the conditional use permit may
be required to enter into a contract with the city providing for the
installation of the physical improvements required as a basis for the
issuance of the conditional use permit. Performance of the contract shall be
secured by cash or surety bond which will cover the total estimated cost of
the improvements as determined by the city; provided, however, that the bond
may be waived by the City Council within its discretion.



   (D)   If the Planning Board recommends the disapproval of the
conditional use permit, and if the City Council denies the permit, each body
shall enter the reason for its action in the minutes of the meeting at which
the action is taken.



   (E)   No appeal may be taken to the Board of Adjustment from this
action of the City Council in granting or denying a conditional use permit.
Any action by the City Council shall be considered as the equivalent of
action on a proposed zoning amendment and shall be reviewable only in the
same manner as action on a proposed amendment.



   (F)   In addition to the conditions specifically imposed by the City
Council, conditional uses shall comply with the height, area and parking
regulations of the zone in which they are located.



   (G)   In the event of failure to comply with the plans approved by
the City Council, or with any other conditions imposed upon the conditional
use permit, the permit shall thereupon immediately become void and of no
effect. No building permits for further construction nor a certificate of
compliance under this conditional use permit shall be issued, and the use of
all completed structures shall immediately cease and the completed structures
not thereafter be used for any purpose other than a use-by-right as permitted
by the zone in which the property is located.



   (H)   Where plans are required to be submitted and approved as part
of the application for a conditional use permit, modifications of the
original plans may be authorized by the City Council after review and
recommendation by the Planning Board.

   a.   Such exception shall be solely for the purpose of promoting an
integrated site plan no less beneficial to the residents or occupants of such
development as well as the neighboring property, than would be obtained under
the development standards regulations of this chapter for buildings developed
on separate zoning lots;



 
 

   b.   Spacing between principal buildings shall be at least
equivalent to such spacing as would be required between buildings similarly
developed under the terms of this chapter on separate zoning lots; it does
not apply in corner-to-corner placement of buildings where perpendicular wall
exposures do not overlap, due consideration being given to the openness
normally afforded by intervening streets and alleys:



 
 

   c.   Along the periphery of such planned developments, yard shall be
provided as required by the regulations of the district in which said
development is located; and



 
 

   d.   In a residential development the maximum number of dwelling
units permitted shall be determined by dividing the net development area by
the minimum lot area per dwelling unit required by the district or districts
in which the area is located, and then increasing this number by 15%. Net
development area shall be determined by subtracting the area set aside for
nonresidential uses from the gross development area and deducting 10% of the
remainder for streets regardless of the amount of land actually required for
streets. The area of land set aside for common open or recreational use may
be included in determining the number of dwelling units permitted.



 
 

(4)   Designation of permanent common open space. No plan for a planned
development shall be approved unless such plan provides for permanent open
space equivalent to 20% of the total area in single-family residential
planned developments, 30% in multiple-family planned developments and 5% in
business and industrial planned developments.



 
 

(5)   Minimum lot area in residential planned developments. Provided the
overall number of dwelling units per acre (density) is not increased beyond
the provisions of division (4) above, and provided that the permanent common
open space is in accord with this division (5), the planned development may
include minimum lot areas per dwelling unit which are less than required in
the applicable zoning district.



 
 

(6)   Manufactured home development standards. Manufactured home

   (B)   Permit required; compliance with chapter. No person shall
construct, erect, install, maintain or use any marquee or canopy of any
material whatever over any street, alley, sidewalk or other public way or
place in the city without first having obtained and paid for and having in
force and effect therefore a permit from the City Manager as provided herein,
or without complying with all of the provisions of this section applicable
thereto.

discretion, before a permit being issued. The policy or bond shall carry an
endorsement protecting the city as its interests may appear as the result of
any accident or injury for which it might become in any manner liable. In the
event the insurance or bond should be terminated for any reason, or the
holder of any permit shall fail to keep the insurance or bond in force at any
time, then the permit for the maintenance of the marquee or canopy shall

causing the marquee or canopy to be constructed, erected, installed,
maintained or used in any way, shall save the city harmless against any suit,
action, claim, demand or liability, based on, connected with or arising out
of, in any way, the construction, erection, installation, maintenance or use

other person to attach it to or to locate it on his or her building or other
property in, on or over any public street, alley, sidewalk or other public

metal canopy which extends over any sidewalk, street, alley or other public
way in the city. If the marquee or canopy is found to be insecurely fastened
or otherwise dangerous, or in any way conflicts with the provisions of this
subchapter, he or she shall report this fact to the owner of the building or
to the occupant of the premises on which it is fastened. If the marquee or
metal canopy is not made to comply within 30 days after notice, it may be

SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES



§ 155.175  PURPOSE.



   (A)   Purpose. It is the purpose of this subchapter to regulate
sexually oriented businesses in order to protect public health, safety and
welfare of citizens and visitors and to establish reasonable and uniform
regulations to prevent the deleterious location of sexually oriented
businesses within the city. The provisions of this subchapter have neither
the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content
of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials.
Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this subchapter to restrict or
deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First
Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually
oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor
effect of this subchapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of
obscene material.



   (B)   Rationale. The following regulations were designed to address
two very distinct issues.



      (1)   One. The city wants to minimize the potential secondary
impacts of sexually oriented businesses on those identified sensitive uses,
i.e., residential districts, schools, churches, day care centers and the like.



      (2)   Two. The city wants to provide an area where people can
exercise their First Amendment right to expression without infringing on
other peoples’ rights. In allowing these uses, the city has had to balance
its constitutional obligations with the need to guarantee the local economy
and quality of life is not impacted.



   (C)   Findings. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary
effects of adult uses on the community and on findings incorporated in the
cases City of Renton v. Playtime Theaters, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986), Young v.
American Mini Theaters, U.S. 50 (1976) and Barnes v. Glenn Theater, Inc., 501
U.S. 560 (1991), and on studies in other communities including, but not
limited to: Phoenix, Arizona; Tucson, Arizona; Saint Paul, Minnesota;
Houston, Texas; Austin, Texas; Indianapolis, Indiana; Amarillo, Texas; Garden
Grove, California; and also on findings from the Report of the Attorney
General’s Working Group on the Regulation of Sexually Oriented Businesses
(June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota), and a report on The Regulation of Adult
Establishments in North Carolina (May 22, 1996), the city finds the following.



      (1)   According to the studies referenced above, sexually
oriented businesses tend to lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and
unhealthy activities that are uncontrolled by the operators of the
establishments. Further, without reasonable regulations, there is no
mechanism to make owners of these establishments responsible for the
activities that occur on their premises.



      (2)   Employees of certain sexually oriented businesses engage
in higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than
employees of other commercial establishments.



      (3)   Sexual acts, including masturbation and oral and anal
sex, occur at certain sexually oriented businesses, especially those which
provide private or semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos
or live sex shows.



      (4)   Offering and providing such space encourages such
activities, which creates unhealthy conditions.



      (5)   Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult cabarets.
and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex
within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses.



      (6)   At least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by
activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses, including. but not
limited to, syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection
(HIV-AIDS), genital herpes, hepatitis B, Non A, Non B amebiasis, salmonella
infections and shigella infections.



      (7)   Since 1951 and to the present, there has been an
increasing cumulative number of reported cases of AIDS caused by the human
immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV) in the United States and in the state.



      (8)   The number of cases of early (less than one  year)
syphilis in the United States reported annually has risen, with 33,613 cases
reported in 1982 and 68,953 reported in the United States in 1996 through
1997.



      (9)   The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States
reported annually remains at a high level, with 392,848 cases being reported
in 1995.



      (10)   According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV
infection, as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by
sexual acts.



      (11)   Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented
businesses are unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are
unhealthy and, in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities
and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to
self-regulate those activities and maintain those facilities.



      (12)   Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen
is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view
adult oriented films.



      (13)   Numerous studies and reports have demonstrated that the
consumption of alcohol or alcoholic beverages at a sexually oriented business
increases the potential for illicit sexual activity, violence, acts
characterized as disturbing the peace, and other identified nuisances to
occur.



      (14)   Studies have demonstrated that sexually oriented
businesses are regional businesses and as such have a regional draw.



      (15)   Small towns do not have sufficient target populations
to support sexually oriented businesses as has been documented in numerous
trade area studies.



      (16)   Studies have demonstrated that a sexually oriented
business in a small town will draw in a regional population consisting
largely of adult males in their twenties, whose interests and activities are
different from those of the older adults or families.



      (17)   The findings noted in divisions (C)(1) through (C)(16)
above raise substantial governmental concerns.



      (18)   Sexually oriented businesses have operational
characteristics, which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect
substantial governmental concerns.



      (19)   A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate
mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and
operators of the sexually oriented businesses. Further, such a licensing
procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to
see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with
the health, safety and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the
citizens and visitors of the town. It is appropriate to require reasonable
assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented
business, fully in possession and control of the premises and activities
occurring therein.



      (20)   Requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to
keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will
help to reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by
facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by
preventing minors from working in such establishments.



      (21)   The disclosure of certain information by those persons
ultimately responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the
sexually oriented business, where such information is substantially related
to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will
aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.



      (22)   It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of
communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding
certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this subchapter is
designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity.



      (23)   The fact that an applicant for a sexually oriented
business license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the
rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in
contravention of federal and state law and this subchapter.



      (24)   The barring of such individuals from the management of
adult uses serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct, which leads to the
transmission of sexually transmitted diseases.



      (25)   By establishing locational criteria to keep sexually
oriented businesses away from sensitive uses, such as residential districts,
schools, day care centers and the like, the potential for the identified
secondary harms to be felt by a sensitive use is lowered.



      (26)   By establishing additional lighting requirements for
the interior and exterior portions of a sexually oriented business, the
potential for illicit sexual activity or criminal activities occurring on or
near the premises of a sexually oriented business is lowered.



      (27)   By establishing a prohibition on employing, or allowing
within the premises, minors, the potential for the exploitation of such
minors by a sexually oriented business is lowered.



      (28)   By requiring internal design configuration standards
and the location of manager’s stations to allow the operators to observe
and police their own patrons, the potential for illicit sexual activity or
criminal activities occurring at a sexually oriented business is lowered.



      (29)   The general welfare, health and safety of the citizens
and visitors of the city will be promoted by the enactment of these
regulations.

§ 155.186  REGULATIONS PERTAINING TO SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES.



   (A)   A person who operates, or causes to be operated, a sexually
oriented business which exhibits on the premises a film, video cassette, live
entertainment, sells adult oriented merchandise including books, magazines,
novelty items, computer software, videos or shows other video reproductions
which depicts specified sexual activities shall comply with the following
requirements.



      (1)   Upon application for a sexually oriented business
license, the application shall be accompanied by a diagram of the premises
showing a plan thereof specifying the location of one or more manager’s
stations and the location of all overhead lighting fixtures and designating
any portion of the premises in which patrons will not be permitted. A
manager’s station may not exceed 32 square feet of floor area. The diagram
shall also designate the place in which the business license will be
conspicuously posted, if granted. A professionally prepared diagram in the
nature of an engineer’s or architect’s blueprint shall be required;
however, each diagram should be oriented to the north or to some designated
street and should be drawn to a designated scale or with marked dimensions
sufficient to show the various internal inches.



      (2)   No alteration in the configuration of a manager’s
station may be made without prior approval of the Planning and Development
Director, or his or her designee.



      (3)   It is the duty of the owners and operator of the
premises to ensure that at least one employee is on duty and situated in each
manager’s station at all times when a patron is inside the premises to
ensure that no illegal activity is taking place within the establishment.



      (4)   The interior of the premises shall be configured in such
a manner that there is an unobstructed view from a manager’s station of the
premises to which any patron is permitted access for any purpose, excluding
restrooms. Restrooms may not contain video reproduction or surveillance
equipment, books or any items offered for sale. If the premises has two or
more manager’s stations, then the interior of the premises shall be
configured in such a manner that there is an unobstructive view of the entire
area of the premises to which any patron is permitted access for any purpose
from at least one of the manager’s stations, excluding restrooms. The view
required in this division (A)(4) shall be by direct line of sight from the
manager’s station.



      (5)   It shall be the duty of the owner(s) and operator(s),
and it shall be the duty of any agent(s) and employee(s) present in the
premises, to ensure that the view area specified in division (A)(4) above
remains unobstructed by any doors, walls, merchandise, display racks or other
materials at all times and to ensure that no patron is permitted access to
any area of the premises that has been designated as off limits to patrons.



      (6)   Sexually oriented businesses shall be equipped with
overhead lighting fixtures of sufficient intensity to illuminate every place
to which patrons are permitted access. It shall be the duty of the owners and
operator, and it shall be the duty of any agents and employees present in the
premises, to ensure that this illumination is maintained at all times when
any patron is present within the premises.



      (7)   Adult motion picture theaters, adult mini motion picture
theaters and adult theaters shall be equipped with overhead lighting fixtures
of sufficient intensity to illuminate every place to which patrons are
permitted access. It shall be the duty of the owners and operator, and it
shall be the duty of any agents and employees present in the premises, to
ensure that this illumination is maintained at all times when any patron is
present within the premises.



      (8)   Adult motion picture theaters and adult theaters shall
be in an enclosed building with no less than 100 fixed seats. No private
viewing rooms or semi-private booths are allowed.



      (9)   An adult mini motion picture theater shall not allow
more than one person in a viewing room at any time.



      (10)   No owner or operator shall allow openings of any kind
to exist between viewing rooms within an adult mini motion picture theater.



      (11)   The owner or operator of an adult mini motion picture
theater shall, during each business day, regularly inspect the walls between
the viewing rooms to determine if any openings or holes exist.



      (12)   The owner or operator of an adult mini motion picture
theater shall cause all floor coverings in viewing rooms to be nonporous,
easily cleanable surfaces, with no rugs or carpeting.



      (13)   The owner or operator of an adult mini motion picture
theater shall cause all wall and ceiling surfaces in viewing rooms to be

   (A)   It shall be a violation of this subchapter for any person in a
sexually oriented business to appear in a state of full nudity or to depict
specified sexual activities.



   (B)   No owner, operator, manager, employee, entertainer or contract

NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS



§ 155.200  CONTINUATION OF NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS AND COMPLETION OF
NONCONFORMING PROJECTS.



   (A)   Nonconforming situations that were otherwise lawful on the
effective date of this chapter may be continued, subject to the restrictions
and qualifications set forth in §§ 155.201 through 155.205.



   (B)   Nonconforming projects may be completed only in accordance
with the provisions of § 155.205.



(2009 Code, § 155.170)  (Ord. passed 10-27-1992)



§ 155.201  NONCONFORMING LOTS.



   (A)   When a nonconforming lot can be used in conformity with all of
the regulations (other than the area or width requirements) applicable to the
district in which the lot is located, such a use may be made as of right.
Otherwise, the nonconforming lot may be used only in accordance with a
conditional use permit issued by the Board of Adjustment. The Board shall
issue a permit if it finds that the proposed use is one permitted by the
regulations applicable to the district in which the property is located, and
the property can be developed as proposed without any significant negative
impact on the surrounding property or the public health, safety or welfare.
In issuing the permit authorized by this division (A), the Board may allow
deviations from applicable dimensional requirements (such as setback lines
and yard size minimums) if it finds that no reasonable use of the property
can be made without the deviations.



   (B)   Whenever this chapter creates a nonconforming lot and the
owner of the nonconforming lot also owns land adjacent to it, and a portion
of this other land can be combined with the nonconforming lot to create a
conforming lot (without thereby creating other nonconformities), the owner of
the nonconforming lot, or his or her successor in interest, may not take
advantage of the provisions of division (A) above.



(2009 Code, § 155.171)  (Ord. passed 10-27-1992)



§ 155.202  EXTENSION OR ENLARGEMENT OF NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS.



   (A)   Except as specifically provided in this section, it shall be
unlawful for any person to engage in any activity that causes an increase in
the extent of nonconformity of a nonconforming situation.



   (B)   Subject to division (D) below, a nonconforming use may be
extended throughout any portion of a completed building that, when the use
was made nonconforming by this chapter, was manifestly designed or arranged
to accommodate the use. However, subject to § 155.205 (authorizing the
completion of nonconforming projects in certain circumstances), a
nonconforming use may not be extended to additional buildings or to land
outside the original building.



   (C)   Subject to § 155.205 (authorizing the completion of
nonconforming projects in certain circumstances), a nonconforming use of open
land may not be extended to cover more land than was occupied by that use
when it became nonconforming, except that a use that involves the removal of
natural materials from the lot (that is, a quarry) may be expanded to the
boundaries of the lot where the use was established at the time it became
nonconforming, if 10% or more of the earth products had already been removed
at the effective date of this chapter.



   (D)   The volume, intensity or frequency of use of property where a
nonconforming situation exists may be increased and the equipment or
processes used at a location where a nonconforming situation exists may be
changed if these or similar changes amount only to changes in the degree of
activity rather than changes in kind, and no violations of other divisions of
this section occur.



   (E)   Physical alteration of structures or the placement of new
structures on open land are unlawful if they result in:



      (1)   An increase in the total amount of space devoted to a
nonconforming use;



      (2)   Greater nonconformity with respect to dimensional
restrictions such as yard requirements, height limitations or density
requirements; or



      (3)   The enclosure of previously unenclosed areas, even
though those areas were previously used in connection with the nonconforming
activity. An area is unenclosed unless at least 75% of the perimeter of the
area is marked by a permanently constructed wall or fence.



   (F)   Minor repairs to and routine maintenance of property where
nonconforming situations exist are permitted and encouraged. Major
renovation, that is, work estimated to cost more than 25% of the assessed tax
value of the structure to be renovated (and not required by the partial or
total destruction of a structure (see division (H) below) may be done
pursuant to a permit issued by the Board of Adjustment. The Board of
Adjustment shall issue a permit if it finds that the work will not result in
a violation of any other divisions of this section (particularly division (E)
above) or make the property more incompatible with the surrounding
neighborhood.



   (G)   Notwithstanding division (E) above, any structure used for
single-family residential purposes and maintained as a nonconforming use may
be replaced with a similar structure of a larger size, so long as the
replacement does not create new nonconformities, increase the extent of
existing nonconformities with respect to yard size and setback requirements
or make the property more incompatible with the surrounding neighborhood. In
particular, a manufactured home may be replaced with a larger manufactured
home, and a “single-wide” manufactured home may be replaced with a
“double-wide”. This division (G) is subject to the limitations stated in
§ 155.205 on discontinuance of nonconforming situations.



   (H)   A structure that is nonconforming in any respect or a
structure that is used in a nonconforming manner may be reconstructed or
replaced if partially or totally destroyed, subject to the following
restrictions:



      (1)   The total amount of space devoted to a nonconforming use
may not be increased, except that a larger, single-family residential
structure may be constructed in place of a smaller one and a larger
manufactured home intended for residential use may replace a smaller one;



      (2)   The reconstructed building may not be more nonconforming
with respect to dimensional restrictions such as yard requirements, height
limitations or density requirements, and the dimensional nonconformities must
be eliminated if that can reasonably be accomplished without unduly burdening
the reconstruction process or limiting the right to continue the
nonconforming use of the building; and



      (3)   The reconstructed building may not enclose areas that
were previously unenclosed, even though those areas were used in connection
with the nonconforming activity. An area is unenclosed unless at least 75% or
more of the perimeter of the area is marked by a permanently constructed wall
or fence.



   (I)   Except for single-family residential structures (including
manufactured homes), if the estimated cost of the reconstruction work exceeds
25% of the assessed tax value of the structure, the work may be done only
after issuance of a permit by the Board of Adjustment. The Board shall issue
the permit if it finds that the work will be done in accordance with this
division (I) and that the reconstructed building will not make the property
more incompatible with the surrounding property than it was before the
destruction occurred.



(2009 Code, § 155.172)  (Ord. passed 10-27-1992)  Penalty, see § 155.999



§ 155.203  CHANGE IN KIND OF NONCONFORMING USE.



   (A)   A nonconforming use may be changed to a conforming use.
Thereafter, the property may not revert to a nonconforming use.



   (B)   A nonconforming use may be changed to another nonconforming
use only in accordance with the use permit issued by the Board of Adjustment.
The Board shall issue a permit if it finds that the proposed use will be more
compatible with the surrounding neighborhood than the use or combination of
uses in operation at the time the permit is applied for.



(2009 Code, § 155.173)  (Ord. passed 10-27-1992)



§ 155.204  DISCONTINUANCE OF NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS.



   (A)   When a nonconforming use is discontinued for a consecutive
period of 180 days, or discontinued for any period of time without a present
intention to reinstate the nonconforming use, the property involved may
thereafter be used only for conforming purposes, except as provided in
division (B) below.



   (B)   The Board of Adjustment may issue a use permit to allow a
nonconforming use that has been discontinued for more than 180 consecutive
days to be reinstated if it finds that the nonconforming use has been
discontinued for less than one year, and the discontinuance resulted from
factors that, for all practical purposes, were beyond the control of the
person maintaining the nonconforming use.



   (C)   If the principal activity on property where a nonconforming
situation other than a nonconforming use exists is discontinued for a
consecutive period of 180 days, or discontinued for any period of time
without a present intention of resuming that activity, then that property may
thereafter be used only in conformity with all of the regulations applicable
to the district in which the property is located, unless the Board of
Adjustment issues a permit to allow the property to be used (for a conforming
purpose) without correcting the nonconforming situation. The Board shall
issue a permit if it finds that the nonconforming situation cannot be
corrected without undue hardship or expense, and the nonconforming situation
is of a minor nature that does not adversely affect the surrounding property
or the general public to any significant extent.



   (D)   For purposes of determining whether a right to continue a
nonconforming situation is lost pursuant to this section, all of the
buildings, activities and operations maintained on a lot are generally to be
considered as a whole. For example, the failure to rent one apartment in a
nonconforming apartment building or one space in a nonconforming manufactured
home park for 180 days shall not result in a loss of the right to rent that
apartment or space thereafter so long as the apartment building or
manufactured home park as a whole is continuously maintained. But if a
nonconforming use is maintained in conjunction with a conforming use,
discontinuance of a nonconforming use for the required period shall terminate
the right to maintain it thereafter. And so, if a manufactured home is used
as a nonconforming use on a residential lot where a conforming residential
structure also is located, removal of that manufactured home for 180 days
terminates the right to replace it.



   (E)   When a structure or operation made nonconforming by this
chapter is vacant or discontinued at the effective date of this chapter, the
180-day period for purposes of this section begins to run at the effective
date of this chapter.



(2009 Code, § 155.174)  (Ord. passed 10-27-1992)



§ 155.205  COMPLETION OF NONCONFORMING PROJECTS.



   (A)   All work on any nonconforming project shall cease on the
effective date of this chapter, and all permits previously issued for work on
nonconforming projects shall be revoked as of that date. Thereafter, work on
nonconforming projects may begin, or may be continued, only pursuant to a
permit issued by the Board of Adjustment (except as provided in division (B)
below). The Board shall issue a permit if it finds that the applicant has in
good faith made substantial expenditures or incurred substantial binding
obligations or otherwise changed his or her position in some substantial way
in reasonable reliance on the land use law as it existed before the effective
date of this chapter and thereby would be unreasonably prejudiced if not
allowed to complete his or her project as proposed. In considering whether
these findings may be made, the Board shall be guided by the following:



      (1)   All expenditures made pursuant to a validly issued and
unrevoked building or zoning permit shall be considered as evidence of
reasonable reliance on the land use law that existed before this chapter
became effective;



      (2)   Except as provided in division (A)(1) above, no
expenditures made more than 180 days before the effective date of this
chapter shall be considered as evidence of reasonable reliance on the land
use law that existed before this chapter became effective. An expenditure is
made at the time a party incurs a binding obligation to make that expenditure;



      (3)   To the extent that expenditures are recoverable with a
reasonable effort, a party shall not be considered prejudiced by having made
those expenditures. For example, a party shall not be considered prejudiced
by having made expenditure to acquire a potential development site if the
property obtained is just as valuable under the new classification as it was
under the old, for the expenditure can be recovered by resale of the property;



      (4)   An expenditure shall be considered substantial if it is
significant both in dollar amount and in terms of the total estimated cost of
the proposed project, and the ordinary business practices of the developer;



      (5)   A person shall be considered to have acted in good faith
if actual knowledge of a proposed change in the land use law affecting the
proposed development site could not be attributed to him or her; and



      (6)   Even though a person had actual knowledge of a proposed
change in the land use law affecting a development site, the Board may still
find that he or she acted in good faith if he or she did not proceed with his
or her plans in a deliberate attempt to circumvent the effects of the
proposed ordinance. The Board may find that the developer did not proceed in
an attempt to undermine the proposed ordinance if it determines that at the
time the expenditures were made, either there was considerable doubt about
whether any ordinance would ultimately be passed, or it was not clear that
the proposed ordinance would ultimately be passed, or it was not clear that
the proposed ordinance would prohibit the intended development; and the
developer had legitimate business reasons for making expenditures.



   (B)   The requirements of division (A) above shall not apply to a
nonconforming project if the Building Inspector certifies that actual
construction of that project began at least 180 days before the effective
date of this chapter and that the work is at least 75% complete at the
effective date of this chapter.



   (C)   The Board of Adjustment shall not consider any application for
a permit authorized by division (A) above that is submitted more than 60 days
after the effective date of this chapter, unless is waives this requirement
for good cause shown.



   (D)   If the Board of Adjustment issues a permit pursuant to
division (A) above, it may attach the reasonable conditions to the permit as
it finds necessary to reduce the extent to which the nonconforming project is
incompatible with the surrounding neighborhood. In particular, the Board may
require that work on the nonconforming project be continuously maintained, if
possible, and that the project be completed as expeditiously as possible.



   (E)   The Building Inspector shall send copies of this section to
the owners (and developers, if different from the owners) of all properties
in regard to which permits have been issued for nonconforming projects or in
regard to which a nonconforming project is otherwise known to be under
construction. This notice shall be sent by registered mail not less than 15
days before the effective date of this chapter.



   (F)   The Board of Adjustment shall establish expedited procedures
for hearing applications for permits under this section. These applications
shall be heard, whenever possible, before the effective date of this chapter,
so that construction work is not needlessly interrupted.



   (G)   When it appears from the developer’s plans or otherwise that
the nonconforming project was intended to be or reasonably could be completed
in stages, segments or other discreet units, the Board of Adjustment shall
not allow the nonconforming project to be constructed or completed in a
fashion that is larger or more extensive than is necessary to allow the
developer to recoup and obtain a reasonable rate of return on the
expenditures he or she has made in connection with that nonconforming project.

DUTIES OF THE BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT
FOR APPEALS, VARIANCES AND INTERPRETATIONS



§ 155.260  APPEALS.



   The Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide appeals from decisions of
administrative officials charged with the enforcement of this chapter and may
hear appeals arising out of any other ordinance that regulates land use or
development, pursuant to all of the following:



   (A)   Any person who has standing under G.S. § 160A-393(d) or the
city may appeal a decision to the Board of Adjustment. An appeal is taken by
filing a notice of appeal with the City Clerk. The notice of appeal shall
state the grounds for the appeal. The notice of appeal must be on an official
form that may be obtained from the administrator.



   (B)   The owner of the property that is the subject of the decision
or the party who sought the decision shall have 30 days from receipt of the
written notice of the decision of the administrative official within which to
file an appeal. Any other person withstanding to appeal shall have 30 days
from receipt from any source of actual or constructive notice of the decision
within with to file an appeal.



   (C)   After an appeal is filed, the administrative official shall
within five working days notify members of the Board of Adjustment of the
appeal. The official who made the decision shall transmit to the Board all
documents and exhibits constituting the record upon which the action appealed
from is taken. The official shall also provide a copy of the record to the
appellant and to the owner of the property that is the subject of the appeal
if the appellant is not the owner.



   (D)   An appeal of a notice of violation or other enforcement order
stays enforcement of the action appealed from unless the administrative
official who made the decision certifies to the Board of Adjustment after
notice of appeal has been fled that because of the facts stated in an
affidavit, a stay would cause imminent peril to life or property or because
the violation is transitory in nature, a stay would seriously interfere with
enforcement of the ordinance. In that case, enforcement proceedings shall not
be stayed except by a restraining order, which may be granted by a court. If
enforcement proceedings are not stayed, the appellant may file with the
administrative official a request for an expedited hearing of the appeal, and
the Board of Adjustment shall meet to hear the appeal within 15 days after
such a request is filed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, appeals of decisions
granting a permit or otherwise affirming that a proposed use of property is
consistent with the ordinance shall not stay the further review of an
application for permits or permissions to use such property; in these
situations the appellant may request and the board may grant a stay of a
final decision of permit applications or building permits affected by the
issue being appealed.



   (E)   The Board of Adjustment may reverse or affirm (wholly or
partly) or may modify the order, requirement or decision or determination
appealed from and shall make any order, requirement, decision or
determination that in its opinion ought to be made in the case before it. To
this end, the Board shall have all the powers of the officer from whom the
appeal is taken.



   (F)   Subject to the provision of division (D) of this section, the
Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide the appeal within a reasonable
time. The administrative official who made the decision shall be present at
the hearing as a witness. The appellant shall not be limited at the hearing
to matters stated in the notice of appeal. If any party or the city would be
unduly prejudiced by the presentation of matters not presented in the notice
of appeal, the Board shall continue the hearing.



   (G)   When hearing an appeal pursuant to G.S. § 160A-400.9(e), any
other appeal in the nature of certiorari, the hearing shall be based on the
record below and the scope of review shall be as provided in G.S. §
160A-393(k).



   (H)   The parties to an appeal that has been made under this section
may agree to mediation or other forms of alternative dispute resolution.



(2009 Code, § 155.235)  (Ord. passed 10-27-1992; Ord. 2014-2-25-25, passed

§ 155.261  VARIANCES.



   (A)   An application for a variance shall be submitted on an
official city form obtained from the Zoning Officer.



   (B)   When unnecessary hardships would result from carrying out the
strict letter of a zoning ordinance, the Board of Adjustment shall vary any
of the provisions of the ordinance upon a showing of all of the following:



      (1)   Unnecessary hardship would result from the strict
application of the ordinance. It shall not be necessary to demonstrate that,
in the absence of the variance, no reasonable use can be made of the property.



      (2)   The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar
to the property, such as location, size, or topography. Hardships resulting
from personal circumstances, as well as hardships resulting from conditions
that are common to the neighborhood or the general public, may not be the
basis for granting a variance.



      (3)   The hardship did not result from actions taken by the
applicant or the property owner. The act of purchasing property with
knowledge that circumstances exist that may justify the granting of a
variance shall not be regarded as a self-created hardship.



      (4)   The requested variance is consistent with the spirit,
purpose, and intent of the ordinance, such that public safety is secured, and
substantial justice is achieved.



   (C)   No change in permitted uses may be authorized by variance.
Appropriate conditions may be imposed on any variance, provided that the
conditions are reasonably related to the variance. Any other ordinance that
regulates land use or development may provide for variances consistent with
the provisions of this division (C), if a variance is granted, the Board of
Adjustment shall through conditions placed on the variance protect the
general public’s interest and neighboring property owners.



   (D)   Variances may be granted for a specific period or indefinitely.



   (E)   The nature of any variance granted, any conditions imposed,
and the time period shall become a part by reference to any related zoning
permit or building ordinance.



(2009 Code, § 155.236)  (Ord. passed 10-27-1992; Ord. 2014-2-25-25, passed
2-25-2014)



§ 155.262  INTERPRETATIONS.



   (A)   The Board of Adjustment is authorized to interpret the zoning
map and to pass upon disputed questions of lot lines or district boundary
lines and similar questions. If the questions arise in the context of an
appeal from a decision of the Zoning Officer, they shall be handled as
provided in § 155.260.



   (B)   An application for a map interpretation shall be submitted to
the Board of Adjustment by filing the application with the Zoning Officer.
The application shall contain sufficient information to enable the Board to
make the necessary interpretation.



   (C)   Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of districts as
shown on the official zoning map, the following rules shall apply:



      (1)   Boundaries indicated as approximately following the
centerlines of alleys, streets, highways, streams or railroads shall be
construed to follow the centerlines;



      (2)   Boundaries indicated as approximately following city
limits or extraterritorial boundary lines, shall be construed as following
the lines, limits or boundaries;



      (3)   Where a district boundary divides a lot or where
distances are not specifically indicated on the official zoning map, the
boundary shall be determined by measurement, using the scale of the official
zoning map; and



      (4)   Where any street or alley is hereafter officially
vacated or abandoned, the regulation applicable to each parcel of abutting
property shall apply to that portion of the street or alley added thereto by
virtue of the vacation or abandonment.

§ 155.263  BURDEN OF PROOF IN APPEALS AND VARIANCES.



   (A)   When an appeal is taken to the Board of Adjustment, the
Administrator shall have the initial burden of presenting to the Board
sufficient evidence and argument to justify the order or decision appealed
from. The burden of presenting evidence and argument to the contrary then
shifts to the appellant, who shall also have the burden of persuasion.



   (B)   The burden of presenting evidence sufficient to allow the
Board of Adjustment to reach the conclusions set forth in § 155.262(B), as
well as the burden of persuasion on those issues, remains with the applicant
seeking the variance.

§ 155.264  BOARD ACTION ON APPEALS AND VARIANCES.



   (A)   With respect to appeals, a motion to reverse, affirm or modify
the order, requirement, decision or determination appealed from shall
include, insofar as practicable, a statement of the specific reasons or
findings that support that motion. If a motion to reverse or modify is not
made or fails to receive the majority vote of the entire Board necessary for
adoption, then a motion to uphold the decision appealed from shall be in
order. Insofar as practicable, this motion shall include a statement of the
findings, or reasons that support it.



   (B)   Before granting a variance, the Board must take a separate
vote and vote affirmatively by a four-fifths majority of the entire Board on
each of the five required findings stated in § 155.261(B)(1). Insofar as
practicable, a motion to make an affirmative finding on each of the
requirements set forth in § 155.261(B)(1) shall include a statement of the
specific reasons for findings of fact supporting the motion.



   (C)   A motion to deny a variance may be made on the basis that any
one or more of the five criteria set forth in § 155.261(B)(1) are not
satisfied or that the application is incomplete. Insofar as practicable, such
a motion shall include a statement of the specific reasons or findings of
fact that support it.

   (B)   A permit issued by representatives of the city shall conform

   (C)   Applicants for building permits, zoning permits, conditional
use permits and variances must have legal authority to use the property in

occupied. The intended use may not be commenced, no buildings occupied or
parcels sold until all of the requirements of this chapter, and any
additional conditions imposed have been met. The use may be commenced and/or
buildings occupied only after an occupancy permit has been issued by the
Building Inspector.



   (E)   Failure to observe the requirement and conditions of a permit
may result in permit revocation and/or other penalties.

single-family houses or duplexes, the Zoning Officer shall develop standard
forms that will expedite the submission of the necessary plans and other
required information.

intends to make it. However, as provided in § 155.278, if the Zoning Officer
believes that the application is incomplete, he or she shall recommend to the
appropriate board that the application be denied on that basis.

development will not comply with one or more requirements of this chapter
(not including those requirements concerning which variance has been granted
or those the applicant is not required to comply with under the circumstances
specified in nonconforming situations); or

§ 155.282  EXPIRATION OF PERMITS.



   (A)   Zoning and conditional use permits shall expire automatically
if, within one year after the issuance of the permits:



      (1)   The use authorized by the permits has not commenced, in
circumstances where no substantial construction, erection, alteration,
excavation, demolition or similar work is necessary before commencement of
the use; or



      (2)   Less than 10% of the total cost of all construction,
erection, alteration, excavation, demolition or similar work on any
development authorized by the permits has been completed on the site.



   (B)   If, after some physical alteration to land or structures
begins to take place, the work is discontinued for a period of one year if
the date of discontinuance occurs more than one year after the issuance of
the permit, or equal to two years less than the time between the issuance of
the permit and the time work is discontinued if the date of discontinuance
occurs less than one year after the issuance of the permit, then the permit
authorizing the work shall immediately expire. However, expiration of the
permit shall not affect the provisions of this section.



   (C)   The permit issuing authority may extend for a period up to one
year the date when a permit would otherwise expire pursuant to divisions (A)
or (B) above if it concludes that the permit has not yet expired, the permit
recipient has proceeded with due diligence and in good faith and conditions
have not changed so substantially as to warrant a new application. Successive
extensions may be granted for periods up to one year upon the same findings.
All extensions may be granted without resort to the formal processes and fees
required for a new permit.



   (D)   For purposes of this section, the permit within the
jurisdiction of the City Council is issued when the Board votes to approve
the application and issue the permit. A permit within the jurisdiction of the
Zoning Officer is issued when the earlier of the following takes place:



      (1)   A copy of the fully executed permit is delivered to the
permit recipient, and delivery is accomplished when the permit is hand
delivered or mailed to the permit applicant; or



      (2)   The Zoning Officer notifies the permit applicant that
the application has been approved and that all that remains before a fully
executed permit can be delivered is for the applicant to take certain
specified actions, such as having the permit executed by the property owner
so it can be recorded if required under state law.



   (E)   Notwithstanding any of the provisions for nonconforming
situations, this section shall be applicable to permits issued prior to the
date this section becomes effective.

§ 155.283  EFFECT OF PERMIT ON SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.



   (A)   Zoning and conditional use permits authorize the permittee to
make use of land and structures in a particular way. The permits are
transferable. However, so long as the land or structures or any portion
thereof covered under a permit continues to be used for the purposes for
which the permit was granted, then:



      (1)   No person (including successors or assigns of the person
who obtained the permit) may make use of the land or structures covered under
the permit for the purposes authorized in the permit except in accordance
with all the terms and requirements of that permit; and



      (2)   The terms and requirements of the permit apply to and
restrict the use of land or structures covered under the permit, not only
with respect to all persons having any interest in the property at the time
the permit was obtained, but also with respect to persons who subsequently
obtain any interest in all or part of the covered property and wish to use it
for or in connection with purposes other than those for which the permit was
originally issued, so long as the persons who subsequently obtain an interest
in the property had actual or record notice (as provided in § 155.282(B)) of
the existence of the permit at the time they acquired their interest.



   (B)   Whenever a zoning or conditional use permit is issued to
authorize development (other than single-family residences or duplexes) on a
tract of land in excess of one acre, nothing authorized by the permit may be
done until the record owner of the property signs a written acknowledgment
that the permit has been issued.

   (A)   No deviations or amendments to zoning or conditional use
permit shall be allowed without specific action of the Planning Board and
City Council. No deviations or amendments to variance permits shall be
allowed without specific action of the Board of Adjustment.



   (B)   All other requests for changes in approved plans will be
processed as new applications. If the requests are required to be acted upon
by the City Council, new conditions may be imposed, but the applicant retains
the right to reject the additional conditions by withdrawing his or her
request for an amendment and may then proceed in accordance with the
previously issued permit.



(2009 Code, § 155.264)  (Ord. passed 10-27-1992)



§ 155.285  RECONSIDERATION OF BOARD ACTION.



   Whenever the City Council disapproves a conditional use permit
application or the Board of Adjustment disapproves an application for a
variance, on any basis other than the failure of the applicant to submit a
complete application, the action may not be reconsidered by the respective
Board for a period of one year unless the applicant clearly demonstrates that:



   (A)   Circumstances affecting the property that is the subject of
the application have substantially changed;



   (B)   The application is changed in some substantial way; or



   (C)   New information is available that could not, with reasonable
diligence, have been presented at a previous hearing.

   The recipient of any zoning or conditional uses permit, or his or her
successor, shall be responsible for maintaining all common areas,
improvements or facilities required by this chapter, or any permit issued in
accordance with its provisions, except those areas, improvements or
facilities with respect to which an offer of dedication to the public has
been accepted by the appropriate public authority. As illustration, and
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, this means that private
roads and parking areas, water and sewer lines, and recreational facilities
must be properly maintained so that they can be used in the manner intended,
and required vegetation and trees used for screening, landscaping or shading
must be replaced if they die or are destroyed.

necessary to the issuance or denial by the Board of Adjustment of the
requested appeal or variance appeal shall be based upon reliable evidence.
Competent evidence (evidence admissible in a court of law) shall be preferred
whenever reasonably available, but in no case may crucial findings be based
solely upon incompetent evidence unless competent evidence is not reasonably
available, the evidence in question appears to be particularly reliable and
the matter at issue is not seriously disputed.

the Chair explaining why it is necessary for certain witnesses or evidence to
be compelled. The Chair shall issue requested subpoenas he or she determines
to be relevant, reasonable in nature and scope, and not oppressive. The Chair
shall rule on any motion to quash or modify a subpoena. Decisions regarding
subpoenas made by the Chair may be appealed to the full Board of Adjustment.
If a person fails or refuses to obey a subpoena issued pursuant to this
section, the Board of Adjustment or the party seeking the subpoena may apply
to the General Court of Justice for an order requiring that its subpoena be
obeyed, and the court shall have jurisdiction to issue these orders after
notice to all proper parties.

the application with the stipulation that the permit will not be issued until
plans reflecting the agreed upon changes are submitted to the Administrator.

VESTED RIGHT PROVISIONS



§ 155.325  PURPOSE.



   (A)   The purpose of this subchapter is to implement the provisions
of G.S. § 160A-385.1 pursuant to which a statutory zoning vested right is
established upon the approval of a site specific development plan.



   (B)   Neither a variance, a sketch plan nor any other document that
fails to describe with reasonable certainty the type and intensity of use for
a specified parcel or parcels of property shall constitute a site specific
development plan.



(2009 Code, § 155.305)  (Ord. passed 10-27-1992)



§ 155.326  ESTABLISHMENT OF A ZONING VESTED RIGHT.



   (A)   A zoning vested right shall be deemed established upon the
valid approval, conditional use approval or variance by the City Council or
Board of Adjustment, as applicable of a site specific development plan,
following notice and public hearing.



   (B)   The approving authority may approve a site specific
development plan upon the terms and conditions as may reasonably be necessary
to protect the public health, safety and welfare.



   (C)   Notwithstanding divisions (A) and (B) above, approval of a
site specific development plan with the condition that a variance be obtained
shall not confer a zoning vested right unless and until the necessary
variance is obtained.



   (D)   A site specific development plan shall be deemed approved upon
the effective date of the approval authority’s action or ordinance relating
thereto.



   (E)   The establishment of a zoning vested right shall not preclude
the application of overlay zoning that imposes additional requirements but
does not affect the allowable type or intensity of use, or ordinances or
regulations that are general in nature and are applicable to all property
subject to land use regulation by the city, including, but not limited to,
Building, Fire, Plumbing, Electrical and Mechanical Codes. Otherwise
applicable new or amended regulations shall become effective with respect to
property that is subject to a site specific development plan upon the
expiration or termination of the vested right in accordance with this chapter.



   (F)   A zoning vested right is not a personal right, but shall
attach to and run with the applicable property. After approval of a site
specific development plan, all successors to the original landowner shall be
entitled to exercise the right while applicable.



(2009 Code, § 155.306)  (Ord. passed 10-27-1992)



§ 155.327  APPROVAL PROCEDURES AND APPROVAL AUTHORITY.



   (A)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, an application
for site specific development plan approval shall be processed in accordance
with the procedures established by ordinance and shall be considered by the
designated approval authority for the specific type of zoning permit,
conditional use permit, building permit or variance approval for which
application is made.



   (B)   Notwithstanding the provisions of division (A) above, if the
authority to issue a particular zoning or conditional use, building or
variance permit or approval has been delegated by ordinance to a board,
committee or administrative official other than the City Council, Board of
Adjustment or other planning agency designated to perform any or all of the
duties of the Board of Adjustment, in order to obtain a zoning vested right,
the applicant must request, in writing at the time of application that the
application be considered and acted on by the City Council or Board of
Adjustment, following notice and a public hearing as provided in G.S. §
160A-364.



   (C)   In order for a zoning vested right to be established upon
approval of a site specific development plan, the applicant must indicate at
the time of application, on a form to be provided by the city that a zoning
vested right is being sought.



   (D)   Each map, plat, site plan or other document evidencing a site
specific development plan shall contain the following notation: “Approval
of this plan establishes a zoning vested right under G.S. § 160A-385.1.
Unless terminated at an earlier date, the zoning vested right shall be valid
until (date).”



   (E)   Following approval or conditional approval of a site specific
development plan, nothing in this chapter shall exempt a plan from subsequent
reviews and approvals to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of
the original approval, provided that the reviews and approvals are not
inconsistent with the original approval.



   (F)   Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit the revocation of the
original approval or other remedies for failure to comply with applicable
terms and conditions of the approval or this chapter.

chapter shall remain vested for a period of two years. This vesting shall not
be extended by any amendments or modifications to a site specific development
plan unless expressly provided by the approval authority at the time the
amendment or modification is approved.



   (B)   Upon issuance of a building permit, the expiration provisions
of G.S. § 160A-418 and the revocation provisions of G.S. § 160A-422 shall
apply, except that a building permit shall not expire or be revoked because
of the running of time while a zoning vested right under this section is
outstanding.

legal rate until paid. Compensation shall not include any diminution in the
value of the property which is caused by the action;



   (E)   Upon findings by the City Council, by ordinance after notice
and a hearing, that the landowner or his or her representative intentionally
supplied inaccurate information or made material misrepresentations which
made a difference in the approval by the approval authority of the site
specific development plan; or



   (F)   Upon the enactment or promulgation of a state or federal law
or regulation that precludes development as contemplated in the site specific
development plan, in which case the approval authority may modify the
affected provisions, upon a finding that the change in state or federal law
has a fundamental effect on the plan, by ordinance after notice and a hearing.

§ 156.01  PURPOSE AND LEGISLATIVE INTENT.



   (A)   The Telecommunications Act of 1996 affirmed the city’s
authority concerning the placement, construction and modification of wireless
telecommunications facilities or complexes. This chapter provides for the
safe and efficient integration of wireless facilities or complexes necessary
for the provision of advanced wireless telecommunications services throughout
the community and to ensure the ready availability of reliable wireless
services to the public, government agencies and first responders, with the
intention of furthering the public safety and general welfare.



   (B)   The city finds that wireless telecommunications facilities
(facilities) and complexes may pose significant concerns to the health,
safety, public welfare, character and environment of the city and its
inhabitants. The city also recognizes that facilitating the development of
wireless service technology can be an economic development asset to the city
and of significant benefit to the city and its residents. In order to assure
that the placement, construction or modification of a facility or complex is
consistent with the city’s land use policies, the city is adopting a
single, comprehensive, wireless telecommunications facility or complex
application and permitting process. The intent of this chapter is to minimize
the physical impact of wireless telecommunications facilities on the
community, protect the character of the community to the extent reasonably
possible, establish a fair and efficient process for review and approval of
applications, assure an integrated, comprehensive review of environmental
impacts of such facilities, and protect the health, safety and welfare of the
city.

regardless of the location or whether the facility or any of its components
is located inside or outside a structure or building.



   (BB)   The existence of a lease or an option to lease shall not be
deemed justification for not complying with the siting priorities set forth
in this section, as well as other applicable land use and zoning regulations.
An applicant may not bypass sites of higher priority solely because the site
proposed is under lease or an option to lease exists. If a site other than
the number one priority is proposed, the applicant must explain to the
reasonable satisfaction of the city why co-location is technically or
commercially impracticable. Build-to-suit agreements between carriers and a
proposed tower owner shall not be a valid basis for any claim of exemption,
exception or waiver from compliance with this section.



   (CC)   Any technical information must be provided in such a manner,
form and with such content that it is able to be verified by a third party
using the information used and provided by the applicant.



   (DD)   All costs associated with the preparation and submission of
an application and/or necessitated by the requirements for obtaining and
maintaining any and all city permits shall be borne by the applicant or
permittee.

      (1)   The intended area cannot be served from outside the
district or visually sensitive area; and



      (2)   That no existing or previously approved facility or
complex can reasonably be used to accommodate equipment needed to provide the
intended service.



   (D)   All applications for a proposed facility or complex applicable
to this section shall contain clear and convincing evidence that the facility
or complex is sited and designed so as to create the least visual
intrusiveness reasonably possible given the facts and circumstances involved.
To achieve this goal the city expressly reserves the right to require the use
of stealth or camouflage siting techniques such as, but not limited to, DAS
(distributive antenna system) or a functional equivalent as regards size, and
such shall be subject to approval by the Council.



   (E)   If proposing a new tower or support structure, or a
substantial co-location or modification of an existing structure, the
applicant shall be required to submit clear and convincing technical evidence
that there is no alternative solution within the search ring of the proposed
site that would be less visually intrusive and that not to permit the
proposed new tower or support structure, or a substantial co-location or
modification would result in the prohibition of service or the perpetuation
of a significant gap in service.



   (F)   In order to better inform the public, in the case of a new
tower, the applicant shall hold a “balloon test” prior to the initial
public hearing on the application. The applicant shall arrange to fly, or
raise upon a temporary mast, a minimum of a ten feet in length brightly
colored balloon with horizontal stabilizers at the maximum height of the
proposed new tower. The use of spherical balloons shall not be permitted.



   (G)   At least 14 days prior to the conduct of the balloon test, a
sign shall be erected so as to be clearly visible from the road nearest the
proposed site and shall be removed no later than 14 days after the conduct of
the balloon test. The sign shall be at least four feet by eight feet in size
and shall be readable from the road by a person with 20/20 vision.



      (1)   Such sign shall be placed off, but as near to, the
public right-of-way as is possible.



      (2)   Such sign shall contain the times and date(s) of the
balloon test and contact information.



      (3)   The dates, (including a second date, in case of poor
visibility or wind in excess of 15 mph on the initial date) times and
location of this balloon test shall be advertised by the applicant seven and
14 days in advance of the first test date in a newspaper with a general
circulation in the city and as agreed to by the city. The applicant shall
inform the city in writing, of the dates and times of the test, at least 14
days in advance. The balloon shall be flown for at least four consecutive
hours between 10:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. on the dates chosen. The primary date
shall be on a weekend, but the second date, in case of poor visibility on the
initial date, may be on a weekday. A report with pictures from various
locations of the balloon shall be provided with the application.



      (4)   The applicant shall notify all property owners and
residents located within 1,500 feet of the nearest property line of the
subject property of the proposed construction of the tower and facility or
complex and of the date(s) and time(s) of the balloon test. Such notice shall
be provided at least 14 days prior to the conduct of the balloon test and
shall be delivered by first-class mail. The City Planner shall be provided an
attested copy of the list of addresses to which notification is provided. The
wireless telecommunications facility or complex shall be structurally
designed to accommodate at least four antenna arrays, with each array to be
flush-mounted or as close to flush-mounted as is reasonable possible.



   (H)   The applicant shall provide certified documentation in the
form of a structural analysis and report, including all calculations, showing
that the facility or complex will be constructed to meet all local, state and
federal structural requirements for loads, including wind and ice loads and
including, but not limited to, all applicable ANSI (American National
Standards Institute) TIA 222 guidelines. In the event of a conflict the more
stringent shall apply.



   (I)   (1)   The applicant shall furnish a visual impact
assessment, which may be required to include:



         (a)   A computer generated “Zone of Visibility Map”
at a minimum of one mile radius from the proposed structure shall be provided
to illustrate locations from which the proposed installation may be seen,
with and without foliage; and



         (b)   To-scale pictorial representations (photo
simulations) of “before and after” views from key viewpoints inside of
the city as may be appropriate and required, including, but not limited to,
state highways and other major roads, state and local parks, other public
lands, historic districts, preserves and historic sites normally open to the
public, and from any other location where the site is visible to a large
number of visitors, travelers or residents.



      (2)   Guidance will be provided concerning the appropriate key
viewpoints at the pre-application meeting. In addition to photographic
simulations to scale showing the visual impact, the applicant shall provide a
map showing the locations of where the pictures were taken and the
distance(s) of each location from the proposed structure.



   (J)   The applicant shall provide a written description and a visual
rendering demonstrating how it shall effectively screen from view the bottom
15 feet of the facility or complex and all related equipment and structures
associated with the facility or complex.



   (K)   A building permit shall not be issued for the construction of
a new tower or other support structure until there is an application for or
by a specific carrier that documents that the facility or complex is
necessary for that carrier to serve the community and that co-location on an
existing structure is not feasible.



   (L)   Co-location on an existing structure is not reasonably
feasible if such is technically or commercially impracticable or the owner of
the structure is unwilling to enter into a contract for such use at fair
market value. Sufficient documentation in the form of clear and convincing
evidence to support such claims shall be submitted with an application for
the first carrier in order to determine whether co-location on existing
structures is reasonably feasible and to document the need for a specific
stated height, and that less height will serve to prohibit or have the effect
of prohibiting the provision of service.

§ 156.11  REQUIREMENTS FOR ELIGIBLE FACILITY CO-LOCATIONS OR MODIFICATIONS.



   (A)   Information required. For the co-location, modification or
upgrade of a wireless facility that qualifies as an eligible facilities
request under applicable law, the following information shall be required to
be contained in an application. Any technical information must be provided in
such a manner, form and with such content that it is able to be verified by a
third party using the information used and provided by the applicant.



      (1)   Safety.



         (a)   The age of the tower or other support structure in
years, including the date of the grant of the original permit;



         (b)   A description of the type of tower, e.g., guyed,

         (h)   The number, type and model of the antenna(s)
proposed, along with a copy of the manufacturer’s specification sheet(s),
i.e., cut sheet(s), for the antennas; and



         (i)   Certification from the owner of the facility
certifying that the facility and all attachments thereto are currently in
compliance with the conditions of the approved conditional use permit or
administrative approval and setting forth any noncompliant situation.



      (2)   Ownership and management.



         (a)   The name, address and phone number of the person
preparing the application;



         (b)   The name, address and phone number of the property
owner and the applicant, including the legal name of the applicant. If the
owner of the structure is different than the applicant, the name and all
necessary contact information shall be provided;



         (c)   The postal address and tax map parcel number of
the property; and



         (d)   A copy of the FCC license applicable for the

      (3)   Construction. The total cost of construction and the
value of all new and/or replacement components and equipment.



   (B)   Attachments to existing structures other than towers.



      (1)   Attachments to buildings. To preserve and protect the
nature and character of the area and create the least visually intrusive
impact reasonably possible under the facts and circumstances, any attachment
to a building or other structure with a fascia, the antennas shall be mounted
on the fascia without increasing the height of the building or other
structure, unless it can be proven that such will prohibit or have the effect
of prohibiting the provision of service, and all such attachments and exposed
cabling shall use camouflage or stealth techniques to match as closely as
possible the color and texture of the structure.



      (2)   Utility poles and light standards. If attaching to a
utility pole or light standard, no equipment may extend more than six feet
beyond the top of the structure and no equipment other than cabling shall be
lower than 15 feet above the ground.



      (3)   Attachments to water tanks. If attaching to a water
tank, in order to maintain the current profile and height, mounting on the
top of the tank or the use of a corral shall only be permitted if the
applicant can prove that to locate elsewhere less visually on the tank will
prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of service or that
to do so would be technologically impracticable.



      (4)   Profile. So as to be the least visually intrusive and
create the smallest profile reasonably possible under the facts and
circumstances involved, and thereby have the least adverse visual effect, all
antennas attached shall be flush-mounted or as near to flush-mounted as is
possible, unless it can be proven that such would prohibit or serve to
prohibit the provision of service or be technologically impracticable.



(Ord. 2016-4-26-38, passed 4-26-2016)



§ 156.12  LOCATION OF WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES.



   (A)   No tower or other new support structure shall be permitted in
any existing or planned (i.e., platted) residential neighborhood.



   (B)   If a new telecommunications support structure is proposed to
be located within one-half mile of an existing or planned residential
neighborhood, irrespective of the type of zoning, the support structure shall
not be taller than ten feet above the tallest obstruction between the
proposed support structure and a residential neighborhood.



   (C)   Applicants shall locate, site and erect all facilities and
associated equipment in accordance with the following priorities, in the
following order: more than ten feet taller than existing surrounding
structures:



      (1)   On existing structures without increasing the height or
size of the profile of the tower or structure;



      (2)   On existing structures without increasing the height of
the structure by more than can be proven by clear and convincing technical
evidence is needed;



      (3)   On properties in areas zoned for commercial use;



      (4)   On properties in areas zoned for rural use;



      (5)   On properties in designated Renaissance or Historic
Districts without increasing the height or size of the profile of the support
structure and only if camouflaged or stealthed to the satisfaction of the
Planning Director; and



      (6)   On properties in areas zoned for residential use without
increasing the height of the support structure or size of the profile and
only if camouflaged or stealthed to the satisfaction of the Planning Director.



   (D)   If the applicant proposes and commits to locate on city-owned
property or structures, the city expressly reserves to right to waive the
application fee that would otherwise be paid to the city.



   (E)   If the proposed site is not proposed for the highest priority
listed above, then a detailed narrative and technical explanation shall be
provided as regards why a site from all higher priority designations was not
selected. The person seeking such an exception must demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the Planning Director and the Council the reason or reasons
why a conditional use permit or administrative approval should be granted for
the proposed site.



   (F)   Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary, the city may
approve any site located within an area in the above list of priorities,
provided that the city finds that the proposed site is in the best interest
of the health, safety and welfare of the city and its inhabitants and will
not have a deleterious effect on the nature and character of the community
and neighborhood. The city may also direct that the proposed location be
changed to another location that is more in keeping with the goals of this
section and the public interest as determined by the Council and that serves
the intent of the applicant.



   (G)   Notwithstanding that a potential site may be situated in an
area of highest priority or highest available priority, the city may
disapprove an application for any of the following reasons:



      (1)   Conflict with safety and safety-related codes and
requirements, including, but not limited to, setback and fall zone
requirements;



      (2)   Noncompliance with zoning or land use regulations;



      (3)   The placement and location of a facility or complex
would create an unacceptable risk, or the reasonable possibility of such, to
any person or entity for physical or financial damage, or of trespass on
private property;



      (4)   The placement and location of a facility or complex
would result in a conflict with, compromise in or change in the nature or
character of the adjacent and surrounding area, and expressly including, but
not limited to, loss in value as measured over the 12 months preceding the
application having been filed;



      (5)   Conflicts with the provisions of zoning or land use
regulations; and



      (6)   Failure to submit a complete application as required
under this section within 60 days after proper notice and opportunity to make
the application complete shall be deemed to have been abandoned and require
no action.



   (H)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this section, for
good cause shown such as the ability to utilize a shorter, smaller or less
intrusive facility or complex elsewhere and still accomplish the primary
service objective, if relocation could result in a less intrusive facility or
complex singly or in combination with other locations, the city may require
the relocation of a proposed site, including allowing for the fact that
relocating the site chosen by the applicant may require the use of more than
one site to provide substantially the same service.



(Ord. 2016-4-26-38, passed 4-26-2016)



§ 156.13  TYPE AND HEIGHT OF TOWERS.



   (A)   All new towers shall be of the monopole type. No new towers of
a lattice or guyed type shall be permitted, unless relief is otherwise
expressly granted.



   (B)   The maximum permitted total height of a new tower or other
proposed support structure shall be 100 feet above pre-construction ground
level, unless it can be shown by clear and convincing technical evidence from
a carrier who has committed to use the tower that such height would prohibit
or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of service in the intended
service area within the city. The maximum permitted height is permissive and
is expressly not as-of-right.



   (C)   As the policy decision has been made that more facilities of a
shorter and less intrusive height is in the public interest, as opposed to
fewer but taller support structures, spacing or the distance between
facilities shall be such that the service may be provided without exceeding
the maximum permitted height.



   (D)   If proposed to be taller than the maximum permitted height,
the applicant for a new tower or support structure shall submit clear and
convincing technical evidence by a carrier or wireless service provider that
has committed to use the tower or other support structure justifying the
total height requested and the basis therefore, as well as a copy of a lease
or a written commitment to use the facility upon completion of its
construction. If the applicant chooses to provide evidence in the form of
propagation studies, such must include all modeling information and support
data used to produce the studies at the requested height and a minimum of ten
feet lower to enable verification of the need for the requested height. The
city or its delegate will provide the form that shall be used for reporting
such information.



   (E)   The city reserves the right to require a drive test to be
conducted under the supervision of the city or its delegate:



      (1)   As evidence of; or



      (2)   To verify the technical need for what is requested.



   (F)   At no time shall a tower or other support structure be of a
height that requires lighting by the FAA.



   (G)   Towers shall be structurally designed to support a minimum of
four carriers using functionally equivalent equipment to that used by the
first carrier attaching to a tower or other support structure, so that the
height can be increased if needed.



(Ord. 2016-4-26-38, passed 4-26-2016)



§ 156.14  VISIBILITY AND AESTHETICS.



   (A)   Generally. No tower or support structure that is not a
building and is constructed after the effective date of this section shall be
tall enough to require lighting by the FAA.



   (B)   Stealth. All new facilities, including, but not limited to,
towers, shall utilize stealth or camouflage siting techniques that are
acceptable to the city, unless such can be shown to be either commercially
impracticable or technologically impracticable.



   (C)   Finish/color. Towers shall be galvanized and/or painted with a
rust-preventive paint of an appropriate color to harmonize with the
surroundings and shall be maintained in accordance with the requirements of
this section.



   (D)   Lighting. Notwithstanding the prohibition of lighting, in the
event lighting is subsequently required by the FAA, the applicant shall
provide a detailed plan for sufficient lighting of as unobtrusive and
inoffensive an effect as is permissible under state and federal regulations.
For any facility or complex for which lighting is required under the FAA’s
regulations, or that for any reason has lights attached, all such lighting
shall be affixed with technology that enables the light to be seen as
intended from the air, but that prevents the ground scatter effect so that it
is not able to be seen from the ground to a height of at least 20 degrees
vertical for a distance of at least one mile in a level terrain situation.
Such device shall be compliant with or not expressly in conflict with FAA
regulations. A physical shield may be used, as long as the light is able to
be seen from the air, as intended by the FAA.



   (E)   Retrofitting. In the event a tower or other support structure
that is lighted as of the effective date of this section is modified, at the
time of the first modification of the facility the city reserves the right to
require that the tower be retrofitted so as to comply with the lighting
requirements of this section or be reduced to a height that does not require
lighting.



   (F)   Flush-mounting. Except for omni-directional antennas, all new
or replacement antennas, shall be flush-mounted or as close to flush-mounted
on the support structure as is functionally possible, unless it can be
demonstrated by clear and convincing technical evidence that such has the
effect of prohibiting the provision of service to the intended service area,
alone or in combination with another site(s), or unless the applicant can
prove that it is technologically impracticable.



   (G)   Placement on building. If attached to a building, all antennas
shall be mounted on the fascia of the building and camouflaged so as to match
the color and, if possible, the texture of the building, or in a manner so as
to make the antennas as visually innocuous and undetectable as is possible
given the facts and circumstances involved.



(Ord. 2016-4-26-38, passed 4-26-2016)



§ 156.15  SECURITY.



   (A)   All facilities shall be located, fenced or otherwise secured
in a manner that prevents unauthorized access.



   (B)   Specifically:



      (1)   All facilities, including antennas, towers and other
supporting structures, such as guy anchor points and guy wires, shall be made
inaccessible to unauthorized individuals and shall be constructed or shielded
in such a manner that they cannot be climbed or collided with and shall
expressly include removing the climbing steps for the first ten feet from the
ground on a monopole; and



      (2)   Transmitters and telecommunications control points shall
be installed so that they are readily accessible only to persons authorized
to operate or service them.



(Ord. 2016-4-26-38, passed 4-26-2016)



§ 156.16  SIGNAGE.



   Facilities shall contain a sign no larger than four square feet and no
smaller than two square feet in order to provide adequate warning to persons
in the immediate area of the presence of RF radiation. A sign of the same
size is also to be installed bearing the name(s) of the owner(s) and
operator(s) of the antenna(s) as well as emergency phone number(s). The sign
shall be on the equipment shelter or cabinet of the applicant and must be
visible from the access point of the facility or complex and must identify
the equipment owner of the shelter or cabinet. On tower sites, an FCC
registration sign, as applicable, is also to be present. The signs shall not
be lighted, unless applicable law, rule or regulation requires lighting. No
other signage, including advertising, shall be permitted.



(Ord. 2016-4-26-38, passed 4-26-2016)



§ 156.17  SETBACK AND FALL ZONE.



   (A)   (1)   All proposed towers and any other proposed wireless
support structures shall be set back from abutting parcels, recorded
rights-of-way and roads and streets by the greater of the following distances:



         (a)   A distance equal to the height of the proposed
tower or support structure plus 110% of the height of the tower or other
structure, otherwise known as the fall zone; or



         (b)   The existing setback requirement of the underlying
zoning district, whichever is greater.



      (2)   Any accessory structure shall be located within the
fenced compound area as approved in the conditional use permit and so as to
comply with the applicable minimum setback requirements for the property on
which it is situated. The fall zone or setback shall be measured from the
nearest portion of the tower to the nearest portion of the right-of-way of
any public road or thoroughfare and any occupied building or domicile, as
well as any property boundary lines.



   (B)   The nearest portion of any private access road leading to a
facility shall be no less than ten feet from the nearest property line.



   (C)   There shall be no development of habitable buildings within
the setback area or fall zone.



(Ord. 2016-4-26-38, passed 4-26-2016)



§ 156.18  RETENTION OF EXPERT ASSISTANCE COST TO BE BORNE BY APPLICANT.



   (A)   To prevent the taxpayers from having to bear the cost related
to the issue of permitting and regulating a commercially used wireless
telecommunications facilities or negotiating an agreement to lease or amend
or modify a lease for any city-owned property or structure, an applicant
shall pay to the city fees as set forth in the city’s Fee Schedule. The
fees are intended to cover all reasonable costs of the expert assistance
needed by the city in connection with the review of any application,
including both the technical review and nontechnical review, and the
permitting, inspection, construction or modification requested, any
application pre-approval evaluation requested by the applicant and any lease
negotiations. The payment of the expert assistance fees to the city shall
precede any work being done that is related to the intended application or
lease, including a pre-application meeting or site visit.



   (B)   The city may hire any consultant of its choice to assist the
city in reviewing and evaluating applications and negotiating leases,
provided the consultant has at least five years experience working
exclusively for the public sector regulating towers and wireless facilities
and negotiating leases.



   (C)   The total amount of the funds needed for expert assistance as
set forth in the city’s Fee Schedule may vary with the scope and complexity
of the application, the completeness of the application and other information
as may be needed to complete the necessary technical and non-technical
reviews, analysis and inspection of any construction or modification or the
amount of time spent responding to an applicant’s arguments as regards its
application or the requirements of this section.



   (D)   The city will maintain an accounting record for the
expenditure of all such funds.



   (E)   Pursuant to G.S. § 160A-400.52(f), if an application is
amended, or a waiver or relief is requested from any regulations at any time
prior to the grant of the certificate of completion required under this
chapter, the city reserves the right to require additional payment for the
review and analysis equal to, but not exceeding, the cost created for the
city by the applicant or its application. Such amount shall be paid to the
city prior to the issuance of the conditional use permit or administrative
approval or the certificate of completion, whichever is procedurally needed
next.



(Ord. 2016-4-26-38, passed 4-26-2016)



§ 156.19  PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS FOR GRANTING A CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT.



   (A)   When a conditional use permit is requested, the following
procedures shall apply, including those set forth in § 155.096 of this code
of ordinances.



   (B)   As part of the process for all new towers or
telecommunications support structures, there shall be a neighborhood meeting.



   (C)   The city shall schedule any required public hearing(s) once it
finds the application is complete and there are no issues of noncompliance or
conflict with applicable law, rule or regulation. The city shall not set a
date for a hearing if the application is not complete or if there are
unresolved issues of noncompliance. The city may, at any stage prior to
issuing a conditional use permit or administrative approval, require such
additional information as it deems necessary and that is not expressly
prohibited from being required by applicable law as relates to the issue of
the siting, construction or modification of or at a wireless

which the facility or complex is located wishes to retain any access roadway
to the facility or complex, the owner may do so with the approval of the city.



   (E)   If a facility or complex has not been removed, or substantial
progress has not been made to remove the facility or complex, within 90 days
after the permit holder has received notice, then the city may order
officials or representatives of the city to remove the facility or complex at
the sole expense of the owner or conditional use permit holder.



   (F)   If the city removes, or causes facilities to be removed, and
the owner of the facility or complex does not claim and remove it from the
site to a lawful location within ten days, then the city may take steps to
declare the facility or complex abandoned, and sell them and their components.



   (G)   Notwithstanding anything in this section to the contrary, the
city may approve a temporary use permit/agreement for the facility or complex
for no more than 90 days duration, during which time a suitable plan for
removal, conversion or relocation of the affected facility or complex shall
be developed by the holder of the conditional use permit, subject to the
approval of the city, and an agreement to such plan shall be executed by the
holder of the conditional use permit or administrative approval and the city.
If such a plan is not developed, approved and executed within the 90-day time
period, then the city may take possession of and dispose of the affected
facility or complex in the manner provided in this section and utilize the
bond in § 156.23(B).

TITLE, PURPOSE AND GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 158.01  TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known as the "Stormwater Quality Management and Discharge Control Ordinance" of the City of Whiteville and may be so cited. The Stormwater Management Manual, the technical manual for complying with the stormwater management and discharge control requirements, is attached as Appendix I to Ordinance 2019-O-72 and incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein. This chapter supersedes any requirements related to drainage that the City Council has adopted previously.
(Ord. 2019-O-72, passed 9-10-2019)
§ 158.02  AUTHORITY.
   Under G.S. Ch. 160A, the city has the responsibility and authority to regulate land use and development, enforce ordinances within its jurisdiction, and to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry.
(Ord. 2019-O-72, passed 9-10-2019)
§ 158.03  PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The purpose and intent of this chapter is to:
   (A)   Ensure the health, safety, and general welfare of citizens, and protect and enhance the water quality of watercourses and water bodies in a manner pursuant to and consistent with the Federal Clean Water Act (33 USC § 1251 et seq.) by reducing pollutants in stormwater discharges to the maximum extent practicable and by prohibiting non-stormwater discharges to the storm drain system.
   (B)   Establish minimum criteria to control and minimize the quantitative and qualitative impacts of stormwater runoff from development within the city.
   (C)   Encourage sustainable development. Prudent site planning should include special consideration for preserving natural drainage ways, maximizing infiltration, slowing stormwater runoff from individual sites in route to streams and rivers by use of effective runoff management, structural and non-structural best management practices, drainage structures, and stormwater facilities.
(Ord. 2019-O-72, passed 9-10-2019)
§ 158.04  APPLICABILITY.
   The provisions of the chapter shall apply to all areas within the planning jurisdictional limits of the city.
(Ord. 2019-O-72, passed 9-10-2019)
§ 158.05  EXCEPTIONS TO APPLICABILITY.
   This chapter shall not apply to those land use activities identified in the specific sections of this chapter or as identified below:
   (A)   Existing development may be continued and maintained. Expansion to existing structures classified, as existing development must meet the provisions of this chapter.
   (B)   Activities on a bona fide farm unless the activity is for non-farm purpose.
(Ord. 2019-O-72, passed 9-10-2019)
§ 158.06  INTERPRETATION.
   (A)   In interpreting and applying this chapter, the requirements are intended to be minimum requirements that are imposed and are to be conformed to, and are in addition to, and not in lieu of, all other legal requirements.
   (B)   This chapter shall not be deemed to interfere with or annul or otherwise affect in any manner whatsoever any ordinance, rules, regulations, permits, or easements, covenants, or other agreements between parties, provided however that, where this chapter imposes greater restrictions and controls with respect to stormwater management, the provisions of this chapter shall prevail.
(Ord. 2019-O-72, passed 9-10-2019)
§ 158.07  PERMITS.
   (A)   Except where provided elsewhere, development shall not commence without obtaining a stormwater permit pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.
   (B)   The stormwater permit application shall be made by, or on behalf of, the owner(s) or developer(s) of the site for which the permit is sought. The application shall be filed with the city on a form supplied by the city and shall be accompanied with the information identified in the Stormwater Management Manual.
   (C)   A stormwater permit shall not be issued until the following conditions are met:
      (1)   Approval by the Stormwater Administrator of the supporting information.
      (2)   Submission and approval of any required easements.
      (3)   Submission and approval of any required inspection and maintenance agreements.
      (4)   Payment of all fees.
   (D)   If the development requires a sediment and erosion control permit, the stormwater permit will be conditional upon the owner receiving such sediment and erosion permit and upon the filing of a copy of the approved Sediment and Erosion Control Plan and associated permit to the Stormwater Administrator.
   (E)   The stormwater permit will be valid for one  year from the date of issuance or if significant changes in the development are made that change the intent of the permit. Significant changes shall be determined by the Stormwater Administrator. If significant changes are made, the original stormwater permit shall not be valid and a new permit shall be required.
(Ord. 2019-O-72, passed 9-10-2019)
§ 158.08  FEES.
   A list, of fees associated with the this chapter are available at the Stormwater Administrator's Office. Pursuant to the authority contained in G.S, § 160A-314(2), the city schedule of rates, fees, charges, and penalties for providing stormwater management programs and structural and natural stormwater and drainage system service may vary according to whether the property served is residential, commercial, or industrial property, the property's use, the size of the property, the area of impervious surfaces on the property, the quantity and quality of the runoff from the property, the characteristics of the watershed into which stormwater from the property drains, and other factors that affect the stormwater drainage system. Rates, fees, and charges imposed under this section may not exceed the city's cost of providing a stormwater management program and a structural and natural stormwater and drainage system.

§ 157.01  PURPOSE AND INTENT.



   (A)   The city finds that:



      (1)   Extremely limited space exists in the public
rights-of-way (PROW) that requires diligent responsible management,
including, but not limited to, responsible and prudent siting policies;



      (2)   Protecting the public safety in and near the PROW is of
paramount concern; and



      (3)   The facilities that use and occupy the PROW often pose
significant concerns regarding the health, safety, public welfare, protecting
the nature and character of the city and its neighborhoods and for the
environmental effects of work and facilities in the PROW.



   (B)   The city recognizes that facilitating the development of the
responsible policies regarding the use of the PROW can be an economic
development asset to the city and of significant benefit to the city and its
residents. To assure that the placement, construction and modification of
facilities in the PROW are consistent and to the extent practicable for
functionally similar users are not discriminatory, and that the regulations
governing the use of the PROW are reasonable and balanced, the city adopts a
single, comprehensive set of regulations governing the use and occupancy of
the PROW.



   (C)   The intent of this chapter is to:



      (1)   Maximize the efficient use of the limited space of the
PROW, minimize the physical impact of facilities on the PROW and adjacent
properties;



      (2)   Minimize the impact of facilities on the community,
including, but not limited to, the visual impact;



      (3)   Protect the nature and character of the community to the
extent reasonably possible;



      (4)   Establish a fair and efficient process for the review of
and action on applications;



      (5)   Facilitate the processing of applications to the extent
practicable;



      (6)   Assure taxpayers’ money in the form of city funds is
not used to subsidize application-related costs normally and traditionally
borne by an applicant;



      (7)   Assure a prompt and efficient review of applications; and



      (8)   Determine any negative environmental impacts associated
with the location, construction and modification of facilities located in the
PROW; and protect the health, safety and welfare of the city, its residents
and visitors.

§ 157.08  RESTORATION OF SURROUNDING AREAS.



   (A)   Obligation to restore disturbed areas. A person or user that
conducts excavation or other activities that disturb the PROW or facilities
within the PROW shall restore the PROW to a condition equivalent to that
prior to the disturbance. The restoration shall include, but is not limited
to, installation of pavement, resurfacing nearby or adjacent areas, grading
any disturbed unpaved surface areas, restoring below ground facilities,
planting and landscaping, replacing curb and curb ramps to applicable
standards and repairing improvements and facilities. Restoration shall meet
the standards set by the Department. Such restoration includes any work
necessary to maintain the nature and character of the area that existed prior
to the work.



   (B)   Temporary restoration. Where permanent restoration is
impractical because of weather or other circumstances, the Department may
require temporary restoration to be followed by permanent restoration.



   (C)   Timetable for restoration. The Department shall determine the
time period during which restoration must be accomplished on an individual
case-by-case basis and such time period shall take into account the extent of
the restoration work required, availability of needed materials and other
limiting factors.



   (D)   Repair of inadequate restoration work. The Department’s
inspection and/or approval of original restoration work does not waive the
Department’s right to require additional restoration where and when
warranted. Therefore, where restoration work proves to be inadequate over
time, as determined in the Department’s discretion, if the issue is not one
of normal wear and tear or is not caused by a third party, but is truly due
to the inadequacy of the restoration, the Department may require additional
reasonable restoration. Such additional restoration may be required for a
period of three years from the date of completion of the initial restoration
work. The person responsible for the work necessitating the original
restoration shall be responsible for the costs of the additional restoration
and inspection.



   (E)   Reimbursement to city of costs of restoration. If a person
responsible for damage to the PROW does not complete required restoration
during the period required by the Department, the city may complete the
restoration. The costs for such shall be promptly reimbursed by the user or
the person responsible for the original work that required restoration of the
PROW.

§ 157.09  REQUIREMENTS FOR LOCATION, CONSTRUCTION RELOCATION, MODIFICATION,
MAINTENANCE AND REMOVAL OF FACILITIES IN THE PROW.



   Users that locate, relocate, modify, repair, maintain or remove
facilities in the PROW shall comply with the following requirements.



   (A)   Locations. The Department shall have the discretion to
determine compliance with this section and to approve, deny, alter and
condition all proposed locations of facilities in the PROW, and to determine
whether placement, if allowed, shall be above ground or below ground, all as
determined by the technical need of the applicant for a specific location, or
alternatively the technological impracticability of a given location.



   (B)   Maximum permitted height. Absent a showing by clear and
convincing technical or safety-related evidence of the need for a greater
specific height for reasons of technical necessity, technical
impracticability or compliance with applicable safety codes, the maximum
permitted height for new or replacement poles or other support structures in
the PROW, including any increases in height of existing structures and poles,
shall be 40 feet above pre-construction ground level. Forty feet is not
as-of-right, but is the maximum permitted height, and shorter, minimally
impactful and intrusive poles and support structures shall be preferred.



   (C)   Minimum distance between poles or other support structures.
Absent a showing by clear and convincing technical evidence of the technical
need for a greater distance between poles or other support structures in the
PROW or for safety-related reason, the minimum distance between poles or
other support structures on the same side of a street as measured in any
direction shall be 100 feet. This minimum distance shall not be applicable
for poles or support structures that are used to support lines or cables
crossing a street or other human-made or natural barrier.



   (D)   Least visual impact. Any equipment attached to a utility pole
or other support structure shall be of a size and be located and constructed
so as to create the least visual impact on the immediate surrounding area
reasonably possible, and the least physical intrusion and impact on the
limited space in the PROW, including occupying both the least amount of
vertical and horizontal space reasonably possible. Absent the demonstration
by verifiable clear and convincing technical evidence of the inability to use
smaller equipment, no equipment shall be allowed in the PROW to be attached
to or associated with a utility pole or other support structure of a size
large enough to require an environmental assessment analysis and report under
federal or state law or rule.



      (1)   Equipment inside pole. Excluding electric utility lines
and equipment, after the effective date of this chapter, cables used to
distribute wireline communications service(s) under 47 U.S.C. Title II or
Title IV shall be placed inside the pole or support structure, unless
technologically impracticable, or unless doing so would prevent compliance
with applicable safety codes or such equipment is able to be attached
mid-span to the transmission cable.



      (2)   Pole replacement.



         (a)   If placement inside a pole is physically or
technologically impracticable, then, as determined most appropriate under the
facts and circumstances by the Department, the pole shall:



            1.   Be replaced in compliance with § 157.13; or



            2.   If deemed appropriate under the facts and
circumstances the equipment shall be stealthed or camouflaged to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Department.



         (b)   If a pole is to be attached to, replacement of
poles in compliance with § 157.11 shall be preferred to stealthing or
camouflaging.



      (3)   New equipment. New equipment being attached to an
existing, otherwise grandfathered, pole by a third party, shall require the
replacement of the pole with an approved type of structure/pole as set forth
in § 157.13.



      (4)   Maximum size of pole-mounted equipment. Excluding cable,
the maximum size of any piece of hardline or wireless communications
equipment attached to a pole or other support structure, such as, but not
limited to, amplifiers and antennas or other transceivers, shall not exceed
three  cubic feet in total volume would fit within an imaginary enclosure or
container three cubic feet in volume.



      (5)   New and replacement poles or support structures. In
addition to all other information required, an application for a new or
replacement pole or support structure must include detailed design
characteristics, including overall dimensions, material composition,
aesthetic appearance, a detailed site plan and a structural analysis with
calculations which must be certified by a professional engineer licensed in
the state and be able to be independently verified using the information
submitted by the applicant. Depending upon the situation and circumstances
involved, to-scale photo simulations may be required showing the facility as
it will appear upon completion, showing the facility from four directions,
each with 90 degrees azimuth separations.



      (6)   Lateral extensions. No lateral equipment extensions
parallel to the PROW from a pole or other support structure in the PROW, such
as, but not limited to, equipment standoffs, shall exceed three feet in
length.



      (7)   Riser cable. All exterior riser or other vertically run
cable attached to the exterior of a pole or other support structure shall be
protected with non-conductive, non-degradable material and shall be of a
color that matches the color of the pole or other support structure as
closely as is reasonably possible.



      (8)   Ground-mounted equipment and equipment enclosures.
Absent a showing by clear and convincing technical evidence of the technical
need or for safety reasons for a greater size, nothing larger in size than
17-cubic foot enclosure may be placed above ground in the PROW.



      (9)   Compliance with NESC and NEC. All attachments to poles
or other structures in the PROW, and all underground work and facilities
placed underground, shall at all times be in compliance with the edition of
the National Electrical Safety Code (NESC), the National Electrical Code
(NEC), the State Building Code and the Office of Safety Administration (OSHA)
regulations in effect at the later of:



         (a)   The time the facility was constructed;



         (b)   The time of the last modification of equipment on
the pole or other support structure; or



         (c)   The edition in effect at the time of the current
application.



      (10)   Compliance with TIA-ANSI222 re stand- alone
communications poles and structures. All poles or support structures used
only by providers of communications service(s) shall comply with the latest
version of TIA-ANSI 222 at the time of construction, as well as at the time
of any modification. Verification of submitted evidence of compliance with
the applicable version of TIA-ANSI 222 shall be a prerequisite for the
issuance of a building permit.



   (E)   Underground locations for wire and fiber. Wires, fiber and
conduits shall generally be located underground, except in areas zoned for
above ground facilities. A user that wishes to place such facilities above
ground in an underground area shall demonstrate to the city’s satisfaction
why above ground placement is a necessity.



   (F)   Existing ducts. Existing ducts, if underground ducts or
conduits are available and not technologically impracticable to use,
underground wires shall be located in such ducts or conduits. Before
installing new ducts or conduits, a user shall make all reasonable effort to
procure the right to use existing ducts or conduits upon reasonable terms and
charges negotiated by and agreed to by the parties.



   (G)   Documentation of sufficient space. A user shall provide
verifiable evidence to demonstrate to the Department’s satisfaction that
sufficient space exists in the PROW and on any pole for proposed new or
modified facilities to be placed without interfering with existing or future
public projects, and that the placement of the pole, other structure and/or
equipment will not unduly or unnecessarily disrupt the normal use of the
PROW, negatively impact the permanent condition of the PROW or by itself
negatively impact adjacent property values.



   (H)   Public noticing. Depending upon the facts and circumstances
involved, for projects involving the disruption of vehicular or pedestrian
traffic in the PROW, breaking the integrity of the surface of pavement or
sidewalk, or when involving a new structure(s) or the increase in height of
an existing structure by more than 10% of its existing height, the Department
shall:



      (1)   Require the applicant to post notice of the proposed
work and its scope on the city’s website or post a reasonably sized notice
no smaller than 24 inches by 18 inches on or within three feet of all utility
poles along the impacted portion of the PROW; or



      (2)   Distribute written notices to all individual properties
for a distance of 200 feet from the location of any such work in or adjacent
to the area of PROW, for a minimum of one calendar week prior to the start of
the work proposed.



   (I)   Documentation to city upon completion. Upon completion of the
authorized work, the person responsible for the work shall give the
Department all reasonable information it requests regarding the work
performed. Such information may include, but is not limited to, as-built or
other appropriate drawings and maps, in the form required by the Department.



   (J)   Maps and information on file with users. During the time a
person user has facilities in the PROW, the user shall maintain up-to-date
as-built maps showing both the general and specific placement of its
facilities in the PROW. A user shall also maintain information regarding the
function and capacity of its facilities and, upon request by the city,
furnish said maps and information to the Department within the time period
specified, at no cost to the city and in such form and detail as the city
requires.



   (K)   Underground location. Users with underground facilities shall
maintain a membership in the state’s underground locating system and
respond to and locate underground facilities and equipment as required by
applicable state regulations and requirements.



   (L)   Relocation of facilities. A user shall, at its own cost,
relocate its facilities within a reasonable time frame as determined by the
Department, if the city determines that the facility(s):

public notification, users shall notify the Department at least 48 hours in
advance of maintenance and repair work that may disrupt or impede the use of
the PROW or its use, including the nature and scope of the work and the
estimated duration of the disruption or impedance.



   (N)   Removal of facilities in the PROW. Facilities placed in the
PROW without authorization and all required currently valid permits, and
facilities for which a license or franchise has expired, shall be removed
upon order of the city. In addition, all abandoned facilities, or facilities
that do not function as intended for 90 consecutive calendar days, shall be
removed by their owner. If facilities that are required to be removed are not
removed within 14 calendar days of notice by the city, the city may remove
them or have them removed, with the cost of removal to be borne by the holder
of the authorization or owner of the facility(s).



   (O)   Third party use. Authorized and properly permitted users shall
allow other authorized users of the PROW to utilize available space in or on
the user’s facilities upon reasonable terms and charges or as otherwise
proscribed by the state or federal government. For private investor-owned
facilities only, charges calculated in accordance with § 224 of the
Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. § 224 shall constitute
reasonable charges for pole attachments.



   (P)   Certificate of completion. An application for the modification
of a facility, for attachments to a pole or other support structure, or to
place a ground-mounted equipment enclosure(s), shall contain a copy of the

(Ord. 2017-O-55, passed 9-12-2017)



§ 157.12  APPLICATIONS FOR SUPPORT STRUCTURES/POLES, EQUIPMENT AND
EQUIPMENT HOUSINGS AND MODIFICATION OF FACILITIES LOCATED IN THE PROW.



   (A)   Application required. An application must be filed with the
Department for any work other than normal maintenance on any pole or other
support structure, including modification, change or replacement of equipment
that would be different in size, weight or appearance than the existing
equipment.



   (B)   Application to modify or replace. An application to modify or
replace a facility shall contain a copy of the last certificate of completion
issued for that facility.



   (C)   False or misleading statements. During the application
process, or in an application, an applicant may not make statement(s)
verbally or in writing that is intended to be relied upon by the city and is
fraudulent, misleading or that causes or are intended to cause a reasonable
probability of confusion or misunderstanding as to the legal rights,
obligations or options of the city, nor fail to inform the city of a relevant
fact material to the application that is known or should be known by the
applicant, the omission of which is deceptive or misleading.



   (D)   Urgency. An applicant shall not misrepresent the urgency of
the work represented in an application, including any asserted deadline by
which action by the city on the application is needed.



   (E)   Processing urgent requests. The city shall attempt to process
urgent requests sooner than the required maximum time allowed by state or
federal law. Notwithstanding the preceding, due to the effects of having to
re-allocate human resources to accommodate such urgent requests, an applicant
shall not misrepresent the urgency of the situation to have a facility(s)
permitted or authorized. It shall be a condition of all authorizations for an
application requesting urgent treatment that the work shall be completed
within 90 calendar days of the issuance of the authorization or pay a penalty
as listed in § 157.99(D) until the final inspection is requested, except for
force majeure situations and situations not reasonably within the control of
the applicant.



   (F)   Warehousing of authorizations and permit(s) not allowed.
Warehousing of an authorization shall never be permitted. To prevent
warehousing of authorizations and/or permit(s) for new structures in the
severely limited and scarce space of the PROW and on existing poles, thereby
preventing another person or entity from using a given location(s) and space
because the proposed structure at the location was not built expeditiously,
an application shall contain a proposed date for the completion of the
construction or modification of any structure, including the placement of
equipment attached to or associated with the structure. The completion date
shall not be more than 180 days after the issuance of a building permit to
occupy a given location and space.



   (G)   Site visit. Prior to the submittal of an application and
following payment of any required fee(s) or anticipatory deposits, a site
visit to each facility proposed to be modified or to the proposed location of
a new facility, shall be conducted to determine:



      (1)   The physical condition of the facility or proposed
location; and



      (2)   To identify issues of concern, noncompliance with
applicable laws, rules and regulations, including, but not limited to, any
safety-related issues or concerns and other matters contained in this chapter.



   (H)   Number of facilities applied for by a given person or entity.
Due to limited staff resources, to prevent forced de facto pro-forma or
rubber stamping approval of an application without meaningful review for
compliance with applicable federal, state and local law and regulations, and
to prevent inadvertent noncompliance by the city with any federal or
state-imposed time requirements for reviewing an application, no person or
entity may make application for more than ten facilities or locations under
this chapter within any 30-consecutive calendar day period.



   (I)   Facilitating applications and mitigating applicant costs.



      (1)   To facilitate the preparation and submittal of an
application in compliance with this chapter, and thereby expedite the review
and permitting of an application, a pre-application meeting shall be held,
the city’s costs for such being paid for by the applicant prior to the
meeting.



      (2)   To facilitate the application process and to mitigate
application-related costs for applicants, depending upon the scope of the
proposed work and its impact both visual and physical as determined by the
Department, applications not involving new support structures may be
submitted in groups of up to three facilities in a single consolidated
application and be subject to only one application fee. Notwithstanding this,
no application for a new or replacement pole or other support structure shall
contain more than a single location or facility.



   (J)   No unidentified facilities. No authorization shall be granted
for new support structures, new equipment or a new facility that is not
expressly and individually identified at the time the application is filed,
including the specific location and design characteristics of each facility.



   (K)   No taxpayer subsidization. Historic, current and anticipated
subscriber rates for services provided using the PROW are assumed to reflect
permitting costs, unless verifiable clear and convincing evidence to the
contrary is provided. Therefore, city funds shall not directly or indirectly
be used subsidize an applicant’s reasonable application-related review and
permitting costs.



   (L)   Application fee. To prevent taxpayer subsidization of
application-related costs, an application fee shall be required of all
applications involving:



      (1)   A new or replacement pole(s) or support structure(s);



      (2)   Any modification of a facility; or



      (3)   Any change of existing equipment attached to an existing
pole(s) or support structure(s) that is visually discernable, changes the
appearance of the facility, changes the structural loading on the pole or
support structure, or involves verification of compliance with an aspect of
the National Electrical Safety Code (NESC), the National Electrical Code
(NEC) or TIA ANSI 222 not previously applicable to that facility. The amount
of the appropriate application fee shall be as set forth in the city’s
Schedule of Fees in § 21.06.



   (M)   Payment for legal and/or expert assistance. To prevent
taxpayer subsidization of application-related costs as required by this
chapter and determined to be appropriate and necessary by the Department,
applicants may be required to place on deposit with the city an amount
estimated to be sufficient to pay for reasonable legal and/or other expert
assistance costs of the city attributable to the application. The minimum
amount(s) required shall be as set forth in the city’s Schedule of Fees in
§ 21.06.



   (N)   Deposit required prior to work on application. An applicant
must deposit the estimated cost of the city’s legal or other expert
assistance with the city prior to any work being done related to an
application or an anticipated or intended application. Notwithstanding the
preceding, inquiries totaling up to one hour of time may be made prior to the
required deposit being in place at no cost to the applicant.



   (O)   Return of unexpended amount of deposit. Any unexpended amount
submitted in compliance with the preceding division (N) remaining after the
issuance of a certificate of completion shall be promptly returned to the
applicant upon written request.



   (P)   Street opening, street cutting, curb and sidewalk cutting fee.
Any person or entity proposing to cut or break the integrity of the surface
of a paved street, sidewalk, pedestrian or bicycle way, or who proposes to
cut any curb shall:



      (1)   Pay to the city a fee(s) as set forth in the city’s
Schedule of Fees  in § 21.06 prior to the issuance of any permit(s); and



      (2)   Obtain a permit for the proposed type of work.

consistent throughout the city limits, and any extraterritorial jurisdiction
(ETJ) where this chapter is of effect.



   (B)   All new or replacement poles shall be of non-wooden,
non-conductive and non-corrodible materials.



   (C)   Antennas attached to new poles or structures in the PROW shall
be of a type that disguises the fact that they are antennas, unless for
reasons proven by verifiable clear and convincing evidence that to do so is
technologically impracticable, in which case a best case type of camouflaging
shall be used.



   (D)   Where not technologically or commercially impracticable,
equipment attached to poles in the PROW shall utilize a “concealed”
design, including all cabling and any antennas being placed inside the pole
or support structure.



   (E)   So as to avoid an applicant having to bear the cost of doing
an environmental assessment and report as otherwise required by FCC Rule
14-153, any ground-mounted equipment enclosures shall be no larger than is
technologically necessary, but in no case larger than 17 cubic feet in volume
for all users of the equipment shelter cumulatively.



   (F)   To protect the nature and character of the area impacted area
a facility shall be:



      (1)   Of a color determined by the Department to be harmonious
with the particular area;



      (2)   Located as near the pole as applicable safety codes
allow;



      (3)   Screened with evergreen shrubbery of sufficient size to
hide the equipment shelter; and



      (4)   If the PROW is landscaped with decorative vegetation, of
the same species, color, size and shape as is used to landscape the PROW in
the neighborhood of the pole or enclosure.



   (G)   Pole-mounted cabinets shall be as small as possible, but no
larger than is technologically necessary and reasonably possible, and shall
be shielded from view in both directions parallel to the PROW by decorative,
noncommercial banners or under a pole-mounted shroud.



   (H)   Unless proven to be physically unfeasible or commercially
impracticable by verifiable clear and convincing evidence, any person
proposing a new attachment to an existing wooden primary electrical
distribution pole, wooden secondary electrical distribution pole or wooden
streetlight in the PROW shall, instead, replace the existing pole with a pole
as described in this division (H).



   (I)   All new poles shall meet or exceed current NESC standards and
wind and ice loading requirements of the latest version of ANSI 222 Version G.



   (J)   Any new poles installed shall be “green”, not made of wood
and not leach any volatile organic compounds or toxic materials into the
ground.



   (K)   To avoid unsightly rust and corrosion, any new pole installed
shall not be made of metal, concrete or cement.



(Ord. 2017-O-55, passed 9-12-2017)



§ 157.14  MAILBOX OBSTRUCTIONS.



   (A)   The city shall not be responsible for the repair or
replacement of any mailbox placed within any PROW.



   (B)   However, to alleviate the possibility of damage due to snow
removal and vehicular traffic, the following guidelines shall be complied
with.



      (1)   Mailboxes shall be erected so that the front of a
curbside box is set back at least 12 inches from the face of the concrete
curb and the structure supporting the box must not encroach on this setback
distance.



      (2)   The bottom of a mailbox must be between 42 inches and 48
inches above the finished road surface.



      (3)   Mailboxes and the standards or posts upon which they are
erected must be designed and installed to withstand the impact of snow hurled
from a passing snowplow.



      (4)   Mailboxes shall not overhang a public sidewalk or
pedestrian way.



(Ord. 2017-O-55, passed 9-12-2017)



§ 157.15  RELIEF.



   (A)   Any applicant desiring relief, waiver or exemption from any
aspect or requirement of this chapter shall address and identify such at the

convincing evidence satisfactory to the Department that, and that, if
granted, the relief, waiver or exemption will have no significant negative
effect on the health, safety or welfare of the city, its residents and other
users of the PROW, the Department must find the following:

the neighborhood, considering the location, type and height of existing
buildings or structures and the type and extent of vegetation on the site.

§ 157.99  PENALTY.



   (A)   Civil penalties. Any person who violates this chapter may be
subject to all civil and equitable remedies as allowed by law.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the violation of a stop work order issued

as such. The Department shall charge civil penalties as are authorized by the
City Council for:



      (1)   Violation of § 157.07(A) and/or (B); and
