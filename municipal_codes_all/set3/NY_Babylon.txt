Failure to Respond to Summonses
[Adopted 8-12-2003 by L.L. No. 14-2003]
§ 1-19. Legislative intent.
The Town Board finds that the proliferation of violations of the provisions of
the Town Code of the Town of Babylon and of conditions of or imposed on
zoning-related grants and/or approvals by the Town Board, Planning Board
and Zoning Board of Appeals has caused a serious threat to the safety and
welfare of the residents of the Town and has eroded the quality of life of all
who live and work in the Town. The Town Board therefore finds it necessary
and proper to provide for the securing of defendants charged with violations
of the Town Code. It is the further intent of the Town Board to exercise
its authority as provided by law with particular reference to its authority
pursuant to Municipal Home Rule Law § 10(4)(b) and Town Law § 135, and
the Town Board hereby supersedes any inconsistent provisions of state law.

summons on the date and time indicated on the summons, in connection
with a criminal action to be instituted in such court with respect to their
alleged commission of said violation of the Babylon Town Code.

period not to exceed six months may be imposed, or both, for a first
offense; a fine not less that $1,000 nor more than $2,500 must be

months may be imposed, or both, for a second offense within five years
of a conviction; and a fine not less that $2,500 nor more than $5,000

guilty of a Class A misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, a fine of
not less than $1,000 nor more than $2,500 must be imposed or
imprisonment for a period not to exceed one year, or both such fine and
imprisonment. The mandatory minimum fine must be imposed and
there shall be no discretion in imposing the mandatory minimum fine;
§ 1-19 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 1-21

§ 1-22. Affirmative defense for failure to respond.
In a prosecution for failing to respond to a summons, it shall be an
affirmative defense that a defendant was unable to respond due to
circumstances beyond their control, such as being confined in a correctional
facility, a hospital or medical facility, or other similar situations beyond the
defendant's control.
no unconditional discharge or any other sentence which does not
include the mandatory minimum fine or term of imprisonment may
be imposed, except upon application of the Special Assistant District
Attorney and consent of the court. Each instance of obstruction or
resistance shall constitute a separate offense hereunder.

[Adopted 11-9-2005 by L.L. No. 25-2005]
§ 1-23. Presumption.
There shall be a presumption in any court proceeding to enforce the Code
of the Town of Babylon that the deed on file with the Babylon Tax Assessor,
filed by the Suffolk County Clerks office, is proof that the person(s) or
entity reflected as the owner or holder of interest conveyed by said deed
is the person, persons or entity that continues to own or hold an interest
in said real property during the same time said deed is on file in the Town
of Babylon Tax Assessor's office. This presumption shall continue until the
Suffolk County Clerks office files a subsequently executed and recorded
deed. This presumption shall be rebuttable.

ARTICLE V
Illegal Occupancy of Buildings or Structures
[Adopted 3-20-2007 by L.L. No. 5-2007]
§ 1-24. Summary proceedings authorized.
A. Legislative intent.
(1) The Town Board finds that the proliferation of violations of the
provisions of the Town Code of the Town of Babylon, specifically as
they apply to the illegal occupancy of buildings and structures as
dwelling units, has caused a serious threat to the safety and
welfare of the residents of the Town, has eroded the quality of life
of all who live and work in the Town and has strained the resources
of the Town to its limits. The Town Board, therefore, finds it
necessary and proper to provide for the prosecution of summary
proceedings by the Town Attorneys Office to vacate illegal
occupants of unlawfully occupied buildings or structures used or
occupied as dwellings. The Town Board further finds it necessary
and proper to prevent property owners and landlords from
profiting from violating the New York State Building Code, the New
York State Property Maintenance Code, the New York State Fire
Code and the Code of the Town of Babylon. Therefore, the Town
Board prohibits the collection of rent or any other compensation
from tenants or occupants of illegally occupied buildings or
structures used as dwellings.
(2) It is the further intent of the Town Board to exercise its authority as
provided by law with particular reference to its authority pursuant
to Municipal Home Rule Law § 10(4)(b) and § 24 and Town Law
§ 135.
B. In addition to the criminal and civil penalties set forth in this Code, the
Town Attorney is authorized to pursue summary proceedings to vacate
illegally occupied buildings and/or structures under this article when
the premises, or any part thereof, are used or occupied as a bawdyhouse,
or house or place of assignation for lewd persons, or for
purposes of prostitution, or for any illegal trade or manufacture, or
other illegal business or violation of §§ 213-20, 213-62 (A) or (B), 213-77
(A) or (B), 213-92 (A) or (B), 213-130 (A), 153-2 or 153-28 (A) or (B) of
the Babylon Town Code. Relief under this article may be sought in any
court of competent jurisdiction.
C. No rent shall be recovered by the owner of any premises during the
period of time that said premises is used or occupied as a bawdy-house,
or house or place of assignation for lewd persons, or for purposes of
prostitution, or for any illegal trade or manufacture, or other illegal
business or being used or occupied while in violation of Babylon Town
Codes §§ 213-20, 213-62 (A) or (B), 213-77 (A) or (B), 213-92 (A) or (B),

ETHICS, CODE OF
§ 23-1. Purpose.
A. This chapter shall authorize the Town Attorney to open a special escrow
account for the purposes set forth in § 22-3 above. The account shall
bear the title "Office of the Town Attorney, Town of Babylon, Escrow
Account," and shall be funded by a petty cash account in the initial
amount of $1,000. Said funds are to be replenished upon submission of
receipts to the Comptroller of the Town of Babylon so that a balance of
$1,000 may be maintained at any given time.

C. Only the Town Attorney and the Deputy Town Attorney shall be
authorized to execute said escrow checks.
D. An accounting of this account shall be limited to providing receipts
acceptable to the Comptroller of the Town of Babylon.
A. The continuation of free and representative government depends in
great measure upon public servants who are motivated by moral and
ethical concepts predicated on rational and spiritual grounds. Public
officials and employees of a free government are entrusted with the
welfare, prosperity, security and safety of the people they serve. In
exchange for this trust, the people are entitled to know that no conflict
between private interests and official duties exists in those who serve
them.
B. The powers, duties, prohibitions and responsibilities of public officials
of the Town government are defined in various laws of the state. To this
legal framework, public officials and employees must add a personal
commitment of honesty and moral and ethical conduct. Such standards
must be founded upon personal integrity and community vigilance. No
law, no ordinance, no code can, in itself, create a moral pattern of
conduct. To act morally and in accordance with accepted standards and
principles is an obligation of public servants, as well as the people they
serve. As the public officials and employees of the Town have the duty to
act always in accordance with legal mandate and ethical standards,
they also have the right to expect that the people they serve will help in
the accomplishment of the objective and promote a healthy civic
conscience.

[Adopted 7-22-1986 by L.L. No. 4-1986]

companies situated within the Town to provide for fire protection services
to the various fire protection districts within the town. Currently, when

fire protection district only provides budgetary information regarding the
requested amount for the current year or the proposed amount for the
next fiscal year. No information is provided to the Town in the itemized
categories for past or present annual budget expenditures. This lack of
information makes it extremely difficult for the Town Board and Budget
Review Committee to adequately review and determine the necessity of
contract increases.

fire companies and the ambulance company providing fire protection and
rescue services to the fire protection districts and the ambulance districts
in the town. The contract monitor shall serve at the pleasure of the Town
Board without compensation.
A. To ensure that sufficient information is provided to the Town of Babylon
for accurate budget review, it shall be the responsibility of each fire
protection district during contract negotiation to submit to the Town of
Babylon an accurate accounting of actual itemized expenses incurred
during the current year and an accurate accounting of all fund balances
for January 1 through August 31 for the current fiscal year.
B. To facilitate the continuing accuracy and veracity of fire protection
district budgets, the Town Comptroller or an authorized agent of the
Town Comptroller is hereby authorized to inspect and examine any and
all financial accounting records, accounts, books, contracts,
documents, papers and procedures connected with the running of the
fire district, at any time that such review is deemed necessary by the
Town Board.

§ 44-16 BABYLON CODE § 44-18
42:128
A. Legislative intent. The purpose and intent of this section is to establish
residency requirements for certain appointed Town officers of the Town
of Babylon who are appointed to positions of Bay Constable,
Harbormaster, Park Ranger and Fire Marshal. In order to employ and
maintain employment of quality appointed Town officers in these
positions, the Town Board of the Town of Babylon has determined that
residency of such Town officers within the State of New York would
provide sufficient geographical boundaries within which to secure and
maintain a pool of qualified appointed Town officers available to be
appointed by the Town of Babylon as the needs for such appointments
occur from time to time. The Town Board further finds and determines
that limiting these appointed Town officers' residency to the Town of
Babylon only is unduly restrictive and burdensome on the Town of
Babylon in attempting to maintain and fill appointed Town officers
vacancies as they occur within the specific positions stated above.
Accordingly, the Town Board of the Town of Babylon adopts this section
for the purposes of allowing the Town to employ and maintain
employment of qualified appointed Town officers to the positions of Bay
Constable, Harbormaster, Park Ranger and Fire Marshal to serve the
Town of Babylon and its residents.
B. Establishment of residency requirements for appointed Town officers.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Subdivision 1 of § 23 of the Town Law
of the State of New York, and notwithstanding the provisions of
Subdivision 1 of § 3 of the Public Officers Law, and notwithstanding the
provisions of Subdivision 1 of § 3-b of the Public Officers Law or
Subdivision 1d of § 30 the Public Officer's Law, in the Town of Babylon,
Suffolk County, New York, all persons appointed to the positions of Bay
Constable, Harbormaster, Park Ranger and Fire Marshal shall reside
within the State of New York.
C. Conflict with state statutes and authority to supersede. To the extent
that any provisions of this section are in conflict or are construed as
inconsistent with the provisions of the New York State Town Law or
New York State Public Officers Law, this section supersedes, amends
and takes precedence over New York State Town Law and New York
State Public Officers Law pursuant to the Town's Municipal Home Rule
powers pursuant to Municipal Home Rule Law §§ 10, Subdivisions
1(ii)d(3) and 1(ii)a(14), and 22 to supersede any inconsistent authority.
In particular, this section supersedes any inconsistent provisions of
Town Law § 23, Subdivision 1, which provides that every officer of the
Town at the time of his election or appointment and throughout his term
of office must be an elector of the Town. This section further supersedes
any inconsistent provisions of Public Officer's Law § 3, Subdivision 1,
which sets forth the qualification for holding public office and provides
that to qualify a person must, at the time chosen, be at least 18 years of
age, a citizen of the United States, a resident of the state and, in the
case of a local office, a resident of the political subdivision for which he
or she is appointed or within which the electors choosing him reside. It
is the intent of this section to amend § 23, Subdivision 1, of the Town

STREETS, PROCEDURE FOR ABANDONMENT OF

§ 59-2. Request of Town Board or Commissioner of Public Works.
A. The Town of Babylon wishes to establish a set of rules and procedures
for the abandonment of streets and highways or portions thereof which
are included in the Town highway system. Although the Town of
Babylon, as well as other Towns throughout New York State, has for
years been adopting resolutions abandoning streets or highways or
portions thereof, a recent decision in litigation in which the Town of
Babylon was involved but which has subsequently been settled raised
an issue whether or not the Town was empowered, absent an
authorizing local law, from abandoning streets under the previous
procedure. While the Town Board of the Town of Babylon strongly
believes that the previous procedures were legal and sufficient, in order
to avoid future litigation the Town of Babylon is hereby adopting this
chapter.
B. This chapter is intended only to enhance the power and authorization of
the officials of the Town of Babylon in the acquisition, care,
management and use of its highways, roads, streets, avenues and
property, and, in the event that it is more strict or stringent than any
provision of the New York State law, the provisions of the New York
State law shall apply.
A. If a member of the Town Board or the Commissioner of the Department
of Public Works of the Town of Babylon desires to abandon the street or
highway or a portion thereof contained in the Town of Babylon highway
system, such abandonment shall occur upon the happening of both of
the following events: [Amended 9-7-1994 by L.L. No. 26-1994]
(1) The adopting of a resolution by the Town Board of the Town of
Babylon setting forth a description of the street or highway or a
portion thereof to be abandoned.
(2) The filing of a certificate of abandonment by the Commissioner of
the Department of Public Works with the Town Clerk setting forth a
decision.
B. The order of the above-mentioned acts is immaterial, and the
abandonment will be deemed to have occurred upon the occurrence of

§ 60-7. Alternate Council position. [Added 11-10-2011 by L.L. No.
20-2011]
A. The Town Board finds that the world is a different place after the United
States was attacked on September 11, 2001. As a result of the attack,
America mobilized our members of our armed services, both active and
reserve and also invoked stop loss, which kept soldiers serving after
their tours of duty were fulfilled. Many Americans have been deployed
overseas and many reserve soldiers have been activated to support our
troops, many times leaving gaps in our society which they filled on a
daily basis.
B. The fact that so many reservists have been activated and reactivated on
numerous occasions has left the Town to answer the question of how
does the government function with the loss of an elected official
activated to serve our country. While a vacancy is not created when an
elected official is deployed on active military duty, the seat is
nonetheless vacant when the Board meets and votes on resolutions
necessary to run Town government on a daily basis.
C. In order to provide for continued government and to secure the
protection of our armed forces serving the government as elected
officials, the Town must act with regard to the membership and
composition of its legislative body pursuant to New York Municipal
Home Rule Law.
D. The Town Board finds it necessary to have a supersession of the
legislature and to supersede any contrary law or statute, including, but
not limited to New York State Public Officer's Law § 30; New York State
Military Law Section §§ 242 and 243; State General Municipal Law § 92
and New York State Town Law §§ 20.1(a); 64(23); 51(6) and 94(5).
A. When an elected Councilperson serving on the Town Board is unable to
fulfill his/her duties due to responsibilities and obligations to the United
States military (active military duty), an alternate Councilperson
position is created and said elected Councilperson is deemed to be on a
leave of absence.
B. An alternate Councilperson may be appointed by a majority vote of the
Town Board within 30 days of written notification that a Councilperson
will be activated for military duty and unable to fulfill his/her duties as a
Town Councilmember. The alternate Councilperson must meet the
§ 60-5 STREETS, PROCEDURE FOR ABANDONMENT § 60-7

§ 60-8. Ward system. [Added 9-13-2016 by L.L. No. 14-2016]
criteria necessary to run for the office of Councilperson in a general
election, as a prerequisite to being appointed as an alternate
Councilperson. Said alternate Councilperson shall assume the office of
alternate Councilperson on the day following the date of deployment of
said soldier/Councilperson or any date thereafter that the Town Board
may designate.
C. The alternate Council position is limited to a term of one year. Nothing
herein shall provide for any such appointment to exceed the term of
office of the elected Councilperson on military leave. The alternate
Councilperson shall serve until the Councilperson's absence has ended
and said elected Councilperson can resume the duties of his/her elected
office.
D. In the event that any of the provisions of this section are declared
invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the
remaining terms and provisions which are not affected thereby shall
remain in full force and effect.
A. Legislative intent. It is the intention of the Town Board to exercise its
authority pursuant to Municipal Home Rule Law §§ 10(1)(ii)(a)(1),
10(1)(ii)(a)(2), 10(1)(ii)(d)(3) and Town Law §§ 24 and 24-a(1) any other
applicable provision of law now or hereinafter enacted, to supersede
and/or expand upon the applicable provisions of Town Law § 85 and any
successor law with respect to authorizing the Town Board instead of the
Suffolk County Board of Elections to draw ward district lines and to
maintain the term of office for all Councilmen at four years after a ward
system has been established.
B. Ward system for election of Councilmen.
(1) Whenever a proposition shall have been adopted in the Town for
the establishment of the ward system and the election thereafter of
one Councilman from each ward, the Town Board shall divide the
Town into four wards and fix the boundaries thereof, unless a
proposition shall have been adopted to increase the number of
Councilmen from four to six, in which instance, the Town Board
shall divide the Town into six wards and fix the boundaries thereof.
The Town Board shall divide the districts so that the number of
voters in each ward shall be substantially equal, with wards
composed of convenient and contiguous territory in as compact
form as practicable. No election district heretofore or hereinafter
created under the Election Law shall contain parts of two or more
wards. When the Town Board shall have finally determined the
boundaries of the ward, it shall cause a map of the Town to be
prepared, showing, in detail, the location of each ward and the
boundaries thereof. The original map so made shall be filed in the
office of the Town Clerk, and copies thereof shall be filed in the
offices of the County Clerk and the Board of Elections of Suffolk

filing is complete.
(2) After a ward system shall have been so established, the term of
office of every Town Councilman shall terminate on the 31st day of
December next succeeding the first biennial Town election held not
less than 120 days after the establishment of such ward system,
and, at such biennial Town election, one resident elector from each
odd-numbered ward shall be elected as Councilman therefrom for a
term of two years, and one resident elector from each evennumbered
ward shall be elected as Councilman therefrom for a
term of four years, each such term to begin on the first day of
January next succeeding such election, and thereafter at each
biennial Town election there shall be elected successors to the
Town Councilmen whose terms are expiring for terms of four years
each to begin on the first day of January next succeeding such
election.

Beaches and recreational areas  See Ch. 81.
§ 74-1. Findings; intent.
The Town Board of the Town of Babylon hereby declares and finds it to be in
the public interest to provide for the regulation of certain conduct in public
places within the Town of Babylon by prohibiting the possession of open
containers of alcoholic beverages by persons on public premises except
as permitted herein. The Town Board finds that possession of an open
container of an alcoholic beverage in a public place within the town has
led to consumption of the same, resulting in public intoxication, disorderly
conduct, disturbance of the public peace, littering of the public places and
destruction of property. The Town Board finds further than preservation
of the public weal and prevention of conditions which lead to conduct
disturbing the public peace attributable to consumption of alcoholic
beverages can be accomplished by the prohibition of consumption of
alcoholic beverages in public places and by restricting the possession of an
open or unsealed container of an alcoholic beverage under circumstances
which indicate that the possessor of such open or unsealed container in a
public place intends to consume the same or intends to have it consumed by
another person.
§ 74-2. Definitions.
The following terms used in this chapter shall have the following meanings,
unless the context requires or indicates a different meaning:
ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE  Includes alcohol, spirits, liquor, wine, beer,
cider and every liquid or solid, patented or not, containing alcohol, spirits
or beer and capable of being consumed by a human being.

used to hold, any liquid.

§ 89-77. Asbestos monitoring; certification.
§ 89-78. Fee for asbestos permit.
A fee shall be charged for every permit issued under this article. The
amount of such fee shall be determined from time to time by the Town
Board.
A. No building or structure shall hereafter be demolished, structurally
altered or expanded on any lot, plot or premises until a report has been
submitted by a state-accredited asbestos monitoring firm or the Town to
the Commissioner of Planning and Development certifying that such
building or structure has been monitored for asbestos and that either
the building or structure is free of asbestos or the building or structure
to be altered necessitates asbestos abatement and that the same is to
be disposed of in an environmentally safe and legally prescribed fashion
or that any asbestos does not pose any health risks to occupants of the
building or the public at large.
B. Upon a review of the report of the asbestos monitoring, a determination
shall be made by the Commissioner of Planning and Development as to
whether a building permit will require asbestos abatement. Where an
asbestos condition is found requiring its abatement, the building permit
to be issued will be conditioned upon such abatement. During and
subsequent to the abatement of any asbestos, the site shall be
monitored by the Town or any certified monitoring firm according to
regulations promulgated by the Department of Planning and
Development of the Town of Babylon. All asbestos abatements shall be

measured in accordance with ANSI Standard Z765-2003 with
exceptions as specified in Appendix A of the RESNET Standard. For
homes with multiple systems, the aggregate leakage of all installed
duct systems will be no greater than the maximum allowable rate
as calculated by the formula above.
(6) An ACCA Manual J has been performed for the subject dwelling as
defined in § 403.6 of the Energy Conservation Construction Code of
New York State.
(7) All HVAC ducts not completely inside the subject dwelling's
thermal envelope are insulated to a minimum of R-6 as defined in
§ 405.2 of the ECCCNYS.
(8) A permanent certificate has been affixed on or in the electrical
distribution panel in accordance with Chapter 4, § 401.3 of the
Energy Construction Code of New York State, which includes the
building's HERS Index.
F. Prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for any subject
dwelling which was granted a building permit prior to the effective date
of this measure, the applicant shall provide evidence that the subject
dwelling complies with all aspects of the LIPA ENERGY STAR Homes
Program, using either the Home Energy Rating System (HERS) or
Builder Option Package method. Prior to issuance of a certificate of
occupancy, all field verification and testing requirements of that
program shall be met.

Notwithstanding any provision contained in § 89-79, the testing and
verification requirement may be waived upon the Long Island Power
Authority (LIPA) submitting a certification that no testing or verification
protocol and procedure can be applied accurately in a particular building
configuration.
§ 89-81. (Reserved)
G. Commencing on January 1, 2012, prior to the issuance of a building
permit for any new subject dwelling for which a building permit has
been previously issued and for which construction has not progressed
beyond the foundation, the applicant shall comply with Subsection D of
this section. Prior to issuance of certificate of occupancy the subject
dwelling shall comply with Subsection E of this section.
H. The commissioner shall establish requirements for HERS raters
practicing in the Town to provide proof of certification, insurance,
experience and independence, and shall maintain a list of raters that
have provided this information and filed other required information
with the commissioner. The commissioner shall establish rules to limit

Universal Design and Accessibility Incentive
[Added 10-19-2010 by L.L. No. 29-2010]
§ 89-88. Legislative intent; findings.
§ 89-89. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms must comply with the Americans
with Disabilities Act (ADA) and shall have the meanings indicated:
ACCESSIBLE DOOR  As defined by ANSI 117.1 and commonly provides
for a thirty-six-inch door that when hung in the standard manner provides
a minimum clearance of 32 inches with no more than one-quarter-inch
beveled thresholds and equipped or easily refitted with lever-type door
handles.
ACCESSIBLE ENTRYWAY  A step-free entry at any opening of the
dwelling (front, back, side, garage), the path to which from the driveway or
A. Legislative intent.
(1) It is the intent of the Town Board to establish incentives for
applicants that submit proposals that incorporate specific universal
design and accessibility features for new and existing residences.
(2) This article establishes a mechanism by which building permit
applications for the development, redevelopment and modification
of new and existing residences containing universal design and
accessibility features are expedited, permit fees are reduced or
waived, and strict adherence to the applicable zoning district's
setback regulations through the building permit approval process
are relaxed to the fullest extent practicable.
B. Findings.
(1) The Town of Babylon's 1998 Comprehensive Plan indicates that the
Town's population over 65 years of age has been increasing, and
the United States Census Bureau reports that by 2030 one out of
five Americans will be 65 years and older. The aging of the
population creates an increasing need for housing that is accessible
for occupants as well as visitors.
(2) The Town Board finds that the incorporation of certain universal
design features during the planning, construction, extension or
alteration of a residence will afford seniors and physically
challenged persons greater opportunity to occupy or visit homes
within the Town of Babylon to age in place which avoids the
considerable cost to retirees, their families and often the State of
New York for unnecessary and unwanted residencies in assistedliving
or nursing-care facilities.

85:265
public sidewalk is an unobstructed walkway of at least 36 inches in width
with an approach slope of not more than 1:12.
ANSI A117.1  The most current version of the "Standard on Accessible
and Usable Building Facilities," commonly known as "ICC/ANSI A117.1,"
published by the International Code Council and American National
Standards Institute, Inc.
EXPEDITED REVIEW  The grant of priority status to an application that
shall result in the review of the application ahead of applications filed prior
thereto. Ultimately the issuance of a building permit will be contingent upon
the application satisfying all applicable New York State Residential Building
Code requirements.
FLEX ROOM  A common-use room that can be converted to a private
bedroom without demolition, with the exception of that which is required
for installing a door in an existing wall opening. A flex room must meet
governing code requirements for future use as a bedroom, including egress
and smoke detection.
KITCHEN  A room or an area in a building in which food is cooked
and/or prepared and which contains equipment used in the cooking and
preparation of food, i.e., stove and/or oven and/or microwave oven or any
other appliance, device or equipment ordinarily used in the preparation
and/or cooking of food. It may also contain any or all of the following: sink
and/or refrigerator and/or base cabinet(s) and/or upper cabinet(s).
INCENTIVE  A specific benefit granted to the applicant submitting an
application for development, redevelopment and modification of new and
existing residences in accordance with the universal design and
accessibility requirements.
POWDER ROOM (ALSO KNOW AS "HALF BATH")  A room containing a
toilet (water closet) and lavatory (sink) but no bathtub or shower.
UNIVERSAL DESIGN  The design of products and environments to be
usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for
adaptation or specialized design.
§ 89-90. Incentives.
A. All applications for development, redevelopment and modification of
new and existing residences, including single-family, multifamily and
senior citizens' multiresidences, which are ADA compliant, shall receive
an expedited review by the Building Division to the fullest extent
practicable, if the following universal design features are incorporated
into the project:

85:266
rise at the zero-step entrance. A sidewalk or walkway being
utilized as the accessible unobstructed route of at least 36
inches in width to the zero-step entrance must have a slope no
greater than 1:12.
(b) All exterior hinged doors shall be accessible doors with a
minimum of 32 inches' internal clearance and with no more
than one-quarter-inch beveled thresholds and equipped or
easily refitted with lever-type door handles.

It is the intention of the Town Board, as part of its goal to limit America's
dependence on imported sources of fossil energy, cut greenhouse gas
emissions and reduce the cost of energy for our residents, to enact a
solar energy system fast-track permit process modeled on the guideline
recommendations of the Long Island Unified Solar Permitting Initiative
composed of Suffolk County Planning Commission, Nassau County Planning
Commission and the Long Island Power Authority, whereby the installation
of standard solar energy systems can be standardized, simplified and
accelerated in towns and villages across Long Island.
§ 89-92. Solar panels. [Amended 8-13-2013 by L.L. No. 16-2013]

If any clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivisions, section or other part of
this article shall for any reason be adjudged by any court of competent
jurisdiction to be unconstitutional or otherwise invalidated, such judgment
shall not affect, impair or invalidate the remainder of this article, and it shall
be construed to have been the legislative intent to enact this article without
such unconstitutional or invalid parts.
(5) Create a gravity roof load of no more than five pounds per square
foot for photovoltaic (PV) and six pounds per square foot for
residential solar hot water (RSHW);
(6) Be installed by prescreened contractors as shown on a list

accessory structure is legal.
C. A professional engineer (PE) or registered architect (RA)  certified
drawing (hand-drawn or better) of the solar panel location and layout
on the roof, as well as an equipment location diagram and a one-line
electrical diagram are required.
D. To assist first responders, the Town shall maintain a list by address of
all solar energy installations to be shared with relevant first responder
organizations.

General Provisions
§ 99-1. Legislative authority.
Pursuant to the provisions of Article 34 of the New York State
Environmental Conservation Law § 10 of the Municipal Home Rule Law, the
Town of Babylon, County of Suffolk, State of New York, hereby enacts, by
Local Law No. 2 of 1989, this chapter.
§ 99-2. Title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Town of Babylon
Coastal Erosion Hazard Area Law."
§ 99-3. Effective date.
This chapter shall take effect 20 calendar days from May 2, 1989, which
is the date of this chapter's adoption and filing pursuant to § 27 of the
Municipal Home Rule Law, or the date of filing the official maps, whichever
is later.
§ 99-4. Purpose.
The Town of Babylon hereby assumes the responsibility and authority to
implement and administer a coastal erosion management program within
its jurisdiction pursuant to Article 34 of the New York State Environmental
Conservation Law. It is the purpose of this chapter to:
A. Establish standards and procedures for minimizing and preventing
damage to structures from coastal flooding and erosion and to protect
natural protective features and other natural resources.
B. Regulate, in coastal areas subject to coastal flooding and erosion, land
use and development activities so as to minimize or prevent damage or
destruction to man-made property, natural protective features and
other natural resources and to protect human life.
C. Regulate new construction or placement of structures in order to place
them a safe distance from areas of active erosion and the impacts of
coastal storms to ensure that these structures are not prematurely
destroyed or damaged due to improper siting, as well as to prevent
damage to natural protective features and other natural resources.
D. Restrict public investment in services, facilities or activities which are
likely to encourage new permanent development in erosion hazard
areas.
E. Regulate the construction of erosion protection structures in coastal
areas subject to serious erosion to assure that, when the construction of
erosion protection structures is justified, their construction and
operation will minimize or prevent damage or destruction to man-made
§ 99-1 COASTAL EROSION HAZARD AREAS § 99-4
99:287
§ 99-5. Findings.
The Town of Babylon finds that the coastal erosion hazard area:
§ 99-6. Definitions.
The following terms, as used in this chapter, shall have the meanings
indicated, unless the context clearly requires otherwise:
ADMINISTRATOR  The Commissioner of Environmental Control or his
or her designee shall be responsible for administering and enforcing this
chapter. The powers and duties of this position are fully described in
§ 99-26.
BEACH  The zone of unconsolidated earth that extends landward from
the mean low-water line to the waterward toe of a dune. Where no dune
exists landward of a "beach," the landward limit of a "beach" is 100 feet
property, private and public property, natural protective features and
other natural resources. [Amended 9-12-1989 by L.L. No. 4-1989]
A. Is prone to erosion from action of the Atlantic Ocean and Fire Island
Inlet. Such erosion may be caused by action of waves, currents running
along the shore and wind-driven water and ice. Such areas are also
prone to erosion caused by the wind, runoff of rainwater along the
surface of the land or groundwater seepage, as well as by human
activities such as construction, navigation and certain forms of
recreation.
B. Experiences coastal erosion which causes extensive damage to publicly
and privately owned property and to natural resources as well as
endangering human lives. When this occurs, individuals and private
businesses suffer significant economic losses, as do the Town and the
state economies, either directly through property damage or indirectly
through loss of economic return. Large public expenditures may also be
necessitated for the removal of debris and damaged structures and
replacement of essential public facilities and services.
C. Experiences erosion-related problems that are often contributed to by
man's building without considering the potential for damage to
property, by undertaking activities which destroy natural protective
features such as dunes or vegetation by building structures intended
for erosion prevention which may exacerbate erosion conditions on
adjacent or nearby property and by water action produced by wakes
from boats.
D. Is the subject of programs which foster erosion protection structures,
either with private or public funds, which are costly, often only partially
effective over time and may even be harmful to adjacent or nearby
properties. In some sections of the Town, major erosion protection
structures of great length would be required to effectively reduce
future damages due to erosion.
§ 99-4 BABYLON CODE § 99-6
99:288
landward from the place where there is a marked change in material or
physiographic form or from the line of permanent vegetation, whichever is
most waterward. Shorelands subject to seasonal or more frequent overwash
or inundation are considered to be "beaches."
COASTAL EROSION HAZARD AREA MAP  The final map and any
amendments thereof issued by the Commissioner of the New York State
Department of Environmental Conservation, which delineates boundaries of
coastal erosion hazard areas subject to regulation under this chapter.
COASTLINE and COASTAL WATERS  The land adjacent to the Town of
Babylon coastal waters is the "coastline." The "coastal waters" are the
Atlantic Ocean and its connecting water bodies, bays, harbors, shallows and
marshes.
DEBRIS LINE  A linear accumulation of waterborne debris deposited on a
beach by storm-induced high water or by wave action.
DEPARTMENT  The New York State Department of Environmental
Conservation.
DUNE  A ridge or hill of loose, windblown or artificially placed earth, the
principal component of which is sand.
EROSION  The loss or displacement of land along the coastline due to
the action of waves, currents, wind-driven water, waterborne ice or other
impacts of storms. It also means the loss or displacement of land due to the
action of wind, runoff or surface waters or groundwaters or groundwater
seepage.
EROSION HAZARD AREA  An area of the coastline which is a structural
hazard area, or a natural protective feature area.
EROSION PROTECTION STRUCTURE  A structure specifically designed
to reduce or prevent erosion such as a groin, jetty, revetment, breakwater
or artificial beach nourishment project.
EXISTING STRUCTURE  A structure and appurtenances in existence or
one where construction has commenced or one where construction has not
begun but for which a building permit has been issued prior to the effective
date of this chapter, as set forth in § 99-3 herein.
GRADING  A redistribution of sand or other unconsolidated earth to effect
a change in profile.
MAJOR ADDITION  An addition to a structure resulting in a twenty-fivepercent
or greater increase in the ground area coverage of the structure,
other than an erosion protection structure or a pier, dock or wharf. The
increase will be calculated as follows: the ground area coverage to be
added, including any additions previously constructed under a coastal
erosion management permit, divided by the ground area coverage of the
existing structure as defined in "existing structure." The sum total ground
area coverage of subsequent additions may not exceed 25% of the ground
area coverage of the existing structure as that term is defined in § 99-6
herein.[Amended 9-12-1989 by L.L. No. 4-1989]

NATURAL PROTECTIVE FEATURE  A nearshore area, beach, primary
dune, secondary dune or marsh and their vegetation.[Amended 9-12-1989
by L.L. No. 4-1989]
NATURAL PROTECTIVE FEATURE AREA  A land and/or water area
containing natural protective features, the alteration of which might reduce
or destroy the protection afforded other lands against erosion or high water
or lower the reserve of sand or other natural materials available to replenish
storm losses through natural processes.[Amended 9-12-1989 by L.L No.
4-1989]
NEARSHORE AREA  Those lands under water beginning at the mean
low-water line and extending waterward in a direction perpendicular to
the shoreline to a point where mean low water depth is 15 feet to or a

is greater.[Amended 9-12-1989 by L.L. No. 4-1989]
NORMAL MAINTENANCE  Periodic replacement or repair of same-kind
structural elements or protective coatings which do not change the size,
design or function of a functioning structure. A "functioning structure" is
one which is fully performing as originally designed at the time that "normal
maintenance" is scheduled to begin. "Normal maintenance" of a structure
does not require a coastal erosion management permit.[Amended

PRIMARY DUNE  The most waterward major dune where there are two
or more parallel lines within a coastal area. Where there is only one dune
present, it is the primary one. Occasionally one or more relatively small
dune formations exist waterward of the "primary dune." These smaller
formations will be considered to be part of the primary dune for the
purposes of this chapter. The waterward limit of the "primary dune" is the
landward limit of its fronting beach. The landward limit of the primary dune
is 25 feet landward of its landward toe.[Amended 9-12-1989 by L.L. No.

ARTICLE II
Standards and Restrictions
§ 99-7. Areas established; boundaries.
The coastal erosion hazard area is hereby established to classify land and
water areas within the Town of Babylon, based upon shoreline recession
rates or the location of natural protective features. The boundaries of the
area are established on the final map prepared by the New York State
Department of Environmental Conservation under § 34-0104 of the New
York State Environmental Conservation Law and entitled "Coastal Erosion
Hazard Area Map of the Town of Babylon," including all amendments made
thereto by the Commissioner of the New York State Department of
Environmental Conservation pursuant to § 34-0104 of the New York State
Environmental Conservation Law.
§ 99-8. Permit required for regulated activities.
No person may engage in any regulated activity in an erosion hazard area
as depicted on the Coastal Erosion Hazard Areas Map of the Town of
Babylon, as amended, without first obtaining a coastal erosion management
permit. No coastal erosion management permit is required for unregulated
activities.
§ 99-9. General standards.
A coastal erosion management permit will be issued only with a finding by
the administrator that the proposed regulated activity:
§ 99-10. Nearshore area restrictions. [Amended 9-12-1989 by L.L.
No. 4-1989]
A. Is reasonable and necessary, considering reasonable alternatives to the
proposed activity and the extent to which the proposed activity requires
a shoreline location.
B. Is not likely to cause a measurable increase in erosion at the proposed
site and at other locations.
C. Prevents, if possible, or minimizes adverse effects on natural protective
features and their functions and protective values, existing erosion
protection structures and natural resources.
A. Nearshore areas dissipate a substantial amount of wave energy before
it is expended on beaches or dunes by causing waves to collapse or
break. Nearshore areas also function as reservoirs of sand, gravel and
other unconsolidated material for beaches. Sandbars, which are located
in nearshore areas, control the orientation of incoming waves and
promote the development of ice cap formations which help protect
shorelines during winter storms. The roots of aquatic vegetation in
§ 99-7 COASTAL EROSION HAZARD AREAS § 99-10
99:293
§ 99-11. Beach area restrictions.
§ 99-12. Dune area restrictions.
nearshore areas bind fine-grained silts, clays and organic matter to
form a fairly cohesive bottom that resists erosion.
B. The following restrictions apply to regulated activities in nearshore
areas:
(1) Excavating, grading, mining or dredging which diminishes the
erosion protection afforded by nearshore area is prohibited, except
construction or maintenance of navigation channels, bypassing
sand around natural and man-made obstructions and artificial
beach nourishment, all of which require a coastal erosion
management permit.
(2) Clean sand or gravel of an equivalent or slightly larger grain size is
the only material which may be deposited within nearshore areas.
Any deposition will require a coastal erosion management permit.
(3) All development is prohibited in nearshore areas unless specifically
provided for by this chapter.
A. Beaches buffer shorelands from erosion by absorbing wave energy that
otherwise would be expended on the toes of dunes. Beaches that are
high and wide protect shorelands from erosion more effectively than
beaches that are low or narrow. Beaches also act as reservoirs of sand
or other unconsolidated material for longshore littoral transport and
offshore sandbar and shoal formation.
B. The following restrictions apply to regulated activities in beach areas:
(1) Excavating, grading or mining which diminishes the erosion
protection afforded by beaches is prohibited.
(2) Clean sand or gravel of an equivalent or slightly larger grain size is
the only material which may be deposited within beach areas. Any
deposition will require a coastal erosion management permit which
may be issued only for expansion or stabilization of beaches.
(3) Active bird nesting and breeding areas must not be disturbed
unless such disturbance is pursuant to a specific wildlife
management activity approved in writing by the New York State
Department of Environmental Conservation.
(4) All development is prohibited on beaches unless specifically
provided for by this chapter.
(5) The restoration of existing structures on beaches that are damaged
or destroyed by events not related to coastal flooding and erosion
may be undertaken without a coastal erosion management permit.
§ 99-10 BABYLON CODE § 99-12
99:294
A. Dunes prevent overtopping and store sand for coastal processes. High,
vegetated dunes provide a greater degree of protection than low,
unvegetated ones. Dunes are of the greatest protective value during
conditions of storm-induced high water. Because dunes often protect
some of the most biologically productive areas as well as developed
coastal areas, their protective value is especially great. The key to
maintaining a stable dune system is the establishment and maintenance
of beach grass or other vegetation on the dunes and assurance of a
supply of nourishment sand to the dunes.
B. The following restrictions apply to regulated activities in dune areas:
(1) In primary dune areas:
(a) Excavating, grading or mining of primary dunes is prohibited.
(b) Clean sand of a compatible type and size is the only material
which may be deposited. Any deposition requires a coastal
erosion management permit.
(c) All depositions must be vegetatively stabilized using species
tolerant of the conditions at the site and must be placed so as
to increase the size of, or restore, a dune or dune area.
(d) Active bird nesting and breeding areas must not be disturbed
unless such disturbance is pursuant to a specific wildlife
management activity approved in writing by the New York
State Department of Environmental Conservation.
(e) Nonmajor additions to existing structures are allowed on
primary dunes pursuant to a coastal erosion management
permit and subject to permit conditions concerning the
location, design and potential impacts of the structure on the
primary dune.
(f) Stone revetments or other erosion protection structures
compatible with primary dunes will only be allowed at the
waterward toe of primary dunes and must not interfere with
the exchange of sand between primary dunes and their
fronting beaches.
(2) In secondary dune areas:
(a) All depositions must be of clean sand of a compatible type and
size, and all grading must be performed so as to increase the
size of, or restore, a dune or former dune area.
(b) Excavating, grading or mining must not diminish the erosion
protection afforded by them.
(c) Nonmajor additions to existing structures are allowed on
secondary dunes pursuant to a coastal erosion management
permit.
§ 99-12 COASTAL EROSION HAZARD AREAS § 99-12
99:295
§ 99-13. Erosion protection structures.
The following requirements apply to the construction, modification or
restoration of erosion protection structures:
(d) Permitted construction, reconstruction, restoration or
modifications must be built on adequately anchored pilings
such that at least three feet of open space exists between the
floor joints and the surface of the secondary dune, and the
permitted activity must leave the space below the lowest
horizontal structural members free of obstructions. [Amended
9-12-1989 by L.L. No. 4-1989]
(3) All other activities and development in dune areas are prohibited

[Added 8-14-2001 by L.L. No. 7-2001]
§ 106-31. Legislative intent.
§ 106-32. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
DOMESTIC ANIMAL  Cats and/or dogs.
DANGEROUS DOG  Any dog which menaces, threatens, attacks or bites a
person who is peaceably conducting himself or herself in any place where
he or she may lawfully be; any dog owned, harbored or trained primarily or
in part for the purpose of dog fighting; any dog owned, harbored or trained
primarily or in part for the purpose of attacking a human being or domestic
animal on command; or any dog which menaces, threatens, attacks or bites
another dog, cat or animal peaceably conducting itself in any place in which
it may lawfully be present.
§ 106-33. Prohibitions.
A. This Board finds and determines that § 121 of the New York Agriculture
and Markets Law imposes penalties for attacks by dogs on domestic
animals such as domesticated sheep, horses, cattle, fallow deer, red
deer, sika deer, whitetail deer raised under license from the Department
of Environmental Conservation, llamas, goats, swine, fowl, ducks,
geese, swan turkeys, confined domestic hare or rabbits, pheasants or
other birds raised in confinement under license from the State
Department of Environmental Conservation, when such animals are
lawfully in a place.
B. This Board also finds and determines that such state legislation does
not address dog attacks on other animals such as dogs and cats.
C. This Board further finds that the recent spate of animal attack incidents
requires action that goes beyond present law.
D. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to impose penalties for dog
attacks on either dogs or cats and to allow local animal control officers
greater latitude to protect the public from vicious dogs.
A. If any dog shall attack any domestic animal, as defined in § 106-32 of
this article, while such animal is in any place where it may lawfully be
present, the owner or caretaker of such, or any other person witnessing
such attack, may, for the purpose of preventing the killing or injury of
such domestic animal, destroy such dog while so attacking, and no
liability in damages or otherwise shall be incurred on account of such
destruction.
§ 106-31 CONSUMER PROTECTION § 106-33
101:329
B. Any person may make a complaint of an attack upon a domestic animal
to a Town of Babylon Dog Control Officer. Such Officer shall
immediately inform the complainant of his right to commence a
proceeding as provided in Subsection C of this section, and, if there is
reason to believe the dog is a dangerous dog, the Officer shall forthwith
commence such proceeding himself.
C. Any person may, and any Town of Babylon Dog Control Officer shall,
make a complaint under oath or affirmation to any municipal judge or
justice of such attack. The judge or justice shall then immediately
determine if there is probable cause to believe the dog is a dangerous
dog and, if so, shall issue an order to any Town of Babylon dog control
officer; peace officer, acting pursuant to his special duties; or police
officer, directing such officer to immediately seize such dog and hold
the same pending judicial determination as herein provided. Whether
or not the judge or justice finds there is probable cause for such seizure,
he or she shall, within five days and upon written notice of not less than
two days to the owner of the dog, hold a hearing on the complaint. If
satisfied that the dog is a dangerous dog, the judge or justice shall then
order any Town of Babylon dog control officer; peace officer, acting
pursuant to his special duties; or police officer to cause the dog to be
euthanized immediately, or shall order the owner to securely confine
such dog permanently, except as provided in Subsection E of this
section. The owner shall confine the dog indoors or in an enclosed and
locked pen or structure as provided for in the order. Such pen or
enclosure shall have a secure top and sides and shall be designed to
prevent an unauthorized entry of a person, the escape of the dog, and
provide protection from the elements. If the owner fails to confine the
dog as required by such order, any Town of Babylon dog control officer;
peace officer, acting pursuant to his special duties; or police officer
shall destroy such dog on or off the premises of the owner.
D. A dog shall not be declared dangerous if the Court determines that the
conduct of the dog:
(1) Was justified because the threat, injury or damage was sustained by
a domestic animal under the dominion and control of a person who,
at the time, was committing a crime or offense upon the owner or
custodian of the dog or upon the property of the owner or custodian
of the dog;
(2) Was justified because the injured domestic animal was tormenting,
abusing or assaulting the dog or has in the past tormented, abused,
or assaulted the dog; or
(3) Was responding to pain or injury, or was protecting itself, its
kennels or its offspring.
E. Restraint and muzzling.
(1) In addition to an order of confinement issued pursuant to
Subsection C of this section, the judge or justice may order the
§ 106-33 BABYLON CODE § 106-33
101:330
§ 106-34. Penalties for offenses.
owner or custodian to securely chain and muzzle the dog and
require that the dog be under physical restraint of a responsible
person when:
(a) Confined in the presence of persons other than the owner or
custodian; and
(b) Outside such enclosure for brief periods only when and for the
period necessary to urinate, defecate or receive medical
treatment.
(2) The muzzle described in Subsection E(1) above shall be made in a
manner that will not cause injury to the dog or interfere with its
vision or respiration but shall prevent it from biting any person or
animal.
F. Nothing contained herein shall limit or abrogate any claim or cause or
action under common law or by statute. The provisions of this section
shall be in addition to such common law and statutory remedies.
G. Nothing contained herein shall restrict the rights and powers derived
from the provisions of Title IV, Article 21, of the New York Public Health
Law relating to rabies and any rule and regulation adopted pursuant
thereto.
A. The owner of a dog who, through any act or omission, negligently
permits his or her dog to bite a domestic animal causing physical injury
shall be subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $400, in addition to any
other applicable penalties.
B. The owner of a dog who, through any act or omission, negligently
permits his or her dog to bite a domestic animal causing serious
physical injury shall be subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $800 in
addition to any other applicable penalties.
C. The owner of a dog who, through any act or omission, negligently
permits his or her dog, which had previously been determined to be
dangerous pursuant to state or local law, to bite a domestic animal, or a
person, causing serious physical injury, shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not more than $1,000, or by a
period of imprisonment not to exceed 90 days, or by both such fine and
imprisonment in addition to any other applicable penalties.
D. If any dog, which had previously been determined by a judge or justice
to be a dangerous dog as defined in § 106-32 of this article, shall,
without justification, kill or cause the death of any domestic animal, or a
person, who is peaceably conducting itself, himself or herself in any
place where it, he or she may lawfully be present, regardless of whether
such dog escaped without fault of the owner, the owner shall be guilty
of a Class A Misdemeanor, in addition to any other penalties.
§ 106-33 CONSUMER PROTECTION § 106-34
101:331
§ 106-35. Applicability.
This article shall apply to any actions occurring on or after the effective date
of this article.
§ 106-36. Severability.
If any clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivision, section or part of this
article or the application thereof to any person, individual, corporation,
firm, partnership, entity or circumstance shall be adjudged by any court
of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unconstitutional, such order or
judgement shall not affect, impair or invalidate the remainder thereof,
but shall be confined in its operation to the clause, sentence, paragraph,
subdivision, section or part of this article, or in its application to the person,
individual, corporation, firm, partnership, entity or circumstance directly
involved in the controversy in which such order or judgement shall be
rendered.
§ 106-37. Effective date.
This article shall take effect on September 1, 2001.
E. The owner shall not be liable pursuant to Subsections A, B, C or D of
this section if the dog was coming to the aid or defense of a person
during the commission or attempted commission or a murder, robbery,
burglary, arson, rape in the first degree as defined in § 130.35,
Subdivision 1 or 2, of the New York Penal Law, sodomy in the first
degree as defined in § 130.50, Subdivision 1 or 2, of the New York Penal
Law, or kidnapping within the dwelling or upon the real property of the

Feeding of Waterfowl
[Added 10-21-2008 by L.L. No. 25-2008]
§ 106-38. Findings of fact.
Whereas, the Town Board of the Town of Babylon has determined that
artificial feeding of waterfowl is actually harmful to these animals and
can cause poor nutrition, increased hybridization, water pollution, beach
closures, contamination of shellfish growing areas, delayed natural
migration, high concentrations of waterfowl at unnatural sites,
overcrowding, spread of disease, costly management efforts, unnatural
behavior and cumulative negative environmental impacts on the South
Shore Estuary Reserve.

"domestic partners." The Town Board deems it is appropriate and fair
that certain societal benefits and privileges now accorded to those who
are in a legally recognized partnership be available to domestic
partners.
B. This legislation is intended to define the term "domestic partnership"
and establish a registry for residents wishing to acknowledge such

that they have resided together and shared a relationship of mutual
support for a period of not less than one year prior to their registration

or death of either partner.

Department regarding the merits of each such application.
§ 108-5. Application for permit.
A. It shall be the public policy of the Town to preserve the purity and
integrity of its coastal wetlands. The health, welfare and protection of
its persons and property require that the Town reasonably restrict the
uses of its wetlands along the waterfront of the Great South Bay. It is
therefore in the exercise of this power that the Town enacts these

§ 114-1. Authority, intent and purpose.
§ 114-2. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, unless the context otherwise requires, the following
terms shall have the meanings indicated:
ACRE  43,560 square feet of land.
ACT  Chapter 114 of the Code of the Town of Babylon.
ACTIONS  Include:
A. This chapter is adopted pursuant to the Municipal Home Rule Law, the
State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA) and the NYCRR Part
617 State Environmental Quality Review Regulations.
B. In adopting the Town of Babylon Environmental Quality Review Act
(TOBEQRA), it is the Town Board of the Town of Babylon's intention that
all agencies conduct their affairs with an awareness that they are
stewards of the air, water, land and living resources and that they have
an obligation to protect the environment for the use and enjoyment of
this and all future generations.
C. The basic purpose of TOBEQRA is to incorporate the consideration of
environmental factors into the existing planning, review and decisionmaking
processes of state, regional and local government agencies at
the earliest possible time. To accomplish this goal, TOBEQRA requires
that all agencies determine whether the actions they directly
undertake, fund or approve may have a significant impact on the
environment and, if it is determined that the action may have a
significant adverse environmental impact, prepare or request an
environmental impact statement.
D. It is the intention of the Town Board of the Town of Babylon that the
protection and enhancement of the environment, human and
community resources should be given appropriate weight with social
and economic considerations in determining public policy, and that
those factors be considered together in reaching decisions on proposed
activities. Accordingly, it is the intention of this chapter that a suitable
balance of social, economic and environmental factors be incorporated
into the planning and decision-making processes of the Town of
Babylon. However, it is not the intention of the TOBEQRA that
environmental factors be the sole consideration in decision-making.
Projects or physical activities, such as construction or other activities
that may affect the environment by changing the use, appearance or
condition of any natural resource or structure, that:
(1) Are directly undertaken by an agency; or

COMMISSIONER  The Commissioner of the New York State Department
of Environmental Conservation.
CONDITIONED NEGATIVE DECLARATION (CND)  A negative declaration
issued by a lead agency for an unlisted action, involving an applicant, in
which the action as initially proposed may result in one or more significant
adverse environmental impacts; however, mitigation measures identified
and required by the lead agency, pursuant to the procedures in § 114-7D of
this chapter, will modify the proposed action so that no significant adverse
environmental impacts will result.

include but are not limited to capital projects, promulgation of agency
rules, regulations, laws, codes, ordinances or executive orders and policymaking
that commit an agency to a course of action that may affect the
environment.
(2) Involve funding by an agency; or
Require one or more new or modified approvals from an agency or
agencies;
(3)
Agency planning and policy-making activities that may affect the

§ 114-2 BABYLON CODE § 114-2
108:348
ENVIRONMENT  The physical conditions that will be affected by a
proposed action, including land, air, water, minerals, flora, fauna, noise,
resources of agricultural, archeological, historic or aesthetic significance,
existing patterns of population concentration, distribution or growth,
existing community or neighborhood character, and human health.
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT FORM (EAF)  A form used by an
agency to assist it in determining the environmental significance or
nonsignificance of actions. A properly completed EAF must contain enough
information to describe the proposed action, its location, its purpose and its
potential impacts on the environment.
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT  A written draft or final
document prepared in accordance with §§ 114-9 and 114-10 of this chapter.
An EIS provides a means for agencies, project sponsors and the public
to systematically consider significant adverse environmental impacts,
alternatives and mitigation. An EIS facilitates the weighing of social,
economic and environmental factors early in the planning and decisionmaking
process. A draft EIS is the initial statement prepared by either the
project sponsor or the lead agency and circulated for review and comment.
An EIS may also be a generic EIS in accordance with § 114-10 of this

the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation published
pursuant to Section 3-0306 of the Environmental Conservation Law and
accessible on the New York State Department of Environmental
Conservation's Internet web site at http://www.dec.state.ny.us.
FINDINGS STATEMENT  A written statement prepared by each involved
agency, in accordance with § 114-11 of this chapter, after a final EIS has
been filed, that considers the relevant environmental impacts presented in
an EIS, weighs and balances them with social, economic and other essential
considerations, provides a rationale for the agency's decision and certifies
that the TOBEQRA requirements have been met.
FUNDING  Any financial support given by an agency, including contracts,
grants, subsidies, loans or other forms of direct or indirect financial
assistance, in connection with a proposed action.
IMPACT  To change or have an effect on any aspect(s) of the environment.
INTERESTED AGENCY(S)  An agency that lacks the jurisdiction to fund,
approve or directly undertake an action but wishes to participate in the
review process because of its specific expertise or concern about the
proposed action. An interested agency has the same ability to participate in
the review process as a member of the public.
INTERESTED ORGANIZATION  A private group such as a local civic
organization that has demonstrated, or is anticipated to, have an interest in
an action.
§ 114-2 DREDGING § 114-2
108:349
INVOLVED AGENCY(S)  An agency that has jurisdiction by law to fund,
approve or directly undertake an action. If an agency will ultimately make a
discretionary decision to fund, approve or undertake an action, then it is an
involved agency, notwithstanding that it has not received an application for
funding or approval at the time the TOBEQRA process is commenced. The
lead agency is also an involved agency.
LEAD AGENCY  An involved agency principally responsible for
undertaking, funding or approving an action, and therefore responsible
for determining whether an environmental impact statement is required
in connection with the action, and for the preparation and filing of the
statement if one is required.
LOCAL AGENCY  Any local agency, board, authority, district, commission
or governing body, including any city, county and other political subdivision
of the state. Includes any agency of the Town of Babylon.
MINISTERIAL ACT  An action performed upon a given state of facts in a
prescribed manner imposed by law without the exercise of any judgment or
discretion as to the propriety of the act, such as the granting of a hunting
or fishing license.
MITIGATION  A way to avoid or minimize adverse environmental impacts.
NEGATIVE DECLARATION  A written determination by a lead agency
that the implementation of the action as proposed will not result in any
significant adverse environmental impacts. A negative declaration may also
be a conditioned negative declaration as defined in § 114-2 of this chapter.
Negative declarations must be prepared, filed and published in accordance
with §§ 114-7 and 114-12 of this chapter.
PERMIT  A permit, lease, license, certificate or other entitlement for use
or permission to act that may be granted or issued by an agency.
PERSON  Any agency, individual, corporation, governmental entity,
partnership, association, trustee or other legal entity.
PHYSICAL ALTERATION  Includes, but is not limited to, the following
activities: vegetation removal, demolition, stockpiling materials, grading
and other forms of earthwork, dumping, filling or depositing, discharges to
air or water, excavation or trenching, application of pesticides, herbicides,
or other chemicals, application of sewage sludge, dredging, flooding,
draining or dewatering, paving, construction of buildings, structures or
facilities, and extraction, injection or recharge of resources below ground.
POSITIVE DECLARATION  A written statement prepared by the lead
agency indicating that implementation of the action as proposed may have
a significant adverse impact on the environment and that an environmental
impact statement will be required. Positive declarations must be prepared,
filed and published in accordance with §§ 114-7 and 114-12 of this chapter.
PROJECT SPONSOR  Any applicant or agency primarily responsible for
undertaking an action.
§ 114-2 BABYLON CODE § 114-2
108:350
RESIDENTIAL  Any facility used for permanent or seasonal habitation,
including but not limited to realty subdivisions, apartments, mobile home
parks, and campsites offering any utility hookups for recreational vehicles.
It does not include such facilities as hotels, hospitals, nursing homes,
dormitories or prisons.
SCOPING  The process by which the lead agency identifies the potentially
significant adverse impacts related to the proposed action that are to be
addressed in the draft EIS, including the content and level of detail of the
analysis, the range of alternatives, the mitigation measures needed and the
identification of nonrelevant issues. Scoping provides a project sponsor with
guidance on matters which must be considered and provides an opportunity
for early participation by involved agencies and the public in the review of
the proposal.
SEGMENTATION  The division of the environmental review of an action
such that various activities or stages are addressed under this chapter
as though they were independent, unrelated activities, needing individual
determinations of significance.
STATE AGENCY  Any state department, agency, board, public benefit
corporation, public authority or commission.
TYPE I ACTION  An action or class of actions identified in § 114-4 of this
chapter, or in any involved agency's procedures adopted in accordance with
§ 114-14 of this chapter.
TYPE II ACTION  An action or class of actions identified in § 114-5 of this
chapter. When the term is applied in reference to an individual agency's
authority to review or approve a particular proposed project or action, it
shall also mean an action or class of actions identified as Type II actions
in that agency's own procedures to implement State Environmental Quality
Review (SEQR) adopted pursuant to Section 617.14 of Part 617 SEQR.
The fact that an action is identified as a Type II action in any agency's
procedures does not mean that it must be treated as a Type II action by any
other involved agency not identifying it as a Type II action in its procedures.
UNLISTED ACTION  All actions not identified as a Type I or Type II action
in this chapter or, in the case of a particular agency action, not identified as
a Type I or Type II action in the agency's own SEQR procedures.
§ 114-3. General rules.
A. No agency involved in an action may undertake, fund or approve the
action until it has complied with the provisions of TOBEQRA. A project
sponsor may not commence any physical alteration related to an action
until the provisions of TOBEQRA have been complied with. The only
exception to this is provided under § 114-5C(18), (21) and (28) of this
chapter. An involved agency may not issue its findings and decision on
an action if it knows any other involved agency has determined that the
action may have a significant adverse impact on the environment and
until a final EIS has been filed. The only exception to this is provided
under § 114-9A(5)(a) of this chapter.
§ 114-2 DREDGING § 114-3
108:351
B. TOBEQRA does not change the existing jurisdiction of agencies nor the
jurisdiction between or among state and local agencies. TOBEQRA
provides all involved agencies with the authority, following the filing of
a final EIS and written findings statement, or pursuant to § 114-7D of
this chapter to impose substantive conditions upon an action to ensure
that the requirements of this chapter have been satisfied. The
conditions imposed must be practicable and reasonably related to
impacts identified in the EIS or the conditioned negative declaration.
C. An application for agency funding or approval of a Type I or unlisted
action will not be complete until:
(1) A negative declaration has been issued; or
(2) Until a draft EIS has been accepted by the lead agency as
satisfactory with respect to scope, content and adequacy. When the
draft EIS is accepted, the TOBEQRA process will run concurrently
with other procedures relating to the review and approval of the
action, if reasonable time is provided for preparation, review and
public hearings with respect to the draft EIS.
D. The lead agency will make every reasonable effort to involve project
sponsors, other agencies and the public in the TOBEQRA process. Early
consultations initiated by agencies can serve to narrow issues of
significance and to identify areas of controversy relating to
environmental issues, thereby focusing on the impacts and alternatives
requiring in-depth analysis in an EIS.
E. Each agency involved in a proposed action has the responsibility to
provide the lead agency with information it may have that may assist
the lead agency in making its determination of significance, to identify
potentially significant adverse impacts in the scoping process, to
comment in a timely manner on the EIS if it has concerns which need to
be addressed and to participate, as may be needed, in any public
hearing. Interested agencies are strongly encouraged to make known
their views on the action, particularly with respect to their areas of
expertise and jurisdiction.
F. No TOBEQRA determination of significance, EIS or findings statement
is required for actions which are Type II.
G. Actions commonly consist of a set of activities or steps. The entire set of
activities or steps must be considered the action, whether the agency
decision-making relates to the action as a whole or to only a part of it.
(1) Considering only a part or segment of an action is contrary to the
intent of TOBEQRA. If a lead agency believes that circumstances
warrant a segmented review, it must clearly state in its
determination of significance, and any subsequent EIS, the
supporting reasons for this course of action and must demonstrate
that such review is clearly no less protective of the environment.
§ 114-3 BABYLON CODE § 114-3
108:352
§ 114-4. Type I actions.
Related actions should be identified and discussed to the fullest
extent possible.
(2) If it is determined that an EIS is necessary for an action consisting
of a set of activities or steps, only one draft and one final EIS need
be prepared on the action, provided that the statement addresses
each part of the action at a level of detail sufficient for an adequate
analysis of the significant adverse environmental impacts. Except
for a supplement to a generic environmental impact statement (see
§ 114-10D of this chapter), a supplement to a draft or final EIS will
only be required in the circumstances prescribed in § 114-9A(7) of
this chapter.
H. Agencies must carry out the terms and requirements of this chapter
with minimum procedural and administrative delay, must avoid
unnecessary duplication of reporting and review requirements by
providing, where feasible, for combined or consolidated proceedings,
and must expedite all TOBEQRA proceedings in the interest of prompt
review.
I. Time periods in this chapter may be extended by mutual agreement
between a project sponsor and the lead agency, with notice to all other
involved agencies by the lead agency.
A. The purpose of the list of Type I actions in this section is to identify, for
agencies, project sponsors and the public, those actions and projects
that are more likely to require the preparation of an EIS than unlisted
actions. All agencies are subject to this Type I list.
(1) This Type I list is not exhaustive of those actions that an agency
determines may have a significant adverse impact on the
environment and that requires the preparation of an EIS. However,
the fact that an action or project has been listed as a Type I action
carries with it the presumption that it is likely to have a significant
adverse impact on the environment and may require an EIS. For all
individual actions which are Type I or unlisted, the determination
of significance must be made by comparing the impacts which may
be reasonably expected to result from the proposed action with the
criteria listed in § 114-7C of this chapter.
(2) Agencies may adopt their own lists of additional Type I actions, may
adjust the thresholds to make them more inclusive, and may
continue to use previously adopted lists of Type I actions to
complement those contained in Section 617.4, (a) (2) (b), 6 NYCRR,
Part 617, State Environmental Quality Review (SEQR) or
amendment thereof. Designation of a Type I action by one involved
agency requires coordinated review by all involved agencies. An
agency may not designate as Type I any action identified as Type II
§ 114-3 DREDGING § 114-4
108:353
in Section 617.5 of 6 NYCRR, Part 617, SEQR or amendment
thereof.
B. The following actions are Type I if they are to be directly undertaken,
funded or approved by an agency:
(1) The adoption of a municipality's land use plan, the adoption by any
agency of a comprehensive resource management plan or the
initial adoption of a municipality's comprehensive zoning
regulations;
(2) The adoption of changes in the allowable uses within any zoning
district, affecting 25 or more acres of the district;
(3) The granting of a zoning change, at the request of an applicant, for
an action that meets or exceeds one or more of the thresholds given
elsewhere in this list;
(4) The acquisition, sale, lease, annexation or other transfer of 100 or
more contiguous acres of land by a state or local agency;
(5) Construction of new residential units that meet or exceed the
following thresholds:
(a) Fifty or more units not to be connected (at the commencement
of habitation) to existing community or public water and
sewerage systems, including sewage treatment works;
(b) One hundred or more units to be connected (at the
commencement of habitation) to existing community or public
water and sewerage systems, including sewage treatment
works;
(6) Activities, other than the construction of residential facilities, that
meet or exceed any of the following thresholds; or the expansion of
existing nonresidential facilities by more than 50 percent of any of
the following thresholds:
(a) A project or action that involves the physical alteration of 10
acres or greater;
(b) A project or action that would use groundwater or surface
water in excess of 2,000,000 gallons per day;
(c) Parking for 1,000 vehicles;
(d) A facility with 240,000 or more square feet of gross floor area;
(7) Any unlisted action (unless the action is designed for the
preservation of the facility or site), occurring wholly or partially
within, or substantially contiguous to, any historic building,
structure, facility, site or district or prehistoric site that is listed on
the National Register of Historic Places, or that has been proposed
by the New York State Board on Historic Preservation for a

108:354
§ 114-5. Type II actions.
recommendation to the State Historic Preservation Officer for
nomination for inclusion in the National Register, or that is listed
on the State Register of Historic Places [The National Register of
Historic Places is established by 36 Code of Federal Regulation
(CFR) Parts 60 and 63, 1994 (see Section 617.17, of Part 617 State
Environmental Quality Review)];
(8) Any unlisted action, that exceeds 25% of any threshold in this
section, occurring wholly or partially within or substantially
contiguous to any publicly owned or operated parkland, recreation
area or designated open space, including any site on the Register of
National Natural Landmarks pursuant to 36 CFR Part 62, 1994 (see
Section 617.17 of Part 617, State Environmental Quality Review);
or
(9) Any unlisted action that exceeds a Type I threshold established by
an involved agency pursuant to Section 617.14 of 6 NYCRR, Part
617 State Environmental Quality Review.
A. Actions or classes of actions identified in § 114-5C of this chapter are
not subject to review under this chapter. These actions have been

otherwise precluded from environmental review under the
Environmental Conservation Law, Article 8. The actions identified in
§ 114-5C of this chapter apply to all agencies of the Town of Babylon.
B. Each agency may adopt its own list of Type II actions to supplement the
actions in § 114-5C of this chapter. No agency is bound by an action on
another agency's Type II list. An agency that identifies an action as not
requiring any determination or procedure under § 114-5C of this
chapter is not an involved agency. Each of the actions on an agency
Type II list must:
(1) In no case, have a significant adverse impact on the environment
based on the criteria contained in § 114-7C of this chapter; and
(2) Not be a Type I action as defined in § 114-4 of this chapter.
C. The following actions are not subject to review under this chapter:
(1) Maintenance or repair involving no substantial changes in an
existing structure or facility;
(2) Replacement, rehabilitation or reconstruction of a structure or
facility, in kind, on the same site, including upgrading buildings to
meet building or fire codes, unless such action meets or exceeds
any of the thresholds in § 114-4 of this chapter;

and temporary basis for the protection or preservation of life,
health, property or natural resources, provided that such actions
are directly related to the emergency and are performed to cause
the least change or disturbance, practicable under the
circumstances, to the environment. Any decision to fund, approve
or directly undertake other activities after the emergency has
expired is fully subject to the review procedures of this chapter;
(34) Actions undertaken, funded or approved prior to the effective dates
set forth in SEQR (see chapters 228 of the Laws of 1976, 253 of the
Laws of 1977 and 460 of the Laws of 1978), except in the case of an
action where it is still practicable either to modify the action in
such a way as to mitigate potentially adverse environmental
impacts, or to choose a feasible or less environmentally damaging
alternative, the Commissioner may, at the request of any person, or
on his own motion, require the preparation of an environmental
impact statement; or, in the case of an action where the responsible
agency proposed a modification of the action and the modification
may result in a significant adverse impact on the environment, an
environmental impact statement must be prepared with respect to
such modification;
(35) Actions requiring a certificate of environmental compatibility and
public need under articles VII, VIII or X of the Public Service Law
and the consideration of, granting or denial of any such certificate;
(36) Actions of the Legislature and the Governor of the State of New
York or of any court, but not actions of local legislative bodies,
except those local legislative decisions such as rezoning where the
local legislative body determines the action will not be entertained.
A. Initial review of actions.
§ 114-5 BABYLON CODE § 114-6
108:358
(1) As early as possible in an agency's formulation of an action it
proposes to undertake, or as soon as an agency receives an
application for funding or for approval of an action, it must do the
following:
(a) Determine whether the action is subject to TOBEQRA. If the
action is a Type II action, the agency has no further
responsibilities under this chapter.
(b) Determine whether the action involves a federal agency. If the
action involves a federal agency, then the provisions of
§ 114-15 of this chapter apply.
(c) Determine whether the action may involve one or more other
agencies.
(d) Make a preliminary classification of an action as Type I or
unlisted, using the information available and comparing it with
the thresholds set forth in §§ 114-4 and 114-5 of this chapter.
Such preliminary classification will assist in determining
whether a full EAF and coordinated review is necessary.
(2) For Type I actions, a full EAF must be used to determine the
significance of such actions. The project sponsor must complete
and sign and date Part 1 of the full EAF, including a list of all other
involved agencies that the project sponsor has been able to identify,
exercising all due diligence. The lead agency is responsible for
preparing Part 2 and, as needed, Part 3.
(3) For unlisted actions, the short EAF must be used to determine the
significance of such actions. However, an agency may instead use
the full EAF for unlisted actions if the short EAF would not provide
the lead agency with sufficient information on which to base its
determination of significance. The lead agency may require other
information necessary to determine significance.
(4) An agency may waive the requirement for an EAF if a draft EIS is
prepared or submitted. The draft EIS may be treated as an EAF for
the purpose of determining significance.
B. Establishing lead agency.
(1) When a single agency is involved, that agency will be the lead
agency when it proposes to undertake, fund or approve a Type I or
unlisted action that does not involve another agency.
(a) If the agency is directly undertaking the action, it must
determine the significance of the action as early as possible in
the design or formulation of the action.
(b) If the agency has received an application for funding or
approval of the action, it must determine the significance of the
action within 20 calendar days of its receipt of the application,
§ 114-6 DREDGING § 114-6
108:359
an EAF, or any additional information reasonably necessary to
make that determination, whichever is later.
(2) When more than one agency is involved:
(a) For all Type I actions and for coordinated review of unlisted
actions involving more than one agency, a lead agency must be
established prior to a determination of significance. For
unlisted actions where there will be no coordinated review, the
procedures § 114-6B(4) of this chapter must be followed.
(b) When an agency has been established as the lead agency for an
action involving an applicant and has determined that an EIS is
required, it must, in accordance with § 114-12B of this chapter,
promptly notify the applicant and all other involved agencies,
in writing, that it is the lead agency, that an EIS is required and
whether scoping will be conducted.
(c) The lead agency will continue in that role until it files either a
negative declaration or a findings statement or a lead agency is
reestablished in accordance with § 114-6B(6) of this chapter.
(3) Coordinated review.
(a) When an agency proposes to directly undertake, fund or
approve a Type I action or an unlisted action undergoing
coordinated review with other involved agencies, it must, as
soon as possible, transmit Part 1 of the EAF completed by the
project sponsor, or a draft EIS and a copy of any application it
has received to all involved agencies and notify them that a
lead agency must be agreed upon within 30 calendar days of
the date the EAF or draft EIS was transmitted to them. For the
purposes of this chapter, and unless otherwise specified by the
New York State Department of Environmental Conservation,
all coordination and filings with the New York State
Department of Environmental Conservation as an involved
agency must be with the appropriate regional office of the New
York State Department of Environmental Conservation.
(b) The lead agency must determine the significance of the action
within 20 calendar days of its establishment as lead agency, or
within 20 calendar days of its receipt of all information it may
reasonably need to make the determination of significance,
whichever occurs later, and must immediately prepare, file and
publish the determination in accordance with § 114-12 of this
chapter.
(c) If a lead agency exercises due diligence in identifying all other
involved agencies and provides written notice of its
determination of significance to the identified involved
agencies, then no involved agency may later require the
preparation of an EAF, a negative declaration or an EIS in
§ 114-6 BABYLON CODE § 114-6
108:360
connection with the action. The determination of significance
issued by the lead agency following coordinated review is
binding on all other involved agencies.
(4) Uncoordinated review for unlisted actions involving more than one
agency.
(a) An agency conducting an uncoordinated review may proceed
as if it were the only involved agency pursuant to § 114-6A of
this chapter unless and until it determines that an action may
have a significant adverse impact on the environment.
(b) If an agency determines that the action may have a significant
adverse impact on the environment, it must then coordinate
with other involved agencies.
(c) At any time prior to its final decision, an agency may have its
negative declaration superseded by a positive declaration by
any other involved agency.
(5) Actions for which a lead agency cannot be agreed upon.
(a) If, within the 30 calendar days allotted for establishment of
lead agency, the involved agencies are unable to agree upon
which agency will be the lead agency, any involved agency or
the project sponsor may request, by certified mail or other
form of receipted delivery to the Commissioner of the New
York State Department of Environmental Conservation, that a
lead agency be designated. Simultaneously, copies of the
request must be sent by certified mail or other form of
receipted delivery to all involved agencies and the project
sponsor. Any agency raising a dispute must be ready to assume
the lead agency functions if such agency is designated by the
Commissioner of the New York State Department of
Environmental Conservation.
(b) The request must identify each involved agency's jurisdiction
over the action, and all relevant information necessary for the
Commissioner of the New York State Department of
Environmental Conservation to apply the criteria in
§ 114-6B(5)(e) of this chapter, and state that all comments
must be submitted to the Commissioner of the New York State
Department of Environmental Conservation within 10 calendar
days after receipt of the request.
(c) Within 10 calendar days of the date a copy of the request is
received by them, involved agencies and the project sponsor
may submit to the Commissioner of the New York State
Department of Environmental Conservation any comments
they may have on the action. Such comments must contain the
information indicated in § 114-6B(5)(b) of this chapter.
§ 114-6 DREDGING § 114-6
108:361
§ 114-7. Determination of significance of action.
(d) The Commissioner of the New York State Department of
Environmental Conservation must designate a lead agency
within 20 calendar days of the date of the request or any
supplemental information the Commissioner has required is
received, based on a review of the facts, the criteria below, and
any comments received.
(e) The Commissioner of the New York State Department of
Environmental Conservation will use the following criteria, in
order of importance, to designate lead agency:
[1] Whether the anticipated impacts of the action being
considered are primarily of statewide, regional, or local
significance (i.e., if such impacts are of primarily local
significance, all other considerations being equal, the local
agency involved will be lead agency);
[2] Which agency has the broadest governmental powers for
investigation of the impact(s) of the proposed action; and
[3] Which agency has the greatest capability for providing the
most thorough environmental assessment of the proposed
action.
[4] Notice of the Commissioner of the New York State
Department of Environmental Conservation's designation
of lead agency will be mailed to all involved agencies and
the project sponsor.
(6) Reestablishment of lead agency.
(a) Reestablishment of lead agency may occur by agreement of all
involved agencies in the following circumstances:
[1] For a supplement to a final EIS or generic EIS;
[2] Upon failure of the lead agency's basis of jurisdiction; or
[3] Upon agreement of the project sponsor, prior to the
acceptance of a draft EIS.
(b) Disputes concerning reestablishment of lead agency for a
supplement to a final EIS or generic EIS are subject to the
designation procedures contained in § 114-6 B(5) of this
chapter.
(c) Notice of reestablishment of lead agency must be given by the
new lead agency to the project sponsor within 10 days of its
establishment.
§ 114-6 BABYLON CODE § 114-7
108:362
A. The lead agency must determine the significance of any Type I or
unlisted action in writing in accordance with this section.
(1) To require an EIS for a proposed action, the lead agency must
determine that the action may include the potential for at least one
significant adverse environmental impact.
(2) To determine that an EIS will not be required for an action, the lead
agency must determine either that there will be no adverse
environmental impacts or that the identified adverse environmental
impacts will not be significant.
B. For all Type I and unlisted actions the lead agency making a
determination of significance must:
(1) Consider the action as defined in §§ 114-2 and 114-3G of this
chapter;
(2) Review the EAF, the criteria contained in § 114-7C of this chapter
and any other supporting information to identify the relevant areas
of environmental concern;
(3) Thoroughly analyze the identified relevant areas of environmental
concern to determine if the action may have a significant adverse
impact on the environment; and
(4) Set forth its determination of significance in a written form
containing a reasoned elaboration and providing reference to any
supporting documentation.
C. Criteria for determining significance.
(1) To determine whether a proposed Type I or unlisted action may
have a significant adverse impact on the environment, the impacts
that may be reasonably expected to result from the proposed action
must be compared against the criteria in this section. The following
list is illustrative, not exhaustive. These criteria are considered
indicators of significant adverse impacts on the environment:
(a) A substantial adverse change in existing air quality,
groundwater or surface water quality or quantity, traffic or
noise levels; a substantial increase in solid waste production; a
substantial increase in potential for erosion, flooding, leaching
or drainage problems;
(b) The removal or destruction of large quantities of vegetation or
fauna; substantial interference with the movement of any
resident or migratory fish or wildlife species; impacts on a
significant habitat area; substantial adverse impacts on a
threatened or endangered species of animal or plant, or the
habitat of such a species; or other significant adverse impacts
to natural resources;
§ 114-7 DREDGING § 114-7
108:363
(c) The impairment of the environmental characteristics of a
critical environmental area as designated pursuant to
§ 114-14G of this chapter;
(d) The creation of a material conflict with a community's current
plans or goals as officially approved or adopted;
(e) The impairment of the character or quality of important
historical, archeological, architectural, or aesthetic resources
or of existing community or neighborhood character;
(f) A major change in the use of either the quantity or type of
energy;
(g) The creation of a hazard to human health;
(h) A substantial change in the use, or intensity of use, of land,
including agricultural, open space or recreational resources,
or in its capacity to support existing uses;
(i) The encouraging or attracting of a large number of people to a
place or places for more than a few days, compared to the
number of people who would come to such place absent the
action;
(j) The creation of a material demand for other actions that would
result in one of the above consequences;
(k) Changes in two or more elements of the environment, no one of
which has a significant impact on the environment, but when
considered together result in a substantial adverse impact on
the environment; or
(2) Two or more related actions undertaken, funded or approved by an
agency, none of which has or would have a significant impact on the
environment, but when considered cumulatively would meet one or
more of the criteria in this section.
(3) For the purpose of determining whether an action may cause one of
the consequences listed in § 114-7C of this chapter, the lead agency
must consider reasonably related long-term, short-term, direct,
indirect and cumulative impacts, including other simultaneous or
subsequent actions which are:
(a) Included in any long-range plan of which the action under
consideration is a part;
(b) Likely to be undertaken as a result thereof; or
(c) Dependent thereon.
(4) The significance of a likely consequence (i.e., whether it is material,
substantial, large or important) should be assessed in connection
with:
§ 114-7 BABYLON CODE § 114-7
108:364
(a) Its setting (e.g., urban or rural);
(b) Its probability of occurrence;
(c) Its duration;
(d) Its irreversibility;
(e) Its geographic scope;
(f) Its magnitude; and
(g) The number of people affected.
D. Conditioned negative declarations.
(1) For unlisted actions involving an applicant, a lead agency may
prepare a conditioned negative declaration (CND) provided that it:
(a) Has completed a full EAF;
(b) Has completed a coordinated review in accordance with
§ 114-6B(3) of this chapter;
(c) Has imposed SEQR conditions pursuant to § 114-3B of this
chapter that have mitigated all significant environmental
impacts and are supported by the full EAF and any other
documentation;
(d) Has published a notice of a CND in the ENB and a minimum
thirty-day public comment period has been provided. The
notice must state what conditions have been imposed. An
agency may also use its own public notice and review
procedures, provided the notice states that a CND has been
issued, states what conditions have been imposed and allows
for a minimum thirty-day public comment period; and
(e) Has complied with §§ 114-7B and 114-12A and B of this
chapter.
(2) A lead agency must rescind the CND and issue a positive
declaration requiring the preparation of a draft EIS if it receives
substantive comments that identify:
(a) Potentially significant adverse environmental impacts that
were not previously identified and assessed or were
inadequately assessed in the review; or
(b) A substantial deficiency in the proposed mitigation measures.
(3) The lead agency must require an EIS if requested by the applicant.
E. Amendment of a negative declaration.
§ 114-7 DREDGING § 114-7
108:365
§ 114-8. Scoping.
(1) At any time prior to its decision to undertake, fund or approve an
action, a lead agency, at its discretion, may amend a negative
declaration when substantive:
(a) Changes are proposed for the project; or
(b) New information is discovered; or
(c) Changes in circumstances related to the project arise that
were not previously considered and the lead agency
determines that no significant adverse environmental impacts
will occur.
(2) The lead agency must prepare, file and publish the amended
negative declaration in accordance with § 114-12 of this chapter.
The amended negative declaration must contain reference to the
original negative declaration and discuss the reasons supporting
the amended determination.
F. Rescission of negative declarations.
(1) At any time prior to its decision to undertake, fund or approve an
action, a lead agency must rescind a negative declaration when
substantive:
(a) Changes are proposed for the project; or
(b) New information is discovered; or
(c) Changes in circumstances related to the project arise that
were not previously considered and the lead agency
determines that a significant adverse environmental impact
may result.
(2) Prior to any rescission, the lead agency must inform other involved
agencies and the project sponsor and must provide a reasonable
opportunity for the project sponsor to respond.
(3) If, following reasonable notice to the project sponsor, its
determination is the same, the lead agency must prepare, file and
publish a positive declaration in accordance with § 114-12 of this
chapter.
A. The primary goals of scoping are to focus the EIS on potentially
significant adverse impacts and to eliminate consideration of those
impacts that are irrelevant or nonsignificant. Scoping is not required.
Scoping may be initiated by the lead agency or the project sponsor.
B. If scoping is conducted, the project sponsor must submit a draft scope
that contains the items identified in § 114-8F(1) through (5) of this
chapter to the lead agency. The lead agency must provide a copy of the
§ 114-7 BABYLON CODE § 114-8
108:366
draft scope to all involved agencies, and make it available to any
individual or interested agency that has expressed an interest in writing
to the lead agency.
C. If scoping is not conducted, the project sponsor may prepare a draft EIS
for submission to the lead agency.
D. Involved agencies should provide written comments reflecting their
concerns, jurisdictions and information needs sufficient to ensure that
the EIS will be adequate to support their TOBEQRA findings. Failure of
an involved agency to participate in the scoping process will not delay
completion of the final written scope.
E. Scoping must include an opportunity for public participation. The lead
agency may either provide a period of time for the public to review and
provide written comments on a draft scope or provide for public input
through the use of meetings, exchanges of written material, or other
means.
F. The lead agency must provide a final written scope to the project
sponsor, all involved agencies and any individual that has expressed an
interest in writing to the lead agency within 60 days of its receipt of a
draft scope. The final written scope should include:
(1) A brief description of the proposed action;
(2) The potentially significant adverse impacts identified both in the
positive declaration and as a result of consultation with the other
involved agencies and the public, including an identification of
those particular aspect(s) of the environmental setting that may be
impacted;
(3) The extent and quality of information needed for the preparer to
adequately address each impact, including an identification of
relevant existing information, and required new information,
including the required methodology(ies) for obtaining new
information;
(4) An initial identification of mitigation measures;
(5) The reasonable alternatives to be considered;
(6) An identification of the information/data that should be included in
an appendix rather than the body of the draft EIS; and
(7) Those prominent issues that were raised during scoping and
determined to be not relevant or not environmentally significant or
that have been adequately addressed in a prior environmental
review.
G. All relevant issues should be raised before the issuance of a final
written scope. Any agency or person raising issues after that time must
§ 114-8 DREDGING § 114-8
108:367
§ 114-9. Preparation and content of environmental impact
statements.
provide to the lead agency and project sponsor a written statement that
identifies:
(1) The nature of the information;
(2) The importance and relevance of the information to a potential
significant impact;
(3) The reason(s) why the information was not identified during
scoping and why it should be included at this stage of the review.
H. The project sponsor may incorporate information submitted consistent
with § 114-8G of this chapter at its discretion. Any substantive
information not incorporated into the draft EIS must be considered as
public comment on the draft EIS.
I. If the lead agency fails to provide a final written scope within 60
calendar days of its receipt of a draft scope, the project sponsor may
prepare and submit a draft EIS consistent with the submitted draft
scope.
A. Environmental impact statement procedures.
(1) The project sponsor or the lead agency, at the project sponsor's
option, will prepare the draft EIS. If the project sponsor does not
exercise the option to prepare the draft EIS, the lead agency will
prepare it, cause it to be prepared or terminate its review of the
action. A fee will be charged by the lead agency for the preparation
or review of an EIS pursuant to § 114-13 of this chapter. When the
project sponsor prepares the draft EIS, the document must be
submitted to the lead agency.
(2) The lead agency will use the final written scope, if any, and the
standards contained in this section to determine whether to accept
the draft EIS as adequate with respect to its scope and content for
the purpose of commencing public review. This determination must
be made in accordance with the standards in this section within 45
days of receipt of the draft EIS.
(a) If the draft EIS is determined to be inadequate, the lead agency
must identify in writing the deficiencies and provide this
information to the project sponsor.
(b) The lead agency must determine whether to accept the
resubmitted draft EIS within 30 days of its receipt.
(3) When the lead agency has completed a draft EIS or when it has
determined that a draft EIS prepared by a project sponsor is
adequate for public review, the lead agency must prepare, file and
publish a notice of completion of the draft EIS and file copies of the
§ 114-8 BABYLON CODE § 114-9
108:368
draft EIS in accordance with the requirements set forth in § 114-12
of this chapter. The minimum public comment period on the draft
EIS is 30 days. The comment period begins with the first filing and
circulation of the notice of completion.
(4) When the lead agency has completed a draft EIS or when it has
determined that a draft EIS prepared by a project sponsor is
adequate for public review, the lead agency will determine whether
or not to conduct a TOBEQRA public hearing concerning the action.
In determining whether or not to hold a TOBEQRA hearing, the
lead agency will consider the degree of interest in the action shown
by the public or involved agencies; whether substantive or
significant adverse environmental impacts have been identified;
the adequacy of the mitigation measures and alternatives
proposed; and the extent to which a public hearing can aid the
agency decision-making processes by providing a forum for, or an
efficient mechanism for the collection of, public comment. If a
hearing is to be held:
(a) The lead agency must prepare and file a notice of hearing in
accordance with § 114-12A and B of this chapter. Such notice
may be contained in the notice of completion of the draft EIS.
The notice of hearing must be published, at least 14 calendar
days in advance of the public hearing, in a newspaper of
general circulation in the area of the potential impacts of the
action. For state agency actions that apply statewide, this
requirement can be satisfied by publishing the hearing notice
in the environmental notice bulletin (ENB) and the State
Register;
(b) The hearing will commence no less than 15 calendar days or no
more than 60 calendar days after the filing of the notice of
completion of the draft EIS by the lead agency pursuant to
§ 114-12B of this chapter. When a SEQR hearing is to be held,
it should be conducted with other public hearings on the
proposed action, whenever practicable; and
(c) Comments will be received and considered by the lead agency
for no less than 30 calendar days from the first filing and
circulation of the notice of completion, or no less than 10
calendar days following a public hearing at which the
environmental impacts of the proposed action are considered,
whichever is later.
(5) Except as provided in § 114-9A(5)(a) of this chapter, the lead
agency must prepare or cause to be prepared and must file a final
EIS, within 45 calendar days after the close of any hearing or within
60 calendar days after the filing of the draft EIS, whichever occurs
later.
§ 114-9 DREDGING § 114-9
108:369
(a) No final EIS need be prepared if the proposed action has been
withdrawn or, on the basis of the draft EIS, and comments
made thereon, the lead agency has determined that the action
will not have a significant adverse impact on the environment.
A negative declaration must then be prepared, filed and
published in accordance with § 114-12 of this chapter.
(b) The last date for preparation and filing of the final EIS may be
extended if it is determined that additional time is necessary to
prepare the statement adequately; or if problems with the
proposed action requiring material reconsideration or
modification have been identified.
(6) When the lead agency has completed a final EIS, it must prepare,
file and publish a notice of completion of the final EIS and file
copies of the final EIS in accordance with § 114-12 of this chapter.
(7) Supplemental EISs.
(a) The lead agency may require a supplemental EIS, limited to the
specific significant adverse environmental impacts not
addressed or inadequately addressed in the EIS that arise
from:
[1] Changes proposed for the project; or
[2] Newly discovered information; or
[3] A change in circumstances related to the project.
(b) The decision to require preparation of a supplemental EIS, in
the case of newly discovered information, must be based upon
the following criteria:
[1] The importance and relevance of the information; and
[2] The present state of the information in the EIS.
(c) If a supplement is required, it will be subject to the full
environmental impact statement procedures and time frames
of this chapter.
B. Environmental impact statement content.
(1) An EIS must assemble relevant and material facts upon which an
agency's decision is to be made. It must analyze the significant
adverse impacts and evaluate all reasonable alternatives. EISs
must be analytical and not encyclopedic. The lead agency and other
involved agencies must cooperate with project sponsors who are
preparing EISs by making available to them information contained
in their files relevant to the EIS.
(2) EISs must be clearly and concisely written in plain language that
can be read and understood by the public. Within the framework
§ 114-9 BABYLON CODE § 114-9
108:370
presented in § 114-9B(5) of this chapter, EISs should address only
those potential significant adverse environmental impacts that can
be reasonably anticipated and/or have been identified in the
scoping process. EISs should not contain more detail than is
appropriate considering the nature and magnitude of the proposed
action and the significance of its potential impacts. Highly
technical material should be summarized and, if it must be included
in its entirety, should be referenced in the statement and included
in an appendix.
(3) All draft and final EISs must be preceded by a cover sheet stating:
(a) Whether it is a draft or final EIS;
(b) The name or descriptive title of the action including the Town
of Babylon Planning Board application number, if applicable;
(c) The location (county and town hamlet) and street address, if
applicable and Suffolk County tax map number of the action;
(d) The name and address of the lead agency and the name,
address and telephone number of a person at the agency who
can provide further information;
(e) The names of companies, individuals or organizations, address
and phone number that prepared any portion of the statement;
(f) The date of its acceptance by the lead agency; and
(g) In the case of a draft EIS, the date by which comments must be
submitted.
(4) A draft or final EIS must have a table of contents following the
cover sheet and a precise summary which adequately and
accurately summarizes the statement.
(5) The format of the draft EIS may be flexible; however, all draft EISs
must include the following elements:
(a) A concise description of the proposed action, its purpose,
public need and benefits, including social and economic
considerations;
(b) A concise description of the environmental setting of the areas
to be affected, sufficient to understand the impacts of the
proposed action and alternatives;
(c) A statement and evaluation of the potential significant adverse
environmental impacts at a level of detail that reflects the
severity of the impacts and the reasonable likelihood of their
occurrence. The draft EIS should identify and discuss the
following only where applicable and significant:
§ 114-9 DREDGING § 114-9
108:371
[1] Reasonably related short-term and long-term impacts,
cumulative impacts and other associated environmental
impacts;
[2] Those adverse environmental impacts that cannot be
avoided or adequately mitigated if the proposed action is
implemented;
[3] Any irreversible and irretrievable commitments of
environmental resources that would be associated with the
proposed action should it be implemented;
[4] Any growth-inducing aspects of the proposed action;
[5] Impacts of the proposed action on the use and
conservation of energy (for an electric generating facility,
the statement must include a demonstration that the
facility will satisfy electric generating capacity needs or
other electric systems needs in a manner reasonably
consistent with the most recent state energy plan);
[6] Impacts of the proposed action on solid waste
management and its consistency with the state or locally
adopted solid waste management plan;
[7] If the proposed action is in or involves resources in Nassau
or Suffolk Counties, impacts of the proposed action on, and
its consistency with, the comprehensive management plan
for the special groundwater protection area program as
implemented pursuant to Article 55 or any plan
subsequently ratified and adopted pursuant to Article 57 of
the Environmental Conservation Law for Nassau and
Suffolk counties;
(d) A description of the mitigation measures;
(e) A description and evaluation of the range of reasonable
alternatives to the action that are feasible, considering the
objectives and capabilities of the project sponsor. The
description and evaluation of each alternative should be at a
level of detail sufficient to permit a comparative assessment of
the alternatives discussed. The range of alternatives must
include the no-action alternative. The no-action alternative
discussion should evaluate the adverse or beneficial site
changes that are likely to occur in the reasonably foreseeable
future, in the absence of the proposed action. The range of
alternatives may also include, as appropriate, alternative:
[1] Sites;
[2] Technology;
[3] Scale or magnitude;
§ 114-9 BABYLON CODE § 114-9
108:372
[4] Design;
[5] Timing;
[6] Use; and
[7] Types of action. For private project sponsors, any
alternative for which no discretionary approvals are
needed may be described. Site alternatives may be limited
to parcels owned by, or under option to, a private project
sponsor;
(f) When the action is in an approved local waterfront
revitalization program area, with the local program policies;
(g) A list of any underlying studies, reports, EISs and other
information obtained and considered in preparing the
statement, including the final written scope.
(6) Additional information.
(a) In addition to the analysis of significant adverse impacts
required in § 114-9B(5)(c) of this chapter, if information about
reasonably foreseeable catastrophic impacts to the
environment is unavailable because the cost to obtain it is
exorbitant, or the means to obtain it are unknown, or there is
uncertainty about its validity, and such information is essential
to an agency's TOBEQRA findings, the EIS must:
[1] Identify the nature and relevance of unavailable or
uncertain information;
[2] Provide a summary of existing credible scientific evidence,
if available; and
[3] Assess the likelihood of occurrence, even if the probability
of occurrence is low, and the consequences of the potential
impact, using theoretical approaches or research methods
generally accepted in the scientific community.
(b) This analysis would likely occur in the review of such actions as
an oil supertanker port, a liquid propane gas/liquid natural gas
facility, or the siting of a hazardous waste treatment facility. It
does not apply in the review of such actions as shopping malls,
residential subdivisions or office facilities.
(7) A draft or final EIS may incorporate by reference all or portions of
other documents, including EISs that contain information relevant
to the statement. The referenced documents must be made
available for inspection by the public within the time period for
public comment in the same places where the agency makes
available copies of the EIS. When an EIS incorporates by reference,
§ 114-9 DREDGING § 114-9
108:373
§ 114-10. Generic environmental impact statements.
the referenced document must be briefly described, its applicable
findings summarized, and the date of its preparation provided.
(8) A final EIS must consist of the draft EIS, including any revisions or
supplements to it; copies or a summary of the substantive
comments received and their source (whether or not the comments
were received in the context of a hearing); and the lead agency's
responses to all substantive comments. The draft EIS may be
directly incorporated into the final EIS or may be incorporated by
reference. The lead agency is responsible for the adequacy and
accuracy of the final EIS, regardless of who prepares it. All
revisions and supplements to the draft EIS must be specifically
indicated and identified as such in the final EIS.
A. Generic EISs may be broader and more general than site or projectspecific
EISs and should discuss the logic and rationale for the choices
advanced. They may also include an assessment of specific impacts if
such details are available. They may be based on conceptual
information in some cases. They may identify the important elements of
the natural resource base as well as the existing and projected cultural
features, patterns and character. They may discuss in general terms the
constraints and consequences of any narrowing of future options. They
may present and analyze in general terms a few hypothetical scenarios
that could and are likely to occur. A generic EIS may be used to assess
the environmental impacts of:
(1) A number of separate actions in a given geographic area which, if
considered singly, may have minor impacts, but if considered
together may have significant impacts; or
(2) A sequence of actions contemplated by a single agency or
individual; or
(3) Separate actions having generic or common impacts; or
(4) An entire program or plan having wide application or restricting
the range of future alternative policies or projects, including new
or significant changes to existing land use plans, development
plans, zoning regulations or agency comprehensive resource
management plans.
B. In particular, agencies may prepare generic EISs on the adoption of a
comprehensive plan prepared in accordance with Subdivision 4, § 28-a
of the General City Law; Subdivision 4, § 272-a of the Town Law; or
Subdivision 4, § 7-722 of the Village Law and the implementing
regulations. Impacts of individual actions proposed to be carried out in
conformance with these adopted plans and regulations and the
thresholds or conditions identified in the generic EIS may require no or
§ 114-9 BABYLON CODE § 114-10
108:374
§ 114-11. Decision-making and findings requirements.
limited TOBEQRA review as described in § 114-10C and D of this
chapter.
C. Generic EISs and their findings should set forth specific conditions or
criteria under which future actions will be undertaken or approved,
including requirements for any subsequent TOBEQRA compliance. This
may include thresholds and criteria for supplemental EISs to reflect
specific significant impacts, such as site-specific impacts, that were not
adequately addressed or analyzed in the generic EIS.
D. When a final generic EIS has been filed under this chapter:
(1) No further TOBEQRA compliance is required if a subsequent
proposed action will be carried out in conformance with the
conditions and thresholds established for such actions in the
generic EIS or its findings statement;
(2) An amended findings statement must be prepared if the
subsequent proposed action was adequately addressed in the
generic EIS but was not addressed or was not adequately
addressed in the findings statement for the generic EIS;
(3) A negative declaration must be prepared if a subsequent proposed
action was not addressed or was not adequately addressed in the
generic EIS and the subsequent action will not result in any
significant environmental impacts;
(4) A supplement to the final generic EIS must be prepared if the
subsequent proposed action was not addressed or was not
adequately addressed in the generic EIS and the subsequent action
may have one or more significant adverse environmental impacts.
E. In connection with projects that are to be developed in phases or
stages, agencies should address not only the site-specific impacts of the
individual project under consideration, but also, in more general or
conceptual terms, the cumulative impacts on the environment and the
existing natural resource base of subsequent phases of a larger project
or series of projects that may be developed in the future. In these cases,
this part of the generic EIS must discuss the important elements and
constraints present in the natural and cultural environment that may
bear on the conditions of an agency decision on the immediate project.
A. Prior to the lead agency's decision on an action that has been the
subject of a final EIS, it shall afford agencies and the public a
reasonable time period (not less than 10 calendar days) in which to
consider the final EIS before issuing its written findings statement. If a
project modification or change of circumstance related to the project
requires a lead or involved agency to substantively modify its decision,
findings may be amended and filed in accordance with § 114-12B of this
chapter.
§ 114-10 DREDGING § 114-11
108:375
§ 114-12. Document preparation, filing, publication and
distribution.
The following TOBEQRA documents must be prepared, filed, published and
made available as prescribed in this section.
B. In the case of an action involving an applicant, the lead agency's filing
of a written findings statement and decision on whether or not to fund
or approve an action must be made within 30 calendar days after the
filing of the final EIS.
C. No involved agency may make a final decision to undertake, fund,
approve or disapprove an action that has been the subject of a final EIS,
until the time period provided in § 114-11A of this chapter has passed
and the agency has made a written findings statement. Findings and a
decision may be made simultaneously.
D. Findings must:
(1) Consider the relevant environmental impacts, facts and
conclusions disclosed in the final EIS;
(2) Weigh and balance relevant environmental impacts with social,
economic and other considerations;
(3) Provide a rationale for the agency's decision;
(4) Certify that the requirements of this chapter have been met;
(5) Certify that consistent with social, economic and other essential
considerations from among the reasonable alternatives available,
the action is one that avoids or minimizes adverse environmental
impacts to the maximum extent practicable, and that adverse
environmental impacts will be avoided or minimized to the
maximum extent practicable by incorporating as conditions to the
decision those mitigative measures that were identified as
practicable.
A. Preparation of documents.
(1) Each negative declaration, positive declaration, notice of
completion of an EIS, notice of hearing and findings must state that
it has been prepared in accordance with Article 8 of the
Environmental Conservation Law and must contain the name and
address of the lead agency; the name, address and telephone
number of a person who can provide additional information; a brief
description of the action; the SEQR classification; and the location
of the action.
(2) The draft EIS or draft GEIS shall be posted on a publicly available
Internet website upon acceptance by the lead agency. The project
sponsor shall be responsible for any costs (if any) associated with
the website posting. The website posting of the DEIS or GEIS shall
§ 114-11 BABYLON CODE § 114-12
108:376
occur prior to the lead agency acting on the proposal. The website
posting of the draft EIS or draft GEIS may be discontinued no less
than one year after all necessary permits have been issued by the
federal, state and local governments. The DEIS shall be available
free of charge on the publicly available Internet website. All printed
filings and public notices shall clearly indicate the address of the
website at which such filing is posted.
(3) In addition to the information contained in § 114-12A(1) of this
chapter:
(a) A negative declaration must meet the requirements of § 114-7B
of this chapter. A conditioned negative declaration must also
identify the specific conditions being imposed that have
eliminated or adequately mitigated all significant adverse
environmental impacts and the period, not less than 30
calendar days, during which comments will be accepted by the
lead agency.
(b) A positive declaration must identify the potential significant
adverse environmental impacts that require the preparation of
an EIS and state whether scoping will be conducted.
(c) A notice of completion must identify the type of EIS (draft,
final, supplemental, generic) and state where copies of the
document can be obtained. For a draft EIS the notice must
include the time period (not less than 30 calendar days from
the date of filing or not less than 10 calendar days following a
public hearing on the draft EIS) during which comments will be
accepted by the lead agency.
(d) A notice of hearing must include the time, date, place and
purpose of the hearing and contain a summary of the
information contained in the notice of completion. The notice
of hearing may be combined with the notice of completion of
the draft EIS.
(e) Findings must contain the information required by § 114-11D
of this chapter.
B. Filing and distribution of documents.
(1) A Type I negative declaration, conditioned negative declaration,
positive declaration, notice of completion of an EIS, EIS, notice of
hearing and findings must be filed with:
(a) The chief executive officer of the political subdivision in which
the action will be principally located;
(b) The lead agency;
(c) All involved agencies (see also § 114-6B(3) of this chapter);
§ 114-12 DREDGING § 114-12
108:377
§ 114-13. Fees and costs.
(d) Any person who has requested a copy; and
(e) If the action involves an applicant, with the applicant.
(2) A negative declaration prepared on an unlisted action must be filed
with the lead agency.
(3) All SEQR documents and notices, including but not limited to,
EAFs, negative declarations, positive declarations, scopes, notices
of completion of an EIS, EISs, notices of hearing and findings must
be maintained in files that are readily accessible to the public and
made available on request.
(4) The lead agency may charge a fee to persons requesting documents
to recover its copying costs.
(5) If sufficient copies of the EIS are not available to meet public
interest, the lead agency must provide an additional copy of the
documents to the local public library.
(6) A copy of the EIS must be sent to the Department of Environmental
Conservation, Division of Environmental Permits, 625 Broadway,
Albany, NY 12233-1750.
C. Publication of notices.
(1) Notice of a Type I negative declaration, conditioned negative
declaration, positive declaration and completion of an EIS must be
published in the Environmental Notice Bulletin (ENB) in a manner
prescribed by the New York State Department of Environmental
Conservation. Notice must be provided by the lead agency directly
to Environmental Notice Bulletin, 625 Broadway, Albany, NY
12233-1750 for publication in the ENB. The ENB is accessible on
the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation
Internet web site at http://www.dec.state.ny.us.
(2) A notice of hearing must be published, at least 14 days in advance
of the hearing date, in a newspaper of general circulation in the
area of the potential impacts of the action.
(3) Agencies may provide for additional public notice by posting on
sign boards or by other appropriate means.
(4) Notice of a negative declaration must be incorporated once into
any other subsequent notice required by law. This requirement can
be satisfied by indicating the SEQR classification of the action and
the agency's determination of significance.
A. When an action subject to this chapter involves an applicant, the lead
agency may charge a fee to the applicant in order to recover the actual
costs of preparing, causing to be prepared or reviewing the draft or
§ 114-12 BABYLON CODE § 114-13
108:378
final EIS. Scoping shall be considered part of the draft EIS fee. Such
costs shall not exceed the maximum amounts allowed pursuant to 6
NYCRR Part 617, Section 617.13, State Environmental Quality Review
(SEQR). An applicant may not be charged a separate fee for both the
preparation and review of a draft EIS.
B. When an applicant chooses not to prepare a draft EIS, the lead agency
shall provide the applicant, upon request, with an estimate of the costs
for preparing such statement calculated on the total cost of the project
for which funding or approval is sought.
C. Fee schedule for review of EISs.
(1) Residential projects. The fee schedule for review of EISs for
residential projects shall be as follows:
Fee Schedule for Residential Projects
Residential Projects Fee
Less than or equal to 1 acre and/or less than or
equal to 5 units
$250
Greater than 1 acre but less than or equal to 2
acres and/or greater than 5 units but fewer than or
equal to 15 units
$500
Greater than 2 acres but less than or equal to 3
acres and/or greater than 15 units but fewer than
or equal to 25 units
$750
Greater than 3 acres but less than or equal to 5
acres and/or greater than 25 units but fewer than
or equal to 45 units
$1,500
Greater than 5 acres but less than or equal to 10
acres and/or greater than 45 units but fewer than

or equal to 300 units
$5,000
Greater than 50 acres and/or 300 units $7,500
NOTE: In the event that the number of units exceeds the number
of acres or the number of acres exceeds the number of units, the
higher number shall be used to compute the fee. For calculating
the acreage, a full acre or 43,560 square feet shall be used.
(2) Industrial/commercial projects. The fee schedule for review of EISs
for industrial/commercial projects shall be as follows:
§ 114-13 DREDGING § 114-13
108:379
§ 114-14. Individual agency procedures to implement SEQR.
Fee Schedule for Industrial/Commercial Projects
Industrial/Commercial Projects Fee
Less than or equal to 1 acre and/or less than or
equal to 18,000 square feet of gross floor area
$500
Greater than 1 acre but less than or equal to 2
acres and/or greater than 18,000 square feet of
gross floor area but less than or equal to 34,000
square feet of gross floor area
$750
Greater than 2 acres but less than or equal to 3
acres and/or greater than 34,000 square feet of
gross floor area but less than or equal to 52,000
square feet of gross floor area
$1,000
Greater than 3 acres but less than or equal to 5
acres and/or greater than 52,000 square feet of
gross floor area
$1,500
Greater than 5 acres but less than or equal to 10
acres and/or greater than 92,000 square feet of
gross floor area but less than or equal to 200,000
square feet of gross floor area
$3,000
Greater than 10 acres and/or greater than 200,000
square feet of gross floor area
$7,500
NOTE: In the event that the gross floor area exceeds the number
of acres or the number of acres exceeds the gross floor area, the
higher number shall be used to compute the fee. For calculating
the acreage, an acre or 43,560 square feet shall be used.
D. Appeals procedure. When a dispute arises concerning fees charged to
an applicant by a lead agency, the applicant may make written request
to the lead agency setting forth reasons why it is felt that such fees are
inequitable. Upon receipt of a request, the chief fiscal officer of the
agency or his designee shall examine the agency record and prepare a
written response to the applicant setting forth reasons why the
applicant's claims are valid or invalid. Such appeal procedure shall not
interfere with or cause delay in the EIS process or prohibit an action
from being undertaken.
E. The technical services of the Department may be made available to
other agencies on a fee basis reflecting the costs thereof.
A. Article 8 of the Environmental Conservation Law requires all agencies
to adopt and publish, after a public hearing, any additional procedures
that may be necessary for them to implement SEQR. Until an agency
adopts these additional procedures, its implementation of SEQR will be
governed by the provisions of NYCRR Part 617 State Environmental
Quality Review (SEQR). If an agency rescinds its additional TOBEQRA
§ 114-13 BABYLON CODE § 114-14
108:380
procedures, it will continue to be governed by Part 617 SEQR. The
agency must promptly notify the Commissioner of the New York State
Department of Environmental Conservation, and the Commissioner
shall publish a notice in the Environmental Notice Bulletin (ENB), of the
adoption of additional procedures or the rescission of agency TOBEQRA
procedures.
B. To the greatest extent possible, the procedures prescribed in NYCRR
Part 617 State Environmental Quality Review (SEQR) must be
incorporated into existing agency procedures. An agency may by local
law, code, ordinance, executive order, resolution or regulation vary the
time periods established in Part 617 SEQR for the preparation and
review of TOBEQRA documents, and for the conduct of public hearings,
in order to coordinate the TOBEQRA environmental review process
with other procedures relating to the review and approval of actions.
Such time changes must not impose unreasonable delay. Individual
agency procedures to implement Part 617 SEQR must be no less
protective of environmental values, public participation and agency and
judicial review than the procedures contained in the most current
version of Part 617 SEQR. This includes any updates or changes to
these regulations by the New York State Department of Environmental
Conservation. Part 617 SEQR supersedes any TOBEQRA provisions
promulgated or enacted by an agency that are less protective of the
environment.
C. Agencies may find it helpful to seek the advice and assistance of other
agencies, groups and persons on TOBEQRA matters, including the
following:
(1) Advice on preparation and review of EAFs;
(2) Recommendations on the significance or nonsignificance of
actions;
(3) Preparation and review of EISs and recommendations on the scope,
adequacy, and contents of EISs;
(4) Preparation and filing of SEQR notices and documents;
(5) Conduct of public hearings; and
(6) Recommendations to decision makers.
D. Agencies are strongly encouraged to enter into cooperative agreements
with other agencies regularly involved in carrying out or approving the
same actions for the purposes of coordinating their procedures.
E. All agencies are subject to the lists of Type I and Type II actions
contained in §§ 114-4 and 114-5 of this chapter and must apply the
criteria provided in § 114-7C of this chapter for review of all potential
actions. In addition, agencies may adopt their own lists of Type I
actions, in accordance with Section 617.4 of Part 617, State
§ 114-14 DREDGING § 114-14
108:381
Environmental Quality Review (SEQR) and their own lists of Type II
actions in accordance with Section 617.5 of Part 617 SEQR.
F. Every agency that adopts, has adopted or amends TOBEQRA
procedures must, after public hearing, file them with the Commissioner
of the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, who
will maintain them to serve as a resource for agencies and interested
persons. The Commissioner of the New York State Department of
Environmental Conservation will provide notice in the ENB of such
procedures upon filing. All agencies that have promulgated their own
TOBEQRA procedures must review and bring them into conformance
with NYCRR Part 617 State Environmental Quality Review (SEQR).
Until agencies do so, their procedures, where inconsistent or less
protective, are superseded by Part 617, SEQR.
G. A local agency may designate a specific geographic area within its
boundaries as a critical environmental area (CEA). A state agency may
also designate as a CEA a specific geographic area that is owned or
managed by the state or is under its regulatory authority. Designation of
a CEA must be preceded by written public notice and a public hearing.
The public notice must identify the boundaries and the specific
environmental characteristics of the area warranting CEA designation.
(1) To be designated as a CEA, an area must have an exceptional or
unique character covering one or more of the following:
(a) A benefit or threat to human health;
(b) A natural setting (e.g., fish and wildlife habitat, forest and
vegetation, open space and areas of important aesthetic or
scenic quality);
(c) Agricultural, social, cultural, historic, archaeological,
recreational, or educational values; or
(d) An inherent ecological, geological or hydrological sensitivity to
change that may be adversely affected by any change.
(2) Notification that an area has been designated as a CEA must
include a map at an appropriate scale to readily locate the
boundaries of the CEA, the written justification supporting the
designation, and proof of public hearing and must be filed with:
(a) The Commissioner of the New York State Department of
Environmental Conservation;
(b) The appropriate regional office of the New York State
Department of Environmental Conservation; and
(c) Any other agency regularly involved in undertaking, funding or
approving actions in the municipality in which the area has
been designated.

§ 114-16. Confidentiality.
When a project sponsor submits a completed EAF, draft or final EIS, or
otherwise provides information concerning the environmental impacts of
a proposed project, the project sponsor may request, consistent with the
Freedom of Information Law (FOIL), Article 6 of the Public Officers Law,
that specifically identified information be held confidential. Prior to
divulging any such information, the agency must notify the applicant of its
determination of whether or not it will hold the information confidential.
§ 114-17. Referenced material.
The following referenced documents have been filed with the New York
State Department of State. The documents are available from the
(3) This designation shall take effect 30 days after filing with the New
York State Department of Environmental Conservation. Each
designation of a CEA must be published in the ENB by the New
York State Department of Environmental Conservation. The New
York State Department of Environmental Conservation will serve as
a clearinghouse for information on CEAs.
(4) Following designation, the potential impact of any Type I or
unlisted Action on the environmental characteristics of the CEA is a
relevant area of environmental concern and must be evaluated in
the determination of significance prepared pursuant to § 114-7 of
this chapter.
A. When a draft and final EIS for an action has been duly prepared under
the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, an agency has no
obligation to prepare an additional EIS under this chapter, provided
that the federal EIS is sufficient to make findings under § 114-11 of this
chapter. However, except in the case of Type II actions listed in § 114-5
of this chapter, no involved agency may undertake, fund or approve the
action until the federal final EIS has been completed and the involved
agency has made the findings prescribed in § 114-11 of this chapter.
B. Where a finding of no significant impact (FONSI) or other written
threshold determination that the action will not require a federal
impact statement has been prepared under the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969, the determination will not automatically constitute
compliance with TOBEQRA. In such cases agencies remain responsible
for compliance with TOBEQRA.
C. In the case of an action involving a federal agency for which either a
federal FONSI or a federal draft and final EIS has been prepared,
except where otherwise required by law, a final decision by a federal
agency will not be controlling on any state or local agency decision on
the action, but may be considered by the agency.

[Adopted 12-9-1969;45 amended in its entirety 5-11-1993 by L.L. No.
4-1993]
§ 117-5. Policy and intent.
It is hereby declared to be the policy of the Town to provide for the proper
use of land to prevent all excavations which create pits, holes or lakes in the
earth and leave it in a hazardous or dangerous condition or state; or cause
soil erosion which depletes the land of its natural vegetative cover and
supply of organic materials; or render such land and surrounding territory
unproductive and unsuitable for agricultural, residential, industrial and
other purposes resulting in lower land values and adversely affecting the
Town tax structure. By this article, the Town Board seeks to remove the
danger to health, life, safety and welfare caused by pits, holes or lakes
remaining in the ground and the stripping of topsoil which results in
damage to agricultural crops through dust storms, in dry weather by
exposure of the bare earth to wind action and in wet periods by ponds of
water, which article will promote the safety, health and general welfare of
the people of the Town and preserve land values and the Town tax structure.
§ 117-6. Applicability of provisions.
No excavation or part or extension thereof for purposes other than the
construction of a wall, railroad, driveway, sidewalk, building or part thereof,
farming or public use or as permitted by § 117-16 of this article and
otherwise permitted by law shall be commenced or shall be continued,
except in conformity with the provisions of this article.
§ 117-7. Permissive uses.
A. Excavations for the purpose of mining sand, gravel and other minerals
shall be allowed as a permissive use by the Board of Appeals, subject to
conditions, restrictions and safeguards as may be imposed by the Board
of Appeals. Mining shall be defined as any alteration of the surface or
subsurface of land by any activity that removes, deposits or disturbs
rock, gravel, sand, silt, soil or any other geologic deposits.
B. Before approving such use, the Board of Appeals shall determine the
following:
(1) No residential zone shall be within 1,000 feet of the site.
(2) No school, church, park or similar place of public assembly shall be
within 1,000 feet of the site.

§ 125-14. Duties and responsibilities of local administrator.
Duties of the local administrator shall include, but not be limited to, the
following:
floodplain development permit applications shall be accompanied by
design plans and specifications, prepared in sufficient detail to enable
independent review of the foundation support and connection
components. Said plans and specifications shall be developed or
reviewed by a licensed professional engineer or architect, and shall be
accompanied by a statement, bearing the signature of the architect or
engineer, certifying that the design and methods of construction to be
used are in accordance with accepted standards of practice and with all
applicable provisions of this chapter.
A. Permit application review. The local administrator shall conduct the
following permit application review before issuing a floodplain
development permit:
(1) Review all applications for completeness, particularly with the
requirements of § 125-13, Application for permit, and for
compliance with the provisions and standards of this chapter.
(2) Review subdivision and other proposed new development,
including manufactured home parks to determine whether
proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a
proposed building site is located in an area of special flood hazard,
all new construction and substantial improvements shall meet the
applicable standards of Article IV, Construction Standards, and, in
particular, § 125-15B, Subdivision proposals.
(3) Determine whether any proposed development in an area of special
flood hazard may result in physical damage to any other property
(e.g., stream bank erosion and increased flood velocities). The local
administrator may require the applicant to submit additional
technical analyses and data necessary to complete the
determination. If the proposed development may result in physical
damage to any other property or fails to meet the requirements of
Article IV, Construction Standards, no permit shall be issued. The
applicant may revise the application to include measures that
mitigate or eliminate the adverse effects and resubmit the
application.
(4) Determine that all necessary permits have been received from
those governmental agencies from which approval is required by
state or federal law.
B. Use of other flood data.

areas of special flood hazard on the community's Flood Insurance
Rate Map (FIRM) but has neither produced water surface elevation
§ 125-13 FIRE PREVENTION § 125-14
123:407
data (These areas are designated Zone A or V on the FIRM.) nor
identified a floodway, the local administrator shall obtain, review
and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data
available from a federal, state or other source, including data
developed pursuant to § 125-13G, as criteria for requiring that
new construction, substantial improvements or other proposed
development meet the requirements of this chapter.
(2) When base flood elevation data are not available, the local
administrator may use flood information from any other
authoritative source, such as historical data, to establish flood
elevations within the areas of special flood hazard, for the purposes
of this chapter.
C. Alteration of watercourses.
(1) Notification to adjacent communities and the New York State
Department of Environmental Conservation prior to permitting any
alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submittal of evidence
of such notification to the Regional Director, Region II, Federal
Emergency Management Agency.
(2) Determine that the permit holder has provided for maintenance
within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood-carrying capacity is not diminished.
D. Construction stage.
(1) In Zones A1-A30, AE and AH, and also Zone A if base flood
elevation data are available, upon placement of the lowest floor or
completion of floodproofing of a new or substantially improved
structure, obtain from the permit holder a certification of the asbuilt
elevation of the lowest floor or floodproofed elevation, in
relation to mean sea level. The certificate shall be prepared by or
under the direct supervision of a licensed land surveyor or
professional engineer and certified by same. For manufactured
homes, the permit holder shall submit the certificate of elevation
upon placement of the structure on the site. A certificate of
elevation must also be submitted for a recreational vehicle if it
remains on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer (unless it is
fully licensed and ready for highway use).
(2) In Zones V1-V30 and VE, and also Zone V if base flood elevation
data are available, upon placement of the lowest floor of a new or
substantially improved structure, the permit holder shall submit to
the local administrator a certificate of elevation, in relation to mean
sea level, of the bottom of the lowest structural member of the
lowest floor (excluding pilings and columns). The certificate shall
be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a licensed land
surveyor or professional engineer and certified by same. For
manufactured homes, the permit holder shall submit the certificate
of elevation upon placement of the structure on the site. An
§ 125-14 BABYLON CODE § 125-14
123:408
elevation certificate must also be submitted for a recreational
vehicle if it remains on a site 180 consecutive days or longer
(unless it is fully licensed and ready for highway use).
(3) Any further work undertaken prior to submission and approval of
the certification shall be at the permit holder's risk. The local
administrator shall review all data submitted. Deficiencies detected
shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the project unless
immediately corrected.
E. Inspections. The local administrator and/or the developer's engineer or
architect shall make periodic inspections at appropriate times
throughout the period of construction in order to monitor compliance
with permit conditions and enable said inspector to certify, if requested,
that the development is in compliance with the requirements of the
floodplain development permit and/or any variance provisions.
F. Stop-work orders; penalties for offenses.
(1) Notices. Whenever the local administrator or designee is satisfied
that the execution of any work for which a building permit is issued
is contrary to this chapter and/or plans and application submitted
for the permit, the Inspector shall serve notice or order upon the
person responsible, directing the discontinuance of such illegal
action and the remedying of the condition that is in violation of the
provisions of this chapter.
(2) Stopping work. Whenever, in the opinion of the local administrator
or designee, by reason of defective or illegal work in violation of a
provision or requirement of this chapter, the continuance of a
building operation is contrary to public welfare, the Inspector may
order, either orally or in writing, all further work to be stopped and
may require suspension of the work until the condition in violation
has been remedied.
(3) Any person, firm or corporation violating a stop-work order issued
pursuant to § 125-14F or failure or neglect to comply with any
order issued pursuant thereto shall be guilty of an A misdemeanor
and, upon conviction thereof, shall be punishable by a fine not less
than $1,000, and not more than $5,000 must be imposed, or
imprisonment for a period not to exceed one year, or both such fine
and imprisonment.

A. Elevation. The following standards apply to new and substantially
improved residential structures located in areas of special flood hazard,
in addition to the requirements in § 125-15B, Subdivision proposals,
§ 125-15C, Encroachments, and § 125-16, Standards for all structures.
(1) Within Zones A1-A30, AE and AH, and also Zone A if base flood
elevation data are available, new construction and substantial
improvements shall have the lowest floor (including basement)
elevated to or above two feet above the base flood elevation.
(2) Within Zone A, when no base flood elevation data are available,
new and substantially improved structures shall have the lowest

(3) With Zone AO, new and substantially improved structures shall
have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the
highest adjacent grade at least as high as two feet above the depth
number specified in feet on the community's Flood Insurance Rate
Map enumerated in § 125-6 (at least two feet if no depth number is
specified).
(4) Within Zones AH and AO, adequate drainage paths are required to
guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures on
slopes.
A. Elevation. New construction and substantial improvements shall be
elevated on pilings, columns or shear walls such that the bottom of the
lowest horizontal structural member supporting the lowest elevated
floor (excluding columns, piles, diagonal bracing attached to the piles
or columns, grade beams, pile caps and other members designed to
either withstand storm action or break away without imparting
§ 125-16 BABYLON CODE § 125-18
123:414
damaging loads to the structure) is elevated to or above two feet above
base flood elevation so as not to impede the flow of water.
B. Determination of loading forces. Structural design shall consider the
effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously during the base
flood on all building components.
(1) The structural design shall be adequate to resist water forces that
would occur during the base flood. Horizontal water loads
considered shall include inertial and drag forces of waves, current
drag forces, and impact forces from waterborne storm debris.
Dynamic uplift loads shall also be considered if bulkheads, walls, or
other natural or man-made flow obstructions could cause wave
runup beyond the elevation of the base flood.
(2) Buildings shall be designed and constructed to resist the forces due
to wind pressure. Wind forces on the superstructure include
windward and leeward forces on vertical walls, uplift on the roof,
internal forces when openings allow wind to enter the house, and
upward force on the underside of the house when it is exposed. In
the design, the wind should be assumed to blow potentially from
any lateral direction relative to the house.
(3) Wind loading values used shall be those required by the building
code.
C. Foundation standards.
(1) The pilings or column foundation and structure attached thereto
shall be adequately anchored to resist flotation, collapse or lateral
movement due to the effects of wind and water pressures acting
simultaneously on all building components. Foundations must be
designed to transfer safely to the underlying soil all loads due to
wind, water, dead load, live load and other loads (including uplift
due to wind and water).
(2) Spread footings and fill material shall not be used for structural
support of a new building or substantial improvement of an existing
structure.
D. Pile foundation design.
(1) The design ratio of pile spacing to pile diameter shall not be less
than 8:1 for individual piles (This shall not apply to pile clusters
located below the design grade.). The maximum center-to-center
spacing of wood piles shall not be more than 12 feet on center
under load-bearing sills, beams, or girders.
(2) Pilings shall have adequate soil penetration (bearing capacity) to
resist the combined wave and wind loads (lateral and uplift)
associated with the base flood acting simultaneously with typical
structure (live and dead) loads, and shall include consideration of
§ 125-18 FIRE PREVENTION § 125-18
123:415
decreased resistance capacity caused by erosion of soil strata
surrounding the piles. The minimum penetration for foundation
piles is to an elevation of five feet below mean sea level (msl) datum
if the BFE is +10 msl or less, or to be at least 10 feet below msl if
the BFE is greater than +10 msl.
(3) Pile foundation analysis shall also include consideration of piles in
column action from the bottom of the structure to the stable soil
elevation of the site. Pilings may be horizontally or diagonally
braced to withstand wind and water forces.
(4) The minimum acceptable sizes for timber piles are a tip diameter of
eight inches for round timber piles and eight inches by eight inches
for square timber piles. All wood piles must be treated in
accordance with requirements of EPEE-C3 to minimize decay and
damage from fungus.
(5) Reinforced concrete piles shall be cast of concrete having a twentyeight-
day ultimate compressive strength of not less than 5,000
pounds per square inch, and shall be reinforced with a minimum of
four longitudinal steel bars having a combined area of not less than
1% nor more than 4% of the gross concrete area. Reinforcing for
precast piles shall have a concrete cover of not less than 1 1/4
inches for No. 5 bars and smaller and not less than 1 1/2 inches for
No. 6 through No. 11 bars. Reinforcement for piles cast in the field
shall have a concrete cover of not less than two inches.
(6) Piles shall be driven by means of a pile driver or drop hammer,
jetted, or augered into place.
(7) Additional support for piles in the form of bracing may include
lateral or diagonal bracing between piles.
(8) When necessary, piles shall be braced at the ground line in both
directions by a wood timber grade beam or a reinforced concrete
grade beam. These at-grade supports should be securely attached
to the piles to provide support even if scoured from beneath.
(9) Diagonal bracing between piles, consisting of two-inch-by-eightinch
(minimum) members bolted to the piles, shall be limited in
location to below the lowest supporting structural member and
above the stable soil elevation, and aligned in the vertical plane
along pile rows perpendicular to the shoreline. Galvanized steel
rods (minimum diameter 1/2 inch) or cable-type bracing is
permitted in any plane.
(10) Knee braces, which stiffen both the upper portion of a pile and the
beam-to-pile connection, may be used along the pile rows
perpendicular and parallel to the shoreline. Knee braces shall be
two-by-eight lumber bolted to the sides of the pile/beam, or four-byfour-
or-larger braces framed into the pile/beam. Bolting shall
consist of two five-eights-inch galvanized steel bolts (each end) for
§ 125-18 BABYLON CODE § 125-18
123:416
two-by-eight members, or one five-eights-inch lag bolt (each end)
for square members. Knee braces shall not extend more than three
feet below the elevation of the base flood.
E. Column foundation design. Masonry piers or poured-in-place concrete
piers shall be internally reinforced to resist vertical and lateral loads,
and be connected with a movement-resisting connection to a pile cap or
pile shaft.
F. Connectors and fasteners. Galvanized metal connectors, wood
connectors, or bolts of size and number adequate for the calculated
loads must be used to connect adjoining components of a structure. Toe
nailing as a principal method of connection is not permitted. All metal
connectors and fasteners used in exposed locations shall be steel, hotdipped
galvanized after fabrication. Connectors in protected interior
locations shall be fabricated from galvanized sheet.
G. Beam-to-pile connection. The primary floor beams or girders shall span
the supports in the direction parallel to the flow of potential floodwater
and wave action and shall be fastened to the columns or pilings by
bolting, with or without cover plates. Concrete members shall be
connected by reinforcement, if cast in place, or, if precast, shall be
securely connected by bolting and welding. If sills, beams, or girders
are attached to wood piling at a notch, a minimum of two five-eightsinch
galvanized steel bolts or two hot-dipped galvanized straps 3/16
inch by four inches by 18 inches each bolted with two one-half-inch lag
bolts per beam member shall be used. Notching of pile tops shall be the
minimum sufficient to provide ledge support for beam members without
unduly weakening pile connections. Piling shall not be notched so that
the cross section is reduced below 50%.
H. Floor and deck connections.
(1) Wood two-by-four- inch (minimum) connectors or metal joist
anchors shall be used to tie floor joists to flood beams/girders.
These should be installed on alternate floor joists, at a minimum.
Cross bridging of all floor joists shall be provided. Such cross
bridging may be one-inch-by-three-inch members, placed eight feet
on center maximum, or solid bridging of same depth as joist at
same spacing.
(2) Plywood should be used for subflooring and attic flooring to provide
good torsional resistance in the horizontal plane of the structure.
The plywood should not be less than 3/4 inch total thickness, and
should be exterior grade and fastened to beams or joists with 8d
annular or spiral thread galvanized nails. Such fastening shall be
supplemented by the application of waterproof industrial adhesive
applied to all bearing surfaces.
I. Exterior wall connections. All bottom plates shall have any required
breaks under a wall stud or an anchor bolt. Approved anchors will be
used to secure rafters or joists and top and bottom plates to studs in
§ 125-18 FIRE PREVENTION § 125-18
123:417
exterior and bearing walls to form a continuous tie. Continuous fifteenthirty-
seconds-inch-or-thicker plywood sheathing, overlapping the top
wall plate and continuing down to the sill, beam, or girder, may be used
to provide the continuous tie. If the sheets of plywood are not vertically
continuous, then two-by-four nailer blocking shall be provided at all
horizontal joints. In lieu of the plywood, galvanized steel rods of onehalf-
inch diameter or galvanized steel straps not less than one inch wide
by 1/16 inch thick may be used to connect from the top wall plate to
the sill, beam, or girder. Washers with a minimum diameter of three
inches shall be used at each end of the one-half-inch-round rods. These
anchors shall be installed no more than two feet from each corner rod,
no more than four feet on center.
J. Ceiling joist/rafter connections.
(1) All ceiling joists or rafters shall be installed in such a manner that
the joists provide a continuous tie across the rafters. Ceiling joists
and rafters shall be securely fastened at their intersections. A
metal or wood connector shall be used at alternate ceiling joist/
rafter connections to the wall top plate.
(2) Gable roofs shall be additionally stabilized by installing two-by-four
blocking on two-foot centers between the rafters at each gable end.
Blocking shall be installed a minimum of eight feet toward the
house interior from each gable end.
K. Projecting members. All cantilevers and other projecting members
must be adequately supported and braced to withstand wind and water
uplift forces. Roof eave overhangs shall be limited to a maximum of two
feet and joist overhangs to a maximum of one foot. Larger overhangs
and porches will be permitted if designed or reviewed and certified by a
registered professional engineer or architect.
L. Roof sheathing.
(1) Plywood, or other wood material, when used as roof sheathing,
shall not be less than 15/32 inch in thickness, and shall be of
exterior sheathing grade or equivalent. All attaching devices for
sheathing and roof coverings shall be galvanized or be of other
suitable corrosion-resistant material.
(2) All corners, gable ends, and roof overhangs exceeding six inches
shall be reinforced by the application of waterproof industrial
adhesive applied to all bearing surfaces of any plywood sheet used
in the sheathing of such corner, gable end, or roof overhang.
(3) In addition, roofs should be sloped as steeply as practicable to
reduce uplift pressures, and special care should be used in
securing ridges, hips, valleys, eaves, vents, chimneys, and other
points of discontinuity in the roofing surface.

be designed to transfer safely the design loads to the supporting
structure. Panel widths of multiple panel sliding glass doors shall not
exceed three feet.
N. Breakaway wall design standards.
(1) The breakaway wall shall have a design safe loading resistance of
not less than 10 and not more than 20 pounds per square foot, with
the criterion that the safety of the overall structure at the point of
wall failure be confirmed using established procedures. Grade
beams shall be installed in both directions for all piles considered
to carry the breakaway wall load. Knee braces are required for
front row piles that support breakaway walls.
(2) Use of breakaway wall strengths in excess of 20 pounds per square
foot shall not be permitted unless a registered professional

in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures
constructed below the base flood elevation, providing that items in
Subsection D(1) through (12) in § 125-22 have been fully considered. As
the lot size increases beyond the 1/2 acre, the technical justification
required for issuing the variance increases.
B. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon determination that:
(1) The proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure's continued designation as an "historic structure"; and
(2) The variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic
character and design of the structure.
C. Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and
substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the
conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided that:
(1) The criteria of Subsections A, D, E, and F of this section are met;
and
(2) The structure or other development is protected by methods that
minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no
additional threat to public safety.
D. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
E. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is
the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
§ 125-22 BABYLON CODE § 125-23
123:424
F. Variances shall only be issued upon receiving written justification of:
(1) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
(2) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
(3) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or
victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or
ordinances.
G. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted for a building with the
lowest floor below the base flood elevation shall be given written notice
over the signature of a community official that the cost of flood
insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from
lowest floor elevation.

§ 128-1. Declaration of policy.
It is declared to be public policy of the Town of Babylon to preserve, protect
and conserve freshwater wetlands and the benefits derived therefrom, to
prevent the despoliation and destruction of freshwater wetlands and to
regulate the development of such wetlands in order to secure the natural
benefits of freshwater wetlands, consistent with the general welfare and
beneficial economic, social and agricultural development of the Town of
Babylon. It is further declared to be the policy of the Town of Babylon to
exercise its authority pursuant to Article 24 of the State Environmental
Conservation Law.
§ 128-2. Statement of findings.
A. The freshwater wetlands located in the Town of Babylon are invaluable
resources for flood protection, wildlife habitat, open space and water
resources.
B. Considerable acreage of freshwater wetlands in the Town has been lost,
despoiled or impaired by unregulated draining, dredging, filling,
excavating, building, pollution or other acts inconsistent with the
natural uses of such areas. Other freshwater wetlands are in jeopardy
of being lost, despoiled or impaired by such unregulated acts.
C. Recurrent flooding aggravated or caused by the loss of freshwater
wetlands has serious effects upon natural ecosystems.
D. Freshwater wetlands conservation is a matter of public concern.
E. Any loss of freshwater wetlands deprives the people of the Town of
Babylon of some or all of the many and multiple benefits to be derived
from wetlands, namely:
(1) Flood and storm control by the hydrologic absorption and storage
capacity of freshwater wetlands.
(2) Wildlife habitat by providing breeding, nesting and feeding
grounds and cover for many forms of wildlife, wildfowl and
shorebirds, including migratory wildfowl and rare species.

§ 133-9 BABYLON CODE § 133-9
128:460
cover to prohibit any material from being discharged while the

48.Editor's Note: This local law also provided its legislative intent as follows: The Town
Board finds that toxic waste is a serious and extremely dangerous threat to our
environment, health, welfare and safety. Toxic waste is a threat that can cause serious
physical injury and death. That without strict control over the disposal of waste, the
residents of the Town of Babylon and of the State of New York are in jeopardy of toxic
waste being disposed of unlawfully, not in compliance with local, state and federal law and
in a manner which may pose a threat to all living things. For this reason, the Town Board
takes the extraordinary step of authorizing summary abatement of the following
nuisance.

solid waste, for collection at such times and dates as may be established by
regulation.
§ 133-21. Commercial recycling.
A. It is hereby declared the policy of the Town to cause the Babylon
resource recovery facility to be operated so that the volume of solid
waste processed results in the most revenues to the Town, thereby
minimizing the burden of the costs of solid waste disposal to the
residents of the Town. To achieve such volume, the Town shall, by
resolution, provide for the implementation of programs to separate
recyclable materials from solid waste.
B. In addition, the Town Board finds that the implementation of a
commercial source separation program shall be established for which
economic conditions exist. This program shall give due consideration to
the Town's existing source separation, recycling and resource recovery
activities as provided for in the Town Solid Waste Management Plan.
Economic conditions will take into account the costs of paper collection,
transportation, processing and marketing of source-separated
materials.

recyclable materials from solid waste by all persons within the
residential improvement area of the Town of Babylon. This program
shall apply only to residential recyclable materials.
B. Participation in the residential recyclable program is mandatory.
Failure to participate shall subject the owner and/or occupant of a
residence to fines set forth in Article VII.

Improper Deposit or Storage of Waste
§ 133-24. Legislative intent. [Amended 10-4-2011 by L.L. No.

It is hereby declared that the outdoor placement, maintenance, existence,
deposit, situating, putting, positioning or maintenance of abandoned,
junked, discarded, dismantled and unlicensed or unregistered motor
vehicles, household appliances, solid waste, rubbish, debris or any other
objects identified herein, upon privately owned properties within the Town
is a matter affecting the public interest. Such placement, storage and
maintenance constitutes a nuisance and a blight, is aesthetically
unpleasant, an unsightly condition and a source of vexation and annoyance
not only to the owners and occupants of adjoining lands, but also to the
general public. The Town Board does not find that it be required that any
of the aforementioned or stated hereinafter objects or items or vehicles be
present on said premises for any period of time. The existence of same at
any given time shall be as offensive, unsafe, unhealthy, in degradation of
the public good and welfare and be prohibited as if it should exist or be
maintained for any period of time. The preservation of peace, good order,
the safeguarding of health, safety and general welfare and the protection of
private property and the removal and avoidance of blight on a neighborhood
compel the Town Board to legislate upon said subject matter.

General Provisions
[Adopted 11-5-1986 by L.L. No. 9-1986]
§ 136-1. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
BROAD-TIPPED INDELIBLE MARKER  Any felt-tip marker or similar
implement containing a fluid or coloring matter that is not water soluble
and which has a flat or angled writing surface of 1/2 inch or greater.
DEFACE  To mar the face or surface of, disfigure, injure or spoil the
appearance of.
GRAFFITI  An inscription, figure, mark or design which is written,
scratched, painted or drawn on a wall, building, monument, statue, rock or
any other surface of real or personal property.
§ 136-2. Legislative intent.
§ 136-3. Prohibited acts.
A. The Town Board hereby finds and declares that the use of broad-tipped
indelible markers, aerosol spray paint cans or other marking devices
used in connection with the writing of graffiti on walls, public and
private buildings, monuments, statues and other structures has become
a major problem in the Town of Babylon and is harmful to the general
public and violative of the public health, peace, safety and welfare of
the residents of the Town of Babylon. The Board also finds graffiti
indicating bias and/or hatred against people based upon their race,
religion, color, disability, sexual orientation, national origin or ancestry
to be particularly repugnant, having a divisive effect on the community,
which is extremely harmful to the general public. [Amended
8-17-1993 by L.L. No. 8-1993]
B. The Town Board further finds, based upon past experience, that such
defacement of property is most often committed by persons under 18
years of age using aerosol spray paint cans and broad-tipped indelible
markers; that such persons rarely have a legitimate need for such
aerosol cans or markers; that, where such a need exists, such aerosol
cans or markers may be furnished by a parent or guardian; and,
therefore, that within the Town the sale of aerosol spray paint cans and
broad-tipped indelible markers should be prohibited and persons
engaged in the retail sale of such aerosol cans and markers should be
required to take reasonable steps to prevent the theft of such cans and
markers.
A. No person shall write, paint or draw any word, inscription, design,
figure or mark of any type or otherwise mar or deface any property, real
or personal, without the express written permission and consent of the

shall be guilty of a violation and, upon conviction thereof, shall be

owner shall be liable and responsible to the Town for the Town's costs in
removing the bamboo from the Town property. Such costs may be

property owner in violation of this chapter shall be responsible for such
damages.

ARTICLE II
Accessory Apartments in One-Family Dwellings
[Adopted 6-20-1995 as L.L. No. 14-199557 ]
§ 153-12. Intent.
§ 153-13. Definitions. [Amended 7-16-2002 by L.L. No. 17-2002]
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
ACCESSORY APARTMENT  An additional self-contained dwelling unit
which is incorporated within a one-family dwelling.
ACCESSORY KITCHEN  A one-family dwelling which has more than one
cooking area, but which contains only one dwelling unit.
A. This article is to amend the existing Town ordinances and regulations
which do not address the illegal accessory apartments situation.
Records on file indicated that there are numerous illegal accessory
apartments in the Town. The Planning Department estimates that
between 10% and 20% of what seemingly are one-family dwellings are
really one-family dwellings with accessory apartments. It is to be noted
that economic reasons are causing many one-family homeowners to add
accessory apartments to their one-family dwellings.
B. It is the purpose of this article to encourage the residents of our
community who require accessory apartments to legally remain in the
Town of Babylon. In addition, this article will provide for the improved
safety and physical appearance of the one-family dwellings with
accessory apartments and the surrounding neighborhoods. Its purpose
is also to further preserve the one-family residential character of the
Town and to continue to protect the health, welfare and safety of the
general public.
C. It is the intent that any approved accessory apartment permits be for
owner-occupied homes since the Division of Building in the Department
of Planning and Development has found that absentee-landlord twofamily
homes disproportionately make up 50% of all two-family home
building complaints received, even though only 10% of the two-family
homes are owned by absentee landlords.
D. It is further recognized that many holders of accessory kitchen permits
have legally converted their homes to one-family dwellings with
accessory apartments. It is therefore necessary to review all such
applications for the purpose of determining the true intent of the
applicant and to regulate the use of the premises.
57.Editor's Note: This local law also repealed former Art. II, Two-Family Dwellings in Single-
Family Districts, adopted 11-20-1979 by L.L. No. 9-1979, amended in its entirety
9-15-1992 by L.L. No. 8-1992.
§ 153-12 MEMORIAL AND INDEPENDENCE DAY SALES § 153-13
149:533
BASEMENT  That space of a building that is partly below grade, which
has more than half its height, measured from floor to ceiling, above the
average established curb level or finished grade of the ground adjoining the
building.
CELLAR  That space of a building that is partly or entirely below grade,
which has more than half of its height, measured from floor to ceiling, below
the average established curb level or finished grade of the ground adjoining
the building.
DWELLING UNIT  An area of a building designated for and/or occupied
as a home or residence containing not more than one cooking area.
FAMILY  A single person or collective group of persons related by kinship,
adoption, blood or marriage, or the functional and factual equivalent of a
natural family, living together under the same roof and cooking together
as a single housekeeping unit in a common household whose relation is of
a permanent and distinct domestic character. The "functional and factual
equivalent of a natural family" is hereby defined as a single housekeeping
unit bearing the generic character of a family unit as a relatively permanent
household, not a framework for transients or transient living, leading a
stable, nonprofit, family-like existence, headed by a householder as one
would likely find in a biologically unitary family; in every sense but a
biological one it must function as a stable, single-family unit, albeit
occasionally changing in composition as a natural family might and does.
ILLEGAL TWO-FAMILY DWELLING  Any residence without an accessory
apartment permit or accessory kitchen permit that may contain any
combination of two or more cooking areas and/or two or more distinct
dwelling units being accessible by separate doors in a home possessing a
certificate of occupancy for a one-family dwelling.
OCCUPANT  A natural person who uses the premises as his/her principal
residence.
OWNER  A natural person who is an owner in fee simple or of a life estate
of at least an undivided fifty-percent interest in the premises as recorded
in the office of the Suffolk County Clerk or Suffolk County Registrar, as
applicable.[Amended 1-24-2012 by L.L. No. 2-2012]
TWO-FAMILY DWELLING  A building designed for and legally occupied
exclusively as a home or residence for two families. It includes two legally
defined dwelling units.
§ 153-14. Accessory Apartment Review Board; issuance of special
permit. [Amended 7-9-1996 by L.L. No. 14-1996; 12-22-1998 by L.L.
No. 15-1998; 10-7-2003 by L.L. No. 23-2003]
The Two-Family Review Board created by L. L. No. 9-1979, adopted
November 20, 1979, and amended by L. L. No 8-1992 on September 15,
1992, is now known as the "Accessory Apartment Review Board" and shall
consist of nine members who shall be appointed by and serve at the
pleasure of the Town Board. The nine-member Accessory Apartment Review
§ 153-13 BABYLON CODE § 153-14
149:534
Board (sometimes referred to in this article as the "Board") shall henceforth
hear all accessory apartment permit applications and renewal of accessory
kitchen permit applications and make a final determination as to whether
the applicant should be granted any such permit. It shall be a violation
to have an accessory kitchen in any premises without a permit or with an
expired permit.
A. Before such approval shall be given, the Board shall determine:
(1) That the use will not prevent the orderly and reasonable use of
adjacent properties or of properties in adjacent use districts.
(2) That the use will not prevent the orderly and reasonable use of
permitted or legally established uses in the district wherein the
proposed use is to be located or of permitted or legally established
uses in adjacent use districts.
(3) That the safety, the health, the welfare, the comfort, the
convenience or the order of the Town will not be adversely affected
by the proposed use and its location.
(4) That the use will be in harmony with and promote that general
purpose and intent of this article.
B. In making such determination, the Board shall also give consideration,
among other things, to:
(1) The character of the existing and probable development of uses in
the district and the peculiar suitability of such districts for the
location of any of such permissive uses.
(2) The conservation of property values and the encouragement of the
most appropriate uses of land.
(3) The effect that the location of the proposed use may have upon the
creation or undue increase of vehicular traffic congestion on public
streets or highways.
(4) The necessity for space for the purpose of off-street parking of
vehicles incidental to the use, and whether such space is
reasonably adequate and appropriate and can be furnished by the
owner of the plot sought to be used within or adjacent to the plot
wherein the use shall be had.
(5) Whether the use or the structures to be used therefor will cause an
overcrowding of the land or undue concentration of population.
(6) Whether the plot area is sufficient, appropriate and adequate for

is located. It is the intent of this chapter to correct the aforesaid abuses,
to provide a guide for the majority of the subdividers within the Town who
deal with the public on a high plane of business integrity and to provide
adequate and sufficient information so that a prospective home buyer in this
Town can make an informed and intelligent decision.
§ 157-2. Scope.

B. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to create a standardized
procedure for securing legal and equitable remedies and to strengthen

in the Town of Babylon by preventing buildings, residences, premises
and real estate within the Town of Babylon from being used in such a
way as to constitute a public nuisance.

Town Board therefore finds it necessary and proper to increase the
fines and related penalties for violations of the Town Code. It is further
the intent of the Town Board to exercise its authority as provided by law

court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such judgment shall not
affect, impair or invalidate the remainder thereof but shall be confined
in its operation to the clause, sentence, paragraph, section, word or

places that are used as an adult use, as such is defined in Chapter 213,
Article XXXI, of this Code, in violation of the restrictions therein or
buildings in which public conduct occurs in violation of Chapter 165,
Article II, of this Code, constitute a public nuisance resulting from the
adverse secondary effects that adult uses and said violative public
conduct have on surrounding properties and communities as has been
found in the numerous studies performed in the Towns of Long island,
the City of New York and many other municipalities across the country
and that it is in the best interests of the public health, safety and
welfare of the Town of Babylon to abate such adult uses and violative
public conduct so as to preserve the quality of life and property values
of adjoining properties and surrounding communities.
B. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to establish a standardized
procedure for securing legal and equitable remedies and to strengthen
existing laws so as to effectively deal with the problem of adult uses
operating in violation of Chapter 213, Article XXXI, of this Code and
violative public conduct in buildings in violation of Chapter 165, Article
II, of this Code.

materials and objects within the 10 days by proving ownership and
paying the storage costs to the Town Clerk. If the owner of said material
or objects fails to claim said material or objects they shall be disposed
of by the Town in any manner that the Town shall see fit, and said
storage fees shall be charged against the premises in the same manner
as provided in Article 15 of the Town Law as a special ad valorem levy.

the health, safety and welfare of the community and poses an attractive
nuisance for young children, who may be injured thereon. These types of
violations degrade neighborhoods, affect property values, interfere with the
quiet use and enjoyment of the neighboring properties and seriously affect
the aesthetics of the community.

danger to the life, safety or health of any person or property unless said
violation is remedied immediately, the Town Board may, by resolution,
authorize the remediation of the violation without prior notice to the owner
of the property. There shall be notice to the owner as soon thereafter

ARTICLE I
General Site Plan Review
§ 186-1. Legislative purpose; findings.
§ 186-2. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
COMMISSIONER  The Commissioner of the Department of Planning and
Development.
PLANNING BOARD  The duly constituted seven-member Planning Board
of the Town of Babylon, and up to three alternate members to serve when a
member has a conflict of interest or is absent or where there is a vacancy.
The Town Board intends to supersede § 271(15) of the Town Law which
allows alternates only where a conflict of interest exists.[Amended
4-26-2005 by L.L. No. 5-2005]
SITE PLAN  A rendering, drawing or sketch prepared to all relevant
specifications and containing necessary elements, as set forth in this
A. Pursuant to § 274-a of the Town Law, the Town Board herein enacts this
chapter to regulate the review of site plan applications and the issuance
of site plan approvals, denials, approvals with modifications and
approvals with conditions.
B. The Town Board finds that reasonable supervision and control over the
layout and design of certain sites is necessary to provide for community
health, safety and welfare. While a designated use may be appropriate
for a certain zoning district or even a particular parcel, control over
layout and design of the site must be effected in order to integrate the
site into the surrounding community and to obviate, or at least
substantially mitigate, negative effects a particular developmental
proposal could or would engender. Further, the regulations provided in
Chapter 213, Zoning, do not provide the type of site-specific review
necessary to assure those ends. Accordingly, the Town Board finds that,
in the circumstances set forth below, proposals for site development or
redevelopment must be reviewed and approved prior to the issuance of
any building permit or certificate of occupancy respecting such
development or redevelopment.
C. The Board also finds that the site plan review process must be designed
to both protect, preserve and advance the interests of the community
and to encourage positive economic development within the Town.
While community interests must not be sacrificed, it also must be
recognized that excessive, duplicative or unnecessary administrative
proceedings serve only to chill economic growth. The underlying aim of
this chapter is to provide control over construction in a manner which
prevents negative construction and encourages positive community and
economic development.
§ 186-1 SEWERS § 186-2
181:709
chapter, which show the arrangement, layout and design of the proposed
use of a single parcel of land as shown on said plan. Plats showing lots,
blocks or sites which are subject to review pursuant to authority provided
for the review of subdivisions under § 276 of the Town Law shall continue
to be subject to such review and shall not be subject to review as site plans
under this chapter. However, this chapter shall apply in the case of any
proposal which contemplates the use of a particular parcel in conjunction
or interrelation with one or other parcels. In such circumstance the term
"single parcel" as stated above shall be deemed to respect all of the
properties involved.
§ 186-3. Issuance of building permits and certificates of occupancy.
Where an approved site plan, or the approval of modifications to an existing
site plan, is required pursuant to this chapter, no building permit, plumbing
permit, sign permit or certificate of occupancy may be issued until such
time as the site plan approval or approval of site plan modification is issued.
§ 186-4. Expiration in absence of construction.
§ 186-5. Additional site plan applications.
No parcel or part thereof may be the subject of an application for a site plan
approval within one year after the determination rendered on a site plan
application is filed, unless such application is substantially different from
the previous application.
§ 186-6. Site plan approval.
The Planning Board of the Town of Babylon is hereby authorized to review,
approve, disapprove, approve with modifications and approve with
A. Any site plan approval or approval of site plan modification issued
pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall become null, void and of
no further effect unless, within 180 days after filing thereof,
construction upon that approved site plan shall actually have
commenced; provided, however, that excavation for and/or construction
of a building foundation alone shall not be deemed to be
commencement of the erection or construction of such building or
structure. Extensions of 180 days may be granted by the Planning
Board for just cause shown.
B. However, in such instance where an approved site plan requires area or
use variance relief or special permission issued by the Zoning Board of
Appeals or another Town board or agency, the one-hundred-eighty-day
period shall not begin to run until the Zoning Board of Appeals or other
respective Town board or agency shall file its determination on an
application respecting such relief when application is filed with the
Zoning Board of Appeals or other Town board or agency within 60 days
of the filing of the site plan approval or preliminary site plan approval.
§ 186-2 BABYLON CODE § 186-6

residence development:
(1) Any application for a building permit or certificate of occupancy
where there is an increase in building area or floor area, exclusive
of outside storage, of 10% or more.
(2) Any application for a building permit or certificate of occupancy
respecting a retaining wall and/or bulkhead.

(8) Any application for a building permit or certificate of occupancy
which receives a positive declaration pursuant to applicable
environmental quality review statutes and regulations by another
involved agency.
(9) Any application for a building permit or certificate of occupancy
which requires that an environmental declaration be made and no
other Town agency has jurisdiction over the issue.
(10) Any change of use which increases on-site parking requirements by
10% or more if such requires providing a parking area not on an
existing site plan.
(11) Any application respecting the outside storage of material, whether
or not offered for retail or wholesale sales, which occupies 10% or
more of the subject property.
(12) Any application for a building permit or certificate of occupancy
which seeks to erect freestanding lighting within 100 feet of any
residentially zoned or developed property, any public park or any

concerning site development which the Commissioner determines
presents issues which could or would foster a negative impact upon
the health, safety and/or welfare of the local community or persons
living and/or working in the Town or would require full site plan
review to comply with the intent of this chapter.
B. An approved site plan, which may be issued only after the conclusion of
a public hearing held pursuant to the terms of this chapter, shall be
required for the following when such concerns commercial, industrial,
multiple residence or senior citizen multiple residence development:
(1) Applications pertaining or related to any subdivision.
(2) Site plan applications made pursuant to Subsection A hereof where
the subject property adjoins property residentially developed or
residentially zoned. Residentially zoned or developed property
shall include property zoned multiple residence and property zoned
senior citizen multiple residence. However, this subsection shall
not apply when the residentially zoned property is designated as a
cemetery. "Adjoining," as employed herein, shall include property
located on the opposite side of any street with the exception of a
thoroughfare having a state or county route number.
C. The Planning Board, however, may hold a public hearing on any
application indicated in Subsection A above, notwithstanding that such
a hearing is not required, if the Planning Board deems that a public
hearing would be necessary or helpful in its review of the application at
issue.
D. The Planning Board shall hold a public hearing on any application
indicated in Subsection A above, notwithstanding the fact that such a
hearing is not required, if the applicant or the Commissioner files a
request for a hearing within 10 days of the submission of the final site
plan to the Planning Board for review. A failure to so file shall be
deemed a waiver by the applicant.
A. Any public hearing held pursuant to this chapter must comply with all
requirements set forth in the Town Law.
B. Additionally, the subject property is to be posted for a period of not less
than 10 days immediately preceding the public hearing. The applicant

181:712
§ 186-8. Conditions and modifications to approved site plans.
shall erect on the affected property a sign or signs of green printing
on a white background measuring 30 inches high and 40 inches wide,
which shall be prominently displayed on the premises facing each
public street (maximum spacing of 200 feet on center) on which the
affected property abuts, set back not less than 10 feet from the property

the Planning Board to adjust to the particular characteristics of an
individual parcel and to ensure that any and all signs posted are plainly
visible.

which envelopes shall name the Board as the return addressee.
(2) The Clerk of the Board shall mail notice of the hearing utilizing the
foregoing not less than 10 days prior to the date fixed for the

feet above the base of the trunk, shall be retained to the maximum
extent possible. The Planning Board and/or Commissioner may
require an applicant to submit a plan showing all such trees and/or

also give consideration to the proposed and reasonably anticipated
uses of the parcel pursuant to Ch. 213, Zoning.

the site and do not intrude upon adjacent property, streets or other
public ways or individuals visiting or working on the site.
(12) That the general health, safety and welfare of the Town and the
local community is not negatively affected by the proposed site
plan.
(13) That the proposed site plan will provide development in harmony

representative to discuss and review the site plan submitted so that the
applicant may proceed with a clear understanding of the Town's
requirements in matters relating to the development of the site,
including the provisions of this chapter and Chapter 213, Zoning.

health, safety or general welfare or intent of this chapter or to be
inappropriate to a particular site plan.
B. The Planning Board may require in any specific case that additional
information be indicated on a site plan, notwithstanding that such is not

Where site plan review by the Planning Board is not required by this chapter
in connection with an application for a building permit, the Commissioner
may require reasonable site improvements in connection with a building
permit application for nonresidential property, provided that such site
improvements do not then require site plan review by the Planning Board
or a variance by the Board of Appeals for approval of the building permit.
Board of Appeals must make a decision shall be tolled during the
pendency of any request made pursuant to this subsection.
B. The Planning Board shall be empowered to seek an advisory opinion
from the Zoning Board of Appeals concerning the interpretation of any
section of the Town Code within the jurisdiction of the Zoning Board of
Appeals and/or concerning the necessity or nature of any variance or
special exception relief which may be presented in any site plan
application. In such circumstances, notice of the request shall be
forwarded to the applicant who shall have 10 days to file comments
with the Zoning Board of Appeals. The Zoning Board of Appeals may
extend the ten-day requirement for good cause shown. The Zoning
Board of Appeals shall file its response within 30 days after the

any court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such judgment shall
not affect, impair or invalidate the remainder thereof but shall be
confined in its operation to the clause, sentence, paragraph, section,
word or part thereof directly involved in the controversy in which such
judgment shall have been rendered. The invalidity of any word, clause,
sentence, paragraph, section or part of this chapter shall not affect the
validity of any other part of this chapter which can be given effect
without such invalid part or parts.
B. If any portion of this chapter is found to be in conflict with any other
provision of any other local law or ordinance of the Code of the Town of
Babylon, the provision which establishes the higher standard shall

ARTICLE II
Architectural Review
[Added 10-5-2004 by L.L. No. 30-2004]
§ 186-19. Legislative intent.
The Town Board finds that the new single-family homes, or substantial
reconstruction, are being built without sufficient architectural review,
resulting in homes that are not in character with the other homes in the
area, are visually displeasing and have a negative impact on the value of
the homes in the neighborhood. The Town Board further finds that granting
the Planning Board architectural review will provide a mechanism to ensure
that new homes are in character with the surrounding neighborhood, are
visually pleasing and have a positive impact on home values.
§ 186-20. Applicability.
It is hereby specifically required that before a building permit is issued for
new single-family homes or reconstruction where the area to be altered
or reconstructed is at least 50% of the existing structure in all residence
districts, such application must first receive a favorable architectural
review from the Planning Board as set forth in Article II of Chapter 186 of
this Code.
§ 186-21. Submission; information required.
A. As soon as possible, and in any event not more than 10 business days
after receipt of a completed application for a building permit, the
Building Inspector shall forward such application, together with the
plans and other information set forth in Subsection B, to the Planning
Board for architectural review thereof.
B. Applications must be accompanied by construction plans, floor plans
and plans showing all elevations of new structures and all affected
elevations in the case of additions or alterations. Such plans shall show
all details of exterior construction, including materials for exterior
walls, doors, windows and roofs. For all new structures, site plan with a
scale minimum of one inch equals 20 feet must be submitted, showing
the following:
(1) Property lines, including curblines of adjacent street.
(2) Outline of existing and proposed structure, including walks,
driveways, terraces, walls and fences.
(3) Existing and proposed contours at two-foot intervals.
(4) Existing trees and trees to be removed with a trunk diameter of
four inches or more at a point 12 inches above the ground.
(5) All proposed plantings.
§ 186-19 SEWERS § 186-21
181:721
§ 186-22. Features and suitability of site to be considered.
In considering an application for a permit, the Planning Board shall take
into account natural features of the site and surroundings, exterior design
and appearances of existing structures and the character of the
neighborhood and its peculiar suitability for particular purposes, with a
view to conserving the values of property and encouraging the most
appropriate use of land.
§ 186-23. Grounds for favorable review.
The Planning Board may recommend the issuance of a building permit to
the Building Inspector for any application referred to it upon finding that
the building or structure for which the permit was requested, if erected or
altered in accordance with the submitted plan, would be in harmony with
the purpose of this chapter, would not be visually offensive or inappropriate
by reason of poor quality of exterior design, would not have monotonous
similarity or striking visual discord in relation to the sites or surrounding

§ 189-1. Findings of fact; statutory authority.
A. It is hereby determined by the Town Board of the Town of Babylon that:
(1) Land development activities and associated increases in site
impervious cover often alter the hydrologic response of local
watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes,
flooding, stream channel erosion, or sediment transport and
deposition. This stormwater runoff contributes to increased
quantities of water-borne pollutants, including siltation of aquatic
habitat for fish and other desirable species. The Great South Bay
and its tidal tributaries within the Town of Babylon have been
placed on the New York State Department of Environmental
Conservation (NYSDEC) Priority Water Bodies List. The NYSDEC
identified urban runoff and storm drain systems as the major
source/contributors to their impairment.
(2) Clearing and grading during construction tends to increase soil
erosion and add to the loss of native vegetation necessary for
terrestrial and aquatic habitat.
(3) Improper design and construction of stormwater management
practices can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff, thereby
increasing stream bank erosion and sedimentation.
(4) Impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil,
thereby decreasing groundwater recharge and stream base flow.
(5) Substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts
to the waters of the Town of Babylon.
(6) Stormwater runoff, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can
be controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater
runoff from land development activity.
(7) The regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land
development activities in order to control and minimize increases
§ 186-25 BABYLON CODE § 189-1
181:724
§ 189-2. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to establish minimum stormwater
management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the
general health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the Town of Babylon
and to address the findings of fact and statutory authority in § 189-1. This
chapter seeks to meet those purposes by achieving the following objectives:
in stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion, stream
channel erosion, and nonpoint source pollution associated with
stormwater runoff is in the public interest and will minimize threats
to public health and safety.
(8) Regulation of land development activities by means of performance
standards governing stormwater management and site design will
result in development compatible with the natural functions of a
particular site or an entire watershed and thereby mitigate the
adverse effects of erosion and sedimentation from development.
B. Therefore, the Town Board of the Town of Babylon hereby establishes
this policy applicable to all land development activities within the Town
of Babylon to provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of
stormwater runoff and erosion and sediment control for the purpose of
protecting local water resources from degradation. It is determined
that the regulation of stormwater runoff and sediment discharges from
land development projects and other construction activities is in the
public interest in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater
runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion, stream channel erosion, and
nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff and will
prevent threats to public health and safety and enhance and improve
the environmental and economic conditions within the Town of Babylon.
This chapter is adopted pursuant to the requirements of the New York
State Environmental Conservation Law (ECL) and the federal Clean
Water Act (CWA) for small municipal separate storm sewer systems
(MS4s) to develop, implement and enforce a stormwater management
program (SWMP) designed to reduce the discharges of pollutants to the
waters of the United States within the Town of Babylon to the maximum
extent practicable (MEP) in order to protect water quality. This chapter
is consistent with the Comprehensive Management Plan for the South
Shore Estuary Reserve to reduce nonpoint source pollution of the
estuary and its tributaries.
A. Establish minimum stormwater and erosion and sediment control

ceased and the discharger has taken steps to prevent its recurrence.
Access may be denied if the Town of Babylon SMO(s) determines in
writing that the illicit discharge has not ceased or is likely to recur. A
person commits an offense if the person reinstates Town of Babylon

[Added 7-16-2013 by L.L. No. 14-2013]
§ 191-28. Findings; legislative intent.
§ 191-29. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
COMMISSIONER  The Town of Babylon Commissioner of the Department
of Public Works.
DANGEROUS/DAMAGED POLE  Any utility pole that is structurally
compromised due to weather, a traffic incident, and/or age and poses a
potential threat to public safety.
DEPARTMENT  The Town of Babylon, Department of Public Works.
DOUBLE POLE/DOUBLE WOOD  Any utility pole that is located directly
next to or in close proximity to, and is shorter in height than, another utility
pole.
PLANT  The cables, terminals, conductors and other fixtures necessary
for transmitting electric, telephone, cable television or other
telecommunications service.
A. This Town Board hereby finds and determines that public utility
companies place poles on Town of Babylon roads and rights-of-way to
facilitate the delivery of electric, telephone, and cable television
services to the residents of the Town of Babylon.
B. This Town Board also finds that utility poles are frequently damaged by
traffic accidents and adverse weather conditions.
C. This Town Board determines that public safety can be compromised
when utility lines and equipment remain affixed to weathered/damaged/
old poles for unreasonably long periods of time.
D. This Town Board further determines that a utility's delay in removing
lines and equipment also delays the removal of the pole itself, which
causes a proliferation of aesthetically unpleasant double woods/double
poles along roadways.
E. This Town Board also finds and determines that local governments have
the authority to regulate their roads and rights-of-way to protect the
public.
F. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to require utilities that use
Town roads and rights-of-way to promptly remove their plants, cables,
lines, equipment, and terminals from old and damaged poles and to
further require the prompt removal of double poles once all plants,
cables, lines, terminals, and other fixtures have been removed.

Business Investment Exemption
[Adopted 2-27-2001 by L.L. No. 1-2001]
§ 195-24. Legislative intent.
The Suffolk County Legislature enacted by local law an amendment to
Chapter 458 (Taxation), Article XI, creating a targeted business investment
real property tax exemption. Pursuant to the provisions of New York State
Real Property Tax Law § 485-b(11), a Town may opt out of the restricted
exemptions enacted by the county by local law. The Town Board of the
Town of Babylon has determined that it is in the best interest of the Town
to maintain the status quo and continue to utilize the business investment
exemption pursuant to the schedule set forth in Real Property Tax Law
§ 485(b)(2)(a)(iii). In furtherance of this objective, the Town Board hereby
enacts the following article pursuant to the authority provided under Real
Property Tax Law § 485(b)(ii).
§ 195-25. Exemption granted.
A. Real property constructed, altered, installed or improved subsequent to
the first day of July, 1976 for the purpose of commercial, business or
industrial activity shall be exempt from taxation and special ad valorem
levies, except for special ad valorem levies for fire district, fire
protection district and fire alarm district purposes, to the extent
hereinafter provided.
B. Computation; exceptions; applicability.
(1) Computation of exemption.
(a) Such real property shall be exempt for a period of one year to
the extent of 50% of the increase in assessed value thereof
attributable to such construction, alteration, installation or
improvement and for an additional period of nine years;
provided, however, that the extent of such exemption shall be
decreased by 5% each year during such additional period of
nine years, and such exemption shall be computed with respect
to the exemption base. The "exemptions base" shall be the
increase in assessed value as determined in the initial year of
such ten-year period following the filing of an original
application, except as provided in Subsection B(1)(b) of this
subsection.
(b) In any year in which a change in level of assessment of 15% or
more is certified for a final assessment roll pursuant to the
rules of the state board, the exemption base shall be multiplied
by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the total
assessed value of the parcel on such final assessment roll (after
accounting for any physical or quantity changes to the parcel
since the immediately preceding assessment roll) and the
§ 195-24 SEWERS § 195-25
181:793
denominator of which shall be the total assessed value of the
parcel on the immediately preceding final assessment roll.
The result shall be the new exemption base. The exemption
shall thereupon be recomputed to take into account the new
exemption base, notwithstanding the fact that the Assessor

be exempt from taxation of county, Town and school levies to the extent
provided hereinafter. After a public hearing, the governing board of an
eligible municipality may adopt a local law and a school district may adopt
a resolution to grant the exemption authorized pursuant to this act. A copy
of such local law or resolution shall be filed with the commissioner of
taxation and finance and the assessor of such municipality who prepares the
assessment roll on which the taxes of such municipality or school district
are levied.
§ 195-44. Eligibility.
To be eligible for the tax exemption authorized by an eligible municipality
or school district pursuant to § 195-43, such primary residence shall have
been owner-occupied by the same owner immediately prior to Superstorm
Sandy and immediately after reconstruction with a certificate of occupancy,
and have already received assessment relief pursuant to Chapter 424 of the
Laws of 2013.
§ 195-45. Extent of exemption.
Such primary residence shall be exempt for a period of one year to the
extent of 100% of the increase in assessed value thereof attributable to such
reconstruction, alteration or improvement and for an additional period of
seven years subject to the following:

commissioner of taxation and finance, the exemption base shall be
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the total

authorized pursuant to this act may limit eligibility for the exemption to
those forms of reconstruction, alterations or improvements as are
prescribed in such local law or resolution; provided, however, that in no
case shall such exemption be granted for reconstruction, alterations or
improvements to aspects of a primary residence not in existence or
otherwise not a part of the primary residence prior to October 29, 2012.
§ 195-47. Application. [Amended 12-5-2018 by L.L. No. 21-2018]
Application for such exemption shall be filed with the assessor of an eligible
municipality by the first of March after the adoption of a local law or
preceding final assessment roll. The result shall be the new exemption
base. The exemption shall thereupon be recomputed to take into
account the new exemption base, notwithstanding the fact that the
assessor of such municipality receives certification of the change in
level of assessment after the completion, verification and filing of the
final assessment roll. In the event the assessor of such municipality
does not have custody of the final assessment roll when such
certification is received, the assessor of such municipality shall certify
the recomputed exemption to the local officers having custody and
control of the final assessment roll, and such local officers are hereby
directed and authorized to enter the recomputed exemption certified
by the assessor of such municipality on the final assessment roll. The
assessor of such municipality shall give written notice of such
recomputed exemption to the property owner, who may, if he or she
believes that the exemption was recomputed incorrectly, apply for a
correction in the manner provided by Title 3 of Article 5 of the Real
Property Tax Law for the correction of clerical errors.
C. Such exemption shall be applied to the difference in the pre-storm
assessed value and the increased assessed value attributable to all the
reconstruction, alterations or improvements due to Superstorm Sandy.
For the purposes of this section, the market value of the reconstruction,
alteration or improvement shall be equal to the increased assessed
value attributable to such reconstruction, alteration or improvement
divided by the Class I ratio in a special assessing unit or the most
recently established state equalization rate or special equalization rate
in the remainder of the state, except where the state equalization rate
or special equalization rate equals or exceeds 95%, in which case the
increase in assessed value attributable to such reconstruction,
alteration or improvement shall be deemed to equal the market value of

building or structure designed and occupied exclusively for residential
purposes by not more than three families, and occupied by the owner as a
primary residence.
§ 195-50. Cessation of exemption.
In the event that a primary residence granted an exemption pursuant to
this article ceases to be used as a primary residence of the owner, or the
title thereto is transferred, the exemption granted pursuant to this article
shall cease. However, the exemption granted pursuant to this article shall
continue for the remaining exemption period for as long as an heir-at-law or
distributee of such owner occupies the property as a primary residence.

pursuant to this article until the expiration of the period for which such
exemption was granted.

This article shall take effect immediately and shall apply to exemption
applications made prior to the first of March next succeeding the date on
which this article shall have become a law and no later than March 1, 2020,

ARTICLE II
Booting
[Adopted 6-6-2000 by L.L. No. 15-2000]
§ 198-41. Legislative intent.
The Town Clerk has received complaints f rom consumers who maintained
that their vehicles had been legally parked when boots were applied, that
no signs had been posted indicating that vehicles would be booted if they
were improperly parked or that the booting personnel were abusive and
unresponsive. By far, the largest portion of these complaints concerned the
booting of motor vehicles on private parking lots serving stores and other
business establishments where motorists were forced not only to pay high
booting charges to have their vehicles released, but also to pay charges
for both the booting and the subsequent towing of their vehicles. Since
booting is currently an unlicensed activity, the Town Clerk has been unable
to mediate any of these consumer complaints. This article would authorize
the Town Clerk to license private persons who boot motor vehicles, and
thereby hear and respond to complaints, and provide for sanctions for any
violation of this article and establish certain standards for any violation
of this article. It would also govern booting activities, thereby helping to
ensure that licensed companies do not wrongfully boot motor vehicles or
engage in booting in such a manner as to endanger the public safety. The
Board further finds that the licensing of towing companies will protect the
public from undue inconvenience and potential damage to vehicles caused
by booting.
§ 198-42. Booting of improperly parked motor vehicles.
A. Definitions. For the purposes of this article, the following terms shall
have the following meanings:
BOOT or BOOTING  The act of placing on a parked motor vehicle
a mechanical device that is designed to be attached to the wheel or
tire or other part of such vehicle so as to prohibit its usual manner of
movement.
PERSON  Any individual, partnership, corporation, association, firm
or other business entity.
B. No person shall engage in booting unless such person is the holder of a
license issued by the Town Clerk as required by § 198-4 of this article.
C. Signs; fees; contract.
(1) No motor vehicle may be booted unless a sufficient number of signs
are conspicuously posted and maintained by the owner of the
property in the form, manner and location prescribed by the
Commissioner of Planning and Development and this subsection.
Such signs shall contain such information as the Commissioner of
Planning and Development shall prescribe, including but not
limited to the word "warning;" the name, business address,

has been authorized to boot such motor vehicle pursuant to a
written contract between such licensee and the owner, lessee,
managing agent or other person in control of the property on which
such motor vehicle is parked, which contract shall be filed by the
licensee in the office of the Town Clerk, together with a schedule of
fees which may be imposed pursuant to § 198-42C(1) and (2) prior

and stating the date and time the vehicle was booted and the name,
business address and the license number of the person who booted
such vehicle as well as a business telephone number which will
facilitate the dispatch of personnel responsible for removing the boot.
F. No release or waiver of any kind purporting to limit or avoid liability for
damages to a vehicle that has been booted shall be valid. In addition,
any person who booted a vehicle, or other person authorized to accept
payment of any charges for such booting, shall provide a signed receipt
to the individual paying the booting charges at the time such charges
are paid. Such receipt shall state the name, business address, business
telephone number and license number of the person who has booted
such vehicle as such information appears on the license to engage in
booting, and such receipt shall also include the date and time that the
boot was removed and a telephone number for the office within the
Town Clerk's office responsible for receiving complaints with respect to
booting.
G. No charge shall be imposed for the booting of a vehicle when any

§ 213-11. Creation. [Added 4-26-2005 by L.L. No. 6-2005]
The Town Board hereby supersedes, pursuant to its powers set forth in § 10
of the Municipal Home Rule Law, § 267(2) of the Town Law, which limits
the Board of Appeals to three or five members, and § 267(11) of the Town
Law, which only allows for alternate members to serve where a conflict of
interest is involved. There shall be a Board of Appeals consisting of seven
members appointed by the Town Board. There shall also be up to three
alternate members who may serve when a member has a conflict of interest
or is absent or when a vacancy on the Board occurs. Such Board of Appeals
shall, consistent with Town Law, determine its own rules and procedure, the
manner in which appeals shall be brought before it and what notice shall
be given of proceedings before it. The Board of Appeals shall investigate
and report upon all matters referred to it by the Town Board. The Board of
Appeals shall have the powers granted by the Town Law and the following
powers.
§ 213-12. Variance powers.
Where there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the way
of carrying out the strict letter of these regulations, the Board of Appeals
shall have power to vary or modify the application of such regulations so
that the spirit of the chapter shall be observed, public safety and welfare
secured and substantial justice done.
§ 213-13. Authorization of permissive uses.
Whenever a use or the location thereof is permitted only if the Board of
Appeals shall approve thereof, the Board of Appeals may, in a specific case
and after notice and public hearing, authorize such permissive use and its
location within the district in which this chapter specifies the permissive
use may be located, subject, however, to the following:
A. Before such approval shall be given, the Board of Appeals shall
determine:
(1) That the use will not prevent the orderly and reasonable use of
adjacent properties or of properties in adjacent use districts.
(2) That the use will not prevent the orderly and reasonable use of
permitted or legally established uses in the district wherein the
proposed use is to be located or of permitted or legally established
uses in adjacent use districts.
(3) That the safety, the health, the welfare, the comfort, the
convenience or the order of the Town will not be adversely affected
by the proposed use and its location.
§ 213-11 WATER § 213-13
211:867
(4) That the use will be in harmony with and promote the general
purposes and intent of this chapter.
B. In making such determination, the Board of Appeals shall also give
consideration, among other things, to:
(1) The character of the existing and probable development of uses in
the district and the peculiar suitability of such district for the
location of any of such permissive uses.
(2) The conservation of property values and the encouragement of the
most appropriate uses of land.
(3) The effect that the location of the proposed use may have upon the
creation or undue increase of vehicular traffic congestion on public
streets or highways.
(4) The availability of adequate and proper public or private facilities
for the treatment, removal or discharge of sewage, refuse or other
effluent (whether liquid, solid, gaseous or otherwise) that may be
caused or created by or as a result of the use.
(5) Whether the use or materials incidental thereto or produced
thereby may give off obnoxious gases, odors, smoke or soot.
(6) Whether the use will cause disturbing emissions of electrical
discharges, dust, light, vibration or noise.
(7) Whether the operations in pursuance of the use will cause undue
interference with the orderly enjoyment by the public of parking or
of recreational facilities, if existing, or if proposed by the Town or
by other competent governmental agency.
(8) The necessity for bituminous surfaced space for purposes of offstreet
parking of vehicles incidental to the use and whether such
space is reasonably adequate and appropriate and can be furnished
by the owner of the plot sought to be used within or adjacent to the
plot wherein the use shall be had.
(9) Whether a hazard to life, limb or property because of fire, flood,
erosion or panic may be created by reason or as a result of the use,
or by the structures to be used therefor, or by the inaccessibility of
the property or structures thereon for the convenient entry and
operation of fire and other emergency apparatus or by the undue
concentration or assemblage of persons upon such plot.
(10) Whether the use or the structures to be used therefor will cause an
overcrowding of the land or undue concentration of population.
(11) Whether the plot area is sufficient, appropriate and adequate for
the use and the reasonably anticipated operation and expansion
thereof.

Every variance or permissive use granted or denied by the Board of Appeals
shall be based upon and accompanied by specific findings supported by
evidence produced at a public hearing. In the case of a variance, the
decision shall set forth whether or not there are unique circumstances of
the particular case as measured by the criteria set forth in § 213-13, so
as to constitute practical difficulties or unnecessary hardship in the way
of carrying out the strict letter of the Zoning Ordinance. In the case of
a permissive use, the decision shall set forth whether or not the criteria
of § 213-13 for the granting of a permissive use have been met and the
determinations of the Board with respect to matters upon which the Zoning
Ordinance requires Board of Appeals consideration. The determination of
the Board of Appeals shall be made at the time of the decision to grant or

such conditions and safeguards as it may deem appropriate, necessary
or desirable to preserve and protect the spirit and objectives of this
chapter. Such permits may be granted for a temporary period or
permanently, as determined by the Board of Appeals. If granted for a
temporary period, the application for extension of same will be subject
to a public hearing as required in the original application. [Amended

or otherwise, into smaller plots which will result in the creation of one
or more undersized or substandard sized plots with relation to area and
street frontage requirements of this chapter in force at the time of such
subdivision, and any plot so created shall be deemed to be in violation of
this chapter, and said violation shall be deemed to extend and apply to all
newly created lots out of the original plot subdivided, whether or not one or
more of the newly created plots is technically in conformity with the thenexisting

9-21-2004 by L.L. No. 27-2004; 10-6-2009 by L.L. No. 22-2009]
The Town Board finds that the proliferation of vacant and abandoned
buildings, structures and dwellings in the Town of Babylon causes a
deterioration of communities and areas within the Town of Babylon and has
a negative impact on the value of property in close proximity to the vacant
and abandoned buildings, structures and dwellings. Furthermore, the Town
Board finds that vacant and abandoned buildings, structures and dwellings
have caused a serious threat to the safety and welfare of the residents of
the Town and had eroded the quality of life of all who live and work in
the Town. Abandoned and vacant buildings, structures and dwellings are
places of infestation of rodents, vermin, insects, wild animals and other
health-threatening creatures and diseases, provide shelter to criminals and
vagrants who use such places to evade the police and to conduct illicit
activities, and are an attractive nuisance to children and adults alike.

B. In the event the provisions of NFPA 13 conflict with the International
Fire Code (IFC), the more restrictive provision shall apply.
A. No building or other structure which has been damaged by fire or other
causes to the extent of more than 50% of its value, exclusive of
foundation, shall be repaired or rebuilt except in conformity with the
regulations of this chapter and the Building Code.
B. Vacant or abandoned buildings, structures and dwellings may not be
boarded up, or have the doors, windows, entrances and exits concealed,
covered, obscured or hidden in any manner, except in an emergency
and then for a period not to exceed 30 days.
C. Annual registration of vacant buildings and registration fees.
(1) Purpose. The purpose of this section requiring the registration of
all vacant buildings, including dwellings as referenced below, and
the payment of registration fees is to assist the Town in protecting
the public health, safety and welfare, to monitor the number of
vacant buildings in the Town, to assess the effects of the condition
of those buildings on nearby businesses and the neighborhoods in
which they are located, particularly in light of firesafety hazards
and unlawful, temporary occupancy by transients, including illicit
drug users and traffickers, and to require of the owners of such
vacant buildings their registration and the payment of related fees,
and to promote substantial efforts to rehabilitate such vacant
buildings. The provisions of this section are applicable to the
owners of such vacant buildings as set forth herein and are in
addition to and not in lieu of any and all other applicable provisions
§ 213-235 BABYLON CODE § 213-236
211:982
of this chapter, the health and sanitation code, and any other
applicable provisions of the Babylon Town Code.

211:984
an emergency affecting the public health, safety or welfare and
for the purposes of service of any and all notices or registration
statements as herein authorized and in connection herewith.
Registration shall be required for all vacant buildings, whether
vacant and secure, vacant and open or vacant and boarded,
and shall be required whenever any building has remained
vacant for 45 consecutive days or more. In no instance shall
the registration of a vacant building and the payment of
registration fees be construed to exonerate the owner, agent
or responsible party from responsibility for compliance with
any other building code or housing code requirement. One
registration statement may be filed to include all vacant
buildings of the owner so registering. The owner of the vacant
property shall be responsible for the payment of the
nonrefundable registration fee. Said fee shall be billed by the
Town Clerk and based on the duration of the vacancy as
determined by the following scale: [Amended 1-27-2015 by
L.L. No. 1-2015]
[1] For properties that are vacant for less than one year: $100.

anniversary: $5,000; plus an additional $500 for each year
in excess of 10 years.
(3) Appeal rights. The owner shall have the right to appeal the
imposition of the registration fees to the Commissioner of Planning
and Development, upon filing an application in writing with the
applicable nonrefundable filing fee of $50 to the Town Clerk no
later than thirty 30 calendar days from the date of the billing
statement. On appeal, the owner shall bear the burden of providing
satisfactory objective proof of occupancy, as defined herein.
(4) One-time waiver of registration fee. A one-time waiver of the
registration fee for up to 90 days may be granted by the Chief
Building Inspector upon application of the owner and upon review
and advice of the Town Attorney's Office, within 30 calendar days
from the date of the bill for the registration fee, or if denied by the
Chief Building Inspector, upon appeal to the Commissioner of
Planning and Development, if the owner:
§ 213-236 WATER § 213-236
211:985
(a) Demonstrates with satisfactory proof that he/she is in the
process of demolition, rehabilitation, or other substantial
repair of the vacant building; and
(b) Objectively demonstrates the anticipated length of time for the
demolition, rehabilitation, or other substantial repair of the
vacant building; or
(c) Provides satisfactory proof that he/she was actively attempting
to sell or lease the property during the vacancy period;
(d) Has paid all past due vacant registration fees and all other
financial obligations and/or debts owed to the Town which are

(5) Two-year waiver. Upon application by the owner and satisfaction of
Subsection C(4) above, the licenses and inspection review board
may grant a one-time two-year waiver of the registration fee, or if
denied by the Chief Building Inspector, upon appeal to the
Commissioner of Planning and Development, if the owner meets
the criteria for nonprofit organizations as defined by section
501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.
(6) Delinquent registration fees as a lien. After the owner is given
notice of the amount of the registration fee due, except for those
owners that have properly perfected an appeal as provided above,
and the owner fails to pay the amount due, said amount shall
constitute a debt due and owing to the Town, and the Town may
commence a civil action to collect such unpaid debt.
(7) Delinquent registration fees as a lien.
(a) After the owner is given notice of the amount of the
registration fee due, except for those owners that have
properly perfected an appeal as provided above, and the owner
fails to pay the amount due, said amount shall constitute a debt
due and owing to the Town;
(b) Duty to amend registration statement. If the status of the
registration information changes during the course of any
calendar year, it is the responsibility of the owner, responsible
party or agent for the same to contact the Town Clerk within 30
days of the occurrence of such changes and advise the Town
Clerk in writing of those changes;

No. 11-1993; amended 7-15-2008 by L.L. No. 18-2008]
A. Purpose.
(1) The general purpose of this section is to protect the environment,
protect and promote the public health, safety and welfare, the
quality of life, and the ability to view the night sky by establishing
provisions and a process for review of exterior lighting.
(2) This section establishes provisions for exterior lighting in order to
accomplish the following:
(a) To provide safe roadways for motorists, cyclists and
pedestrians.
(b) To protect against direct glare and excessive lighting.
(c) To ensure that sufficient lighting can be provided where
needed to promote safety and security.
(d) To prevent light trespass in all areas of the Town.
(e) To protect and reclaim the ability to view the night sky.
(f) To allow the flexibility in the style of lighting fixtures.
(g) To provide lighting guidelines.
(h) To discourage the wasting of energy used to produce excessive
lighting.
(i) To provide assistance to property owners and occupants in
bringing nonconforming lighting into conformance with this
section.
(j) To minimize the impact of stray lighting on human health,
habitat and environment.
B. Definitions. As used in this section, unless otherwise expressly stated,
the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:
AREA LIGHT  A luminaire designed for illumination of a broad area.
Area lights include, but are not limited to, streetlights, parking lot lights
and yard lights over 1,800 (100 watts incandescent) lumens.
AVERAGE HORIZONTAL FOOTCANDLE  The average level of
illuminance for a given situation measured at ground level with the
light meter placed parallel to the ground.
ESSENTIAL LIGHTING  Lighting that is used for a specified period of
time, which is necessary for a specific task or purpose while said task
118. Editor's Note: Former § 213-245, Use of tidal lands, was repealed 4-8-1988 by L.L. No.

§ 213-245 WATER § 213-245
211:989
or purpose is actively being performed. This includes lighting that is
necessary to promote public safety or facilitate public circulation.
EXCESSIVE LIGHTING  Illuminance levels beyond that which is
required for safety, as is indicated on the Table of Limits of Illumination
Levels. (See Table 3 at the end of this chapter).119
EXTERIOR LIGHTING  Temporary or permanent lighting equipment
that is installed, located or used in such a manner with the intention to
cause light rays to shine outdoors. Luminaires located indoors that are
intended to light something outside are considered exterior lighting for
the purposes of this section.
FIXTURE (also called "luminaire")  The bulb, the assembly that holds
the bulb (or lamp) in a lighting system, and the mounting apparatus,
including reflecting elements, shielding elements, cover glass or lenses,
the ballast, and the housing.
FLOODLIGHT  A fixture rated to produce over 1,800 lumens (100
watts incandescent), regardless of the number of bulbs, and is designed
to flood an area with light.
FOOTCANDLE (FC)  The American unit of illuminance (the amount of
light falling on a surface). One footcandle is approximately equal to the
illuminance produced by a light source of one candle, measured on a
surface one foot away from the source. Horizontal footcandles measure
the illumination striking a horizontal plane. Footcandle values can be
measured directly with certain handheld incident light meters.
FULL CUTOFF (FCO)  A classification for a luminaire designed and
installed where no light is emitted at or above a horizontal plane
running through the lowest point on the luminaire. In addition, the
luminous intensity (as measured in candelas) emitted at any angle
from 80° up to 90° cannot exceed a numerical value equal to 10%
of the lumen rating of the lamp, as reported in a photometric report
from the manufacturer as produced by an independent lab. A cutoff, or
semicutoff, design allows a restricted amount of light emitted above the
horizontal, and a noncutoff provides no restriction against light emitted
above the horizontal.
FULLY SHIELDED  A luminaire constructed, lamped, and installed
in such a manner that all light emitted by it, either directly from the
lamp or a diffusing element, or indirectly by reflection or refraction
from any part of the luminaire, is projected below the horizontal. A full
cutoff fixture is also fully shielded, but without any restrictions on light
distribution below the horizontal plane, and it can be identified without
a manufacturer's report.
GLARE  Stray, unshielded light striking the eye that may result in:
(1) Nuisance or annoyance, such as light falling across property lines;
119. Editor's Note: Table 3 is available in the Town offices.
§ 213-245 BABYLON CODE § 213-245
211:990
HID LIGHTING  A family of bulb types known as "high-intensity
discharge," including high-pressure sodium, mercury vapor, and metal
halide. These types require a warmup time, usually require a ballast,
and have a higher lumen output per wan than incandescent or halogen
lamps.
HOLIDAY LIGHTING  Temporary lights used to celebrate holidays.
Holiday lighting includes, but is not limited to, strings of small
individual lights, illuminated menorahs, illuminated nativity scenes,
illuminated candles, and various yard decorations seasonal in nature.
IESNA  Illuminating Engineering Society of North America (IES or
IESNA), an organization that establishes updated standards and
illumination guidelines for the lighting industry.
IESNA RECOMMENDED PRACTICES  The publications of the IESNA
setting forth illuminance levels for different task areas, e.g., walkways,
streets, sportslights, etc.
ILLUMINANCE  The density of light falling on any point of a surface,
usually measured in footcandles in the United States. See "footcandle."
LAMP  The generic term for an artificial light source, to be
distinguished from the whole assembly (see "fixture"); commonly
referred to as the "light bulb."
LIGHT  The form of radiant energy acting on the retina of the eye to
make sight possible.
LIGHTING ASSEMBLY  Any or all parts of a luminaire that function to
produce light, including the bulb, assembly, ballast, mounting features
and/or pole.
LIGHT POLLUTION  Any adverse effect of man-made light, including
but not limited to glare, light trespass, skyglow, visual clutter, wasted
energy due to excessive or unnecessary lighting, or any man-made light
that unnecessarily diminishes the ability to view the night sky or is
disruptive to flora and fauna.
LIGHT TRESPASS  Light projected onto the property of another or
into the public right-of-way when it is not required or permitted to do
so.
LUMEN  A unit used to measure the actual amount of light that is
produced by a bulb. The lumen quantifies the amount of light energy
produced by a lamp at the lamp, not by the energy input, which is
indicated by the wattage. For example, a seventy-five-watt
incandescent lamp can produce 1,000 lumens, while a seventy-watt

Disability, such as bright light reducing the ability of the eyes to see
into shadows and visual performance; or
(3)
(4) Distracting light which diverts the eye from a visual task.
§ 213-245 WATER § 213-245
211:991
high-pressure sodium lamp produces 6,000 lumens. Lumen output is
listed by the manufacturer on the light bulb packaging.
LUMINAIRE  The complete lighting assembly (including the lamp,
housing, ballasts, photocells, reflectors, lenses and shields), including
the support assembly (pole or mounting bracket); a light fixture. For
purposes of determining total light output from a luminaire or light
fixture, lighting assemblies which include multiple unshielded or
partially shielded lamps on a single pole or standard shall be considered
as a single unit.
LUMINANCE  The brightness of a source of light.
MOUNTING HEIGHT  The distance from natural grade to the lowest
light-emitting part of the luminaire.
NONCONFORMING LIGHTING  Lighting which does not meet the
requirements and specifications contained herein.
NONESSENTIAL LIGHTING  Lighting which is unnecessary and not
generally useful (e.g., decorative and landscape lighting). This includes
lighting intended for a specific task or purpose when said task or
purpose is not being actively performed (e.g., parking lot illumination
and wall-mounted perimeter lights after business hours).
PARTIALLY SHIELDED  A luminaire which is not fully shielded but
incorporates a partial shield around the lamp.
PHOTOMETRICS  Technical test reports that indicate light
distribution and performance from a luminaire. Photometric reports
may include candlepower distribution data, cutoff classifications,
footcandle charts, etc. These are generally available from the luminaire
manufacturers.
REPAIR OF A LUMINAIRE OR SIGN  Any service normally provided
by a licensed electrician upon a luminaire or sign. Repair shall be
considered to include replacement or modification of any of the
following: poles, mounting arms, housings, hardware, wiring, ballasts,
lenses, reflectors, diffusers, baffles, shields, sensors, switches, relays,
power supplies, and lamp replacement modules which contain any of
the items listed above. Replacement of a user-serviceable lamp will not
by itself be considered a repair.
SKYGLOW  The overhead glow from light emitted sideways and
upwards, including light reflected upward from the ground or other
surfaces. Skyglow is caused by the reflection and scattering of various
forms of light by dust, water, and other particles suspended in the
atmosphere. Among other effects, skyglow reduces one's ability to
view the night sky. Different sources of light, in equal quantities, can
contribute differently to skyglow.
TEMPORARY LIGHTING  Lighting that is intended to be used for a
specific event and removed within seven days thereafter.
§ 213-245 BABYLON CODE § 213-245
211:992
UNIFORMITY RATIO (U RATIO)  A ratio that describes uniformity
of illuminance across an area. The uniformity ratio may be a ratio
of the maximum-to-minimum illuminance or the average-to-minimum
illuminance. For example, if the Illuminating Engineering Society
recommends an average-to-minimum ratio of 4:1 for a parking lot,
the minimum illuminance should be no less than 1/4 of the average
illuminance across the parking lot.
UNSHIELDED FIXTURE  A fixture which, as designed or installed,
emits all or part of the light emissions above the lowest light-emitting
part of the fixture.
C. Applicability; nonconforming lighting; exceptions.
(1) All exterior lighting, installed, replaced, altered, changed, repaired
or relocated after the effective date of this section shall conform to
the provisions established by this section except as provided
hereto.
(2) Existing exterior lighting in conflict with this section shall be
classified as "nonconforming." All exterior lighting existing or
installed prior to the date of the adoption herein, which does not
conform with the provisions of the article, shall be exempt,
provided that the following requirements are met:
(a) Upon adoption of this section, with any installation,
replacement, alteration, change, repair, or relocation of any
nonconforming luminaire, such luminaire shall be brought in
compliance with the terms of this section.
(b) To the extent that preexisting residential exterior floodlights
can accommodate lamps of a total of less than 1,800 lumens
(100 watt incandescent), said exterior lighting shall be
equipped with a lamp or lamps of a total of less than 1,800
lumens (100 watt incandescent) per fixture and, to the extent
possible, be angled downward, such that the center beam is
not directed above a forty-five-degree angle measured from the
vertical line drawn from the center of the lamp to the ground
and so as not to cause glare, light trespass, or beam spread
beyond the intended target or across property lines. Operable
photocells, motion sensors, timers that allow a light to go on at
dusk and off by 11:00 p.m., as well as retrofit shields, are
encouraged to alleviate nuisance and disability glare.
(3) Exceptions. Any outdoor lighting, whether residential, commercial,
institutional and privately or publicly owned, which is lawfully in
existence prior to the effective date of this section, shall be exempt
from the provisions of this section under the following conditions:
(a) Unshielded residential luminaires. Unshielded residential
luminaires equal to one sixty-watt incandescent lamp per
§ 213-245 WATER § 213-245
211:993
fixture, regardless of number of lamps, are allowed, provided
light trespass limitations are met.
(b) Vehicular lights and all temporary emergency lighting needed
by the fire, ambulance, police departments or other emergency
services are exempt.
(c) Residential sensor-activated luminaires, provided:
[1] The luminaire is operational and located in such a manner,
or shielded, to prevent glare and light trespass;
[2] The luminaire is set to only go on when activated and to go
off within five minutes after activation has ceased; and
[3] The sensor shall not be triggered by activity off the

[4] The luminaire output, regardless of the number of lamps,
does not exceed 1,800 lumens (100 watts incandescent).
(d) Illumination of signs permitted pursuant to the Town of
Babylon, Chapter 213, Zoning, Article XXXIII, Signs, and any
amendments made hereto.
(e) In situations of lighted flags which are not illuminated with
"downward" lighting, upward lighting may be used in the form
of a single ground-mounted narrow cone spotlight which
confines the illumination to the flag, provided the lumen output
is no more than 1,300 lumens, regardless of the number of
lamps. The Town encourages the tradition of lowering flags at
sunset to avoid the need for lighting.
(f) Lighting of radio, communication and navigation towers is
allowed, provided the owner or occupant demonstrates that
the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations can only
be met through the use of lighting that does not comply with
this section and that the provisions of this section are
otherwise met to the fullest extent possible. Tower lighting
shall not be permitted unless required by the FAA, in which
case, required lighting shall be of the lowest allowed intensity
and red, unless specifically forbidden under FAA requirements.
Towers which are constructed no higher than 199 feet are
preferable to avoid the need for FAA lighting.
(g) Installation and replacement of municipal streetlights which
are designated as "historic" or are decorative in nature, if part
of a continuous lighting design scheme where the replacement
of the luminaire on a piecemeal basis with compliant

ARTICLE XIXA
Tobacco Advertising
[Added 4-18-2000 by L.L. No. 10-2000]
§ 213-252. Tobacco advertising restrictions.
A. Legislative intent and findings.
(1) The Town Board and the staff of the Town of Babylon reviewed land
use studies of the location of tobacco advertising in proximity to
schools, parks and child day-care centers. In addition, the Town has
examined the actions and codes of other municipalities including
the City of New York and the City of Long Beach.
(2) The Town Board of the Town of Babylon finds that restricting the
exposure of minors to advertising regarding tobacco and tobacco
products is constitutional when achieved through reasonable
targeted limitations on such advertising in the vicinity of schools
and other locations where it is well established that children tend
to congregate. It is the intention of the Town Board to enhance and
augment compliance with and enforcement of federal, state and
local laws prohibiting the sale or distribution of tobacco products to
minors, and to protect such minors against such illegal sales.
(3) The Center for Disease Control and Prevention has reported that
while the rate of adult smoking of tobacco products has decreased
nationwide by 50% between 1971 and 1993, the rate of smoking
among all high school students has increased by 26% during the
years 1991 and 1996, and now stands at the highest rate since
1981. It is further noted that this dramatic increase has occurred
contrary to and at variance with the laws of all 50 states prohibiting
sale and distribution of tobacco products to minors, and the pledge
of all tobacco product manufacturers to adhere to a voluntary
industry code prohibiting advertising of such products in a manner
appealing to minors.
(4) In 1991, a study of the Journal of the American Medical Association
concluded that "...cigarette advertising encourages youth to smoke
and should be banned." In 1994, a report of the National Institute
of Medicine stated that, "...the substantial convergent evidence
that advertising and promotion increase tobacco use by youth is
impressive and...provided a strong basis for legal regulation." In
1995, a report of the federal Center for Disease Control and
Prevention found that "...cigarette marketing practices appeared to
be the most likely account for [the] increase in teen smoking
initiation rates."
(5) In 1997, Liggett & Myers, Inc., a cigarette manufacturer, made the
following acknowledgement in executing a settlement agreement
with the Attorney Generals of 17 states, including the State of New
§ 213-252 WATER § 213-252
211:1007
York, "...Liggett acknowledges that the tobacco industry markets to
'youth,' which means those under 18 years of age...."
(6) Based upon the preponderance of the evidence that tobacco
products are advertised and promoted to minors, and that the rate
of use of tobacco products by minors has drastically increased
contrary to legislation prohibiting the sale or distribution of such
products to minors, the Town Board of the Town of Babylon hereby
finds and declares it to be in the best interests of minors residing
and/or otherwise present within the Town to enact affirmative,
reasonable and constitutionally permissible restrictions on the
advertising of tobacco products.
(7) By enacting this legislation, it is the intent of the Town Board to
promote compliance with an enforcement of federal, state and local
laws prohibiting sale or distribution of tobacco products to minors,
and therefore, in deference to the protections afforded by the First
Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, this
legislation has been narrowly crafted to place reasonable time,
place and manner restrictions on such advertising in those
locations where it is well established that minors tend to
congregate, while not imposing restrictions on such advertising
clearly directed to adults.

§ 213-278. Legislative intent and purpose.
A. The Town Board of the Town of Babylon hereby has determined that:
132. Editor's Note: This local law superseded former Art. XXII, Transfer Stations, added
3-12-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996, as amended.
§ 213-277 WATER § 213-278
211:1023
§ 213-279. Geographic restrictions; local approvals required.
(1) The management of solid waste and recyclable materials is a
fundamental municipal function of Town government having been
codified pursuant to Chapter 133, Solid Waste Management, of the
Code of the Town of Babylon. Chapter 133, Solid Waste
Management, provides the Town of Babylon with the statutory
authority to manage and supervise the transportation, disposition
and collection of solid waste on a Town-wide basis with the purpose
of protecting the safety, health and well-being of people and
property within the Town of Babylon.
(2) It is incumbent upon the municipality responsible for managing the
collection of solid waste and recyclable materials to provide and/or
permit the infrastructure necessary for the orderly and efficient
collection and transportation of solid waste within said
municipality. The establishment of transfer stations and recycled
materials management (RMM) facilities is a necessary component
of a municipality's solid waste infrastructure.
(3) Transfer stations, scrap metal processing facilities and RMM
facilities are highly intensive uses that have been associated with a
multitude of environmental impacts and land use conflicts. Further,
the type and volume of material passing through a transfer station,
scrap metal processing facility or RMM facility directly correlates
with the degree of impacts associated with the facility.
(4) Impacts and land use conflicts associated with transfer stations,
scrap metal processing facilities and RMM facilities can be
managed by:
(a) Determining appropriate geographic locations for siting
transfer stations and recyclable materials management
facilities and restricting the location of such facilities to these
areas.
(b) The establishment of operational, mitigative and performance
standards governing the operation of transfer stations and
RMM facilities.
(c) Maintaining strict local oversight of transfer stations and RMM
facilities operating within the Town of Babylon to ensure
operational and performance standards are met, and potential
impacts to abutting properties are being adequately mitigated.
B. The purpose of this article is to establish geographic requirements,
restrictions, performance standards and regulatory controls to mitigate
to the greatest extent possible known impacts associated with the
operation of transfer stations, scrap metal processing facilities and
RMM facilities within the Town of Babylon.

(9) Whether a hazard to life, limb or property because of fire, flood,
erosion or panic may be created by reason or as a result of the use,

verdant and park-like and to provide quality development, landscaping
and attractive streetscapes as an overall objective in the Town of
Babylon.
B. The Town of Babylon has taken numerous measures as part of this
overall comprehensive strategy to implement both through regulations
of private land use and by the public improvements made in each
community.
C. The Town Board has determined that landscaping, natural plantings.
buffer zones, screening, including buffer fencing, grass/sod and the
like, which are not maintained in good order and condition, can create
hazardous, unsanitary or visual blight offensive to those who reside,
work, travel and do business in the Town and can have a negative
economic, visual and aesthetic impact upon surrounding properties.
D. It is the intent of this legislation to promote the conservation of

Maintenance Code in all business, industrial and multiple residence
zones, so that all required building structures and landscaping is
maintained in good order and condition.

the health, safety and general welfare of the residents of the Town of
Babylon through the establishment of standards, guidelines and
enforcement mechanisms whereby all landscaped areas required by the
Planning Board shall be maintained in good order and condition in
accordance with all requirements of this Code.

§ 213-369. Findings; intent.
§ 213-370. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
APPLICANT  The owner of real property or their duly authorized
employee, agent or any person or persons acting on their behalf requesting
a land clearing permit for the removal of trees, shrubs and associated
and related vegetation from private or public property, pursuant to the
provisions of this chapter.

number in populated areas and the health, safety and welfare of this
community and as related to the natural, scenic and aesthetic values of
trees and the physical and visual qualities of the environment which the
Town of Babylon is authorized to protect.
B. Trees and such vegetation stabilize the soil and control water pollution
by preventing soil erosion and flooding, yield advantageous
microclimatic effects, provide a natural habitat for wildlife, abate noise,
preserve the balance of oxygen in the air by removing carbon dioxide

and verdure to human construction.

vegetation causes increased governmental costs for proper drainage
control, impairs the benefits of occupancy of existing residential
properties and impairs the stability and value of both improved and
unimproved real property in the area of destruction and adversely
affects the health, safety and general welfare of the inhabitants of the
Town. It is therefore the intent of the Town to enact regulations, special
conditions and restrictions regarding the removal or destruction of
trees or the substantial alteration of grade level around trees to provide
for the protection and conservation of trees and related vegetation in
support of the health, safety and general welfare of Town residents.

Adult Use District
[Added 12-15-1987 by L.L. No. 11-1987; amended 5-24-2005 by L.L.
No. 9-2005]
§ 213-376. Legislative intent and purpose.
The Town Board has conducted an extensive review of land use studies
concerning secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses in other
municipalities, including the Town of Huntington, Town of Islip and the City
of New York, and has further prepared maps to set forth the locations where
adult uses would be permissible pursuant to certain proposed regulations.
From a review of these studies, and the testimony of its residents, the Town
Board finds the following:
§ 213-377. Definitions and word usage. [Amended 7-19-2005 by L.L.
No. 19-2005; 11-8-2007 by L.L. No. 21-2007; 11-17-2010 by L.L. No.
35-2010; 5-22-2012 by L.L. No. 4-2012]
A. Some uses, due to their very nature, have characteristics which cause,
or tend to cause, secondary adverse impacts upon the community and
have a deleterious effect on both surrounding businesses and
residential areas, such as increased crime and downgraded property
values. Said impacts are heightened by concentration of such uses in
any one area, thereby aggravating deleterious effects on adjacent areas
and other uses.
B. Among such uses are sexually oriented businesses, which have serious
objectionable characteristics, particularly when operated in close
proximity to each other, thereby contributing to crime, lower property
values, blight and downgrading of the quality of life in adjacent areas.
Special regulation of such uses is necessary to ensure that said adverse
secondary impacts do not contribute to blighting or downgrading of
surrounding neighborhoods or land uses.
C. Location of such uses in relation to residential and other areas where
youth may regularly assemble and/or congregate, the general
atmosphere around their operation and their downward impact of
property values, resulting in disinvestment with concomitant social and
economic deterioration, is of great concern to the Town of Babylon.
D. The special regulations set forth hereinbelow are intended to
ameliorate adverse secondary impacts of such uses on adjacent areas
and other land uses, to prevent concentration of such uses in any one
area and to dissuade accessibility to such uses by minors.

Special Exception Use Permits
[Added 4-8-1988 by L.L. No. 2-1988]
§ 213-382. Legislative findings.
§ 213-383. General standards for issuance.
A. It has come to the attention of the Town Board of the Town of Babylon
that there are certain uses of land which, by their very nature, can
disrupt the peaceful, quiet enjoyment of nearby land use. The Town
Board has deemed it necessary to exercise its authority to minimize and
soften the impact of certain uses upon areas where they will be
incompatible unless conditioned in a manner suitable to a particular
location.
B. The Town Board has articulated the standards it will duly consider in
determining the imposition of conditions it may place upon particular
uses of land in order to protect abutting landowners and preserve the
character of the neighborhood within the Town of Babylon.
C. It is the opinion of the Town Board of the Town of Babylon, after
carefully considering the facts and information supplied to it, that it
would be in the best interest of the residents of the Town of Babylon and
for the municipality as a whole to set forth the standards which will be
considered for the issuance of special exception use permits.
A. The conditional uses or special exception uses in this article possess
characteristics of a nature such as to require special review and an
application of special standards and conditions before locating in
districts where they are not permitted by right, in order to assure an
orderly and harmonious arrangement of land uses in the district and in
the community. Such uses may be permitted conditionally by the Town
Board, as specified, after public hearing. A conditional use shall be
authorized by a special use permit, and before such permit is issued,
the Town Board shall find that:
(1) Such use is reasonable, necessary and will be in harmony with and
promote the general interests and welfare of the surrounding
community;
(2) The neighborhood character and surrounding property values are
reasonably safeguarded;
(3) The proposed use will not prevent the orderly and reasonable use
of adjacent property;
(4) The site is particularly suitable for the location of such use in the
community;
§ 213-382 WATER § 213-383
211:1079
(5) The access facilities are adequate for the estimated traffic from
public streets, so as to ensure the public safety and to avoid traffic
congestion;
(6) There is room for creation of off-street parking and truck-loading
spaces at least in the number required by the applicable provisions
of this chapter, but in any case, adequate for the actual anticipated
number of occupants of the proposed use, whether employees,
patrons or visitors, and, further, that the layout of the spaces and
related facilities can be made convenient and conducive to safe
operation;
(7) The proposed use will not pose risks to the public health or safety;
(8) The characteristics of the proposed use are not such that its
proposed location would be unsuitably near to a church, school,
theater, senior citizens' residence, recreational area or other place
of public assembly;
(9) Adequate buffer yards and screening can be provided to protect
adjacent properties and land uses from possible detrimental
impacts of the proposed use;
(10) Adequate provision can and will be made for the collection and
disposal of stormwater runoff, sewage, refuse and other liquid,
solid or gaseous waste which the proposed use will generate;
(11) The natural characteristics of the site are such that the proposed
use may be introduced there without undue disturbance or
destruction of important natural features, systems or processes
and without significant negative impact to groundwater and
surface water on and off the site;
(12) The lot area is sufficient, appropriate and adequate for the use, as
well as reasonably anticipated operation expansion thereof;
(13) The proposed use can and will comply with all provisions of this
chapter and of the code which are applicable to it and can meet
every other applicable federal, state, county and local law,
ordinance, rule or regulation; and
(14) The proposed use will not result in unacceptable levels of noise,
vibration, smoke, dust, odor, fumes or noxious gases, nor negatively
impact upon air quality.

ARTICLE XXXIII
Signs
[Added 6-5-1990; amended 9-25-1990; 3-14-1995 by L.L. No.
6-1995; 6-24-1997 by L.L. No. 8-1997]
§ 213-386. Legislative purpose.
The purpose of this article is to preserve, protect, promote and advance the
public health, safety and welfare by regulating and establishing standards
for the erection of outdoor signs within the Town. The Town Board has
concluded that the character, quality and appearance of the Town and
quality of life of its residents are directly and substantially affected by
the location, height, size, construction and general design of the signs
contained therein. Those signs which exist in harmony with the surrounding
community serve to simultaneously convey the message depicted thereon
while not detracting from the public health, safety and welfare. Conversely,
signs if misplaced, disproportionate to the surrounding environment, in
excessive proliferation or containing excessive lighting or other displaced
fixtures, exist in disharmony to the environment of the Town and constitute
egregious examples of ugliness, distraction and deterioration. Such signs
degrade the aesthetic quality of the environment; detract from natural and
scenic beauty, as well as from the character and order of the developed
sections of the Town whether residential, commercial or industrial. Further,
such signs can cause diminution in property values and do provide visual
distractions and obstructions to passing motorists which can cause or
contribute to traffic accidents. Also, improperly placed signs cause physical
and visual obstructions to vehicular and pedestrian traffic. Finally, unsafe
or improperly constructed signs (or signs which could be confused with
or mistaken for traffic signals, railroad crossings, aviation landing fixtures,
governmental signs or aviation signs) can provide serious hazards to the
health, safety and welfare of persons and property.

seeks to regulate the location, design and use of current and future gasoline
service stations. The regulations are intended to conserve property values,
create a more attractive and effective economic and business climate,
prevent blight, encourage the most appropriate use of current and future
gasoline station sites, improve the aesthetic environment of the Town and
fully integrate gasoline service stations into the community.

Motor Vehicle Dismantlers
[Added 8-9-2017 by L.L. No. 3-2017143]
§ 213-435. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meaning indicated:
MOTOR VEHICLE DISMANTLING BUSINESS  Includes the buying or
receiving of end-of-life or secondhand motor vehicles, disassembled motor
vehicles, parts and accessories and/or the crushing or reduction in size of
motor vehicles by means other than by the operation of a shredder for the
purpose of decommissioning, remodeling, taking apart or reselling the same
for scrap or the buying, storage or selling of parts of secondhand or end-oflife
motor vehicles or tires or assembling of secondhand motor parts.
MOTOR VEHICLE DISMANTLING FACILITY  The premises from which
a motor vehicle dismantling business is conducted; formerly defined as
"junkyard."
§ 213-436. Legislative intent and purpose.
A. The Town Board of the Town of Babylon hereby has determined that:
(1) Motor vehicle dismantlers are a necessary yet highly intensive use
that can produce a multitude of adverse environmental impacts and
land use conflicts within a community. A motor vehicle dismantler's
location and operational controls directly correlate with the degree
of impact associated with the facility.
(2) It is incumbent upon the municipality to provide the statutory
requirements to permit the proper siting and safe operation of
motor vehicle dismantling facilities within said municipality. The
establishment of motor vehicle dismantling facilities is a necessary
component of a municipality's solid waste infrastructure.
(3) Impacts and land use conflicts associated with motor vehicle
dismantlers can be managed by:
(a) Determining appropriate geographic requirements for the
siting and operation of motor vehicle dismantling facilities.
(b) The establishment of operational, mitigative and performance
standards governing the operation of motor vehicle
dismantling facilities.
(c) Maintaining strict local oversight of motor vehicle dismantling
facilities operating within the Town of Babylon to ensure
operational and performance standards are met, and potential
impacts to abutting properties are being adequately mitigated.
143. Editor's Note: This local law superseded former Art. XXXVII, Junkyards, added 8-19-1997
by L.L. No. 11-1997, as amended.

Transfer Stations and Recycled Materials Management Facilities,"
dated May 4, 2016, and on file at the Town Clerk's office.
(2) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, on a
site issued a license to operate by the Town of Babylon Sanitation
Commission as a nonconforming motor vehicle dismantling facility,
as such is defined in § 213-446 of this Code, based upon a
recommendation issued by the Town of Babylon Nonconforming
Use Board to the Town of Babylon Sanitation Commission, and the
premises shall be in compliance with § 213-446.

(2) A special exception permit granted by the Town of Babylon Zoning
Board of Appeals to the operator of the motor vehicle dismantling
facility pursuant to the standards set forth in this chapter; and
(3) The operator shall also have been issued a Class 13 license for the
facility by the Town of Babylon Sanitation Commission. A motor
vehicle dismantling facility that also accepts scrap metal not
meeting the definition of a "motor vehicle dismantling business"
shall also obtain a Class 12 license.
C. Motor vehicle dismantlers meeting the requirements of § 213-437A(2)
shall be classified as nonconforming and shall only be permitted to
operate in the Town of Babylon with the following local approvals:
(1) A current Class 13 license for the facility issued by the Town of
Babylon Sanitation Commission. In addition, a nonconforming
motor vehicle dismantler that also accepts scrap metal not meeting
the definition of a "motor vehicle dismantling business" shall also
require a Class 12 license from the Town of Babylon Sanitation
Commission, subject to all standards and requirements.

Hot-Mix Asphalt Facilities
[Added 6-21-2005 by L.L. No. 16-2005]
§ 213-473. Legislative intent and purpose.
§ 213-474. Definitions and word usage.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
AGGREGATE  Any crushed rock, gravel, sand or other granular material
suitable for the manufacture of hot-mix asphalt or concrete.
BITUMEN  Any of a class of black or dark-colored solid, semi-solid or
viscous flammable mixtures of hydrocarbons and other substances,
occurring naturally or obtained by distillation from coal or petroleum, that
are a component of asphalt and tar and are used for surfacing roads and for
waterproofing.
HOT-MIX ASPHALT (HMA)  A paving material comprised of a mixture of
hot dry aggregate and bitumen.
HOT-MIX ASPHALT PLANT, HOT-MIX ASPHALT FACILITY  All the
component structures, buildings and material storage areas of a site used
for the production of hot-mix asphalt by mixing hot dry aggregate with
bitumen or similar asphalt petroleum products. Neither the manufacture of
A. The Town Board of the Town of Babylon, after a review of the impacts of
hot-mix asphalt plants and their regulation elsewhere, finds that:
(1) Hot-mix asphalt plants constitute a small but thriving industry on
Long Island, offering such community benefits as jobs in the
manufacturing sector and a local source of materials for other
industries that provide for area growth and for the development
and maintenance of its infrastructure;
(2) Local sourcing of hot-mix asphalt is advantageous because the
product can deteriorate during transport over long distances, and
because distance hauling contributes to higher costs;
(3) Hot-mix asphalt facilities can entail adverse impacts on local air
and water quality, traffic, and neighborhood character which may
be mitigated by use-specific controls;
B. It is therefore the purpose of this article to:
(1) Support a local hot-mix asphalt industry by permitting facility
location where compatible in all of the Town of Babylon's industrial
districts;
(2) Establish clear, adequate and consistently applied regulatory
controls to limit the impact of any hot-mix asphalt facility on
surrounding uses and the general public welfare.

forth below in §§ 213-476 through 213-485.
D. Special exception use permits for hot-mix asphalt facilities will be valid
for a period of five years. They may be renewed by application to the
Zoning Board of Appeals upon demonstration of continued compliance
with the requirements set forth below and all additional requirements
previously imposed by the Zoning Board.
A. No site containing an asphalt manufacturing plant shall be located
within:
(1) Two thousand feet from sensitive institutional, residential and/or
public uses, including churches, schools, libraries, hospitals,
assisted-living and long-term-care facilities, and park and
recreation areas;
(2) One thousand five hundred feet of residentially zoned property;
(3) Seven hundred fifty feet of residential uses in a nonresidential
zone.
B. The location restrictions in this subsection may be reduced by 100 feet
for every 10 feet of vegetative buffer planted along the entire length of
the site boundary from which the restrictive distance is measured. The
buffer shall be planted with a dense mix of deciduous and coniferous
trees and shrubs, with at least half the stock to be a minimum of five
feet when planted.

As used in this chapter the following terms phrase, words, and their
derivatives shall have the meanings given:
TOBACCO USE  Includes smoking and the chewing of tobacco.
SMOKING  To inhale or exhale the smoke of burning tobacco or tobacco
substitute or electronic cigarettes, vape pens, vapors, e-liquids, other legal
marijuana derivatives or other substances and also to carry burning tobacco
or tobacco substitute in the form of a cigarette, cigar, or any other smokeproducing
product or device, including pipes.[Amended 4-25-2018 by

§ 213-490. Smoking and tobacco use prohibited.
A. This Legislature hereby finds and determines that human health is
seriously threatened by exposure to environmental tobacco smoke
(ETC) and that recent findings by the Federal Environmental
Protections Agency (EPA) make clear that ETS, or secondhand smoke, is
a human carcinogen responsible for 3,000 lung cancer deaths each year
in nonsmoking adults.
B. This Legislature also finds and determines that although smoking is
prohibited in Town facilities and all hospitals located with the Town of
Babylon, people seeking access to these facilities can still be exposed to
secondhand smoke as they seek to enter such public buildings. The
Town of Babylon declares and finds it to be in the public's interest to
provide for regulation of certain conduct in public places by prohibiting
smoking and tobacco use by persons at nondesignated areas. The odor
from smoking tobacco products and litter caused by the improper
disposal of cigarette butts in public areas can significantly reduce the
enjoyment of a healthy and wholesome environment free of smoking
related pollution. By prohibiting smoking at public areas, the Town
desires to promote and enhance the healthy and wholesome
environment and its safe enjoyment by all individuals, especially
children.
C. Smoking and tobacco use are not prohibited in areas specifically
designated and suitably equipped for that purpose.

shall upon conviction thereof, be subject to a fine or penalty of not less than
$50 and not more than $250.

If any clause, paragraph, subdivision, section or part of this article or the
application thereof to any person, individual, corporation, firm, partnership,
entity, or circumstance shall be adjudged by any court of competent
jurisdiction to be invalid or unconstitutional, such order or judgment shall
not affect, impair, or invalidate the remainder thereof, but shall be confined
in its operation to the clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivision, section,
or part of this article, or in its application to the person, individual,
corporation, firm partnership, entity, or circumstance directly involved in
the controversy in which such order or judgment shall be rendered.

Downtown Copiague (DC) Zoning District
[Added 4-7-2015 by L.L. No. 4-2015]
§ 213-534. Legislative intent and purpose.
In 2009, the Town of Babylon and Copiague community completed the
Copiague Vision Plan (the "Vision Plan"), a comprehensive vision for the
downtown Copiague. The vision for downtown Copiague is that it will be
a vibrant, people-friendly place that feels safe and secure, where people
can walk, shop, entertain, relax, play, interact, and spend time, and where
the sense of community can be strengthened. The Vision Plan identifies
various existing conditions that stand in the way of that vision and suggests
the implementation of various actions to encourage and facilitate the
transformation of downtown Copiague. The Vision Plan observes that the
existing zoning in downtown Copiague represents a limitation towards
revitalization of the downtown core. Among the Vision Plan's
recommendations is the development of contemporary zoning regulations
for downtown Copiague, including updated lot and bulk controls that would
coordinate and guide future development. Therefore, in response to these
recommendations, the Town Board of the Town of Babylon ("Town Board")
herein enacts a new article of the Code of the Town of Babylon to create a
new district to be known as the "Downtown Copiague (DC) Zoning District."
The primary purpose of the DC Zoning District is to facilitate a vibrant
transit-oriented downtown containing a mix of housing types and retail,
office, personal service, and/or other compatible uses that contribute to a
sense of community. The DC Zoning District regulations are designed to
build upon the strengths of Copiague and especially the downtown area,
including the presence of the Copiague Long Island Rail Road ("LIRR")
Station, Veterans' Memorial and Copiague parks, and a diverse residential
community that is within walking distance of many of the downtown's
commercial establishments. Further, the regulations set forth in this article
are designed to encourage and continue to improve the existing aesthetic
appearance of downtown Copiague, in order to enhance its community
identity. Finally, the regulations set forth in this article reflect "form-based"
strategies that are as much interested in the form of development and its
relation to Copiague's streets and sidewalks, as to the specific use, lot, and
bulk of development.
§ 213-535. Applicability; district boundaries.
The provisions of the DC Zoning District promulgated herein shall apply to
those properties designated as such on the Building Zone Map of the Town
of Babylon, Suffolk County, New York, as amended. The DC Zoning District
is generally comprised of those properties fronting along Great Neck Road
from Campagnoli Avenue to Hollywood Avenue, along Marconi Boulevard
from Pine Street to Verrazano Avenue, and along Railroad Avenue from Pine
Street to Verrazano Avenue.

§ 213-548. Off-street parking. [Amended 8-3-2016 by L.L. No.
11-2016]
One of the strengths of downtown Copiague is the strategic location of the
Copiague LIRR station at its center. As a result, the DC Zoning District
emphasizes downtown Copiague as a natural transit-oriented development
(TOD) community, whereby uses are within easy walking distance of a
transit stop and designed to maximize access to and from transit. Therefore,
the following off-street parking regulations and strategies are designed to
enhance the pedestrian- and transit-friendly nature of the area:
A. Off-street parking standards. In the DC Zoning District, off-street
parking requirements shall be in conformity with those requirements
set forth in Article XXIII of this Chapter, except the following:
(1) Multiple residences: 0.5 space for each studio; one space for one
bedroom; 1.5 spaces for two bedrooms, and 0.5 additional spaces
for each additional bedroom in the dwelling unit.
(2) Retail stores, shops, and personal service establishments: one
space for each 400 square feet of gross floor area.
(3) Offices, banks, or financial institutions, not including medical
offices: one space for each 500 square feet of gross floor area.
(4) Public, private, or vocational schools, learning centers, or test
preparation centers: five per classroom or teaching station, plus
one for each teaching and non-teaching staff person.
B. Shared parking.
(1) The minimum required quantity of parking may be reduced when
shared parking is used. Where credible evidence is provided that
parking could be shared by the proposed uses with nearby uses, as
provided by a traffic study, parking study, traffic counts, or data by
a licensed traffic engineer, up to a twenty-percent reduction in offstreet
parking may be permitted for shared parking. Shared
parking shall be located within 500 feet of each use and may
include on-street parking, off-street parking, and commuter

parking areas. Such determination shall be at the discretion of
the Planning Board and determined during the site plan approval
process.
(2) Shared parking lots with cross-access agreements are encouraged
so as to allow drivers to park in one lot and walk to other
businesses without moving their cars, or to drive from one lot to
another without returning to the street.
C. Parking demand reduction. Given the TOD nature of the area, as part of
site plan review, applicants will be encouraged to explore techniques to
reduce parking demand. Techniques may include, but are not limited to
parking management programs, promotion of and priority to car
sharing and ridesharing, parking cash-out programs, unbundled
parking, provision of free or discounted transit passes, provision of
bicycle parking facilities.
D. Buffering. In order to soften the appearance of parking lots, parking
lots shall be landscaped with ground cover, grasses, or low shrubs.
E. Notwithstanding § 213-548B, every attempt should be made to provide
off-street parking on the premises or in connection therewith.

requirements stated in § 213-547 are met.
(e) Sustainable building techniques: building, siting, or
constructing structures beyond the minimum sustainable

application has been determined to be complete by the
Planning Department and Office of Downtown Revitalization,
the Planning Board shall begin its site plan review of the
incentives and the overall site plan, in accordance with
Chapter 186. As part of such review, the Planning Department
shall refer the proposal to the Office of Downtown
Revitalization for review of the incentives and the overall site

procedures for adoption of an amendment to the zoning ordinance
or local law, as well as SEQRA/TOBEQRA. At least five days' notice
(14 days if an environmental impact statement was required) of the
time and place of the hearing shall be published in an official

amenity/incentive proposal, the Town Board shall determine that
the requirements of SEQRA/TOBEQRA have been met through the
issuance of a negative declaration (or environmental findings if an
environmental impact statement was required) and that the
proposed amenity provides sufficient public benefit to grant the
requested incentive. The Town Board may impose conditions on a
project to ensure that the above findings are ensured through the
subsequent plan review and construction phases of the project.
(6) Plan review. Upon a favorable decision of the Town Board
regarding the incentives, the application shall continue its formal
site plan review by the Planning Board, in accordance with Chapter

Zoning  See Ch. 213.
§ 215-1. Legislative findings.
The Town Board finds that:
§ 215-2. Adoption by local law regardless of protest
Any land use regulation, restriction or zoning district classification or
boundary, whether included in Chapter 213, Zoning, of the Town Code or
otherwise, may be adopted, amended, changed, modified or repealed by the
Town Board by adoption of a local law, and such local law shall be deemed to
have been approved and adopted by a favorable vote of a simple majority of
the entire Town Board and shall then take full force and effect as provided
A. The health, safety and welfare of the community cannot be adequately
protected by the Town Board unless it can speedily effect changes of
land use regulations when the need for such action is clearly shown.
However, certain provisions of the New York Town Law have proven to
be detrimental to towns by impairing the ability of a Town Board to
speedily enact needed changes in zoning and land use regulations even
when such changes are desired by the overwhelming majority of Town
residents and a majority of their elected representatives, with the result
that sound planning and orderly growth has often been undermined and
the will of the electorate thwarted.
B. In order to achieve the objectives of protecting the established
character of neighborhoods, especially residential neighborhoods, the
social and economic well-being of residents and the value of private and
public property and in order to prevent the overcrowding of land or
buildings, to avoid the undue and unnecessary concentration of
population and to lessen and, when possible, to prevent traffic
congestion on the public streets and highways, the Town Board desires
to utilize a proven mechanism to accomplish the above objectives.
C. The Constitution and the Municipal Home Rule Law of the State of New
York provide a mechanism for remedying this situation and permitting
the adoption and amendment of land use regulations by local law by a
simple majority vote of the Town Board, and the use of such mechanism
is an appropriate way for the Town Board to deal with the recent
unprecedented redevelopment of the Town and the obvious need to
update and amend the land use regulations of the Town of Babylon.

for in state law, regardless of whether or not the same has been the subject
of:
§ 215-3. Procedure.
Local laws involving land use regulations shall be adopted in accordance
with the procedures for the adoption of local laws generally, as set forth in
§ 20 of the Municipal Home Rule Law.
§ 215-4. Effect on other laws.
This chapter is adopted as a local law and, pursuant to, inter alia, the New
York State Constitution, Article 9, § 2(b)(3); Statute of Local Governments,
§ 10, Subdivision 6; and Municipal Home Rule Law § 10, Subdivision
1(ii)a(11), § 10, Subdivision 1(ii)a(12), and § 10, Subdivision 1(ii)d(3), shall,
in its application to the Town of Babylon, amend and, to the extent
necessary, supersede any provisions of § 265 or other sections of the New
York Town Law with which it may be inconsistent.
