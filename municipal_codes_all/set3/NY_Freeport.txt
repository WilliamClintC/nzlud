TAX CAP OVERRIDE
§ 8-1. Legislative intent.
Due to the unfunded mandates forced upon municipalities by the Governor
and State Legislature to comply with the new January 1, 2020, discovery
statute, the Village of Freeport will have to pierce the property tax cap. To
that end, this chapter will grant the Village of Freeport the ability to adopt
a budget for the fiscal year commencing March 1, 2020, that requires a
real property tax levy in excess of the "tax levy limit" as defined by General
Municipal Law § 3-c.
§ 8-2. Authority.
This chapter is adopted pursuant to Subdivision 5 of General Municipal Law
§ 3-c, which expressly authorizes a local government's governing body to
override the property tax cap for the coming fiscal year by the adoption
of a local law approved by a vote of 60% of said governing body, which
corresponds to a simple majority of the Board.
§ 8-3. Tax levy limit override.
The Board of Trustees of the Village of Freeport, County of Nassau, is
hereby authorized to adopt a budget for the fiscal year commencing March
1, 2020, that requires a real property tax levy in excess of the amount
otherwise prescribed in General Municipal Law § 3-c.
§ 8-4. Severability.
If a court determines that any clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivision,
or part of this chapter or the application thereof to any person, firm or
corporation, or circumstance is invalid or unconstitutional, the court's order
or judgment shall not affect, impair, or invalidate the remainder of this
local law, but shall be confined in its operation to the clause, sentence,
paragraph, subdivision, or part of this chapter or in its application to the
person, individual, firm or corporation or circumstance directly involved in
the controversy in which such judgment or order shall be rendered.
§ 8-5. Effective date.
This chapter shall take effect immediately upon filing with the Secretary of
State.

Residency of Employees
[Adopted 1-16-1978 by L.L. No. 3-1978]
§ 42-5. Legislative declaration.
The Board of Trustees of the Incorporated Village of Freeport notes that
unemployment within the community is currently excessive. It is further
recognized that emergency work situations arise which require employees
of the village to be near their place of employment and to assume the
continuation of public services to protect the health, safety and general
welfare of the people. Through the adoption of this article, the Board of
Trustees makes a legislative determination that those who are residents of
the village take a greater interest in promoting the public safety and health
and in the future of this community than do nonresidents whose families
reside in areas unaffected by village services. The Board of Trustees further
declares that such a quality is desirable for its employees. The legislative
body considers that residency by its employees and officers within a
community will strengthen the economic status of the Village and will
encourage stability in its neighborhoods and assure continuation of
essential public services. Pursuant to the authority of law and pursuant to
determinations by the State Public Employment Relations Board, the Board
of Trustees determines that the public need is sufficient to require that
employees hired after the effective date of this article be residents of the

the personnel officer or other appropriate municipal official, upon becoming
aware of the allegation, shall provide the employee with written notice of
his alleged violation and shall allow the employee seven calendar days in
which to respond. Regardless of whether or not a response is received, a

the employee will be deemed to have voluntarily resigned.
§ 42-9. Waiver of requirements.
§ 42-10. Distribution.

employee communications.
A. In the event that the Board of Trustees determines that it is in the best
interests of the public employer to do so, the provisions of § 42-7 may be
waived with respect to a particular person or particular position in
accordance with the following standards:
(1) Lack of applicants. The requirement of residency may be waived in
those instances where the employer had difficulty hiring because of
the residency requirement.
(2) Necessity for nonresidency. The requirement of residency may be
waived in those instances where it is determined that residency is
not in the best interests of the employer.

ALARM SYSTEMS
GENERAL REFERENCES
Security systems  See Ch. 73. Peace and good order  See Ch. 55.
§ 72-1. Purpose and intent.
§ 72-2. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
A. The unregulated transmission of automatic alarm systems to police
headquarters in the Village has, from time to time, resulted in the
overtaxing of facilities and in the impairment of the ability of the Police
and Fire Departments of the Village to respond to true emergencies.
Additionally, the continued and unnecessarily prolonged emission of
sound from audible alarm systems to the surrounding community and
the difficulties and delays encountered in silencing such systems have
disturbed the rest and repose of residents of the Village and have
caused police, fire, and other Village personnel to spend excessive
amounts of time both in the investigation of those alarms and in the
attempted silencing of them, thereby preventing the devotion of such
time to the protection and general welfare of the inhabitants of the
Village.
B. It is necessary to the general welfare, peace and repose of the Village to
protect its residents through the establishment of controls of various
types of fire, intrusion, holdup, and other emergency signals from fire
and police alarm devices which require Fire Department or Police
Department response, investigation or safeguarding of property at the
location of an event reported by a signal transmitted by telephone or
radio or otherwise relayed to the Police Department or the Fire
Department by an alarm device requiring investigation or other action
by any person acting in response to a signal activated by any alarm
device.
C. The purpose and intent of this chapter is to decrease the number of
emergency service requests for dispatch or response attributable to
false alarms and to improve the availability of police, fire, and other
personnel for the handling of emergency situations. It is hereby
declared that the noise emanating from audible alarms which continue
to sound either without the existence of an emergency situation or after
the emergency situation has ended constitutes a public nuisance.

any changes in the information contained in the permit application

Clerk is authorized to establish procedures for the collection of
material information from alarm users and the dissemination of
said information to the various emergency services. Said
authorization shall extend but not be limited to the establishment
of shared files, including electronic files, in a manner in which in
the judgment of the Village Clerk will best achieve the collection
and dissemination of material permit information.

I. Freeport Plaza Urban Renewal Area. [Added 7-20-1992 by L.L. No.
4-1992]
(1) On May 4, 1992, after numerous and extensive public hearings, the
Board of Trustees adopted an urban renewal plan known as the
§ 86-7 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 86-7
1:161
"Urban Renewal Plan for the Freeport Plaza Urban Renewal Area"
(hereinafter "the plan" and "the Urban Renewal Area,"
respectively). On the same date, the Board of Trustees, by
resolution, created the Freeport Plaza Architectural Review and
Revitalization Board (hereinafter "the Architectural Board").
Pursuant to said Urban Renewal Plan and for its duration, within
said Urban Renewal Area the Architectural Board shall exercise the
following authority, duties and responsibilities:
(a) To develop design and specification guidelines for all structural
work, facades and signage of buildings and structures to be
rehabilitated or constructed in said Urban Renewal Area and
for the design, construction and landscaping of all off-street
parking facilities, whether public or private, located within
said Urban Renewal Area; and
(b) To review for consistency with said guidelines and approve all
site plans and building permit applications for all structural,
facade, signage, parking and landscape design work to be
performed within said Urban Renewal Area prior to the final
approval of said site plans and permit applications by the
Superintendent of Buildings.
(2) As a condition precedent to said review by the Architectural Board,
the applicant shall file with the Architectural Board a certification
from the Agency that the application and work proposed therein
are consistent with the provisions of the Urban Renewal Plan. The
Architectural Board shall submit said guidelines to the Agency for
final review, modification, approval and adoption by the Agency;
and following said adoption, the Agency shall cause said guidelines
to be published.
(3) Pursuant to said Urban Renewal Plan and for its duration, within
said Urban Renewal Area the Superintendent of Buildings shall
continue to exercise his authority and responsibility to review and
approve all applications for building permits and all site plans and
other plans required to be submitted in conjunction therewith.
However, for the duration of the plan, the Architectural Board shall
have final approval of all building permits and site plans for all
construction, reconstruction or rehabilitation activity or work
within the Urban Renewal Area; and no building permit shall be
approved, issued or denied and no site plan shall be approved
unless and until the Agency shall have certified to the Architectural
Board that such proposed construction and use and such site plan
are consistent with the plan.
(4) In addition to the foregoing, within the Urban Renewal Area and
upon the review and approval of the Architectural Board, the Board
of Trustees for the Incorporated Village of Freeport may grant
variances from existing Village of Freeport Building Code
requirements pursuant to the provisions of Articles 15 and 15-A of
§ 86-7 FREEPORT CODE § 86-7
1:162
§ 86-7.1. Moratorium on telecommunications towers. [Added
4-22-2002 by L.L. No. 4-2002]
the General Municipal Law, provided that the spirit of said Building
Code is followed in granting said variances, and provided further
that the exercise of said discretion by the Board of Trustees is
reasonable and consistent with all other applicable federal and
state laws, rules and regulations.
(5) Any determination by the Architectural Board, the Superintendent
of Buildings or the Agency with respect to the approval or denial, in
whole or in part, of an application for a building permit, a site plan
or a variance from the Village's Building Code with respect to any
structural, facade, signage, parking and landscape design work to
be performed within the Urban Renewal Area and certification as
to plan compliance may be appealed by the applicant, the
Architectural Board, the Superintendent of Buildings or the Agency
within 30 days of the date of said determination and upon notice to
all other parties to the Board of Trustees for final determination. A
hearing, on not less than 15 days' published notice, shall be held
upon such application.
A. Purpose.
(1) The Federal Telecommunications Act preserves the authority of
local governments over reasonable nondiscriminatory decisions
regarding the placement, construction, and modification of
wireless telecommunications towers. It appears that there will be a
continual interest and need to construct towers to meet demand
and accommodate new technologies within the state and the
Incorporated Village of Freeport. The Incorporated Village of
Freeport has received several requests to locate such towers and
accessory uses and expects to receive more requests in the near
future to locate such towers and accessory uses.
(2) The Incorporated Village of Freeport has significant concerns over
the location of wireless telecommunications towers within the
Incorporated Village of Freeport. The zoning regulations of the
Incorporated Village of Freeport were adopted at a time before
wireless telecommunications towers existed, and appropriate siting
and development standards do not exist. The Incorporated Village
of Freeport would like to insure that the installation of these towers
proceeds in a fashion that minimizes any adverse impacts while
maximizing services and benefits to the community. The
Incorporated Village of Freeport wants to accommodate the need
for wireless telecommunications towers while regulating their
location and number; minimize adverse visual impacts through
proper design, siting and screening; avoid potential physical
damage to adjacent properties; and encourage joint use of tower
structures.
§ 86-7 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 86-7.1
1:163
(3) This section is necessary in order to address the Incorporated
Village of Freeport's concerns by barring final decisions on
applications for tower construction in order to allow the Board of
Trustees time to research the issues and adopt a local law
regulating wireless telecommunications towers and accessory uses
consistent with the Comprehensive Plan of the Incorporated Village
of Freeport. The Incorporated Village of Freeport hopes to develop
legislation that will establish a clear and understandable
permitting process to guide local officials and businesses. In order
to facilitate this effort, the Incorporated Village of Freeport will
seek the input of citizens through the public hearing process and
will request comments and suggestions from companies that
provide wireless services within the area.
B. Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms shall have the
meanings indicated:
ACCESSORY USE  An accessory use serves the principal use, is
subordinate in area, extent or purpose to the principal use, and is
located on the same lot as the principal use. Examples of such uses,
include transmission equipment and storage sheds.
TELECOMMUNICATIONS ANTENNA  A system of electrical
conductors that transmit or receive radio frequency waves.
TELECOMMUNICATIONS TOWER  A structure on which one or more
antenna will be located, that is intended for transmitting and/or
receiving radio, television, telephone, wireless or microwave
communications for an FCC licensed carrier, but excluding those used
exclusively for fire, police and other dispatch communications, or
exclusively for private radio and television reception and private
citizen's bands, amateur radio and other similar private, residential
communications.
C. Imposition of moratorium.
(1) For a period of 90 days from and after the effective date of this
section, no final decision shall be made on any application for the
construction or erection of a telecommunications tower, antenna or
accessory use. For the purpose of this section, a final decision shall
be deemed to mean any approval which would in any way authorize
the construction or erection of a telecommunications tower,
antenna or accessory use.
(2) This moratorium may be extended for an additional 180 days at
ninety-day increments, upon a resolution duly adopted by the
Board of Trustees of the Incorporated Village of Freeport.
(3) The imposition of this section shall not affect the acceptance or
processing of new applications, or applications for which approval

section will not adversely affect the health, safety and welfare of the
Incorporated Village of Freeport. Any request for a variance shall be

suits and proceedings authorized by this code to be brought for the
recovery of any penalty or the enforcement of any provisions of this
code and shall give preference to such suits and proceedings over

suit or proceeding is located. Every such lien may be enforced
against said property in every respect, notwithstanding the same
may be transferred subsequent to the filing of said notice.

shall consist of a copy of the notice issued by the Superintendent of
Buildings requiring the removal of the violation and a notice of the
suit or proceedings instituted or to be instituted thereto. Such
§ 86-10 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 86-10

notice of lis pendens may be filed at any time after the service
of the notice issued by the Superintendent as aforesaid, provided

the owner of the property is about to transfer the same to avoid
responsibility for having violated a provision of this code. Any
notice of lis pendens filed pursuant to the provisions of this code
may be vacated and canceled of record upon an order of a Justice

specify the location of the property with respect to which the
designation is made and the residences and places of business of
the person making it and the person designated. It shall remain in
force during the period specified therein, if any, or until revoked by

and endorsed with the consent of the Superintendent of Buildings.
The Superintendent of Buildings shall file and index each
designation and shall note, upon the original designation and index,
the filing of a revocation. While the designation remains in force, as
prescribed in this section, a notice of violation, notice to make safe

(3) It shall be unlawful to occupy a floor area by a greater number of
persons than that for which exits have been provided in accordance
with this article.
G. Location of exits. Exits shall be so located that no point in any floor area
served by them shall be more than 100 feet distant along the line of
travel from the exit, except that when any floor area is subdivided into
small areas, such as rooms in hotels and office buildings, the distance
from the door to any such room along an unobstructed hallway to an
exit shall be not more than 125 feet. Where more than one exit is
required to any floor area, the exits shall be placed remote from each
other. Where more than two exits are required, they shall be located in
such a manner as to contribute to the rapid exit of the occupants.
H. Stairway exits. Every required stairway exit shall lead, either directly or
through a passageway or hallway, to a street. In structures more than
two stories high above curb level with flat roofs, all stairways shall lead
to the roof. In structures more than three stories high above the curb
level when there are two or more required stairways, at least two shall
continue to the roof, provided that in the case of roofs having a pitch
exceeding a one-foot rise in four feet, such stairways shall lead to a

every structure shall be clearly and legibly indicated by exit signs,
and, where required to serve their purpose adequately, such signs
shall be placed at an angle with the exit doorway. Exit signs shall be
of a type and size approved by the Superintendent of Buildings.
(2) In long corridors, in open floor areas and in all other situations
where the location of the means of egress may not be readily
discernible or understood by the occupants, directional signs shall
be provided and maintained to serve as guides from all portions of
the floor or corridor.
K. Lighting of required means of egress. All stairways, fire towers,
hallways, passageways and other required means of egress, together
with all areas to which the public has access, shall be equipped with
adequate artificial lighting facilities. Such lighting facilities shall be
used when adequate natural light is unavailable.
L. Effect of change in occupancy or use upon exits. Structures changed
from one class of use or occupancy to another shall comply with the
requirements for means of egress which apply to the use or occupancy,
but the Superintendent of Buildings may, in his discretion, approve such
other means of egress as, in his judgment, will accomplish the same
purpose when strict compliance with the provisions of this article is
impractical.
M. Inadequate exits for existing structures. Every existing structure which
is unprovided with exit facilities, as prescribed in this section, and in
which exit facilities are, in the opinion of the Superintendent of
Buildings, inadequate for the safety of the occupants shall be provided

stresses prescribed in this article may be increased 33 1/3%,
provided that the section thus found is not less than that required
by the dead load and live loads alone.
(2) For members carrying wind stresses only, the permissible working
stresses may be increased 33 1/3%.
A. New and altered buildings. The live load for which each floor or part of
a floor of a business building or storage building hereafter erected or
altered is designed and approved by the Superintendent of Buildings
shall be conspicuously posted in that part of the story to which it
applies.
B. Existing buildings.
(1) In every business building or storage building now existing in
which heavy materials are kept or stored or machinery is

correctness of said estimate, he is empowered to revise and correct
the same and, for the purpose of such revision, the officers and
employees of the Department of Buildings may enter any building
and remove so much of any floor or other portion of the structure as
may be required to make necessary measurements and
examination. Any expense necessarily incurred in removing any
floor or other portion of a structure for the purpose of making the
examination herein provided for shall be paid by the Treasurer
upon the requisition of the Board of Trustees. Such expense shall
be a charge against the person or persons by whom or on whose
behalf said estimate was made, provided that such examination
proves the floor or other portion of the structure of insufficient
strength to safely sustain the estimated live load.
C. Loading restricted. No person shall place or cause or permit to be
placed on any floor of a building or on any part of a structure a greater
load than the approved safe load.
A. General requirements.
(1) Computations. Every structure hereafter erected and all new
construction in the alteration of an existing structure shall be so
designed and constructed that the working stresses fixed in this
section are not exceeded. In using these stresses, the effects of all
loads and conditions of loading and the influence of all forces
affecting the design and strength of the several parts shall be taken
into account.
(2) Permissible working stresses. Higher stresses than herein specified
may be used, but only if it is clearly established by test or other

not more than 1/2 of the capacity otherwise assumed.
B. Soil tests. When a doubt arises as to the safe sustaining power of the
soil upon which a structure is to be erected or it is desired to exceed the
presumptive capacity, the Superintendent of Buildings may direct that
borings or tests be made by and at the expense of the owner of the
proposed structure to determine the sustaining power of the soil.

ARTICLE IX
Construction
§ 86-55. Workmanship.
Workmanship in the fabrication, preparation and installation of materials
shall conform to generally accepted good practice
§ 86-56. Excavations.
A. Protection at excavations. Until provision for permanent support has
been made, excavations shall be properly guarded and protected so as
to prevent the same from becoming dangerous to life or limb and shall
be sheetpiled and braced, where necessary, by the person causing she
excavation to be made to prevent adjoining earth from caving in.
B. Excavations of ten feet or less. When an excavation extends not more
than 10 feet below the curb level, the owner of a structure, the safety of
which may be affected by such excavation, shall preserve and protect
the same from injury and, when necessary, shall underpin and support
the same by proper foundation, and for such purpose he shall be
permitted, if necessary, to enter upon the premises where such
excavation is being made.
C. Excavations more than 10 feet deep. When an excavation extends more
than 10 feet below the curb level, he person causing such excavation to
be made shall, if afforded the necessary license to enter upon adjoining
land, at his own expense, preserve and protect from injury every
structure, the safety of which may be affected by such excavations and,
when necessary, shall underpin and support the same by proper
foundations, irrespective of the depth to which the foundations of such
structure may extend. If the necessary license is not accorded to the
person making the excavation, then it shall be the duty of the owner
refusing such license to preserve and protect such structure from injury
and, when necessary, to underpin and support the same by proper
foundations, and for that purpose shall, if necessary, be permitted to
enter upon the premises where such excavation is being made.
D. Support of party walls. In case there is a party wall along a lot line of
the premises where an excavation is being made, the person causing
the excavation to be made shall, at his own expense, preserve such
party wall in as safe a condition as it was before the excavation was
commenced and shall, when necessary, underpin and support the same
by proper foundation.
E. Curb level. In case a structure is so located that the curb level to which
it is properly referred is at a higher level than the curb level to which
the excavation is referred, such part of any necessary underpinning or
foundation as may be due to the difference in the curb levels shall be
made and maintained at the joint expense of the owners of the adjoining
premises at that point.
§ 86-55 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 86-56
1:247
§ 86-57. Foundations.
F. Superintendent of Buildings may act. If the person whose duty it shall
be under the provisions of this code to properly guard and protect an
excavation or to prevent adjoining earth from caving in or to preserve
or protect any wall or structure from injury shall neglect or fail so to do
after having had twenty-four-hours notice from the Superintendent of
Buildings, such Superintendent may enter upon the premises and
employ such labor and furnish such materials and take such steps as, in
his judgment. may be necessary to prevent adjoining earth from caving
in or to make such wall or structure safe and secure or to prevent the
same from becoming unsafe or dangerous at the expense of the person
whose duty it is to keep the same safe and secure. The Village or any
person doing said work or any part thereof under and by direction of
the Superintendent of Buildings may bring and maintain an action
against the person last herein referred to to recover the value of the
work done and materials furnished in and about said premises in the
same manner as if he had been employed to do the work by said person.
G. Abandoned excavations. Whenever an excavation is made and the
structure to be erected thereon has not been begun within 60 days and
the excavation lacks a foundation wall of sufficient strength to retain
the surrounding earth or the place is dangerous for any other reason
such as lack of proper backfill, the excavation shall be considered
abandoned. Such abandoned excavation may be ordered filled by the
service of notice by the Superintendent of Buildings upon the owner of
the plot upon which it is located in person or by mail to his latest known
address as it appears on the Village tax rolls. If, thereafter, the owner
fails to have the excavation filled within the time specified in the notice
or within a reasonable time if no time is specified in the notice, the
excavation may be filled by the Village and the cost thereof assessed
against the property as a tax lien thereon after due notice to the owner
and hearing as to the reasonableness of the cost thereof.
A. General requirements. Foundation walls, except those erected upon
solid rock or upon wharves or piers on the waterfront and except those
of dwellings or two-and-one half-story buildings of frame construction,
shall be carried not less than four feet below the adjacent ground level
and shall rest on solid ground or on level surface of rock or on files or
ranging timbers when solid rock is not found. The foundation walls of
dwellings or two-and-one-half-story frame buildings may be stopped at
a depth of three feet below grade.
B. Footings.
(1) Materials. Footings consisting of stone, concrete, reinforced
concrete or steel grillages shall be provided under foundation walls
that rest on earth. Footings of wood, when permitted by the
Superintendent of Buildings, may be used if they are entirely below
permanent water level.
§ 86-56 FREEPORT CODE § 86-57
1:248
(2) Steel grillage footings. When steel grillage beams are used, they
shall be provided with separators and bolts and shall rest on a
proper concrete bed and shall be completely encased in concrete.
(3) Protection of metal. Where metal is incorporated in or forms part of
a foundation, it shall be protected from rust by paint, asphalt,
concrete or by such materials and in such manner as may be
approved by the Superintendent of Buildings.
(4) Pressure under footings. For the loads exerting pressure under the
footings of foundation walls, the full dead loads and the assumed
live loads from all floors on the lowest tier of columns, piers or
walls shall be taken.
(5) Design. Footings shall be so designed that the pressure they
produce on the soil per unit of area shall be uniform as far as
possible under all parts of the foundation walls, and such pressures
shall not exceed the bearing capacity of the soil. In proportioning
the areas of footings, the dead loads alone shall be considered;
provided, however, that in no case shall the full dead loads, plus the
reduced live loads exceed the bearing capacity of the soil.
C. Pile foundations.
(1) Resistance and method of driving.
(a) Piles which are to be used to sustain all of a structure or any
part thereof shall be driven to a resistance satisfactory to the
Superintendent of Buildings by such methods as will not impair
their strength and as will ensure the retention of that
resistance.
(b) Piles shall be held in correct location during driving. No load
shall be permitted upon a pile broken prior to or during
driving. If any pile is driven out of plumb more than 2% of the
pile length, the design of the foundation shall be modified to
support lateral forces properly and additional piles shall be
driven if necessary.
(2) Loads on piles.
(a) The following formula may be used as an approximate
indication of the allowable load on any pile not driven to rock,
except that in no case shall the maximum allowable loads for
the various types of piles be exceeded.
For drop hammers:
For single-acting hammers:
§ 86-57 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 86-57
1:249
Where
P = the allowable load on the pile in pounds.
W = the weight of the striking part of the hammer in pounds.
H = the fall, in feet, of the striking part of the hammer.
S = the average penetration, in inches, under the last five
blows after the pile has been driven to a point where
successive blows produce equal penetration.
(b) When a double-acting steam hammer is used in which steam or
compressed air is employed to increase the blow of the driving
ram, the term "W" shall be equal to the weight of the driving
ram, plus the area of the piston multiplied by the mean
effective pressure of the steam or compressed air on the piston
during the stroke, but "W" shall not exceed the total weight of
the hammer.
(3) Tests of sustaining of power of piles. Where any doubt exists as to
the safe sustaining power of the piles, the Superintendent of
Buildings may order loading tests of individual piles or groups of
piles to be made at the expense of the owner of the proposed
structure or of the person causing the piles to be driven. Tests shall
be made with 150% of the proposed load and shall be considered
unsatisfactory and the result unacceptable, if, after standing 24
hours, the total net settlement after deducting rebound is more
than 0.01 inch per ton of total test load. The record of every test
shall be filed with the Department.
(4) Jetting of piles. Exterior jetting of piles shall be permitted only by
special permission of the Superintendent of Buildings. If conditions
require jetting, such conditions shall be fully set forth in the
application and such permission requested. If jetting is used, it
shall be carried out in such a manner that the carrying capacities of
piles already in place shall be unimpaired.
(5) Wood piles.
(a) Wood piles shall be of dense or sound grade southern pine,
structural or common grade douglas fir, spruce, mixed
hardwoods or other species approved for such use. Piles shall
be of sound timber and free from wind shakes, short or
reversed bends. They shall be cut above the ground swell, shall
have a reasonably uniform taper and shall be so straight that a
line between the center of the point and the center of the butt
shall not depart from the body of the pile more than 1% of the
length of the pile. The least diameter at the point of the pile
shall be six inches. The least diameter of the butt of a pile shall
be 12 inches, except that where a pile is less than 25 feet in
length, it may be 10 inches or more in diameter. Measurements
§ 86-57 FREEPORT CODE § 86-57
1:250
shall be taken under the bark. The minimum total penetration
of any pile shall be 12 feet.
(b) Piles, other than those used as foundations for wood frame
structures over submerged or marsh lands, shall be cut off
below permanent water level. Piles used as foundations for
wood frame structures over submerged or marsh lands shall be
impregnated with creosote or other preservative as approved
by the Superintendent.
(c) The maximum allowable load on a wood pile having a six-inch
point shall be 15 tons and on a pile having a point of eight
inches or over 20 tons.
(d) Nothing in this section shall prohibit the use of piles with a butt
at least eight inches in diameter when, in the opinion of the
Superintendent of Buildings, such is adequate, in the case of a
light private dwelling.
(6) Concrete filled steel piles.
(a) Piles consisting of concrete steel tubes shall have a minimum
inside diameter of 10 inches and a shell thickness of at least 3/
8 inch, except that ten-and-twelve-inch piles may have a shell
thickness of 5/16 inch. The concrete shall be of a mixture at
least equal to reinforced concrete as specified in § 86-47D(3).
The ends of each tube shall be perpendicular to its axis, and all
bearing surfaces shall be smooth and true-cut by an approved
method. Splices shall be of such material and design as to
assure good alignment of tubes. If splices below the upper
splice are closer together than 20 feet, a 5% reduction in load
values shall be made for each additional splice used.
(b) Where the borings indicate that piles will be less than 60 feet
in length, the maximum designed outside diameter of the tube
shall be at least 1/40 of the length. If, as actually driven, such
piles exceed 40 diameters in length, a one-percent reduction in
load shall be made for each diameter of excess length. Where
borings indicate that the piles will be 60 feet or more in length,
the minimum diameter shall be 18 inches and the minimum
shell thickness shall be 1/2 inch, and no reduction from the
allowable loading need be made for the slenderness ratio.
(c) After driving, the inside of the tube shall be cleaned of any
foreign matter before placing the concrete filling. When tubes
exceed 50 diameters in length, the concrete in the tube below
the upper 50 diameters shall be deposited with a tremie or
fully lowered bottom-dump bucket. The concrete shall never be
placed through water except on specific written approval of the
Superintendent of Buildings after submission of the detailed
method of procedure.
§ 86-57 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 86-57
1:251
(d) The allowance load on any such pile when driven to bedrock
shall not exceed 500 pounds per square inch on the concrete
and 7,500 pounds per square inch on the steel, provided that in
computing the effective area of the steel, the outer 1/16 inch of
thickness shall be deducted from the thickness of the tube.
When driven open-ended to refusal in boulders or a mixture of
gravel and boulders with no softer material underlying, the
maximum unit loads shall be 50% of the above values. Piles so
used shall be spaced at least 20 inches, plus the diameter of
the tube.
(7) Piles cast in place.
(a) Concrete piles cast in place shall be so made and placed as to
ensure the exclusion of any foreign matter and to ensure a
continuous and full size pile. Piles shall be driven in such order
and with such spacing as to ensure against distortion or injury
to the finished pile. Concrete shall be of a mixture at least
equal to reinforced concrete, as specified in § 86-47D(3), and
shall be placed in the dry and shall not be placed in a form
containing water. The average diameter of such piles shall be
at least 11 inches, and the diameter of the point shall be at
least eight inches.
(b) The maximum load for cast-in-place piles shall be 30 tons.
When not driven to rock or hardpan, their carrying capacities
shall be determined by test.
(8) Precast concrete piles.
(a) Concrete piles moulded and cured before driving shall be
designed and reinforced to permit handling and driving them
without injury. Reinforcing steel shall be so located that it will
be covered by at least two inches of concrete. The diameter or
least lateral dimension of such piles shall be 10 inches or more
at the point and shall average at least 12 inches throughout the
length of the pile for piles up to 20 feet, 14 inches for piles up
to 30 feet and 15 inches for piles up to 40 feet. For piles over
40 feet in length, the diameter or least lateral dimension shall
be 1/35 of the length, except that all piles shall be at least 15
inches and shall not be required to exceed 24 inches in
diameter or least lateral dimension.
(b) The concrete shall be of a mixture at least equal to reinforced
concrete as specified in § 86-47D(3).
(c) Piles shall be reinforced with longitudinal reinforcing at least
equal to 2% of the volume of the concrete in the pile, together
with lateral reinforcing in the form of hoops or spirals, at least
one-fourth-inch round rods or wire, spaced 12 inches on
centers throughout the length of the pile, except the bottom

D. Steel joists.
(1) Form of steel joists. The term "steel joist" shall denote any
approved form of open-webbed beam or truss less than 20 inches in
depth and produced directly by rolling or pressing or fabricated
from rolled or pressed shapes by welding, pressing, riveting or
expanding. Limiting provisions in the following paragraphs do not
apply to structural steel sections such as hot-rolled solid web Tbeams,
channels or plate girders which may be used as steel joists,
their design, spacing and loading to be governed only by the
stresses required in this code, and provided that bridging, as
specified in Subsection D(5) hereof, shall be used.
(2) Use of steel joists. Steel joists may be used elsewhere than around
stairs, shafts and other floor openings as secondary members for
floor fillers in structures 100 feet or less in height.
(3) Design of steel joists. Steel joists small be designed using stresses
not exceeding those allowed under the Building Code. Web
members shall have the same section throughout.

steel top chord shall be within 550 times the lateral radius of
gyration of the top chord, but in case the top chord consists of a flat
top section continuous with a center web, the radius or gyration of
the top plate alone shall be taken. The span shall be within 24 times
the depth of the joist. The maximum deflection shall not be greater
than 1/360 of the span for the total load as determined by test. The
§ 86-62 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 86-62
1:279
maximum spacing of the joists shall be the safe span of the top slab
or flooring over the joist and in no case greater than 24 inches in
floors and 30 inches in roofs, except that steel joists may be used to
support wood or sheet metal roofs only if not over seven feet apart.
(5) Loading and bridging of steel joists. Every steel joist shall be
capable of sustaining a concentrated load at any panel point of at
least 800 pounds, except as required elsewhere for concentrated
loads, and shall be securely bridged so that it shall develop, without
failure, 2 1/4 times the total uniformly distributed load for which it
is designed, provided that the bridging is the same as that to be
actually used in the construction, but in no case shall the bridging
be more than six feet apart or six feet from supports. Such bridging
shall securely support the top chord of the joist against lateral
displacement and shall be rigid in character and capable of
transmitting directly at least 500 pounds to the two adjoining joists
at each line of bridging. The steel joists shall be designed to carry
directly the total dead load of partitions where they occur in
addition to all other dead and live loads imposed. During testing,
the character of the bridging shall be such as not to relieve the
member of any fraction of the test load.
(6) Bearing and anchoring of steel joists. Where steel joists have a
bearing on masonry or concrete, at least four inches of their length
shall be on each such bearing, and the joists shall be securely
anchored to the masonry or concrete. When bearing on steel, steel
joists shall have at least 2 1/2 inches of their length on each such
bearing. The bearing stresses shall not exceed 200 pounds per
square inch on masonry or concrete and 1,000 pounds per square
inch on steel. All joists shall be anchored to supports so as to
prevent dislodgment during erection, and they shall be belted or
welded to all steel supports. Any joists at the end of a panel shall be
braced laterally by anchors or ties at each line of bridging.
(7) Connections of steel joists. Connections of the various members of
steel joists shall be designed with as little eccentricity as possible,
and all stresses due to eccentricty shall be included with primary
stresses in designing. All such connections shall be made by leaving
a portion of the metal intact or by fusion welding. All joints and
connections shall be capable of resisting at least three times the
designed stress.
(8) Painting of steel joists. Painting of steel joists shall be in
accordance with the requirements of § 86-62C(13), Painting, or the
joists shall be dipped once in hot asphalt at the place of
manufacture or given two coats of cold asphalt, either by dipping or
spraying, at the place of manufacture. When either hot or cold
asphalt is used, all abrasions shall be touched up at the job with the
same material.

a lot, in conformity with the street or streets on which it is situated,
shall require the ground on such lot to be raised and kept higher than
the ground of the adjoining lot or lots, provided that the ground of such
adjoining lot or lots is not maintained at a grade lower than in
conformity with the street or streets on which they are situated, and a
retaining wall for supporting the same shall be necessary, such
retaining wall shall be made and maintained jointly by the owners of the
land on each side and shall stand 1/2 upon the land of each owner, but if
the owner of the lot or lots having the lower grade shall bear and
discharge the entire cost and expense of the making, such retaining
wall shall be built entirely upon the lot having the higher grade and
shall thereafter be maintained jointly by the owners of the land on both
sides thereof.
E. Retaining walls to support adjoining earth. Where an excavation has
been made or a fill placed on any lot but, as the case may be, not below
or above the legal grade in conformity with the street on which that lot
fronts and the land adjoining it has no building or permanent structure
thereon, other than frame sheds or structures of like character, and
where a retaining wall shall be necessary to support the adjoining
earth, such retaining wall shall stand 1/2 upon the lot of each owner and
shall be made and maintained jointly by the owners of the land on each
side, provided that if the owner of the lot having the lower grade shall
bear and discharge the entire cost and expense of the making, such
retaining wall shall be built entirely upon the lot having the higher
grade and shall thereafter be maintained jointly by the owners of the
land on both sides thereof.
F. Surplus retaining wall. Where any owner shall insist on maintaining his
ground either higher or lower than the legal regulation as hereinafter
provided, except in a case herein otherwise specifically provided for,
the surplus retaining wall, which may be necessary to support such
height and provide for such excavation, shall be made and maintained
at the sole expense of such owner.

strength of at least 55,000 pounds per square inch:
For cinder concrete:
Twenty thousand when reinforcement is continuous.
Fourteen thousand when reinforcement is hooked or attached
to one or both supports.
For stone concrete:
Fifteen thousand when reinforcement is hooked or attached
to one or both supports.
Twenty-three thousand when reinforcement is continuous.
(b) The use of this formula is forbidden unless the reinforcement is

bond at 50 pounds per square inch and n equals 30, and the
strength may be figured by the usual methods.
(d) If steel of an ultimate strength in excess of 55,000 pounds per
square inch is used, the above coefficient may be increased in
the ratio of the ultimate strength to 55,000 but at most 30%,
provided that a certificate of the manufacturer, certifying to
the minimum strength of the wire fabric actually to be used, is
submitted before erection.

Superintendent of Buildings and continuously maintained and
operated to provide at all times not less than four changes per hour
of the air volume of such water closet compartment daily from 7:00
a.m until 7:00 p.m., and nothing in regard to the separation of
water closet compartments from each other shall apply to a general
toilet room containing several water closets hereafter placed or
heretofore lawfully placed in a multiple dwelling, provided that
such water closets are supplemental to the water closet
accommodations required by law for the use of the tenants of said
dwelling or are solely for the use of business portions of the
building.
(2) Except as provided in § 86-132F, no water closet shall be
maintained in the cellar of any multiple dwelling unless such water
closet is supplemental to those water closets required by this
article, nor without a written permit from the Superintendent of
Buildings.
(3) Every water closet compartment hereafter placed in any multiple
dwelling shall be provided with fixtures for gas or electricity to
properly light the same at night. The floor of every such water
closet compartment shall be made waterproof with asphalt, tile,
stone or some other waterproof material approved by the
Superintendent of Buildings, and such waterproofing shall extend

except where it is practicable to make such connection with a street
sewer. In every multiple dwelling, all shafts, courts, areas and yards
shall be properly graded and drained and connected with the
stormwater drain so that all water may pass freely into it, except that
where no stormwater drain or combined sewer exists in the street, the
Superintendent of Buildings may permit the shafts, courts, areas and
yards to be drained into the street gutter, provided that such gutter
leads to a natural channel or watercourse or, if the soil be permeable, to
be drained into a dry well. When required by the Superintendent of
Buildings, the shafts, courts, areas and yards shall be properly
concreted.
D. Repairs to multiple dwellings. Every multiple dwelling and every part
thereof shall be kept in good repair, and the roof shall be kept so as not

as to prevent its dripping to the ground or causing dampness in the
walls, ceilings, yards or areas. The owner of such multiple dwelling
shall be responsible for compliance with the provisions of this section,
but the tenant also shall be liable for every violation of the provisions of
this section if such violation is caused by his own willful act or
negligence or that of any member of his household or his guest.
E. Painting shafts and courts. The walls of all courts and shafts of multiple
dwellings, unless built of a light color brick or stone, shall be thoroughly
whitewashed or painted a light color by the owner and shall be so
maintained. Such whitewash or paint shall be renewed whenever
necessary as may be determined and required by the Superintendent of
Buildings. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to walls of
outer courts when such courts open on a street.
F. Cleanliness. Every multiple dwelling and every part thereof shall be
kept clean and free from vermin and from any accumulation of dirt, filth
or garbage or other matter in or on the same or in the yards, courts,
passages, areas or alleys connected with or belonging to the same. The
owner of every multiple dwelling or part thereof shall thoroughly
cleanse every room, passage, stair, floor, window, door, wall, ceiling,
privy, watercloset, cesspool drain, hall, cellar, roof and every other
public part of said multiple dwelling or part of the dwelling of which he
is the owner to the satisfaction of the Superintendent of Buildings and
shall keep said parts of said multiple dwelling in a clean condition at all
§ 86-134 FREEPORT CODE § 86-134
1:380
times, but this provision shall not be construed to make the owner
responsible for such cleanliness of occupied rooms or apartments.
Where carpets or rugs are provided in public parts of the multiple
dwelling, they shall be taken up and cleaned once a year or as often
as the Superintendent of Buildings shall deem necessary. The interior
surfaces of walls and ceilings of any multiple dwelling, whether or
not in public parts thereof, shall be painted or, if papered, shall be
repapered or painted, and the ceilings shall be rekalsomined,
repapered or repainted whenever necessary to keep said surfaces in a
sanitary condition. No wallpaper shall be placed upon a wall or ceiling

person shall place ashes, garbage, rubbish, filth, urine or fecal matter
in any place in a multiple dwelling, other than in that provided for the
same, or keep ashes, garbage, rubbish, filth, urine or fecal matter in
his apartment or upon his premises such length of time as to create a
nuisance. Any tenant shall be punishable hereunder for the existence
of conditions in violation of the provisions of this article within his
apartment to the extent that such conditions are caused by him or
by the members of his household and are under his control, but this
provision shall be construed to relieve the owner of any liability or
duty under this subsection, except where such violation is caused and
continued solely by the tenant.
G. Receptacles for waste matter. The owner of every multiple dwelling
shall provide proper and suitable conveniences or receptacles for
ashes, rubbish, garbage, refuse and other waste matter for said
dwelling and shall arrange for the removal of such ashes, rubbish,
garbage, refuse and other waste matter daily from within said
structure.
H. Uses prohibited. No apartment in any Class A multiple dwelling shall be
used for a rooming or a lodging house or hotel, but this sentence shall
not be construed to prohibit the letting of one or more rooms in any
apartment in any Class A multiple dwelling to lodgers if no room in such
apartment is occupied by more than two persons. No such room shall be
let to any lodger unless such lodger and every other occupant of the
apartment in which such room is located shall have free and
unobstructed access to each required exit from such apartment. Such
access, if through any room, shall not be obstructed by any door or
device capable of being locked or fastened, and such exit shall be
deemed to include the opening to any required fire escape, fire stair or
fire tower directly accessible from such apartment. No multiple
dwelling or any part thereof or the lot or premises thereof shall be used
for the purpose of prostitution or assignation of any description. No
horse, cow, calf, swine, sheep or goat shall be kept in a multiple

§ 86-134 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 86-135
1:383
the clear. Stair landings at all floor levels shall be at least three feet
eight inches wide in the clear.
(3) Except as otherwise expressly provided in Subsection A(5), in every
fireproof multiple dwelling hereafter erected, if the number of
rooms, exclusive of bathrooms, water closet compartments and
cooking compartments, not exceeding 49 square feet in area on any
floor above the entrance floor exceeds 40, there shall be an
additional fire stair for each 20 rooms or fraction thereof on any
floor above the entrance floor in excess of 40, provided that if the
number of rooms, exclusive of bathrooms, water closet
compartments and cooking compartments, not exceeding 49
square feet in superficial floor area on any such floor above the
entrance floor does not exceed 50, in lieu of an additional fire stair,
one fire stair may be in clear width at least 1 1/2 times the width
specified for fire stairs in Subsection A(2), and every public hall
connected with such fire stair shall be 1 1/2 times the width
specified for public halls in Subsection F, and every entrance hall
connected with such fire stair shall be 1 1/2 times the width
specified for entrance halls in § 86-133A.
(4) Except as otherwise specifically provided in Subsection A(5) and
(7), such fire stairs shall be so located that there shall be horizontal
access from every apartment to not less than two fire stairs and not
less than one of which shall be within 75 feet horizontally in the line
of travel of at least one required exit from such apartment.
(5) Every Class B fireproof multiple dwelling hereafter erected in
which at least 80% of the living rooms above the second story open
directly upon a public hall without any intervening foyer or private
hall shall have at least two fire stairs accessible at each story from
each room through a public hall, and such fire stairs shall be so
located that at least one fire stair shall be at no greater distance
than 125 feet along the line of travel from the exit of any living
room in such multiple dwelling. Every such fire stair shall have a
clear width of at least three feet eight inches. Such two fire stairs
shall be deemed adequate for 70 such living rooms. If the number
of such living rooms on any such floor is greater than 70, for each
35 living rooms or fraction thereof in excess of 70 on any such floor,
there shall be one additional fire stair, except that if such fractional
excess number of living rooms is not more than 20% of the total
number of living rooms provided for by the required two fire stairs
and one additional fire stair for each 35 living rooms, if any, in
excess of 70, in lieu of another fire stair for such fractional excess
number of living rooms, the area of every fire stair landing at such
floor may be increased by not less than two square feet for each
living room of such fractional excess number of living rooms. In
every such Class B fireproof multiple dwelling, each living room
which is occupied by more than two persons shall be counted as
§ 86-135 FREEPORT CODE § 86-135
1:384
one additional room for each 400 cubic feet or fraction thereof by
which the cubic content of such room exceeds 800 cubic feet.
(6) A fire tower may, except as provided in Subsection A(7), be

rooms. Except as otherwise expressly provided in § 86-135A(5) and (7),
at least one fire stair shall be accessible from each such exit, and at
least one fire stair shall be distant not more than 75 feet from at least
one such exit. When any such fire stair serving any apartment as a
required means of egress from the building opens exclusively into an
entrance hall, no other fire stair serving the same apartment as a
required means of egress from the building shall open exclusively into
the same entrance hall. Any required fire stair not opening exclusively
into an entrance hall shall open on a street or in a yard, court or
passageway affording continuous, safe and unobstructed access to the
street, but any such required fire stair serving any apartment as a
means of egress from the building may have a supplementary entrance
into the same entrance hall as that into which any other fire stair
§ 86-135 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 86-135
1:385
serving the same apartment as a required means of egress from the
buildings opens exclusively. Whenever any apartment occupies parts of
more than one floor, there shall be at least one exit on each floor of such
apartment, and the number of exits on any floor of such apartment shall
be determined as though each floor of such apartment were a separate

every stair, fire stair and fire tower carried to the roof in accordance
with the provisions of Subsection A. In any fireproof multiple dwelling
hereafter erected, the roof of any penthouse, which is protected by
parapet walls or guardrails as required by § 86-133I, may, for the
purpose of this subsection, be deemed part of the main roof of such
multiple dwelling if unobstructed access is provided and maintained
between all required fire stair landings on the main roof adjoining such
penthouse and on the same penthouse and any other penthouse
extending above such main roof. Such unobstructed access shall, where
horizontal, be by means of a passage not less than three feet in clear
width and may include one or more stairs necessary to provide access
from any penthouse roof to any main roof adjoining such penthouse,
such stairs shall be constructed so as to conform to all the requirements
for stairways or fire escapes pursuant to § 86-137C and shall be so
located that there shall be a passageway not less than four feet in clear

(4) In every converted dwelling three stories in height, the first floor of
every public hall shall be of Class 1 or Class 2 construction or
provided with not less than three inches of cement deadening or, if
permitted by the Superintendent of Buildings, the spaces between
floor beams may be filled with incombustible materials of a
thickness equal to the depth of the floor beams.
P. Stairs in Class B converted dwellings. Every stair, fire stair, fire tower
and public hall of every dwelling hereafter converted to a Class B
multiple dwelling having more than 15 sleeping rooms above the
entrance story shall be fireproof throughout, enclosed in fireproof walls
and access to or egress from which shall be exclusively through
fireproof self-closing doors.
Q. Frame buildings on plot with converted dwelling. No frame structure
shall be erected or maintained upon the same lot or plot with a dwelling
hereafter converted to a multiple dwelling.
R. Water closets required.
(1) In every converted dwelling, there shall be, except as otherwise
provided in Subsection R(2), a separate water closet compartment
within each apartment. Every such water closet compartment and
bathroom shall be placed in a compartment completely separated
from every other water closet and bath, such compartment may
§ 86-139 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 86-139
1:401
also contain a bath, such compartment shall not be less than two
feet four inches wide in the clear and shall be enclosed with
plastered or tiled partitions which shall extend to the ceiling.
Nothing in this section in regard to the separation of water closet
compartments from each other shall apply to a general toilet room
containing several water closets, provided that such water closets
are supplemental to the water closet accommodations required
for the use of tenants of said dwelling. No water closet shall be
maintained in the cellar of any such converted dwelling unless such
water closet is supplemental to those water closets required by
this article. Every water closet compartment in any such converted
dwelling shall be provided with fixtures for gas or electricity to
properly light the same at night. The floor of every such water
closet compartment shall be made waterproof with asphalt, tile,
stone or some other waterproof material approved by the
Superintendent of Buildings, and such waterproofing shall extend
at least six inches above the floor so that said floor can be washed
or flushed out without leaking. No drip trays shall be permitted
in such water closet compartment. No such water closet or other
plumbing fixture shall be enclosed with any woodwork. In every
such converted dwelling, every water closet compartment and
bathroom shall be ventilated by one of the following methods:
(a) A window opening directly upon a street or upon a yard or a
court. Every such window shall be at least one foot by three
feet between stop beads and shall be made so as to readily
open to the extent of 1/2 its area.
(b) Every such compartment on the top floor of any converted
dwelling may be lighted and ventilated by a skylight directly
above such compartment not less than two feet in least
horizontal dimension, readily capable of being opened to the
extent of at least two square feet of its area by a convenient
operating device and equipped with ridge ventilators having
fixed openings of not less than 30 square inches in aggregate
area.
(c) Every such compartment on the floor next below the top floor
may be lighted and ventilated by a separate and independent
shaft not less than nine square feet in area and not less than
three feet in least horizontal dimension, such shaft to be of fireretarded
construction and to extend vertically to and through
the roof and be covered by a skylight not less than three feet in
least horizontal dimension, readily capable of being opened to
the extent of at least two square feet of its area by a convenient
operating device and equipped with ridge ventilators having
fixed openings of not less than 30 square inches in aggregate
area. Not more than one water closet or bathroom shall open
into any such shaft. There shall be no sash, grille or other
obstruction between such compartment and such skylight.
§ 86-139 FREEPORT CODE § 86-139
1:402
(d) Every such compartment on any floor of any such dwelling may
be ventilated and lighted by a window opening on a shaft not
less than three feet in least horizontal dimension and not less,
in horizontal area at any point, than nine square feet, plus
three square feet for each story below the roof through which
such shaft passes, and such shaft shall have its entire
horizontal area open to the sky without obstruction and shall
be made properly waterproofed and drained. If two or more
such compartments open into any such shaft, the opening from
such compartments into such shaft shall not be situated on
opposite sides of such shaft and shall be so arranged that
privacy is ensured. Every window into every such shaft shall be
at least one foot by three feet between stop beads and shall be
made so as to readily open to the extent of 1/2 its area. Every
such shaft shall be lined with material having a surface of light
color, and such material shall be fire-retarding material, except
when and to the extent required by the Superintendent of
Buildings to be fireproof.
(e) Every such compartment which is below the highest story of
any converted dwelling shall either be ventilated and lighted as
hereinbefore in this section provided or by a separate and
independent sheet metal flue not less than one square foot in
clear open cross-sectional area and not less than eight inches
in least horizontal dimension. Such flue shall connect at the
lower end with the compartment and shall extend directly and
vertically up through the roof. Ventilation through such flue
shall be induced by either one of two methods: first, by means
of connection at or near the lower end of such flue with a hotwater
system so arranged that, without diminishing the
required cross-sectional area or least horizontal dimension of
such flue at any point, the pipes will provide sufficient heat to
create an active updraft at all times within the flue, and such
flue shall, at its upper end, terminate in a suitable gooseneck,
raincap or other weatherproof device which will not obstruct
ventilation; or, second, by means of a wind-operated ventilator
situated at the top of the flue, which, in the opinion of the
Superintendent of Buildings, will permit a gravity flow of air
and will, in addition, induce a positive flow of air upward
whenever subjected to a wind velocity in excess of four miles
per hour, and such ventilator shall at all times be kept in good
order and repair. Every such flue or group of such flues shall be
enclosed in fire-retarding material throughout the length
thereof.
(f) Nothing in this section contained shall be deemed to require
any change in the lighting or ventilating of any existing water
closet compartment in any converted dwelling, which opens by
a window not less than three square feet in area between stop
beads into an existing shaft, open and unobstructed, lined with
§ 86-139 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 86-139

brick and having a horizontal area not less at any point than
nine square feet.
(2) Nothing in this subsection shall be deemed to require, in any
dwelling converted to Class B multiple dwelling, more nor shall
there be less than one water closet compartment for every seven
sleeping rooms.
S. Water supply. In every converted dwelling, there shall be proper
appliances to receive and distribute an adequate supply of water at
each floor of said dwelling at all times of the year during all times of the
day and night.
A. Repairs to multiple dwellings. Every multiple dwelling and every part
thereof shall be kept in good repair, and the roof shall be kept so as not
to leak, and all rain water shall be so drained and conveyed therefrom
as to prevent its dripping to the ground or causing dampness in the
walls, ceilings, yards or area. The owner of such multiple dwelling shall
be responsible for compliance with the provisions of this section, but
the tenant also shall be liable for every violation of the provisions of this
section if such violation is caused by his own willful act or negligence or
that of any member of his household or his guest.
B. Cleanliness of multiple dwellings.
(1) Every multiple dwelling and every part thereof shall be kept clean
and free from vermin and from any accumulation of dirt, filth or
garbage or other matter in or on the same or in the yards, courts,
passages, areas or alleys connected with or belonging to the same.
The owner of every multiple dwelling or part thereof shall
thoroughly cleanse every room, passage, stair, floor, window, door,
wall, ceiling, privy, water closet, cesspool, drain, hall, cellar, roof
and every other public part of said multiple dwelling or part of the
dwelling of which he is the owner to the satisfaction of the
Superintendent of Buildings and shall keep said parts of said
multiple dwelling in a clean condition at all times, but this provision
shall not be construed to make the owner responsible for such
cleanliness of occupied rooms or apartments. Where carpets or
rugs are provided in public parts of the multiple dwelling, they shall
be taken up and cleaned once a year or as often as the
Superintendent of Buildings shall deem necessary. The interior
surfaces of walls and ceilings of any multiple dwelling, whether or
not in public parts thereof, shall be painted or, if papered, shall be
repapered or painted, and the ceilings shall be rekalsomined,
repapered or repainted whenever necessary to keep said surfaces
in a sanitary condition. No wallpaper shall be placed upon a wall or
ceiling of any multiple dwelling unless all wallpaper shall be first
removed therefrom and said wall or ceiling thoroughly cleaned and
repaired. No person shall place ashes, garbage, rubbish, filth, urine

1:404
or fecal matter in any place in a multiple dwelling other than that
provided for the same or keep ashes, garbage, rubbish, filth, urine
or fecal matter in his apartment or upon his premises such length
of time as to create a nuisance.
(2) Any tenant shall be punishable hereunder for the existence of
conditions in violation of the provisions of this article within his
apartment to the extent that such conditions are caused by him or
by the members of his household and are under his control, but this
provision shall not be construed to relieve the owner of any liability
or duty under this section, except where such violation is caused
and continued solely by the tenant.
C. Existing rooms for living purposes. No room in any existing structure
shall be used for living purposes unless it shall have sufficient light and
ventilation, shall be welldrained and dry and shall be fit for human
habitation.
D. Light and ventilation. In all existing dwellings, the public halls and
stairs shall be provided with such skylights, ventilators, windows or
other means of light and ventilation as may be deemed practicable by
the Superintendent of Buildings. All skylights hereafter placed in such
houses shall be provided with ridge ventilators having a minimum
opening of 40 square inches and also with either fixed or movable
louvres or with movable sashes and shall be of such size as may be
determined to be practicable by said Superintendent, and the roofs of
such skylights shall be glazed with plain glass equipped with suitable
wire screen above and below.
E. Privacy. In every apartment of three or more rooms in all existing
dwellings, access to every living room and bedroom and to at least one
water closet compartment shall be had without passing through any
bedroom.

every apartment.
G. Egress. Every existing nonfireproof dwelling exceeding two stories in
height shall have at least two independent means of egress, which shall
extend from the ground floor to the roof and shall be located remote
from each other and shall be separated from each other by walls. One of
such means of egress shall be a flight of stairs constructed and
arranged as provided in § 86-139L, but this sentence shall not be
construed to require any alteration in the material or width of any stair
or its treads and risers lawfully permitted at the time this code becomes
effective. The other means of egress shall be directly accessible at each
story to each apartment without having to pass through the first means
of egress.
§ 86-140 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 86-140
1:405
H. Closet under stair. In existing nonfireproof dwellings, no closet of any
kind shall be constructed under any stair leading from the entrance
story to the upper stories, but such space shall be left entirely open and
kept clear and free from encumbrance.
I. Cellar entrance. In existing dwellings, there shall be an entrance to the
cellar or other lowest story from the outside of said building.
J. Water closet accommodations. In every dwelling, all water closet

§ 86-141. Location and height.
Air-supported structures may be erected inside or outside of the fire limits,
provided that they are not more than one story high above the ground or
above a roof that meets the requirements for Class I Fireproof Structures,
§ 86-13A. The type of occupancy in an air-supported structure shall be
for recreational purposes only, and then only as approved by the
Superintendent with the concurrence of the Village Board.
§ 86-142. Separation.
§ 86-143. Fire protection.
The ground enclosed by an air-supported structure and the ground for a
distance of at least 10 feet outside of same shall be cleared and maintained
clear of all combustible material or vegetation. No open flame of any kind
shall be employed within the structure or closer than 20 feet to any part of
the enclosure fabric. Smoking is prohibited within the structure and within
20 feet thereof. Fire-extinguishing facilities shall be provided in accordance
with § 86-125.
§ 86-144. Exits.
Notwithstanding any other requirements of this code, travel distance to an
exit from any point within an air-supported structure shall not exceed 75
feet. Exit doors in air-supported structures shall close automatically against
normal operational pressures. Opening force at the edge of such doors shall
not exceed 15 pounds with the structure at operational pressure. Exit doors
shall be located in frames so constructed that they will remain operative
and support the weight of the structure in a state of total collapse.
A. No air-supported structure shall be erected closer than 20 feet to any
interior lot line nor closer than 30 feet in any direction to an
unprotected opening, required exterior stairway or corridor or required
exit door on the same level or above the level of the air-supported
structure. An air-supported structure may abut another building on the
same lot if there are no unprotected openings or exits above or within
30 feet as above stipulated, if there is no door between them that is a
required exit and if the exterior wall separating them meets the
requirements of Class 1 Fireproof Structures.
B. Requirements for separation from other buildings on the site may be
waived by the Superintendent where an air-supported structure is used
for on-site temporary shelter for construction work or incidental
fabrication of construction elements to be used on the site of
construction.

§ 86-147. Pressurization system.
A. Air-supported structures shall be anchored to the ground or supporting
structure by either ballast or positive anchorage sufficiently and evenly
distributed and adequate to resist the inflation lift load, the
aerodynamic lift load and the drag (shear, load due to wind impact). The
latter factors shall be based on a sustained wind velocity of at least 70
miles per hour, gusts to 80 miles per hour and an estimated stagnation
of not less than 0.5 q for structures on grade whose height is equal to or
less than the width of the structure. For greater heights or for elevated
structures, increased anchorage shall be provided, justified by
analytical and/or experimental data.
B. The skin of the structure shall be of such strength and the joints so
constructed as to provide a minimum dead-load strip tensile strength at
70 of four times the seventy-miles-per-hour design load (inflation and
aerodynamic loading). The joints shall provide a dead-load strip tensile
strength at 160° F. of twice the seventy-miles-per-hour design load (i.e.,
a factor of safety of four and two respectively). In addition, the material
shall provide a trapezoidal tear strength of at least 15% of the
maximum design tensile load. Material and joint strength shall be so
certified by the manufacturer, justified by analytical and/or
experimental data.
A. Air-supported structures shall be inflated and shall remain inflated
during all periods of occupancy to a minimum differential pressure of
0.88 inch and a maximum differential pressure of 1.50 inches of water.
Ventilation flow per occupant, either through vents or anticipated
leakage, shall comply with the requirements of Article VI of this code.
B. Where the net floor area per occupant is 150 square feet or less, the
structure shall be provided with at least two blowers, each of which

pressure. Also, an auxiliary engine-generator set capable of powering
one blower or a supplementary blower powered by an internal
combustion engine, either of which shall have the capacity to run
continuously for four hours, shall be located outside the structure, shall
be weather-protected and shall be arranged to automatically operate
the blower within 20 seconds upon failure of the normal source. Heat
shall be provided from a source outside the structure so arranged as to
prevent the spread of fire to the structure. The temperature within the
air-supported structure shall be maintained at not less than 50° F.
§ 86-145 FREEPORT CODE § 86-147
1:408
§ 86-148. Certificates of occupancy.
Certificates of occupancy for air-supported structures shall be issued for a
period not exceeding one year, and such certificate may be renewed for oneyear
periods thereafter if the air-supported structure complies with all laws,
codes, rules and regulations in effect at the time of the request for renewal.
The fee for a certificate of occupancy for an air-supported structure shall be
as elsewhere specified in this code for a temporary certificate of occupancy,
and the fee shall also be due each time that a request is made for renewal.
C. The air-supported structure shall be equipped with a fail-safe alarm
system. An exit alarm is to sound when the inside air pressure nears
atmospheric pressure and when there is a sharp drop in inside air
pressure as might occur through a large tear or hole in the fabric. Prior
to utilizing the air-supported structure and issuance of a certificate of
occupancy, the alarm system is to be tested in the presence of the
Superintendent or his representative and shall meet his approval.

Interim Development No. 1
[Added 1-6-1986 by L.L. No. 1-198632]
§ 86-149. Legislative intent.
The Board of Trustees finds that, pending the enactment of an amendment
to the Master Plan for the Incorporated Village of Freeport, it is necessary
for the good, safety and welfare of the community to adopt a moratorium on
the issuance of building permits for improvements within the affected areas
described hereinbelow. The Board of Trustees is presently considering three
reports entitled "Waterfront Area Studies, 1985," "Freeport Municipal
Stadium Study of Future Use Options" and "Freeport Industrial Area
Parking Study," all of which were prepared by the Village Planning
Consultants, Raymond, Parish, Pine and Weiner, Inc. It is the purpose of
this Interim Development Law to stop, for the time period provided, all
construction in the areas presently under consideration for rezoning, except
that specifically authorized by this article. It is the findings of the Board
that without such interim prohibitions, proposed amendments to the Master
Plan would be ineffectual if building permits are issued pending adoption of
said amendments.
§ 86-150. Prohibitions on issuance of permits.
Notwithstanding any of the provisions to the contrary contained herein
in Chapter 86 and except as hereinafter provided in § 86-152 hereof, the

Interim Development No. 2
[Added 6-19-1989 by L.L. No. 2-1989]
§ 86-153. Legislative intent.
The Board of Trustees finds that, pending completion of the aquatic
resources study and the adoption of amendments to the Village of
Freeport's Master Plan, including amendments to the Zoning Code for the
Incorporated Village of Freeport, in order to implement recommendations
resulting from said study, it is necessary for the good, safety and welfare of
the community to adopt a moratorium on the issuance of building permits
for improvements within the affected areas described hereinbelow. The
Board of Trustees is presently awaiting the completion of an aquatic
resources study, to be completed pursuant to a contract by and between the
Incorporated Village of Freeport and Donham and Sweeney, Inc., of Boston,
Massachusetts, and a contract between the Kearney/Centaur Division of
A.T. Kearney, Inc., of Alexandria, Virginia, pursuant to a grant to the State
of New York by the federal government under Section 306 of the Federal
Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972, as amended. The purpose of said
grant and study is to identify aquatic resources, make recommendations as
to their protection, preservation, enhancement and prudent management
and recommend necessary amendments to the Village's Master Plan in
so far as it pertains to zoning and land use. It is the purpose of this
Interim Development Law No. 2 to stop, for the time period provided
herein, all construction in those areas presently zoned Marine Business
District and/or Marine Industries District, except that which is specifically
authorized by this article. The Board of Trustees finds that, without such
interim prohibition, any proposed amendments to the Master Plan resulting
from said study, including any amendments to the existing Zoning Code,
would be ineffectual if building permits are issued pending adoption of said
amendments.
§ 86-154. Prohibitions on issuance of permits.
Notwithstanding any of the provisions to the contrary contained herein
in Chapter 86 and except as hereinafter provided in § 86-156 hereof, the
Superintendent of Buildings is hereby prohibited from issuing any building
permits for improvements within any area zoned Marine Business District
and/or Marine Industries District for a period of 120 days following the
effective date of this article.
§ 86-155. Time limitations on prohibitions.
The time period for the prohibition of the issuance of building permits
referred to hereinabove at §§ 86-153 and 86-154 shall be in effect for a
period of 120 days following the effective date of this article and may be
extended by ninety-day increments or less upon resolution by the Board of
Trustees up to a period not to exceed 1 1/2 years from the effective date of
this article.

permits for structural repairs to existing residential and commercial
structures so long as said repairs do not result in an increase in the size
of said existing structures. Furthermore, the Superintendent of Buildings
may continue to accept or deny applications for permits, with or without
modifications, for the construction of an individual detached single-family
residence on one building lot, for additions to existing detached singlefamily
residences and for additions to existing commercial nonresidential
buildings, provided that said additions shall not exceed 10% of the total

Interim Development Law No. 3
[Added 10-27-1997 by L.L. No. 11-1997]
§ 86-157. Legislative intent.
The Board of Trustees finds that, pending the enactment of the new
Comprehensive Plan for the Incorporated Village of Freeport and
preparation of laws, rules and regulations, including but not limited to
providing for appropriate sanitary and parking facilities, for the landside
operation of charter boats not currently operating from the harbors, ports
and waterways in the Incorporated Village of Freeport, it is necessary for
the health, safety and welfare of the community to adopt a moratorium
on the establishment and operation of charter boats not currently sailing
within or leaving from the harbors, ports and waterways in the Incorporated
Village of Freeport. It is the finding of the Board that without such interim
prohibitions, the proposed Comprehensive Plan and laws, rules and
regulations to be promulgated thereunder would be rendered ineffectual
if such building permits are issued pending the adoption of the
Comprehensive Plan, laws, rules and regulations permitting charter boats
to commence operation from the harbors, ports and waterways of the
Incorporated Village of Freeport.
§ 86-158. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:

passengers, being used as a means of transportation on or in water, which
is available to the public, whether or not for a fee, for rental, private or
public parties or entertainment, for fishing trips whether private or public,
for scenic cruises or for cruises with or without a particular destination.
§ 86-159. Prohibitions on issuance of permits.
Notwithstanding any of the provisions to the contrary contained herein
in Chapter 86 or Chapter 210 of the Code of the Incorporated Village of
Freeport, the Superintendent of Buildings is hereby prohibited from issuing
any building permits for any parking lot, building, structure, facility or any
other improvement to be used, erected or modified for use in conjunction
with the establishment, maintenance or operation of any charter boat
leaving from the harbors, ports and waterways in the Incorporated Village
of Freeport. This section shall not be construed to prohibit the issuance of
any permit for the installation or repair of any bulkhead.

§ 87-1. Findings.
The Mayor and the Board of Trustees of the Incorporated Village of
Freeport finds that the potential and/or actual damages from flooding and
erosion may be a problem to the residents of the Village of Freeport and that
such damages may include destruction or loss of private and public housing;
damage to public facilities, both publicly and privately owned; and injury to
and loss of human life. In order to minimize the threat of such damages and
to achieve the purpose and objectives hereinafter set forth, this chapter is
adopted.
§ 87-2. Purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
A. Regulate uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due
to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood heights or velocities.
B. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve
such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction.
C. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
natural protection barriers which are involved in the accommodation of
floodwaters.
D. Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage.
E. Regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert
floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.
F. Qualify for and maintain participation in the National Flood Insurance.

the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be
evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD  The land in the floodplain
within a community subject to a one-percent-or-greater chance of
flooding in any given year. This area may be designated as Zone A,
AE, AH, AO, A1-A30, A99, V, VO, VE, or V1-V30. It is also commonly
referred to as the base floodplain or one-hundred-year floodplain. For
purposes of this chapter, the term "special flood hazard area (SFHA)" is
synonymous in meaning with the phrase "area of special flood hazard."

available, for all new and substantial improvements to structures,
floodplain development permit applications shall be accompanied by
design plans and specifications, prepared in sufficient detail to enable
independent review of the foundation support and connection
components. Said plans and specifications shall be developed or
reviewed by a licensed professional engineer or architect, and shall be
accompanied by a statement, bearing the signature of the architect or
engineer, certifying that the design and methods of construction to be
used are in accordance with accepted standards of practice and with all
applicable provisions of this chapter.
A. Permit application review. The local administrator and/or duly
authorized agent shall conduct the following permit application review
before issuing a floodplain development and/or building permit:
(1) Review all applications for completeness, particularly with the
requirements of § 87-13, Permit application, for compliance with
the provisions and standards of this chapter.
(2) Review subdivision and other proposed development, including
manufactured home parks to determine whether proposed building
sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a proposed building
site is located in an area of special flood hazard, all new
construction and substantial improvements shall meet the
applicable standards of §§ 87-15 through 87-16.
(3) Determine whether any proposed development in an area of special
flood hazard may result in physical damage to any other property.
§ 87-13 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 87-14
1:429
The local administrator may require the applicant to submit
additional technical analysis and data necessary to complete the
determination. If the proposed development may result in physical
damage to any other property or fails to meet the requirements of
§§ 87-15 through 87-16, no permit shall be issued. The applicant
may revise the application to include measures that mitigate or
eliminate the adverse effects and resubmit the application.
(4) Determine that all necessary permits have been received from
those governmental agencies from which approval is required by
state, county or federal law.
B. Use of other flood data.
(1) When the Federal Emergency Management Agency has designated
areas of special flood hazard on the community's Flood Insurance
Rate Map (FIRM) but has neither produced water surface elevation
data (These areas are designated Zone A on the FIRM.) nor
identified a floodway, the local administrator shall obtain, review
and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data
available from federal, state or other source, including data
developed pursuant to § 87-13F as criteria for requiring that new
construction, substantial improvements or other proposed
development meet the requirements of this chapter.
(2) When base flood elevation data are not available, the local
administrator may use flood information from any other
authoritative source, such as historical data, to establish flood
elevations within the areas of special flood hazard, for the purpose
of this chapter.
C. Alteration of watercourses. The local administrator shall:
(1) Notify adjacent communities and the New York State Department
of Environmental Conservation prior to permitting any alteration or
relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such
notification to the Regional Director, Region II, Federal Emergency
Management Agency.
(2) Determine that the permit holder has provided for maintenance
within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood-carrying capacity is not diminished.
D. Construction stage.
(1) The local administrator shall, in Zones A1-A30, AE and AH, and also
Zone A if base flood elevation data are available, upon placement of
the lowest floor or completion of floodproofmg of a new or
substantially improved structure, obtain from the permit holder a
certification of the as-built elevation of the lowest floor or
floodproofed elevation, in relation to mean sea level. The
certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of
§ 87-14 FREEPORT CODE § 87-14
1:430
a licensed land surveyor or professional engineer and certified by
same. For manufactured homes, the permit holder shall submit the
certificate of elevation upon placement of the structure on the site.
A certificate of elevation must also be submitted for a recreational
vehicle if it remains on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer
(unless it is fully licensed and ready for highway use).
(2) In Zones V1-V30 and VE, and also Zone V if base flood elevation
data are available, upon placement of the lowest floor of a new or
substantially improved structure, the permit holder shall submit to
the local administrator a certificate of elevation, in relation to mean
sea level, of the bottom of the lowest structural member of the
lowest floor (excluding pilings and columns). The certificate shall
be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a licensed land
surveyor or professional engineer and certified by same. For
manufactured homes, the permit holder shall submit the certificate
of elevation upon placement of the structure on the site. An

improved residential structures located in areas of special flood
hazard, in addition to the requirements in §§ 87-15B and C and
87-16.
(a) Within Zones Al-A30, AE, AH, and also Zone A, if base flood
elevation data are available, new construction and substantial
improvements shall have the lowest floor (including basement)
elevated to a minimum of four feet above the base flood
elevation or two feet above the New York State freeboard
requirement, whichever is greater. [Amended 7-8-2013 by
L.L. No. 3-2013 (as approved by the New York State
Division of Building Standards and Codes 2-27-2014)]

bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member supporting
the lowest elevated floor (excluding columns, piles, diagonal
bracing attached to the piles or columns, grade beams, pile
caps, and other members designed to either withstand storm
action or break away without imparting damaging loads to the
structure) is elevated to or above two feet above base flood
elevation so as not to impede the flow of water.
(3) Nonconversion agreement. [Added 5-6-2015 by L.L. No.
3-2015]
(a) Any owner who has applied for a permit to construct or elevate
a structure on a property located in the FEMA designated flood
§ 87-16 FREEPORT CODE § 87-16
1:436
hazard area must enter into a nonconversion agreement with
the Village of Freeport.
(b) Such agreement shall be signed by the owner prior to the
issuance of any building permits. This agreement shall be
recorded by the owner with the Nassau County Clerk's office.
(c) With this agreement, the owner shall agree that all
construction below the allowable lowest floor will meet all
requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program; shall
be in compliance with all local, county, state, and federal laws
rules and regulations; and will allow upon consent inspection
by the Department of Buildings to verify such conditions
continue to exist.
F. Structural designs shall consider the effects of wind and water loads
acting simultaneously during the base flood on all building components.
(1) The structural design shall be adequate to resist water forces that
would occur during a base flood. Horizontal water loads considered
shall include inertial and drag forces of waves, current drag forces,
and impact forces from waterborne debris. Dynamic uplift loads
shall also be considered if bulkheads, walls or other natural or manmade
flow obstructions could cause wave runoff beyond the
elevation of the base flood.
(2) Buildings shall be designed and constructed to resist the forces due
to wind pressures. Wind forces on the superstructure include
windward and leeward forces on vertical walls, uplift on the roof,
internal forces when openings allow wind to enter the house and
upward force on the underside of the house when exposed. In
design, the wind should be assumed to blow potentially from any
lateral direction relative to the house.
(3) Wind loading values shall be those required by BOCA 160.0, Wind
Loads (ASCE-1995).
G. Foundation standards.
(1) The piling or column foundations and structure attached thereto
shall be adequately anchored to resist flotation, collapse or lateral
movement due to the effects of wind and water pressures acting
simultaneously on all building components. Foundations must be
designed to transfer safely to the underlying soil all loads due to
wind, water dead load, live load, and other loads (including uplift
due to wind and water).
(2) Spread footings and fill material shall not be used for structural
support of a new building or substantial improvements of an
existing structure.
§ 87-16 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 87-16
1:437
(3) Soil-bearing tests must be submitted to the local administrator at
the time of application. The number of borings will be determined
by the scope of the project.
H. Piling foundation design.
(1) The design ratio of pile spacing to pile diameter shall not be less
than 8:1 for individual piles (This shall not apply to pile clusters
located below the design grade.). The maximum center-to-center
spacing of wood piles shall not be more than 12 feet on center
under load-bearing sills, beams, or girders.
(2) Pilings shall have adequate soil penetration (bearing capacity) to
resist the combined wave and wind loads (lateral and uplift)
associated with the base flood acting simultaneously with typical
structure (live and dead) loads, and shall include consideration of
decreased resistance capacity caused by erosion of soil strata
surrounding the piles. The minimum penetration for foundation
piles is to an elevation of five feet below mean sea level (msl) datum
if the BFE is +10 msl or less, or to be at least 10 feet below msl if
the BFE is greater than +10 msl.
(3) Pile foundation analysis shall also include consideration of piles in
column action from the bottom of the structure to the stable soil
elevation of the site. Pilings may be horizontally or diagonally
braced to withstand wind and water forces.
(4) The minimum acceptable sizes for timber piles are a tip diameter of
eight inches for round timber piles and eight by eight inches for
square timber piles. All wood piles must be treated in accordance
with requirements of EPEE-C3 to minimize decay and damage from
fungus.
(5) Reinforced concrete piles shall be cast of concrete having a twentyeight-
day ultimate compressive strength of not less than 5,000
pounds per square inch, and shall be reinforced with a minimum of
four longitudinal steel bars having a combined area of not less than
1% nor more than 4% of the gross concrete area. Reinforcing for
precast piles shall have a concrete cover of not less than 1 1/4
inches for No. 5 bars and smaller and not less than 1 1/2 inches for
No. 6 through No. 11 bars. Reinforcement for piles cast in the field
shall have a concrete cover of not less than two inches.
(6) Piles shall be driven by means of a pile driver or drop hammer,
jetted, or augered into place.
(7) Additional support for piles in the form of bracing may include
lateral or diagonal bracing between piles.
(8) When necessary, piles shall be braced at the ground line in both
directions by a wood timber grade beam or a reinforced concrete
§ 87-16 FREEPORT CODE § 87-16
1:438
grade beam. These at-grade supports should be securely attached
to the piles to provide support even if scoured from beneath.
(9) Diagonal bracing between piles, consisting of two-inch-by-eightinch
(minimum) members bolted to the piles, shall be limited in
location to below the lowest supporting structural member and
above the stable soil elevation, and aligned in the vertical plane
along pile rows perpendicular to the shoreline. Galvanized steel
rods (minimum diameter 1/2 inch) or cable-type bracing is
permitted in any place.
(10) Knee braces, which stiffen both the upper portion of a pile and the
beam-to-pile connection, may be used along pile rows
perpendicular and parallel to the shoreline. Knee braces shall be
two-by-eight lumber bolted to the sides of the pile/beam, or four-byfour-
or-larger braces framed into the pile/beam. Bolting shall
consist of two five-eighths-inch galvanized steel bolts (each end) for
two-by-eight members, or one five-eighths-inch lag bolt (each end)
for square members. Knee braces shall not extend more than three
feet below the elevation of the base flood.
(11) Masonry piers or poured-in-place concrete piers shall be internally
reinforced to resist vertical and lateral loads, and be connected
with a movement-resisting connection to a pile cap or pile shaft.
I. Connectors and fasteners. Galvanized metal connectors, wood
connectors, or bolts or size and number adequate for the calculated
loads must be used to connect adjoining components of a structure. Toe
nailing as a principal method of connection is not permitted. All metal
connectors and fasteners used in exposed locations shall be steel, hotdipped
galvanized after fabrication. Connectors in protected interior
locations shall be fabricated from galvanized sheet.
J. Beam-to-pile connections. The primary floor beams or girders shall
span the supports in the direction parallel to the flow of potential
floodwater and wave action and shall be fastened to the columns or
pilings by bolting, with or without cover plates. Concrete members shall
be connected by reinforcement, if cast in place, or (of precast) shall be
securely connected by bolting and welding. If sills, beams, or girders
are attached to wood piling at a notch, a minimum of two five-eighthsinch
galvanized steel bolts or two hot-dipped galvanized straps 3/16
inch by four inches by 18 inches each bolted with two one-half-inch lag
bolts per beam member shall be used. Notching of pile tops shall be the
minimum sufficient to provide ledge support for beam members without
unduly weakening pile connections. Piling shall not be notched so that
the cross section is reduced below 50%.
K. Floor and deck connections.
(1) Wood two-by-four-inch (minimum) connectors or metal joist
anchors shall be used to tie floor joists to floor beams/girders.
These should be installed on alternate floor joists, at a minimum.

bridging may be one-by-three-inch members, placed eight feet oncenter
maximum, or solid bridging of same depth as joist at same
spacing.
(2) Plywood should be used for subflooring and attic flooring to provide
good tortional resistance in the horizontal plane of the structure.
The plywood should not be less than 3/4 inch total thickness, and
should be exterior grade and fastened to beams or joists with 8d
annular or spiral thread galvanized nails. Such fastening shall be
supplemented by the application of waterproof industrial adhesive
applied to all bearing surfaces.
L. Exterior wall connections. All bottom plates shall have any required
breaks under a wall stud or an anchor bolt. Approved anchors will be
used to secure rafters or joists and top and bottom plates to studs in
exterior and bearing walls to form a continuous tie. Continuous fifteenthirty-
seconds-inch-or-thicker plywood sheathing overlapping the top
wall plate and continuing down to the sill, beam, or girder may be used
to provide the continuous tie. If the sheets of plywood are not vertically
continuous, then two-by-four nailer blocking shall be provided at all
horizontal joints. In lieu of the plywood, galvanized steel rods of onehalf-
inch diameter or galvanized steel straps not less than one inch wide
by 1/16 inch thick may be used to connect from the top wall plate to the
sill, beam or girder. Washers with a minimum diameter of three inches
shall be used at each end of the one-half-inch round rods. These anchors
shall be installed no more than two feet from each corner rod, no more
than four feet on center.
M. Ceiling joist/rafter connections.
(1) All ceiling joists or rafters shall be installed in such a manner that
the joists provide continuous tie across the rafters. Ceiling joists
and rafters shall be securely fastened at their intersections. A
metal or wood connector shall be used at alternate ceiling joist/
rafter connections to the wall top plate.
(2) Gable roofs shall be additionally stabilized by installing two-by-four
blocking on two-foot centers between the rafters at each gable end.
Blocking shall be installed a minimum of eight feet toward the
house interior from each gable end.
N. Projecting members. All cantilevers and other projecting members
must be adequately supported and braced to withstand wind and water
uplift forces. Roof eave overhangs shall be limited to a maximum of two
feet and joist overhangs to a maximum of one foot. Larger overhangs
and porches will be permitted if designed or reviewed and certified by a
registered professional engineer or architect.
O. Roof sheathing.
§ 87-16 FREEPORT CODE § 87-16
1:440
(1) Plywood, or other wood material, when used as roof sheathing,
shall not be less than 15/32 inch of thickness, and shall be of
exterior sheathing grade or equivalent. All attaching devices for
sheathing and roof coverings shall be galvanized or be of other
suitable corrosion-resistant material.
(2) All corners, gable ends, and roof overhangs exceeding six inches
shall be reinforced by the application of waterproof industrial
adhesive applied to all bearing surfaces of any plywood sheet used
in the sheathing of such corner, gable end, or roof overhang.
(3) In addition, roofs should be sloped as steeply as practicable to
reduce uplift pressures, and special care should be used in
securing ridges, hips, valleys, eaves, vents, chimneys, and other
points of discontinuity in the roofing surface.
P. Protection of openings. All exterior glass panels, windows, and doors
shall be designed, detailed, and constructed to withstand loads due to
the design wind speed of 75 mph. Connections for these elements must
be designed to transfer safely the design loads to the supporting
structure. Panel widths of multiple panel sliding glass doors shall not
exceed three feet.
Q. Breakaway wall design standards.
(1) The breakaway wall shall have a design safe loading resistance of
not less than 10 and not more than 20 pounds per square foot, with
the criterion that the safety of the overall structure at the point of
wall failure be confirmed using established procedures. Grade
beams shall be installed in both directions for all piles considered
to carry the breakaway wall load. Knee braces are required for
front row piles that support breakaway walls.
(2) Use of breakaway wall strengths in excess of 20 pounds per square
foot shall not be permitted unless a registered professional
engineer or architect has developed or reviewed the structural
design and specifications for the building foundation and
breakaway wall components, and certifies that:
(a) The breakaway walls will fail under water loads less than those
that would occur during the base flood; and
(b) The elevated portion of the building and supporting foundation
system will not be subject to collapse, displacement, or other
structural damage due to the effects of wind and water loads
acting simultaneously on all building components (structural
and nonstructural). Water loading values used shall be those
associated with the base flood. Wind loading values shall be
those required by the Building Code.
R. Nonresidential structures. The following standards apply to new and
substantially improved commercial, industrial, and other nonresidential

size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures
constructed below the base flood elevation, providing items in
§ 87-20D(1) through (12) have been fully considered. As the lot size
increases beyond the 1/2 acre, the technical justification required for

character and design of the structure.
C. Variances may be issued by the Zoning Board of Appeals for new
construction and substantial improvement and for other development
necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided
that:
(1) The criteria of Subsections A, D, E and F of this section are met.

minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no
additional threat to public safety.
D. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
E. Variances shall only be issued upon determination that the variance is
the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
F. Variances shall only be issued upon receiving written justification of:
(1) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
(2) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
(3) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety or
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or
victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or
ordinances.
G. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted for a building with the
lowest floor below the base flood elevation shall be given written notice
over the signature of a community official that the cost of flood
insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from
such lowest floor elevation. Such notice shall be a required condition of

ARTICLE I
Registration
[Adopted 9-9-2014 by L.L. No. 5-2014]
§ 88-1. Legislative intent.
The Village Board finds that the proliferation of vacant and abandoned
buildings, structures and dwellings in the Village of Freeport causes a
deterioration of communities and areas within the Village of Freeport and
has a negative impact on the value of property in close proximity to the
vacant and abandoned buildings, structures and dwellings. Furthermore,
the Village Board finds that vacant and abandoned buildings, structures
and dwellings have caused a serious threat to the safety and welfare of the
residents of the Village and had eroded the quality of life of all who live
and work in the Village. Abandoned and vacant buildings, structures and
dwellings are places of infestation of rodents, vermin, insects, wild animals
and other health-threatening creatures and diseases, provide shelter to
criminals and vagrants who use such places to evade the police and to
conduct illicit activities, and are an attractive nuisance to children and
adults alike.
§ 88-2. Definitions.
For purposes of this section, the following words and phrases shall have the
meanings respectively ascribed to them as follows:
BOARDED BUILDING(S) AND STRUCTURE(S)  A building(s) or
structure(s) with sheet(s) of plywood, wood or similar material(s) in front or
in place of one or more exterior doors, other than a storm door, or of one or
more windows.
OCCUPIED BUILDING(S) OR STRUCTURE(S)  Any building(s) or
structure(s) wherein one or more persons actually conducts a business or
resides in all or any part of the building as the business occupant, or as
the legal or equitable owner(s)/occupant(s) or tenant(s) on a permanent,
nontransient basis, or any combination of the same. For purposes of this
article, evidence offered to prove that a building is so occupied may include,
but shall not be limited to, the regular receipt of delivery of regular mail
through the United States Postal Service; proof of continual telephone,
electric, gas, heating, water and sewer services; a valid Village business
license, or the most recent, federal, state, or city income tax statements
indicating that the subject property is the official business or residence
address of the person or business claiming occupancy; or proof of pre-rental
inspection.
OWNER(S)  Any person, partnership, limited liability company,
corporation or other entity who, alone or jointly with others, shall have
legal title to any premises, with or without accompanying actual possession
thereof; or who shall have charge, care or control of any dwelling unit as
a cooperative shareholder or as executor, administrator, trustee, receiver

§ 88-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 88-2
1:449
including but not limited to a bank or lending institution, regardless of how
such possession, title or control was obtained.
VACANT BUILDING(S) OR STRUCTURE(S)  A building(s) or structure(s)
where no person or persons actually currently conducts a business, or
resides or lives in any part of the building or structure as the legal or
equitable owner(s) or tenant occupant(s), or owner-occupant(s), or tenant(s)
on a permanent, nontransient basis. Or wherein electric and water

names and addresses of all owners, in accordance with Subsections
A(1)(a) through (g) below, and any other information deemed
necessary by the Building Department, and shall be notarized. In
no instance shall the registration of a vacant building and the
payment of registration fees be construed to exonerate the owner,
agent or responsible party from responsibility for compliance with
any other building code or housing code requirement. The
registration fee(s), as required herein, shall be billed by the
Building Department and shall be paid by March 1 of each year. For

register and pay the annual nonrefundable registration fee of $250.
Thereafter, said fee shall be billed by the Building Department
annually on March 1 of each year.
(2) One vacant building registration may be filed to include all vacant
buildings situated upon a single property of an owner so
registering. The $250 fee shall apply to the property upon which
the buildings are situated. A separate fee need not be paid for each
building upon a single property.
(3) This fee shall be charged to the owner(s) as long as the building
remains vacant. The registration fee shall increase by $250 each
year, for each year that the property remains vacant.

occupied.
D. One-time waiver of registration fee. A one-time waiver of the
registration fee for up to 90 days may be granted by the Superintendent
of Buildings upon application of the owner, and upon review and advice
of the Village Attorney. A one-time waiver of the registration fee for up
to a ninety-day waiver may be given if an owner provides information
that they are actively pursuing mitigation/rehabilitation funding and
can be renewed for an additional 90 days provided that this
documentation is satisfied within 30 calendar days from the date of the

two-year waiver of the registration fee, or if denied by the

(1) After the owner is given notice of the amount of the registration fee
due, except for those owners that have properly perfected an
appeal as provided above, by certified mail, and the owner fails to
pay the amount due within 30 days, said amount shall constitute a
debt due and owing to the Village. Ownership verification shall be
by tax bill, water bill, electric bill, assessors records, deed, or
internet records accepted by New York State Courts. This
obligation shall constitute a lien and a charge on the real property
concerned until paid or otherwise satisfied and shall be collected
by the Village Treasurer in the same manner provided by law for
delinquent taxes.
(2) Duty to amend registration statement. If the status of the
registration information changes during the course of any calendar

Superintendent of Buildings as provided for in § 128-6E hereof, give
written notice to the persons interested in said building to appear

MALL AREA ASSESSMENT DISTRICT
GENERAL REFERENCES
Operation and Utilization of Freeport
Mall  See Ch. 180, Art. VII.
Taxation  See Ch. 185.
Zoning  See Ch. 210.
§ 145-1. Legislative findings.
A. There are three commercial areas which together form the core of the
Central Business District, which are in need of economic revitalization.
They are:
(1) The Freeport Village Mall, i.e., those businesses and properties
situated on the east and west sides of South Main Street between
Merrick Road and Sunrise Highway.
(2) The commercial area north of said Mall generally situated between
Freeport Plaza (east and west) on the north, Henry Street on the
east, Sunrise Highway (east and west) on the south and the Off-
Track Betting and Firestone Tire properties on the west.
(3) The commercial area south of said Mall generally situated between
Merrick Road (east and west) on the north, Henry Street on the
east, Smith Street on the south and Church Street on the west.
B. Together, these three areas generally comprise the area hereinafter
referred to as the "Mall Area Assessment District," the boundaries of
which are more particularly described in § 45-3 of this chapter.
C. There is a public as well as a private need, and it is both in the public
interest and in the private pecuniary interest of the merchants and
property owners located within the Mall Area Assessment District, to
reopen the Freeport Village Mall to both vehicular and pedestrian
traffic, to restore said street bed as an integral part of South Main
Street and to make other related improvements in connection
therewith. Such a reopening will improve the flow of vehicular traffic in
the area and will encourage the economic revitalization of the district.
D. There is a public as well as a private need, and it is both in the public
interest and in the private pecuniary interest of the merchants and
§ 142-13 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 145-1
1:611
property owners located within the Mall Area Assessment District,
to provide adequate public parking facilities, both on-street and offstreet,
in connection with such reopening and to make other related
improvements in connection therewith in order to encourage the
economic revitalization of the district.
E. However, the Board of Trustees has determined that because of the cost
involved in undertaking and completing the reopening of the Mall and
related improvements, because of the lack of availability of sufficient
federal community development funds and surplus general revenues
not otherwise committed to other development projects and because
the primary beneficiaries of the reopening of the Mall and related
improvements are the merchants and property owners situated within
the Mall Area Assessment District, the only way that said project could
be completed was for the Village of Freeport to:
(1) Undertake such work and improvements either directly through
the use of its own employees or indirectly through the use of public
contracts put out for competitive bids based upon plans and
specifications drawn, or through a combination of said methods;
(2) Initially finance the cost of said benefits, work and improvements
through the issuance of bond anticipation notes; and
(3) Assess the full costs of said benefits, work and improvements
against the properties benefited, i.e., those properties situated
within the boundaries of the Mall Area Assessment District, which
assessments may then be financed by the issuance of serial bonds
pursuant to § 11.00, Subdivision 34, of the Local Finance Law of the
State of New York.
F. There is a general consensus among the merchants and property
owners situated within the Mali Area Assessment District, which was
expressed at a public hearing held on February 24, 1986, that:
(1) The reopening of the Freeport Village Mall to both vehicular and
pedestrian traffic and other related improvements is vital to the
economic well-being of said district.
(2) Said project should go forward notwithstanding the lack of
availability of federal community development funds and surplus
general revenues not otherwise committed to other development
projects.
(3) The merchants and property owners of the Mall Area Assessment
District are the primary beneficiaries of said benefits, work and
improvements.
(4) The cost of the entire project should be initially financed by the
Village through the issuance of bond anticipation notes and
assessed against the properties situated within the Mall Area
Assessment District, which assessments may then be financed by
§ 145-1 FREEPORT CODE § 145-1
1:612
§ 145-2. Scope of improvements.
The scope of the improvements to be made is comprehensive and consists of
the reopening of the Freeport Village Mall to both vehicular and pedestrian
traffic, restoring it to its former status as an integral part of South Main
Street together with any and all benefits, work and improvements
reasonably connected therewith, including but not limited to the following:
the issuance of serial bonds pursuant to § 11.00, Subdivision 34, of
the Local Finance Law of the State of New York.
G. Accordingly, the Board of Trustees has determined that the project can

compliance with this article would constitute an unreasonable hardship
on the applicant, on the community or on other persons. Such
information shall further include but not be limited to the following:
(1) The plans, specifications and other information pertinent to such
sources, including but not limited to the nature and location of the
facility or process for which such application is made and the
reasons for which the variance is requested.

1:638
(2) The characteristics of the sound emitted by the source, including

Superintendent of Buildings or the willful misrepresentation of a
material fact contained in said application by an applicant shall be
cause for the rejection of the application by the Superintendent.

special variance may file a statement with the Department of Buildings
containing any information to support his claim. If the Department of
Buildings finds that a sufficient controversy exists regarding an
application, a public hearing may be held.
D. In determining whether to grant or deny the application, the
Superintendent of Buildings shall balance the hardship to the applicant,
the community and other persons of not granting the special variance
against the adverse impact on the health, safety and welfare of persons
affected, the adverse impact of property affected and any other adverse
impacts of granting the special variance.
E. If the special variance is granted, it may contain restrictions and
conditions, including a time limit on the permitted activity, that the
Superintendent of Buildings determines to be appropriate. However, in

effect or has not been revoked or been otherwise modified by the
Superintendent. Any person to whom a variance has been issued who
continues to engage in any noise-producing activity for which the
variance was sought following the termination or revocation of such
variance shall be deemed to be in violation of both this section and
§ 155-19 of this chapter, in addition to any other provision of this
chapter containing maximum permissible sound levels applicable to the
activity in question, and subject to the penalties contained in § 155-39

Graffiti
[Added 12-11-2006 by L.L. 7-200650]
§ 155-44. Purpose and intent.
§ 155-45. Definitions.
For the purposes of this article, the following words shall have the meanings
respectively ascribed to them in this section, except where the context
clearly indicates a different meaning:
AEROSOL PAINT CONTAINER  Any aerosol container that is adapted or
made for the purpose of applying spray paint or other substances capable
of defacing property.
BROAD-TIPPED MARKER  Any felt-tip indelible marker or similar
implement with a flat or angled writing surface that, at its broadest width,
is greater than 1/4 of an inch, containing ink or other pigmented liquid that
is not water soluble.
ETCHING EQUIPMENT  Any tool, device, or substance that can be used
to make permanent marks on any natural or man-made surface.
GRAFFITI  Any inscription, word, figure, painting or other defacement
that is written, marked, etched, scratched, sprayed, drawn, painted, or

A. The Board of Trustees of the Incorporated Village of Freeport is
enacting this article to help prevent the spread of graffiti vandalism and
to establish a program for the removal of graffiti from public and
private property.
B. The Board of Trustees finds that graffiti is a public nuisance and
destructive of the rights and values of property owners as well as the
entire community. Unless the Village acts to remove graffiti from public
and private property, the graffiti tends to remain. Other properties then
become the target of graffiti, and entire neighborhoods are affected and
become less desirable places in which to be, all to the detriment of the
Village.
C. The Board of Trustees intends, through the adoption of this article, to
provide additional enforcement tools to protect public and private
property from acts of graffiti vandalism and defacement. The Board
does not intend for this article to conflict with any existing anti-graffiti
state laws.
50.Editor's Note: This local law also repealed former Art. IV, Graffiti, added 10-28-1985 by
L.L. No. 5-1985.

PAINT STICK or GRAFFITI STICK  Any device containing a solid form of
paint, chalk, wax, epoxy, or other similar substance capable of being applied
to a surface by pressure and leaving a mark of at least 1/8 of an inch in

PERSON  Any individual, partnership, cooperative association, private
corporation, personal representative, receiver, trustee, assignee, or any
other legal entity.

that includes the fine and administrative costs.
(3) Upon an application and finding of indigence, the court may decline
to order fines against the minor, parents or guardian.
B. Restitution. In addition to any punishment specified in this section, the
court may order any violator to make restitution to the victim for
damages or loss caused directly or indirectly by the violator's offense in
the amount or manner determined by the court. In the case of a minor,

public good, as permitted under the general obligations.

Freeport or by the Superintendent of Buildings or his duly authorized

police services would have an immediate and adverse effect upon
the welfare and safety of persons and property.
(11)No event is scheduled elsewhere in the Village of Freeport where
the police resources required for that event are so great that the
deployment of police services for the proposed parade or public
assembly would have an immediate and adverse effect upon the
welfare and safety of persons and property.
B. No permit shall be granted that allows for the erection or placement of
any structure, whether permanent or temporary, on a Village street,
sidewalk or right-of-way unless advance approval for the erection or
placement of the structure is obtained from the Board of Trustees of the
Incorporated Village of Freeport.

Panhandling
[Added 2-28-2000 by L.L. No. 2-2000]
§ 155-87. Legislative findings.
§ 155-88. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
AGGRESSIVE MANNER  Includes:
A. The Board of Trustees finds that the increase in aggressive solicitation
throughout the Village has become extremely disturbing and disruptive
to residents and businesses and has contributed not only to the loss of
access to and enjoyment of public places but also to an enhanced sense
of fear, intimidation and disorder.
B. Aggressive solicitation usually includes approaching or following
pedestrians, repetitive soliciting despite refusals, the use of abusive or
profane language to cause fear and intimidation, unwanted physical
contact or the intentional blocking of pedestrian and vehicular traffic.
The Board of Trustees further finds that the presence of individuals who
might be soliciting monies from persons at or near banks, automated
teller machines or in public transportation vehicles and upon public
roadways is especially troublesome because of the enhanced fear of
crime in those confined environments. Such activity carries with it an
implicit threat to both persons and property.
C. The law is not intended to limit any persons from exercising their
constitutional rights to solicit funds, picket, protest or engage in other
constitutionally protected activity. Rather, its goal is to protect citizens
from the fear and intimidation accompanying certain kinds of
solicitation that have become an unwelcome and overwhelming
presence in the Village.
Intentionally or recklessly making any physical contact with or touching
another person in the course of the solicitation without the person's
consent.
A.
Following the person being solicited, if that conduct is:
Intended to or is likely to cause a reasonable person to fear
imminent bodily harm or the commission of a criminal act upon
property in the person's possession; or
(1)
Is intended to or is reasonably likely to intimidate the person being
solicited into responding affirmatively to the solicitation.
(2)
B.

AUTOMATED TELLER MACHINE  A device, linked to a financial
institution's account records, which is able to carry out transactions,
including, but not limited to, account transfers, deposits, cash withdrawals,
balance inquiries and mortgage and loan payments.
AUTOMATED TELLER MACHINE FACILITY  The area comprised of one
or more automatic teller machines and any adjacent space which is made
available to banking customers after regular banking hours.
BANK  Means any banking corporation as defined by Article I, § 2, of the
Banking Law of the State of New York.
CHECK CASHING BUSINESS  Any person duly licensed by the
Superintendent of Banks to engage in the business of cashing checks, drafts
or money orders for consideration pursuant to the provisions of the banking
laws.
Continuing to solicit within five feet of the person being solicited after
the person has made a negative response, if continuing the solicitation
is:
Intended to or is likely to cause a reasonable person to fear
imminent bodily harm or the commission of a criminal act upon
property in the person's possession; or
(1)
Is intended to or is reasonably likely to intimidate the person being
solicited into responding affirmatively to the solicitation;
(2)
C.
Intentionally or recklessly blocking the safe or free passage of the
person being solicited or requiring the person to take evasive action
to avoid physical contact with the person making the solicitation. Acts
authorized as an exercise of one's constitutional right to picket or
legally protest, and acts authorized by a permit issued pursuant to
§§ 155-54 through 155-71 of the Village Code, shall not constitute
obstruction of pedestrian or vehicular traffic under this article.
D.
Intentionally or recklessly using:
Obscene or abusive language or gestures intended to or likely
to cause a reasonable person to fear imminent bodily harm or
the commission of a criminal act upon property in the person's
possession; or
(1)
Words intended to or reasonably likely to intimidate the person into
responding affirmatively to the solicitation.
(2)
E.
Approaching the person being solicited in a manner that:
Is intended to or is likely to cause a reasonable person to fear
imminent bodily harm or the commission of a criminal act upon
property in the person's possession; or
(1)
Is intended to or reasonably likely to intimidate the person being
solicited into responding affirmatively to the solicitation.

persons has access, and includes, but is not limited to, alleys, bridges,

and streets open to the general public, and the doorways and entrances to
buildings and dwellings and the grounds enclosing them.

slugs, as defined herein.
F. Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to
treatment or reduction by the sewage treatment process employed or
are amenable to treatment only to such degree that the water pollution
control plant effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies
having jurisdiction over discharge to the receiving waters.
A. If any waters or wastes are discharged, or are proposed to be
discharged, into the public sewers, which waters contain the
substances or possess the characteristics enumerated in § 176-3E(4)
and which, in the judgment of the Commission, may have a deleterious
effect upon the sewage treatment processes, equipment or receiving
waters, or which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public
nuisance, the Commission may:
§ 176-3 FREEPORT CODE § 176-4
1:778
(1) Reject the waste; or
(2) Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to
the public sewers; and/or
(3) Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge.
B. Grease, oil, hair and sand interceptors shall be provided when the
Commission or Superintendent determines that they are necessary for
the proper handling of liquid wastes containing grease in excessive
amounts, or any flammable wastes, sand or other harmful ingredients,
except that such interceptors shall not be required for private
dwellings. All the interceptors shall be located as to be readily and
easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. No dishwater discharge
will be allowed to pass through any of the aforementioned interceptors.
C. All major contributing industries must comply with federal
pretreatment standards and any other applicable requirements
promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency in
accordance with Section 307 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act
Amendments of 1972. It shall be required that plans and other
documents must be submitted for approval before installation of
pretreatment or flow-equalizing facilities. All reports, plans and/or
specifications that propose pretreatment facilities must be approvable
and signed and sealed by a professional engineer, licensed to practice
in the State of New York. All such documents shall be subject to the
review and approval of the Commission, Superintendent of Public
Works, the Administrator of the United States Environmental
Protection Agency, the New York State Department of Environmental
Conservation and the Nassau County Department of Health.
D. Where preliminary treatment or flow-equalizing facilities are provided
for any waters or wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in
satisfactory and effective operation by the owner at his expense. There
shall be no by-pass of the pretreatment facilities which would allow the
entry of untreated or partially treated wastes to the public sewer
system.
E. When required by the Commission or the Superintendent, the owner of
any property serviced by a building lateral carrying industrial wastes
shall install a suitable control manhole, together with such necessary
meters and other appurtenances, including but not limited to parshall
flumes, venturi meters and weirs, in the building sewer to facilitate
observation, sampling and measurement of the wastes. Such manhole,
when required, shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved
by the Commission or Superintendent. The manhole shall be installed
by the owner at his expense and shall be maintained by him so as to be
safe and accessible at all times.
F. All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters
and wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be
determined in accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods
§ 176-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 176-4
1:779
for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, published by the
American Public Health Association, and shall be determined at the
control manhole provided or upon suitable samples taken at said
control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the
downstream manhole in the public sewer nearest the point at which
the building lateral is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by the
customarily accepted methods and to reflect the effect of constituents
upon the sewer system and to determine the existence of hazards to
life, limb and property. The particular analyses involved will determine
whether a twenty-four-hour composite of all outfalls of a premise is
appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are
obtained from twenty-four-hour composites of all outfalls, whereas pH's
are determined from periodic grab samples.
G. All sampling, analyses and flow measurements shall be performed by
personnel employed by the Village or by a laboratory or engineering
firm approved by the Commission. The sampling, analyses and flow
measurement procedures, equipment and results shall be subject at any
time to inspection by the Superintendent. Sampling and flowmeasurement
facilities shall be such as to provide safe access to
authorized personnel.
H. Those industrial wastewater dischargers required to make periodic
measurements of their wastewater flows and its constituents shall
annually make the minimum number of such measurements required.
Composite samples of the industrial wastewater shall be obtained for
the required analyses. Dischargers required to sample only a few days
per year shall sample during the period of highest wastewater flow and
wastewater constituent discharges.
I. Adequate care shall be maintained in obtaining, recording and
reporting the required data on wastewater effluent quality and quantity,
so that the precision and accuracy of the data will be equal to or better
than that achieved by the prescribed standard analytical procedures.
The industrial wastewater discharger shall calibrate and perform
maintenance procedures on all monitoring and analytical
instrumentation at sufficiently frequent intervals to ensure accuracy of
measurements. Sampling shall be representative of the volume and
quality of wastewater effluent discharged over the sampling and
reporting period. When required by the Commission or Superintendent,
dischargers shall install and maintain in proper order automatic flow
proportional sampling equipment and/or automatic analysis and
recording equipment. Care shall be exercised when collecting a
composite sample to assure that the proper preservative is present in
the sample container during sample collection. Depending on the
analysis to be conducted, several different containers and preservation
techniques may be required. Samples shall be analyzed as quickly as
possible after collection. The industrial wastewater discharger shall

§ 176-5. Applications for permits.
ascertain that the methodology used is reliable for its specific wastes
in its laboratory. Such discharger must be able to demonstrate to
the Commission or Superintendent that it has a viable quality control
program.
J. The industrial wastewater discharger shall maintain and record the
results of all required analyses and measurements and shall record, for
all samples, the date and time of sampling, the sample method used, the
dates the analyses were performed, who performed the sampling and
analyses and the results of such analyses. All records shall be retained
for a minimum of three years, such a period to be extended during the
course of any unresolved litigation or when so requested by the
Commission or Superintendent. The industrial wastewater discharger
also shall retain all original stripchart recordings and any continuous
monitoring instrumentation and any calibration and maintenance
records for a minimum of three years, such period to be extended
during the course of any unresolved litigation or when so requested by
the Commission or Superintendent. The industrial wastewater
discharger shall provide the above records and shall demonstrate the
adequacy of the flow-measuring and sampling methods upon request of
the Commission or the Superintendent. The industrial wastewater
discharger shall identify the effluent sampling point used for each
discharge pipe by providing a sketch or flow diagram, as appropriate,
showing the locations.
K. No statement contained in this chapter shall be construed as
preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the Village
and any industrial concern.
A. Applications for permits under these regulations shall be made on
printed forms to be furnished by the Superintendent. The permit
application shall be supplemented by any plans, specifications or other
information considered pertinent in the judgment of the
Superintendent.
B. There shall be two classes of permits, to be known as "special" and
"general." A general permit shall be sufficient to authorize the
connection or attachment, as well as the discharge of sewage from
private dwellings, into the Village sewer facility; all other connections,
attachments, discharges or uses require special permits. Applications
for general permits shall be signed by the fee owner of the premises as
shown by the last preceding tax roll or his attorney-in-fact specifically
authorized by such fee owner to make such application. Applications for
special permits may be made in the same manner or by a lessee of the
premises. In each instance where a special permit is required, it shall
be unlawful to contribute any sewage, directly or indirectly, into Village
sewer facilities without such permit, and the fact that the contributor
has obtained a general permit from the Village shall be no defense to a
prosecution for a violation of these regulations.
§ 176-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 176-6
1:781
§ 176-6. Conditions which void special permits.
Every special permit is nonassignable and is void upon the occurrence of

amend a schedule of fees payable by an applicant for general and special
permits issued and required under this chapter.
§ 176-8. Revocation of permit.
A permit may be revoked at any time by the Commission, in writing, for
the continuance, after notice to desist, of any practice or operation which
contravenes the purposes set forth in this chapter or for a refusal to permit
inspection by any employee, officer or duly authorized representative of the
Village.
§ 176-9. Permit to be available for exhibition.
A permit for making a connection must be kept on the premises, available
for exhibition at all times during the construction of the work, and the
failure to keep such permit so available shall be presumptive evidence that
the work is being conducted in violation of these regulations.
§ 176-10. Building sewers and building laterals.
A. Violation by the permittee of any of the conditions prescribed in his
permit.
B. Any change in either the permittee's business or his processes which

B. All costs and expenses incident to the installation and connection of the
building sewer and/or building lateral shall be borne by the owner. The
owner shall indemnify and save the Village harmless from any loss or
damage or expenses, claims or suits arising out of or in connection with
the installation and connection of the building sewer and/or building
lateral. All building lateral and building sewer connections must be
maintained in good working condition at the expense of the property
owner. All necessary repairs shall be promptly made at the expense of

C. A separate and independent building sewer and building lateral shall be
provided for every building, except where one building stands at the
rear of another on the same lot and no private sewer is available or can
be constructed to the rear building through an adjoining alley, court,
yard or driveway. The building sewer from the front building may be
extended to the rear building, and the whole considered as one building
sewer with a separate permit for each building. In the case of one- or
two-story multiple dwellings, when a building is constructed so as to
allow more than two units to be constructed on the same floor, a
separate building drain shall be provided for each unit.
D. Old building laterals may be used in connection with new buildings only
when they are found on examination and test by the Superintendent to
meet all requirements of this chapter. Where cesspools or septic tanks
are to be discontinued following connections to a public sewer, the
owner shall have these pools promptly emptied, cleaned and backfilled
with earth, sand or other acceptable clean material.
E. The size, slope, alignment, material or construction of a building sewer
and building lateral, and the methods to be used in excavating, placing
the pipe, jointing, testing and backfilling the trench, shall all conform to
the requirements of the Building and Plumbing Codes and all applicable
rules and regulations of the Village. In the absence of code provisions or
in amplification thereof, the materials and procedures set forth in
appropriate specifications of the American Society for Testing Materials
and the Water Pollution Control Federation Manual of Practice No. 9
shall apply.
F. Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the building
at an elevation below the basement floor. In all buildings in which any
building drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer,
sanitary sewage carried by such building drain shall be lifted by an
approved means and discharged into the building lateral. The cost
thereof shall be borne by the owner.
G. No person shall make connections of roof downspouts, exterior
foundation drains, areaway drains or other sources of surface runoff or
groundwater to a building lateral, a building sewer or building drain
which in turn is connected directly or indirectly to a public sewer.
H. The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall
conform to the requirements of the Building and Plumbing Codes and
all applicable rules and regulations of the Village or the procedures set
forth in appropriate specifications of the American Society for Testing
Materials and the Water Pollution Control Federation Manual of
Practice No. 9. All such connections shall be made gastight and
watertight. Any deviation from the prescribed procedures and materials
must be approved by the Superintendent before installation.
I. All excavations for building lateral and building sewer installation shall
be adequately guarded with barricades and lights so as to protect the

the duty of the applicant to notify the Superintendent that the connection is
ready for inspection, and such connection shall not be covered until it has
been inspected and approved by a Village representative.
§ 176-13. False statement in or noncompliance with permit.
The making of any false statement in an application for a permit, or the
failure to comply with any conditions in a permit, shall be deemed a
violation of these regulations.
§ 176-14. Additional permits.
The issuance of a permit for the making of a connection shall not relieve
the permittee or any person presuming to act under the authority of such
permit from obtaining any additional permits required by law, ordinance or
regulation, for the opening of streets or roads, the construction of buildings
or the like.

§ 180-58. Penalties for offenses.
N. No person shall operate, nor shall any owner permit the operation or

load, is greater than the posted weight or exceeds the height of the
posted clearance as shown on an official sign.
O. If a vehicle or combination of vehicles is operated in violation of this
section, an appearance ticket or summons may be issued to the
registrant of the vehicle or, if a combination of vehicles, to the
registrant of the hauling vehicles, rather than the operator. In the event
that the vehicle is operated by a person other than the registrant, any
appearance ticket or summons issued to the registrant shall be served
upon the operator, who shall be deemed the agent of the registrant only
for the purpose of receiving such appearance ticket or summons. In
addition, a notice containing all pertinent information relating to the
charge which is contained on the summons or appearance tickets shall
be mailed by or on behalf of the person who issued the appearance
ticket or summons to the registrant of said vehicle or trailer on file with
the Department of Motor Vehicles of said state no less than five days
before the return date specified on the appearance ticket or summons.
Proof of mailing to the registrant under this section shall be filed with
the court in which the appearance ticket or summons is returnable on
or before the return date. A failure of a corporate registrant to appear
or answer upon arraignment or trial shall constitute a default which
shall result in the entry of a civil judgment in an amount corresponding
to the amount of fine for a violation of this section. The provisions of this
subsection shall not apply to owner-operators of any motor vehicle or to
any motor vehicle or trailer which is registered in the name of a person
whose principal business is the lease or rental of motor vehicles or
trailers, unless the motor vehicle or trailer is being operated by an
employee of the registrant or for a community of interest other than the
lease or rental agreement between the panics to the lease or rental
agreement.
P. In any case wherein the charge before the court alleges a violation of
this section, any plea of guilty thereafter entered in satisfaction of such
charge must include at least a plea of guilty to a violation of one of the
subsections of this section. No other disposition of plea of guilty to any
other charge in satisfaction of such shall be authorized; provided,
however, that if the prosecuting attorney, upon reviewing the available
evidence, determines that the charge of a violation of this section is not
warranted, the prosecuting attorney may consent, and the court may
allow, a disposition by plea of guilty to that or another charge in
satisfaction of such charge; provided, however, that the court must
impose at least the minimum fine, as authorized in this article, for the
offense.
§ 180-57 FREEPORT CODE § 180-58
1:820

fine of not less than $200 nor more than $500 or by imprisonment for
not more than 30 days, or by both such fine and imprisonment, for the
first offense; by a fine of not less than $500 nor more than $1,000 or by

vehicle or combination of vehicles whose weight exceeds the weight
limitations set forth in any of these sections or the weight limitations
specified by a permit issued by the United States Department of
Transportation or the New York State Department of Transportation
shall be punishable by fines levied on the registered owner of the
vehicle or vehicles, whether at the time of the violation the vehicle was
in the charge of the registered owner or his agent or lessee, in
accordance with the following schedule, which shall be in addition to
the penalties provided in Subsection A of this section:

registrant for the purpose of receiving such appearance ticket or
summons. Such operator-agent shall transmit such ticket or summons
to the registrant of the vehicle or hauling vehicle, If the registrant does
not appear on the return date, a notice establishing a new return date

Any utility failing to file a return or a corrected return or to pay any tax or
any portion thereof within the time required by this article shall be subject
to a penalty of 5% of the amount of tax due, plus 1% of such tax for each
month of delay or fraction thereof, except the first month, after such return
was required to be filed or such tax became due, but the Village Treasurer,
if satisfied that the delay was excusable, may remit all or any portion of such
penalty.
§ 185-9. Tax as operating cost.
The tax imposed by this article shall be charged against and be paid by the
utility and shall not be added as a separate item to bills rendered by the
utility to customers or others but shall constitute a part of the operating

A. Time of filing. Every utility subject to a tax hereunder shall file a return
on or before July 25 and January 25 for the six calendar months
preceding each return date, including any period for which the tax
imposed hereby or any amendment hereof is effective; however, any
utility whose average gross income or gross operating income for the
aforesaid six-month period is less than $3,000 may file a return annually
on October 1 for the 12 calendar months preceding each return date,
including any period for which the tax imposed hereby or any

1:828
§ 185-10. Insufficient or unsatisfactory returns.
In case any return filed pursuant to this article shall be insufficient or
unsatisfactory to the Village Treasurer, he may require a further or
supplemental return at any time, which shall contain any data that may be
specified by him, and if a corrected or sufficient return is not filed within
20 days after the same is required by notice from him or if no return is
made for any period, the Village Treasurer shall determine the amount due
from such information as he is able to obtain and, if necessary, estimate
the tax on the basis of external indexes or otherwise. He shall give notice
of such determination to the utility liable for such tax. Such determination
shall finally and irrevocably fix such tax unless the utility against which
it is assessed shall, within one year after the giving of notice of such
determination, apply to him for a hearing or unless the Village Treasurer,
of his own motion, shall reduce the same. After such hearing, he shall give
notice of his decision to the utility liable for such tax.
§ 185-11. Review of determination of tax.
Any final determination of the amount of any tax payable hereunder shall
be reviewable for error, illegality or unconstitutionality or any other reason
whatsoever by a proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law
and Rules if the proceeding is commenced within 90 days after the giving
of notice of such final determination; provided, however, that any such
proceeding under said Article 78 shall not be instituted unless the amount
of any tax sought to be reviewed, with such interest and penalties thereon
as may be provided for by local law, ordinance or resolution, shall be first
deposited and an undertaking filed, in such amount and with such sureties
as a Justice of the Supreme Court shall approve, to the effect that if such
proceeding be dismissed or the tax confirmed, the petitioner will pay all
costs and charges which may accrue in the prosecution of such proceeding.
§ 185-12. Service of notice.
Any notice authorized or required under the provisions of this article may
be given by mailing the same to the utility for which it is intended in a
postpaid envelope and addressed to such utility at the address given by
it in the last return filed by it under this article or, if no return has been
filed, then to such address as may be obtainable. The mailing of such notice
shall be presumptive evidence of the receipt of the same by the utility to
which addressed. Any period of time, which is determined according to the
provisions of this section by the giving of notice, shall commence to run
from the date of mailing of such notice.
§ 185-13. Refunds.
If, within one year from the giving of notice of any determination or
assessment of any tax or penalty, the person liable for the tax shall make
application for a refund thereof and the Village Treasurer or the court shall
determine that such tax or penalty or any portion thereof was erroneously
§ 185-10 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 185-13
1:829
or illegally collected, the Village Treasurer shall refund the amount so
determined. For like cause and within the same period, a refund may be
so made on the initiative of the Village Treasurer; however, no refund
shall be made of a tax or penalty paid pursuant to a determination of the
Village Treasurer as hereinbefore provided unless the Village Treasurer,
after a hearing as hereinbefore provided or of his own motion, shall have
reduced the tax or penalty or it shall have been established in a proceeding
in the manner provided in the Civil Practice Law and Rules that such
determination was erroneous or illegal. An application for a refund, made
as hereinbefore provided, shall be deemed an application for the revision
of any tax or penalty complained of, and the Village Treasurer may receive
additional evidence with respect thereto. After making his determination,
the Village Treasurer shall give notice thereof to the person interested, and
he shall be entitled to commence a proceeding to review such determination
in accordance with the provisions of the following section hereof.
§ 185-14. Review of proceedings for refunds.
Where any tax imposed hereunder shall have been erroneously, illegally
or unconstitutionally collected and application for the refund thereof duly
made to the Village Treasurer and he shall have made a determination
denying such refund, such determination shall be reviewable by a
proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules; provided
however, that such proceeding is instituted within 90 days after the giving
of the notice of such denial, that a final determination of tax due was not
previously made and that an undertaking is filed with the Village Treasurer,
in such amount and with such sureties as a Justice of the Supreme Court
shall approve, to the effect that if such proceeding be dismissed or the tax
confirmed, the petitioner will pay all costs and charges which may accrue in
the prosecution of such proceeding.
§ 185-15. Assessment of additional tax restricted.
Except in the case of a willfully false or fraudulent return with the intent to
evade the tax, no assessment or additional tax shall be made with respect
to taxes imposed under this article after the expiration of more than three
years from the date of filing of a return; provided, however, that where no
return has been filed as required hereby, the tax may be assessed at any
time.
§ 185-16. Power of Village Treasurer.
In addition to any other powers herein given the Village Treasurer and in
order to further ensure payment of the tax imposed hereby, he shall have
the power to:
A. Prescribe the form of all reports and returns required to be made
hereunder.
B. Take testimony and proofs, under oath, with reference to any matter
hereby entrusted to him.
§ 185-13 FREEPORT CODE § 185-16
1:830
§ 185-17. Enforcement.
Whenever any person shall fail to pay any tax or penalty imposed by this
article, the Village Attorney shall, upon the request of the Village Treasurer,
bring an action to enforce payment of the same. The proceeds of any
judgment obtained in any such action shall be paid to the Village Treasurer.
Each such tax and penalty shall be a lien upon the property of the person
liable to pay the same in the same manner and to the same extent that the
tax and penalty imposed by § 186-a of the Tax Law is made a lien.
C. Subpoena and require the attendance of witnesses and the production
of books, papers, records and documents.
D. In the absence of the Village Treasurer, authorization shall be granted
to the Deputy Treasurer, if any, the Village Clerk and, in his absence,
the Deputy Village Clerk to sign documents consisting of, but not
limited to, tax sales certificate redemptions and bond anticipation
notes. [Added 10-27-1980 by L.L. No. 12-1980]

C. The annual income referred to in the above table shall be that income
for the income tax year immediately preceding the date of making the
application for exemption.
D. The term "income tax year" shall mean the twelve-month period for
which the owner or owners filed a federal personal income tax return
or, if no such return is filed, the calendar year. Where title is vested in
either the husband or wife, their combined income may not exceed such
§ 185-19 FREEPORT CODE § 185-19
1:834
sum, except that where the husband or wife, or ex-husband or ex-wife,
is absent from the property as provided in the New York State Real
Property Tax Law § 467, Subdivision 3, Paragraph (d), Subparagraph
(ii), then only the income of the spouse or ex-spouse residing on the
property shall be considered and may not exceed such sum. Such
income shall include social security and retirement benefits, interest,
dividends, total gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset which
may be offset by a loss from the sale or exchange of a capital asset
in the same income tax year, net rental income, salary or earnings
and net income from self-employment, but shall not include a return
of capital, gifts, inheritances, payments made to individuals because of
their status as victims of Nazi persecution, as defined in P.L. 103-286, or
monies earned through employment in the Federal Foster Grandparent
Program, and any such income shall be offset by all medical and
prescription drug expenses actually paid which were not reimbursed
or paid for by insurance. The provisions of this subsection
notwithstanding, such income shall not include veteran's disability
compensation, as defined in Title 38 of the United States Code. In
computing net rental income and net income from self-employment, no
depreciation deduction shall be allowed for the exhaustion or wear and
tear of real or personal property held for the production of income.
E. No exemption shall be granted:
(1) Unless the owner shall have held an exemption under this section
for his previous residence or unless the title of the property shall
have been vested in the owner or one of the owners of the property
for at least 12 consecutive months prior to the date of making
application for exemption; provided, however, that in the event of
the death of either a husband or wife in whose name title of the
property shall have been vested at the time of death and then
becomes vested solely in the survivor by virtue of devise by or
descent from the deceased husband or wife, the, time of ownership
of the property by the deceased husband or wife shall be deemed
also a time of ownership by the survivor and such ownership shall
be deemed continuous for the purposes of computing such period
of 12 consecutive months. In the event of a transfer by either a
husband or wife to the other spouse of all or part of the title to the
property, the time of ownership of the property by the transferor
spouse shall be deemed also a time of ownership by the transferee
spouse and such ownership shall be deemed continuous for the
purposes of computing such period of 12 consecutive months.
Where property of the owner or owners has been acquired to
replace property formerly owned by such owner or owners and
taken by eminent domain or other involuntary proceedings, except
a tax sale, the period of ownership of the former property shall be
combined with the period of ownership of the property for which
application is made for exemption and such periods of ownership
shall be deemed consecutive, for purposes of this section. Where a
residence is sold and replaced with another within one year and
§ 185-19 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 185-19
1:835
both residences are within the state, the period of ownership of
both properties shall be deemed consecutive for purposes of the
exemption from taxation by a municipality within the state granting
such exemption. Where the owner or owners transfer title to
property which, as of the date of transfer, was exempt from taxation
under the provisions of this section, the reacquisition of title by
such owner or owners within nine months of the date of transfer
shall be deemed to satisfy the requirement of this subsection that
the title of the property shall have been vested in the owner or one
of the owners for such period of 12 consecutive months. Where,
upon or subsequent to the death of an owner or owners, title to
property which, as of the date of such death, was exempt from
taxation under such provisions, becomes vested, by virtue of devise
or descent from the deceased owner or owners or by transfer by
any other means within nine months after such death, solely in a
person or persons who, at the time of such death, maintained such
property as a primary residence, the requirement of this subsection
that the title of the property shall have been vested in the owner or
one of the owners for such period of 12 consecutive months shall
be deemed satisfied.
(2) Unless the property is used exclusively for residential purposes;
provided, however, that in the event any portion of such property is
not so used exclusively for residential purposes but is used for
other purposes, such portion shall be subject to taxation and the
remaining portion only shall be entitled to the exemption provided
by this section.
(3) Unless the real property is the legal residence of and is occupied in
whole or in part by the owner or by all of the owners of the
property, except where an owner is absent from the residence while
receiving health-related care as an inpatient of a residential healthcare
facility, as defined in § 2801 of the Public Health Law, provided
that any income accruing to that person shall only be income only
to the extent that it exceeds the amount paid by such owner, spouse
or co-owner for care in the facility, and provided, further, that
during such confinement such property is not occupied by other
than the spouse or co-owner of such owner; or the real property is
owned by a husband and/or wife, or an ex-husband and/or an exwife,
and either is absent from the residence due to divorce, legal
separation or abandonment and all other provisions of this section
are met, provided that where an exemption was previously granted
when both resided on the property, then the person remaining on
the real property shall be 62 years of age or over.
(4) For the purposes of this section, title to that portion of real property
owned by a cooperative apartment corporation in which a tenantstockholder
of such corporation resides and which is represented
by his share or shares of stock in such corporation as determined
by its or their proportional relationship to the total outstanding

application for such exemption shall be punishable by a fine of not more
than $100 and shall disqualify the applicant or applicants from further
exemption for a period of five years.
stock of the corporation, including that owned by the corporation,
shall be deemed to be vested in such tenant-stockholder.
(5) That proportion of the assessment of such real property owned by a
cooperative apartment corporation determined by the relationship
of such real property vested in such tenant-stockholder to such
entire parcel and the buildings thereon owned by such cooperative
apartment corporation in which such tenant-stockholder resides
shall be subject to exemption from taxation pursuant to this
section, and any exemption so granted shall be credited by the
appropriate taxing authority against the assessed valuation of such
real property; the reduction in real property taxes realized thereby
shall be credited by the cooperative apartment corporation against
the amount of such taxes otherwise payable by or chargeable to
such tenant-stockholder.
F. The property must be used exclusively for residential purposes in order
to qualify for the exemption and must be occupied in whole or in part by
the owners or owner and is the legal residence of said owners or owner.
A. Application for such exemption must be made by the owner or all of the
owners of the property on forms to be furnished by the Assessor of the
Incorporated Village of Freeport and shall furnish the information and
be executed in the manner required or prescribed in such forms and
shall be filed in such Assessor's office at least 90 days before the day for
filing the final assessment roll.
B. At least 60 days prior to the first day of October, which is the taxable
status date of the Incorporated Village of Freeport, the assessing
authority shall mail to each person who was granted exemption
pursuant to this section on the latest completed assessment roll an
application form and a notice that such application must be filed on or
before taxable status date and be approved in order for the exemption
to be granted. Failure to mail any such application form and notice or
the failure of such person to receive the same shall not prevent the levy,
collection and enforcement of the payment of the taxes on property
owned by such person. [Added 2-22-1971 by L.L. No. 2-1971]

more major life activities, such as caring for one's self, performing
manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing,
learning and working, and who: a) is certified to receive social

from the property due to divorce, legal separation or abandonment,
then only the income of the spouse or ex-spouse residing on the
property shall be considered and may not exceed such sum. Such
income shall include social security and retirement benefits, interest,
dividends, total gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset which
may be offset by a loss from the sale or exchange of a capital asset in
the same income tax year, net rental income, salary or earnings, and net

and net income from self-employment, no depreciation deduction shall
be allowed for the exhaustion, wear and tear of real or personal
property held for the production of income.
G. No exemption shall be granted:
(1) Unless the property is used exclusively for residential purposes;
provided, however, that in the event any portion of such property is
not so used exclusively for residential purposes but is used for
other purposes, such portion shall be subject to taxation and the
remaining portion only shall be entitled to the exemption provided
by this section;
(2) Unless the real property is the legal residence of and is occupied in
whole or in part by the disabled person, except where the disabled
person is absent from the residence while receiving health-related
care as an inpatient of a residential health care facility, as defined
in § 2801 of the Public Health Law, provided that any income
accruing to that person shall be considered income for purposes of
this section only to the extent that it exceeds the amount paid by
such person or spouse or sibling of such person for care in the
facility.
H. For the purposes of this section, title to that portion of real property
owned by a cooperative apartment corporation in which a tenantstockholder
of such corporation resides and which is represented by his
shares of stock in such corporation as determined by its or their

§ 185-47. Application for exemption.
proportional relationship to the total of outstanding stock of the
corporation, including that owned by the corporation, shall be deemed
to be vested in such tenant-stockholder.
I. That proportion of the assessment of such real property owned by a
cooperative apartment corporation determined by the relationship of
such real property vested in such tenant-stockholder to such entire
parcel and the buildings thereon owner by such cooperative apartment
corporation in which such tenant-stockholder resides shall be subject to
exemption from taxation pursuant to this section, and any exemption so
granted shall be credited by the appropriate taxing authority against
the assessed valuation of such real property; the reduction in real
property taxes realized thereby shall be credited by the cooperative
apartment corporation against the amount of such taxes otherwise
payable by or chargeable to such tenant-stockholder.
A. Application for such exemption must be made annually by the owner, or
all of the owners of the property, on forms prescribed by the State
Board, and shall be filed in the office of the Village Assessor on or
before the Village's taxable status date and be approved in order for the
exemption to be granted. Failure to mail such application form or the
failure of such person to receive the same shall not prevent the levy,
collection and enforcement of the payment of the taxes on property
owned by such person.
B. At least 60 days prior to the first day of October, which is the taxable
status date of the Incorporated Village of Freeport, the assessing
authority shall mail to each person who was granted exemption
pursuant to this section on the latest completed assessment roll an
application form and a notice that such application must be filed on or
before the taxable status date and be approved in order for the
exemption to be granted. Failure to mail any such application form and
notice or the failure of such person to receive the same shall not
prevent the levy, collection and enforcement of the payment of the taxes
on property owned by such person.

SEX OFFENDERS
GENERAL REFERENCES
Adult uses  See Ch. 210, Art. XXVI.
§ 196-1. Findings and intent.
§ 196-2. Definitions.
For the purposes of this chapter, the following terms shall have the
meanings intended:
CHILD DAY-CARE CENTER  A building or property that provides care for
six or more children during the day or evening hours by someone other than
the parent, stepparent, guardian or relative of the child, whether or not
A. The Board of Trustees of the Incorporated Village of Freeport
recognizes that the Sex Offender Registration Act, New York's version
of Megan's Law (Correction Law Article 6-C) and County Law have
increased public awareness of sex offenders by requiring them to
become registered with authorities and making such information
available to the public.
B. The Board of Trustees finds that registered sex offenders pose a
significant threat to the health and safety of the community and
especially to children, whose age and inexperience make them
particularly vulnerable to the heinous and reprehensible acts of these
offenders. The Board of Trustees also finds that the rate of recidivism is
high and programs designed to treat and rehabilitate these types of
offenders have been largely ineffective. The Board of Trustees further
finds that restricting registered sex offenders from residing in close
proximity to places where children are likely to congregate is likely to
reduce the opportunity and temptation for, and can minimize the risk of
repeated acts against minors.
C. It is the intention of the Board of Trustees to exercise its authority
pursuant to Article IX of the New York State Constitution and § 10 of the
Municipal Home Rule Law, to protect and safeguard the lives and wellbeing
of the community, especially minors, from registered sex
offenders, by prohibiting registered sex offenders from residing in close
proximity to places where children could naturally congregate, such as
schools, child day-care centers, community centers, public libraries,
parks, playgrounds, and other recreational facilities.
D. This chapter is intended to create a civil regulatory scheme in order to
protect minors to the extent possible under the circumstances and is
not intended as a punitive measure against registered sex offenders.
§ 191-32 FREEPORT CODE § 196-2

trails, bleachers, waterfront areas, beaches, pools, ice rinks, tennis courts,
and any other centers designed for recreational uses.

general public.
REGISTERED SEX OFFENDER  A sex offender who is required to register
with the New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services or other
agency having jurisdiction pursuant to the provisions of Article 6-C of the
Correction Law of the State of New York or other applicable or successor
law, whether or not the sex offender has actually registered in compliance
with the law, or of an order of a court of competent jurisdiction.
RESIDENCE  The place where a person sleeps, which may include more
than one location, and may be mobile or transitory.
SCHOOL  A building or property, whose principal purpose and use is as a
place of education, including, but not limited to, public or private preschool,
elementary and secondary schools, vocational schools and other nondegree
granting schools, including self-defense, dance, swimming, gymnastics, and
similar instruction programs.
§ 196-3. Restrictions established.
It shall be unlawful for any registered sex offender to establish a residence
or domicile within a one-thousand-foot radius of any property line of a
school, child day-care center, community center, public library, and
municipal recreational facility.
§ 196-4. Relocation.
Any registered sex offender who establishes a residence or domicile in
violation of the residency restriction set forth in § 196-3 of this chapter shall
have 30 days from receipt of a written notice from the Village to relocate to
a location which does not violate the restriction set forth in § 196-3 of this
chapter.
§ 196-2 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 196-5
1:887
§ 196-5. Applicability.
This chapter shall not apply to a registered sex offender if that person
is required to be domiciled at a location fixed by an order of a court of
competent jurisdiction.
§ 196-6. Exemption.
The residency restriction of § 196-3 shall not apply to a registered sex
offender who has established a residence or domicile prior to the effective
date of this chapter; or to a registered sex offender under the age of 18
years of age residing with his or her parent(s) or legal guardian.
§ 196-7. Administration.
Unless otherwise provided, the provisions of this chapter shall be
administered and enforced by the Superintendent of Buildings for the
Incorporated Village of Freeport and by the Freeport Police Department.
§ 196-8. Enforcement.
§ 196-9. Village not liable.
Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to impose any duty or obligation
upon the Village of Freeport which might serve as a basis for civil or
criminal liability against the Village or any official or employee of the Village
for failing to act in accordance with this chapter.
§ 196-10. Severability.
If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, or phrase of this chapter is for
any reason held to be invalid or unconstitutional by the decision of any court
of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect the validity of the
remaining portions of this chapter.
A. Any person violating the provisions of §§ 196-3 and 196-4 of this chapter
shall, upon conviction, be subject to a fine up to $2,500 and/or 15 days
in the Nassau County Correctional Center or both such fine and/or
imprisonment. Each and every day a violation of §§ 196-3 and 196-4
exists shall be separate violation.
B. In addition to the fines set forth in Subsection A hereof the Village may
request an order of injunction of the Nassau County Supreme Court
compelling compliance by such sex offender with the provisions of this
chapter.

General Regulations
§ 201-1. Definitions. [Amended 2-11-1974]
Unless otherwise expressly stated, whenever used in this article, the
following words shall mean:
AIR GAP  The unobstructed vertical distance through the free atmosphere
between the lowest opening from any pipe or faucet supplying water to
a pool, tank, plumbing fixture or other device and the flood-level rim of
the receptacle. The vertical distance shall be not less than two times the
diameter of the supply pipe and never less than one inch.
ATMOSPHERIC VACUUM BREAKER  A combination check valve in the
supply line and valve member opening to atmosphere when the pressure in
the water line drops to atmospheric. It must be installed on the discharge
side of the last control valve and above the usage point. It cannot be used
under continuous pressure for periods exceeding 12 hours.
AUXILIARY SUPPLY  Any water source, other than the Village supply,
which may be available in the building or on the premises.
BACKFLOW  The flow of water or other liquids, mixtures or substances
from any source into pipes supplying potable water.
BACKFLOW PREVENTER  A device or means to prevent a backflow or
backsiphonage.
BACK PRESSURE  A condition whereby pressure higher than the water
supply pressure is created on the premises by pumps, thermal expansion

BACKSIPHONAGE  The flowing back of used, contaminated or polluted
water from a plumbing fixture, vessel, swimming pool or other source into a
pipe supplying potable water and caused by a vacuum or partial vacuum in
the potable water piping. It may be caused by:

feet, at its topmost point, above the highest fixture it supplies.
Ordinary gravity. When the water supply is lost and a fixture that is
elevated is opened allowing air into the system, water will, by gravity,
reverse the flow.
A.
Undersized piping. High velocity water traveling through undersized
piping can cause an aspirator effect and draw water out of branch pipes
causing a partial vacuum and a reverse flow.
B.
Vacuum. Caused by pumping water from the supply system, causing a
pressure drop or negative pressure in the supply or on the premises. A
break in the water main or excessive usage at a lower level in the water
system or on the premises can also be a cause.

overflows.
HOSE CONNECTION VACUUM BREAKER  A combination check valve
and atmospheric vacuum breaker used on sill cocks, hose bibs, water
outlets to boat docks or threaded faucets where a portable hose may be
attached.
NONPOTABLE WATER  Water which is not safe for human consumption
or which is of questionable potability.
OWNER  Includes his duly authorized agent or attorney, a purchaser,
devisee, fiduciary and any person having a vested or contingent interest in
the property in question.
POLLUTION or CONTAMINATION  The introduction of any foreign
substance, organic, inorganic, radiological or biological, in the Village
potable water which tends to degrade its quality so as to constitute a
nuisance, a hazard or make the water unsafe for human consumption.
Hazardous pollutants or contaminants include sewage, lethal chemicals or
other substances which, if introduced into the public water supply system,
would or may endanger the health of the consumer. Nonhazardous
substance would not endanger the health of the consumer but would create
a nuisance if introduced into the public water supply system.
POTABLE WATER  Any water which, according to federal and state
established standards, is safe for human consumption.
PREMISES  Any building, structure, enclosure or locality to which water
is supplied or to be supplied, whether attached to realty or not and further

§ 209-7. Review criteria.
A. General criteria. Planning Board review of the site plan shall include,
but not be limited to, the following criteria:
(1) Development shall be compatible with natural features of the site
and with surrounding land uses.
(2) Various on-site structures and uses within the development shall be
harmonious and in scale to one another and with the neighborhood.
No open design foundation system will be permitted for residential
structures within an AE flood zone. Open design foundation
systems shall only be permitted in FEMA designated V (Velocity)
zones. [Amended 5-6-2015 by L.L. No. 2-2015]
(3) Development shall be arranged to minimize visual or noise impacts
with adjoining uses and adjoining lands. In mitigating impacts,
consideration shall be given to the use, adequacy, type and
arrangement of trees, shrubs and other landscaping materials.
(4) Development shall minimize the destruction, damage or
detrimental modification of, or interference with, natural, scenic,
topographic or physical features of the site.
(5) Development shall promote and facilitate open space, recreation
and public access to the water, where appropriate and feasible, and
shall avoid obstruction of existing public or semi-public access to
the waterfront.
(6) Development shall provide for sufficient and adequate off-street
parking and loading space.
(7) Development shall provide adequate and efficient arrangement of
vehicular traffic access and circulation within the site and take
steps to mitigate the proposal's effect on traffic patterns and
congestion in the vicinity of the proposed development.
(8) Development shall provide unimpeded access for emergency
service vehicles and convenient availability of fire protection
devices.
(9) Development shall provide for adequate pedestrian and
nonmotorized vehicular access, circulation and safety.
(10) Development shall give consideration to the relationship,
compatibility, location, arrangements, size, design and aesthetics of
buildings, lighting and signs with respect to on-site and off-site uses
and facilities.
(11) Development shall ensure that there will be no measurable
increase in runoff from the site during or after construction.
§ 209-7 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 209-7
1:927
(12) Development shall ensure an adequate supply of potable water and
sanitary waste disposal systems.
(13) Development shall minimize flooding and erosion hazards through
nonstructural means, long-term structural measures and
appropriate siting of structures.
(14) Development shall protect surface waters and groundwaters from
direct and indirect pollution and from overuse.
(15) Development shall ensure the adequacy of landscaping and
setbacks in regard to achieving maximum compatibility with, and
protection of, local and area scenic quality, adjacent fish and
wildlife habitats, freshwater wetlands, tidal wetlands and coastal
waters.
(16) The height and bulk of buildings and structures shall be compatible
with the site and in harmony with adjacent buildings, structures
and uses so that new construction does not harm the visual quality
or character of the area.
(17) For parcels abutting the water, and at the boundary between
districts zoned for residential, apartment house, condominium or
cooperative uses and all other districts, the height of the building
or structure at any given point, where feasible, shall not exceed a
distance greater than the setback of the structure from the lot line,
except in the case of one-family dwellings, and except to the extent
that a facility located adjacent to the water is essential to the
functioning of a water-dependent use, as said term is defined in
§ 911 of the Executive Law of the State of New York.
(18) Building orientation and site design shall, to the maximum extent
practicable, ensure that the proposed development conserves
energy use.
(19) Development shall protect and avoid disturbance of sites
recognized as being of local historical, architectural or
archaeological importance on or adjacent to the site.
B. Reservation of parkland on site plans containing residential units.
(1) Before the Planning Board, may approve a site plan containing
residential units, such site plan shall also show, when required by
such board, a park or parks suitably located for playground or
other recreational purposes.
(2) Land for park, playground or other recreational purposes may not
be required until the Planning Board has made a finding that a
proper case exists for requiring that a park or parks be suitably
located for playgrounds or other recreational purposes within the
Village. Such finding shall include an evaluation of the present and
anticipated future needs for park and recreational facilities in the
§ 209-7 FREEPORT CODE § 209-7
1:928
§ 209-8. Public hearing.
Upon the Planning Board's determination that the site plan application is
complete and satisfactory for review, a public hearing shall be scheduled
to be held within 62 days from the time of such determination, except
as provided for herein. For the purpose of this section, the date of
determination of a complete application shall be taken as the date of the
first regular Planning Board meeting following completion of the site plan
application. The Clerk of the Planning Board shall mail notice of said
hearing to the applicant at least 10 days before such hearing, and shall
cause said hearing to be advertised at least five days prior to the scheduled
date in a newspaper of general circulation in the Village and shall mail to all
Village based on projected population growth to which the
particular site plan will contribute.
(3) In the event that the Planning Board makes a finding pursuant to
§ 209-7B(2) that the proposed site plan presents a proper case for
requiring a park or parks suitably located for playgrounds or other
recreational purposes but that a suitable park or parks of adequate
size to meet the requirement cannot be properly located on such
site plan, the Planning Board may require a sum of money in lieu
thereof to be established by resolution of the Board of Trustees. In
making such determination of suitability, the Planning Board shall
assess the size and suitability of lands shown on the site plan which
could be possible locations for parks or recreational facilities, as
well as practical factors, including whether there is a need for
additional facilities in the immediate neighborhood. Any money
required by the Planning Board in lieu of land for park playground
or other recreational purposes, pursuant to the provisions of this
section, shall be deposited into a trust fund to be used by the
Village exclusively for park, playground or other recreational
purposes, including but not limited to the acquisition of a fee, or
less than fee, interest in property or the enhancement or
revitalization of existing park facilities.
(4) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of § 209-7B, if the land
included in a site plan under review is a portion of a subdivision
plat which has been reviewed and approved, the Planning Board
shall credit the applicant for any land set aside, or money donated
in lieu thereof, under such subdivision plat approval. In the event of
resubdivision of such plat, nothing shall preclude the additional
reservation of parkland or money donated in lieu thereof.
C. Consultation with other agencies and departments. In its review of a
site plan, the Planning Board shall consult with the Superintendent of
Buildings or his representative and may consult with other local and
county officials and its designated private consultants, in addition to
representatives of federal and state agencies, including but not limited
to the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, New
York State Department of State and the Army Corps of Engineers.

Board of Appeals
§ 210-10. Establishment; membership and organization. [Amended
1-21-1974]
There shall be a Board of Appeals as authorized by the Village Law,
consisting of five members appointed by the Board of Trustees, one of
whom shall be appointed Chairman by the Board of Trustees for a period
of three years. The first appointments of members shall be effective April
1, 1975. The first appointments under this section shall be for terms so
fixed that at least one appointment will expire at the end of each official
year commencing at the end of the current such year and continuing in
succeeding years until the entire original appointments made pursuant to
this section run out. At the expiration of each original appointment, the
succeeding members shall be appointed for five-year terms. Vacancies shall
be filled for the unexpired term of the member whose place has become
vacant. A Deputy Chairman shall be appointed by the Board of Trustees,
said Deputy Chairman to preside in the absence of the Chairman.
§ 210-10.1. Alternate members. [Added 11-19-2001 by L.L. No.

A. The Board of Trustees of the Incorporated Village of Freeport finds it
necessary to supersede § 7-712 of the Village Law, which permits the
appointment of alternate members to the Board of Appeals in cases
where a member has a conflict of interest. This Board finds it necessary
to provide for the appointment of alternate members to such Board, not
only in cases of a conflict of interest, but in situations where a member
is absent. We find it to be in the best interest of the Incorporated Village
of Freeport and its residents to have the full benefit of a five-member
Board of Appeals in all cases where practical.
B. The Mayor, subject to the approval of the Board of Trustees, may
appoint two alternate members to the Board of Appeals for purposes of
substituting for a member in the event such member is unable to
participate because of a conflict of interest or in the event of an absence
of a member.
C. The term of the first two appointed members shall be until the next
organization meeting of the Board of Trustees. Subsequently they shall
be appointed for annual terms expiring with the annual organization
meeting of the Board of Trustees.
D. The Chairperson of the Board of Appeals may designate a duly
authorized alternate member to substitute for a member when such
member is unable to participate due to a conflict of interest or absence
of a member on any matters before the Board. When so designated, the
alternate member shall possess all the powers and responsibilities of
such member of the Board. Such designation shall be entered into the
§ 210-10 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 210-10.1

As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
ADULT BOOKSTORE  A commercial establishment which, as its principal
business purpose, offers for sale or rental for any form of consideration
books, magazines, other periodicals, films, slides, videotapes, games,
novelties or other material which is distinguished or characterized by an
emphasis on depicting or describing sexual conduct or specified anatomical
areas and which establishment is customarily not open to the public
generally but excludes any minor by reason of age.
ADULT ENTERTAINMENT CABARET  A public or private establishment
which presents topless dancers, strippers, male or female impersonators

A. In the execution of this article, it is recognized that there are some uses
which, due to their very nature, have serious objectionable
characteristics. The objectionable characteristics of these uses are
further heightened by their concentration in any one area, thereby
having deleterious effects on adjacent areas. Special regulation of these
uses is necessary to ensure that these adverse effects will not
contribute to the blighting or downgrading of the surrounding
neighborhoods or land uses within the Incorporated Village of Freeport.

where our youth may regularly assemble and the general atmosphere
encompassing their operation is of great concern to the Mayor, Board of
Trustees and residents of the Incorporated Village of Freeport.

primary purposes of preventing a concentration of these uses in any
one area and restricting their accessibility to minors.

or service related thereto exposes specified anatomical areas. This
definition shall not be construed to include a hospital, nursing home or

ARTICLE XXIX
Stormwater Runoff
[Added 12-17-2007 by L.L. No. 6-2007]
§ 210-297. Findings of fact.
It is hereby determined that:
§ 210-298. Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to establish minimum stormwater management
requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general health,
safety, and welfare of the public residing within this jurisdiction and to
A. Land development activities and associated increases in site impervious
cover often alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and
increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding, stream
channel erosion, or sediment transport and deposition;
B. This stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of
waterborne pollutants, including siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and
other desirable species;
C. Clearing and grading during construction tends to increase soil erosion
and add to the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and
aquatic habitat;
D. Improper design and construction of stormwater management
practices can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff, thereby
increasing streambank erosion and sedimentation;
E. Impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil, thereby
decreasing groundwater recharge and stream baseflow;
F. Substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts on
the waters of the municipality;
G. Stormwater runoff, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be
controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff
from land development activities;
H. The regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development
activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater
runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion, stream channel erosion, and
nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the
public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety.
I. Regulation of land development activities by means of performance
standards governing stormwater management and site design will
produce development compatible with the natural functions of a
particular site or an entire watershed and thereby mitigate the adverse
effects of erosion and sedimentation from development.
§ 210-297 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 210-298
1:1077
address the findings of fact in § 210-297 hereof. This article seeks to meet
those purposes by achieving the following objectives:
§ 210-299. Statutory authority.
In accordance with § 10 of the Municipal Home Rule Law of the State of
New York, the Village of Freeport has the authority to enact local laws
and amend local laws and for the purpose of promoting the health, safety
or general welfare of the Village of Freeport and for the protection and
enhancement of its physical environment. The Board of Trustees may
include in any such local law provisions for the appointment of any
municipal officer, employees, or independent contractor to effectuate,
administer and enforce such local law.
§ 210-300. Applicability.
A. Require land development activities to conform to the substantive
requirements of the NYS Department of Environmental Conservation
State Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (SPDES) General Permit
for Construction Activities GP-02-01, or as amended or revised;
B. Minimize increases in stormwater runoff from land development
activities in order to reduce flooding, siltation, increases in stream
temperature, and streambank erosion and maintain the integrity of
stream channels;
C. Minimize increases in pollution caused by stormwater runoff from land
development activities which would otherwise degrade local water
quality;
D. Minimize the total annual volume of stormwater runoff which flows
from any specific site during and following development to the
maximum extent practicable; and
E. Reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion and nonpoint
source pollution, wherever possible, through stormwater management
practices and to ensure that these management practices are properly
maintained and eliminate threats to public safety.
A. This article shall be applicable to all land development activities as
defined in this within this section and in § 210-3 and shall apply to all
Zoning Districts within the Village of Freeport.
B. The Superintendent of Buildings, his duly authorized representative, or
the Superintendent of Public Works, or his duly authorized
representative, are hereby appointed the Stormwater Management
Officer, and to that end shall accept and review all stormwater pollution
prevention plans and forward such plans to any municipal board,

§ 212-6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 212-6
1:1099
§ 212-7. Activities contaminating stormwater prohibited.
§ 212-8. Prevention, control and reduction of stormwater pollutants
by use of best management practices.
§ 212-9. Illicit discharges in emergency situations.
(3) A person is considered to be in violation of this article if the person
connects a line conveying sewage to the municipality's MS4 or
allows such a connection to continue.
A. Activities that are subject to the requirements of this section are those
types of activities that:
(1) Cause or contribute to a violation of the municipality's MS4 SPDES
permit.
(2) Cause or contribute to the municipality being subject to the special
conditions as defined in § 212-2 Definitions, of this article.
B. Upon notification to a person that he or she is engaged in activities that
cause or contribute to violations of the municipality's MS4 SPDES
permit authorization, that person shall take all reasonable actions to
correct such activities such that he or she no longer causes or
contributes to violations of the municipality's MS4 SPDES permit
authorization.
A. Best management practices. Where the SMO has identified illicit
discharges as defined in § 212-2 or activities contaminating stormwater
under this article, the municipality may require implementation of best
management practices (BMPs) to control those illicit discharges and
activities.
(1) The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment
shall provide, at his or her own expense, reasonable protection
from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes
into the MS4 through the use of structural and nonstructural
BMPs.

be, the source of an illicit discharge as defined in § 212-2 or an
activity contaminating stormwater as defined in § 212-8, may be
required to implement, at said person's expense, additional
structural and nonstructural BMPs to reduce or eliminate the
source of pollutant(s) to the MS4.
(3) Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid SPDES permit
authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial
activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with
the provisions of this section.

§ 212-10. Industrial or construction activity discharges.
Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity SPDES
stormwater discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such
permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form
acceptable to the municipality prior to the allowing of discharges to the
MS4.
§ 212-11. Applicability; access to facilities; monitoring of
discharges.
A. The SMO may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a
person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or
threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and
substantial danger to the environment, to the health or welfare of
persons, or to the MS4. The SMO shall notify the person of such
suspension within a reasonable time thereafter in writing of the reasons
for the suspension. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension
order issued in an emergency, the SMO may take such steps as deemed
necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or to minimize
danger to persons.
B. Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person
discharging to the municipality's MS4 in violation of this article may
have his or her MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate
or reduce an illicit discharge. The SMO will notify a violator in writing
of the proposed termination of its MS4 access and the reasons therefor.
The violator may petition the SMO for a reconsideration and hearing.
Access may be granted by the SMO if he/she finds that the illicit
discharge has ceased and the discharger has taken steps to prevent its
recurrence. Access may be denied if the SMO determines in writing
that the illicit discharge has not ceased or is likely to recur. A person
commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises
terminated pursuant to this section without the prior approval of the
SMO.
A. Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that the SMO must
inspect to enforce any provision of this article, or whenever the
authorized enforcement agency has cause to believe that there exists,
or potentially exists, in or upon any premises any condition which
constitutes a violation of this article.
B. Access to facilities:
(1) The SMO shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject
to regulation under this article as often as may be necessary to
determine compliance with this article. If a discharger has security
measures in force which require proper identification and
clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make
the necessary arrangements to allow access to the SMO.
§ 212-9 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 212-11
1:1101
§ 212-12. Notification of spills.
Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person
responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency
response for a facility or operation has information of any known or
suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal
discharges or pollutants discharging into the MS4, said person shall take all
necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such
release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials, said person
shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence
via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of nonhazardous
materials, said person shall notify the municipality in person or by
telephone or facsimile no later than the next business day. Notifications
in person or by telephone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed
and mailed to the municipality within three business days of the telephone
notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial
or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment
shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions
(2) Facility operators shall allow the SMO ready access to all parts of
the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination
and copying of records as may be required to implement this

this article such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the SMO to
conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's stormwater
discharge.

§ 212-13. Enforcement; penalties for offenses.
A. Notice of violation.
(1) When the municipality's SMO finds that a person has violated a
prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this article, he/she
may order compliance by written notice of violation to the
responsible person. Such notice may require, without limitation:
(a) The elimination of illicit connections or discharges;

(c) The abatement or remediation of stormwater pollution or
contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected
property;
(d) The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting;
(e) Payment of a fine; and
(f) The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs.
(2) If abatement of a violation and/or restoration of affected property is
required, the notice shall set forth a deadline within which such
remediation or restoration must be completed. Said notice shall
further advise that, should the violator fail to remediate or restore
within the established deadline, the work will be done by a
designated governmental agency or a contractor and the expense
thereof shall be charged to the violator.
B. Penalties. In addition to or as an alternative to any penalty provided
herein or by law, any person who violates the provisions of this article
shall be guilty of a violation punishable by a fine not exceeding $350 or
imprisonment for a period not to exceed six months, or both for
conviction of a first offense; for conviction of a second offense, both of
which were committed within a period of five years, punishable by a
fine not less than $350 nor more than $700 or imprisonment for a
period not to exceed six months, or both; and upon conviction for a third
or subsequent offense, all of which were committed within a period of
five years, punishable by a fine not less than $700 nor more than $1,000
or imprisonment for a period not to exceed six months, or both.
However, for the purposes of conferring jurisdiction upon courts and
judicial officers generally, violations of this article shall be deemed

to misdemeanors shall apply to such violations. Each week's continued
violation shall constitute a separate additional violation.
§ 212-12 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 212-14
1:1103
§ 212-14. Appeal of notice of violation.
Any person receiving a notice of violation may appeal the determination of
the SMO to the Village Board of Trustees within 15 days of its issuance,
which shall hear the appeal within 30 days after the filing of the appeal,
and within five days of making its decision, file its decision in the office of
the municipal clerk and mail a copy of its decision by certified mail to the
discharger.
§ 212-15. Corrective measures after appeal.
§ 212-16. Injunctive relief.
It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any provision or fail to comply
with any of the requirements of this article. If a person has violated or
continues to violate the provisions of this article, the SMO may petition for
a preliminary or permanent injunction restraining the person from activities
which would create further violations or compelling the person to perform
abatement or remediation of the violation.
§ 212-17. Alternative remedies.
A. If the violation has not been corrected pursuant to the requirements set
forth in the notice of violation, or, in the event of an appeal, within five
business days of the decision of the municipal authority upholding the
decision of the SMO, then the SMO shall request the owner's
permission for access to the subject private property to take any and all
measures reasonably necessary to abate the violation and/or restore
the property.
B. If refused access to the subject private property, the SMO may seek a
warrant in a court of competent jurisdiction to be authorized to enter
upon the property to determine whether a violation has occurred. Upon
determination that a violation has occurred, the SMO may seek a court
order to take any and all measures reasonably necessary to abate the
violation and/or restore the property. The cost of implementing and
maintaining such measures shall be the sole responsibility of the
discharger.
A. Where a person has violated a provision of this article, he/she may be
eligible for alternative remedies in lieu of a civil penalty, upon
recommendation of the Village Attorney and concurrence of the
Authorized Municipal Code Enforcement Officer, where:
(1) The violation was unintentional.
(2) The violator has no history of previous violations of this article.
(3) Environmental damage was minimal.
(4) The violator acted quickly to remedy violation.
§ 212-14 FREEPORT CODE § 212-17
1:1104
§ 212-18. Violations deemed a public nuisance.
In addition to the enforcement processes and penalties provided, any
condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions of
this article is a threat to public health, safety, and welfare, and is declared
and deemed a nuisance, and may be summarily abated or restored at
the violator's expense, and/or a civil action to abate, enjoin, or otherwise
compel the cessation of such nuisance may be taken.
§ 212-19. Remedies not exclusive.
The remedies listed in this article are not exclusive of any other remedies
available under any applicable federal, state or local law and it is within
the discretion of the authorized enforcement agency to seek cumulative
remedies.
(5) The violator cooperated in investigation and resolution.
