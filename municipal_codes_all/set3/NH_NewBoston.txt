14.1 	In accordance with the Goals and Objectives in the Master Plan, common driveways are encouraged where feasible to minimize curb cuts onto Town roads and provide maximum safety and protection to both the traveling public and the property owners.  Common driveways shall be approved only after it has been proven to the Planning Board that each lot could, if needed, support its own driveway in accordance with these regulations and the Town of New Boston Zoning Ordinance. 
14.2 	Common driveways will be permitted in the Town of New Boston in accordance with the following specifications.  The common driveway is defined as that portion of the driveway that provides access to two or more individual parcels.  The common driveway becomes a private driveway at the point at which it provides access to one parcel. 
14.3 	The acceptable common driveway configuration is such that the driveway enters at the common lot line and splits to the separate lots within one hundred feet (100') of the right­of-way line. 
14.4 	Wherever common driveways result in access by one or more landowners over the land of another, the Planning Board will require Deeds of Easement to be submitted for review by Town Counsel.  Said review shall be at the applicant's expense.  Said documents shall provide, at a minimum, for maintenance of the driveway in a fashion sufficient to ensure that the same is reasonably accessible by emergency vehicles and that said responsibility shall be a condition of lot ownership that shall run with the land.  Additionally, such documents shall provide that the common driveway shall not become a town road. 
14.5 	Common driveways shall have the shared portion of the driveway built to NFPA 1141, Fire Protection Infrastructure for Land Development in Surburban and Rural Areas, 2008 Edition, and as amended. 
14.6 	A common driveway constructed to NFPA standards as listed in Section 14.5 must be complete up to a point fifteen feet beyond the common access point, between the home and the Town road, including drainage, crushed gravel and grading, and all identification markers must be installed prior to the issuance of a building permit.

15.1 	Driveways shall be limited to one per lot, except as provided for under Section 15.2 below. 
15.2 	The Road Agent may grant a second driveway if there is 200' or more between the original driveway and the proposed secondary driveway, and if the physical constraints of the lot, including natural features, unusual lot shape or size, or elevation change makes the use of the original driveway as access impractical for the proposed current use. 
15 
TOWN OF NEW BOSTON DRIVEWAY REGULATIONS 
Section 16 TEMPORARY DRIVEWAY ENTRANCES (CURB CUTS) 
16.1 	An application for a temporary driveway entrance (curb cut) shall be submitted and processed in accordance with Section 7 of these regulations.  However, the application fee for said permit shall be $25.00.

The Road Agent shall approve the amount of the security.  This security shall be in a form acceptable to the Planning Board and shall be submitted to the Office of the Planning Board/Planning Department.  The security shall be held until the items listed in Section 
16.5 below have been completed. 
16.3 	No more than one temporary driveway entrance (curb cut) shall be permitted per lot at any one time. 
16.4 	Temporary driveway permits are valid for a period of one (1) year.  The Road Agent may extend that permit for an additional year. 
16.5 	Temporary driveway entrances (curb cuts) shall be restored to a natural state whereby all obstructions in the right-of-way are to be removed and the area restored to its original ditchline slope and loamed and seeded, so as to prevent erosion. 
16.6 	Stabilized construction entrances shall be required for heavy trucking/logging operations at the discretion of the Road Agent. 
Section 17 PAVING ONLY PERMIT  (EXISTING LOTS)

17.2 	The driveway shall be properly prepared so that when the pavement is applied, the required 3% negative grade as defined in Section 9.6 above, or such other requirement from the approved driveway permit on file, is maintained and there is no change to any existing drainage structures. 
17.3 	The Road Agent shall be contacted to perform a pre-paving inspection to ensure that the driveway is in compliance with Section 9.6 above. A post-paving inspection shall also be required. 
16 
TOWN OF NEW BOSTON DRIVEWAY REGULATIONS 
Section 18 MAINTENANCE AND RESPONSIBILITY  (ALL LOTS) 
18.1 	The owner shall have continuing responsibility for maintaining the driveway such that no driveway or access threatens the integrity of the public highway or adversely affects the safety of the traveling public.  This responsibility extends to the adequacy of the access and any grades, culverts, or other structures pertaining to such access, whether or not located within the public right-of-way. 
Enforcement of this section shall be the responsibility of the Building Inspector/Code Enforcement Official and the procedures for enforcement shall be as described in the above-referenced statute.  This can include taking whatever actions are necessary to protect the highway and the traveling public, with the owner or other responsible party held civilly liable to the Town for its costs in taking such actions. 
18.2 	The owner of the property accessed by the driveway shall have continuing responsibility for maintaining sight distance.  No obstructions (e.g. signage, ornaments, or lighting) shall be permitted to hinder sight distance. 
18.3 	The driveway shall be maintained so as to provide all season access for Town emergency equipment. 
17 
TOWN OF NEW BOSTON DRIVEWAY REGULATIONS 
Section 19 BONDING 
19.1 	Should the approved Driveway Permit require that the driveway have a paved apron installed and said paved apron is not satisfactorily completed at the time a Certificate of Occupancy is requested (for instance, if the driveway apron cannot be paved due to winter conditions), the applicant shall post security with the Planning Board in the amount of $2,000.  The security shall be held until the paving of the apron is satisfactorily inspected by the Road Agent. 
19.2 	The applicant may propose posting a security with the Planning Board if the applicant is unable to satisfactorily complete conditions established by the Planning Board as part of the approval of a driveway for a Subdivision or Non-Residential Site Plan Review prior to the time a Certificate of Occupancy is requested.  For instance, if permanent stabilization of side slopes has not been achieved, the applicant shall prove that temporary stabilization is in place and shall produce estimates for completing the permanent stabilization to the satisfaction of the Building Inspector/Code Enforcement Officer.  The security shall be held until the condition is fulfilled and satisfactorily inspected by the Building Inspector/Code Enforcement Official.  
19.3 	All securities in this section shall be in a form acceptable to the Planning Board.  They shall be submitted to the Office of the Planning Board/Planning Department.  Securities shall be held until all conditions are fulfilled and a satisfactory inspection is conducted, at which time the security shall be returned to the applicant. 
(NOTE:  It is expected that the applicant will make every effort to plan the construction of the driveway in a timely fashion and complete the work required prior to requesting a Certificate of Occupancy.  This sub-section should in no way be interpreted to mean that a security will be accepted for every driveway.  It is intended that this sub-section be used, for example, to allow the submission of securities to cover completion of items that are affected by winter weather conditions and the timing of construction and not those issues that will affect the safety of the property owners or the traveling public.)

Section 204.6 Wetlands Conservation and Stream Corridor District (District
amended March 13, 2007.)
A. Authority and Purpose
By the authority granted in RSA 483-B:8, 674:16-17 and 674:20-21, in the interest of public health, safety and general welfare, and consistent with the goals and objectives of the New Boston Master plan, and the Piscataquog River Management Plan, the New Boston Wetlands and Stream Corridor Conservation District is hereby enacted to regulate the uses of lands associated with ponds, streams, and wetlands, and in the transitional upland fringe adjoining them.
1. To encourage preservation and maintenance of fields, forests, wetlands, river front, river beds, and wildlife corridors, consistent with the Land Use Goals of the New Boston Master Plan adopted September 12, 2006.
2. To protect river and stream corridors, reduce or eliminate impacts from leach fields, and non-point sources of pollution, to protect spawning and rearing habitats, protect threatened, endangered and sensitive species dependant on our aquatic habitats, and promote stewardship of our aquatic resources, consistent with the “Piscataquog River Management Plan”, adopted under the New Boston Master plan.
3. To protect and encourage agriculture and forestry in recognition of their contributions to the food supply, economy, aesthetics, natural environment, wildlife habitats, history, and traditions of New Hampshire, consistent with RSA 672:1.
4. To protect, to the greatest extent possible consistent with the foregoing, the existing property rights of landowners who have constructed structures and commenced, before the effective date
of this amendment, land uses that might otherwise be constrained or effected hereby.
5. To control the development of structures and land uses on streambanks and naturally occurring wetlands which would contribute to the pollution of surface and groundwater.
6. To prevent the destruction or alteration of natural wetlands which provide flood protection, groundwater recharge, pollution abatement, and the augmentation of stream flow during dry periods, and which are important for such other reasons as those cited in RSA 482-A:1.
7. To prevent unnecessary and excessive expenses to the town for providing and maintain essential services and utilities; which
TOWN OF NEW BOSTON
ZONING ORDINANCE
14
expenses arise because of unwise use of streambanks, wetlands, and the transitional upland fringe.
8. To encourage those uses that can be appropriately and safely located on or near streambanks and in wetland areas.
9. To preserve and enhance those aesthetic values associated with the ponds, streams and wetlands of this town.
B. District Boundaries
1. The New Boston Wetlands and Stream Corridor Conservation District is defined as those areas in New Boston that contain, or are within the setback distances prescribed herein from perennial streams, and rivers; Great Ponds, ponds, and lakes; poorly drained soils; and wetlands including bogs, marshes, and vernal pools, as defined herein, or by Statute.
a. Wetlands are defined, consistent with State and Federal law, as areas inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency or duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances, do support a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. See RSA 482-A:2, X; 674:55; and Env-Wt 301.01(a), (c), (d), (f).
b. Perennial Streams shall mean a water course in a well defined channel that contains water year round during a year of at least average precipitation. A perennial stream exhibits typical biological, hydrological, and physical characteristics commonly associated with the continuous conveyance of water.
c. Vernal Pool shall mean a confined basin depression which, at least in most years, holds water for a minimum of two continuous months during the spring and/or summer, provides essential breeding habitat for certain amphibians and invertebrates, and is free of adult fish populations.
d. This section shall not apply to isolated wetlands of less than 2,000 square feet, nor to erosion control structures such as sediment basins and diversion ditches, nor to low-impact development practices such as bio-filters, detention and retention ponds, infiltration trenches, and drainage swales.
2. To supplement and assist with locating, but not to define the District as defined above, the map designated as the "Town of New Boston Wetlands and Stream Corridor Conservation District Map" as
TOWN OF NEW BOSTON
ZONING ORDINANCE
15
it may be, from time to time, updated is hereby deemed to be a part of the official Zoning Map of the Town of New Boston.
3. The location and limits of wetlands shall be determined through field delineation done by a NH Certified Wetland Scientist, performed consistent with the State of New Hampshire’s approved method codified at Env-Wt 301.01 (a), (c), (d), (f) as it may hereafter be, from time to time, amended.
C. General Provisions
1. Boundary Appeals. In the event that the Building Inspector or the Conservation Commission questions the validity of the boundaries of a wetland area on a specific parcel of land, or upon the written petition of the owner or any abutter of the said property to the Planning Board, the Board may call upon the services of a certified wetland scientist to examine said area and report his or her findings in writing to the Planning Board for the determination of the boundary. The cost of such an appeal shall be borne by the applicant.
“Certified Wetland Scientist” means a person qualified in wetland delineation and mapping who is so licensed and certified by the State of New Hampshire Joint Board of Licensure and Certification.
2. Building Site Location and Lot Size Determination. Areas designated as having “poorly drained soils” may be used to fulfill up to 25% of the minimum lot size required by town ordinances and subdivision regulations, provided that the minimum non-wetland area is contiguous and sufficient in size and configuration to adequately accommodate the primary structure and all required utilities such as sewage disposal and water supply, including primary and auxiliary leach field locations. This minimum contiguous dryland area shall be the required building site with accommodating utilities thereon. All contiguous areas shall be a minimum of 50 feet in width in order to be considered contiguous. Building envelopes may be required to be shown on the subdivision or site plans at the discretion of the Planning Board. Backlots, which are allowed in the R-A district, shall be required to comply only with the minimum area requirements of a frontlot.
No part of areas designated as having “very poorly drained” soils, or bodies of water, may be used to satisfy minimum lot size.
At the discretion of the Planning Board, the determination of the minimum lot size may be based upon either a delineation of the poorly drained soils performed by a Certified Wetland Scientist, or a site specific soil survey conducted by a Certified Soil Scientist. The cost of such an appeal shall be borne by the applicant.

Section 204.7 Groundwater Resource Conservation District
A. Authority and Purpose
Pursuant to the authority granted under RSA 674:21, as amended, the Town of New Boston hereby adopts the following regulations. The purpose of these regulations is, in the interest of public health, safety and general welfare, to protect, preserve and maintain existing and potential groundwater supply areas and to protect surface waters that are fed by groundwater from adverse development, land use practices or depletion. (Amended March 9, 2010.)
This is to be accomplished by regulating land uses which would contribute polluted water and pollutants to designated wells and/or aquifers identified as being needed for present and future public and private water supply. (Amended March 9, 2010.)
B. District Defined
The Groundwater Resource Conservation District shall encompass those areas which are identified on the map entitled "Town of New Boston Aquifer Transmissivity Levels", dated June 2009, as prepared by the Southern New Hampshire Planning Commission. This map is based upon the stratified drift aquifer data available on NH GRANIT. This transmissivity data was automated from maps generated as part of a larger study of groundwater resources in the State and is based on a study conducted under a cooperative agreement between the U.S. Geological Survey, Pembroke, NH and the NH Department of Environmental Services, Water Resources Divisions. From time to time, this data may be amended or superseded by the U.S. Geological Survey and the NH Department of Environmental Services, or by the Planning Board as provided herein. (Amended March 9, 2010.)
The Groundwater Resource Conservation District shall also include all the Wellhead Protection Areas for public water supply wells as defined under Section J of this ordinance. (Amended March 9, 2010.)
The Town of New Boston Aquifer Transmissivity Levels Map is hereby adopted by reference as a zoning overlay district within which additional standards apply to the underlying zoning classification. In all cases where the standards for this district conflict with those of the underlying district, the more restrictive requirement shall apply. (Amended March 9, 2010.)
C. Incorrectly Designated Zones
When the actual boundary of the Groundwater Resource Conservation District is disputed by any owner or abutter affected by said boundary, the Planning Board, at the owner/abutter's expense and request, may engage the services of a professional geologist or

A. Authority and Purpose
By the authority granted in New Hampshire RSA 674:16-17 and RSA 674:20-21, as amended, and in the interest of public health, safety, natural resources and general welfare, the New Boston Steep Slopes Conservation District is hereby enacted to require responsible development of steeply sloping land.
The Steep Slopes Conservation District is intended to:
1. Reduce the negative environmental impacts of stormwater runoff caused by land disturbance for construction and/or other uses, and erosion and sedimentation into streams, rivers, ponds and wetlands;
2. Reduce the dangers of pollution from septic system installation and performance in steep slope areas and to prevent additional water from hillside septic systems from causing erosion;
3. Preserve vegetative cover and wildlife habitat;
4. Prevent negative impact to the Town’s roads and drainage systems;
5. Prevent development that could negatively impact the Town’s ability to provide emergency services; and,
6. Permit those uses of land which can be harmoniously, appropriately and safely located on steep slopes. (Amended March 14, 2006.)
B. District Boundaries
1. The Steep Slopes Conservation District includes all areas of New Boston with slopes of equal to or greater than 15% up to 25% and 25% or greater.
2. For visual reference and for use as a general guide, the Steep Slopes Conservation District is shown on the map designated as the “Town of New Boston Steep Slopes Map,” dated 08/03/2004, and is hereby adopted by reference.
3. The Steep Slopes Conservation District is a zoning overlay district within which additional standards apply to the underlying zoning classification. In all cases where the standards for this district conflict with those of the underlying district, the more restrictive requirement shall apply.
4. The standard for delineation or mapping of the steep slopes conservation district shall be by either an aerial or on-ground topographical survey in intervals of not less than 5 feet contours.

ZONING ORDINANCE
42
Said mapping standard to be completed by a qualified surveyor licensed to practice in the State of New Hampshire. Any necessary surveying and other expenses incurred for this purpose shall be paid by the applicant.
C. Scope of Application of Ordinance
1. This ordinance is intended to apply to the construction or development of any building lot not exempted hereby and is also intended to govern the manner in which the Planning Board approves of subdivisions and site plans.
D. Incorrectly Designated Zones
1. In the event an area is incorrectly designated as being moderately steeply sloping or very steeply sloping on the Town of New Boston Steep Slopes Map, or an area not so designated meets criteria for a steep slope designation and evidence to that effect is satisfactorily presented to the Planning Board during site plan or subdivision review, or to the Building Inspector during an application for building permit, such Board or official may determine that the restrictions contained in this section shall or shall not apply, whichever the case may be. Any necessary testing or expenses incurred to clearly delineate questionable steep slope areas shall be based on an on-ground survey at not less than 5 feet contour intervals, completed by a qualified surveyor licensed to practice in the State of New Hampshire. Any necessary surveying and other expenses incurred for this purpose shall be paid by the applicant.
E. Exemptions (Renumbered March 14, 2006.)
1. All development proposals shall be subject to RSA 676:12, as amended, however, lots of record recorded in the Hillsborough County Registry of Deeds prior to the adoption of this ordinance shall be exempt from the requirements of the Steep Slopes Conservation District, provided, however, that uses requiring Non-Residential Site Plan Review shall be subject to the requirements of said district.

F. Individual Stormwater Management Plan (Added March 14, 2006.)
All subdivision or development in the steep slopes conservation district will require these additional regulations to be followed:
1. All lots created following the adoption of this ordinance on March 14, 2006, shall show lines on the plan depicting at least one Suitable Building Envelope area (SBE) of at least 0.5 acres of contiguous flatland that is all at least 75 feet from all Very Poorly Drained soils and 20 feet from all side and rear lot lines. All steeply sloped areas outside the SBE would be depicted as a “Critical Area”.
2. If the SBE is less than 0.5 acres, or if any disturbance is proposed or will likely be required in the “Critical Areas”, then an “Individual Pre-Engineered Stormwater Management Plan” (IPESWMP)
shall be submitted at the time of subdivision application to verify that the lot is viable for building on.
3. All plans with critical areas will require notes, satisfactory to the Planning Board per the Town of New Boston Subdivision Regulations, that any construction proposed in the “Critical Areas” will require a “Stormwater Management Plan” (SWMP) to be submitted prior to the issuance of a building permit. If the construction will adhere to an existing PESWMP, then the PESWMP can be upgraded to a SWMP for the building permit. See Town of New Boston Planning Board Subdivision and Non-Residential Site Plan Review regulations for specific requirements of the IPESWMP and ISWMP.
4. Newly created deeds for properties with critical areas will require notes, satisfactory to the Planning Board per the Town of New Boston Subdivision Regulations, that indicate the presence of critical areas and inform potential owners of the ISWMP requirement.

Some of these techniques include the use of landscaping and open space, bioretention facilities, dry wells, filter/buffer strips and other landscape areas, grassed swales, bioretention swales, wet swales, rain barrels, cisterns, infiltration trenches, etc. (Source: Low Impact Development Center, Beltsville, MD)
I. Open Space - Land within or related to an Open Space Development, not individually owned, which is designed and intended for the common use or enjoyment of the residents of the development, or the public, which may contain such accessory structures and improvements as are necessary and appropriate for recreational purposes.

* Amount and type of landscaping and/or natural vegetation.
* Preservation of view corridors, vistas, and viewsheds.
* Continuation of existing colors, textures, and materials.
iii) Visibility focuses on:
* Eliminating or mitigating visual impact.
* Protecting, continuing, and enhancing the existing environment.
B. Camouflage for Facilities on Existing Buildings or Structures - Roof Mounts
When a personal wireless service facility extends above the roof height of a building on which it is mounted, every effort shall be made to conceal or camouflage the facility within or behind existing or new architectural features to limit its visibility from public ways. Facilities mounted on a roof shall be stepped back from the front façade in order to limit their impact on the building's silhouette.
C. Camouflage for Facilities on Existing Buildings or Structures - Side Mounts
Personal wireless service facilities which are side mounted shall blend with the existing building's architecture and the panels shall be painted or shielded with material consistent with the design features and material of the building. All surfaces shall be non-reflective.
D. Camouflage for Ground Mounted Facilities
All ground-mounted personal wireless service facilities shall be surrounded by a buffer of dense tree growth that extends continuously for a minimum distance of one hundred and fifty feet (150') from the mount, security barrier, or designated clear area for access to equipment, whichever is greatest, and screens views of the facility in all directions. These trees must be existing on the subject property, planted on site, or be within a landscape easement on an adjoining site. The Planning Board shall have the authority to decrease, relocate, or alter the required buffer based on site conditions. The one hundred and fifty foot (150') vegetative buffer area shall be protected by a
TOWN OF NEW BOSTON
ZONING ORDINANCE
80
landscape easement or be within the area of the carrier's lease. The easement or lease shall specify that the trees within the buffer shall not be removed or topped, unless the trees are dead or dying and present a hazard to persons or property.
E. Color
To the extent that any personal wireless service facilities extend above the height of the vegetation immediately surrounding it, they shall be of a color which blends with the background or surroundings. All surfaces shall be non-reflective.
F. Equipment Shelters
Equipment shelters for personal wireless service facilities shall be designed consistent with one of the following design standards:

Section 407 Impact Fee Ordinance (Added March 12, 2019)
Section 407.1 Authority & Intent
This Ordinance is established pursuant to The State of New Hampshire RSA 674:21 (V). All references in this Ordinance will refer to State of New Hampshire RSAs. This Ordinance is intended to: Implement and be consistent with the Town of New Boston's Master Plan; and allocate a fair and equitable share of the cost of public capital facilities (including school construction) to new development, currently in place and require that new development contribute its proportionate share of funds necessary to accommodate its impact on public facilities; and apply to all forms of development identified in NH RSA 674:21 (V).
Section 407.2 Findings
The Town of New Boston is responsible for and committed to the provision of public facilities and services at levels necessary to support residential and non-residential growth and development. Such facilities and services have been and will be provided by the Town utilizing funds allocated via the Capital Improvements Program as regularly updated pursuant to NH RSA 674:5. The rate of growth experienced by the Town in recent years and projected growth rates, have and will continue to necessitate an expenditure of public funds in order to provide adequate facility standards. New development may create a need for the construction, equipping or expanding of public capital facilities. The imposition of impact fees is one of the available methods of ensuring that public expenditures are not excessive, and that new development bears a proportionate share of the cost of public capital facilities necessary to accommodate such development. This must be done in order to promote and ensure the public health, safety and welfare. The fees established by the Impact Fee Structure for the categories identified herein, are derived from, based upon, and shall not exceed the costs of: Providing additional public capital facilities necessitated by the new development for which the fees are levied; or Compensating the Town of New Boston for expenditures made for existing public facilities that were constructed in anticipation of new growth and development.
Section 407.3 Definitions
Applicant: A person or agent applying for the issuance of a building permit, permit for manufactured home installation, subdivision, site plan or other local land use decision, permit or approval.
New Development: Any activity that results in: The creation of a new dwelling unit or dwelling units; The conversion of a non-residential use to a dwelling unit or dwelling units; Construction of new non-residential facilities and/or accessory structures; and the conversion of a residential use to non-residential use. New Development does not include: The reconstruction of a residential or non-residential structure that has been destroyed by fire or natural disaster, provided there is no change in the
TOWN OF NEW BOSTON
ZONING ORDINANCE
97
number of dwelling units or size of the structure; The replacement of a manufactured home with another manufactured home provided there is no change in the number of dwelling units or size of the structure.
Public Capital Facilities: Facilities and equipment which are owned and operated by the Town of New Boston, the New Boston School System, or cooperatively with other municipalities and which have a useful life of no less than five years. Public capital facilities do not include the costs associated with the operation, maintenance or repair of such facilities, or with facility replacements that do not increase the capacity or level of service, but do include reasonable costs for planning, engineering, design, land acquisition, and other reasonable costs associated with such facilities.
Section 407.4 Off-Site Improvement
An improvement that is required by the Planning Board for either a site plan or subdivision that is necessary, in the judgment of the Planning Board, for the project to operate properly on the day that it opens shall be considered to be an Off-Site Improvement. Off-site improvements for site specific applications shall be assessed on a case by case basis and shall be in addition to other impact fees imposed pursuant to this Ordinance. In a case in which it is determined that such an improvement is necessary for the proper operation of the project, the Planning Board shall so notify the applicant. The applicant shall be required to present to the Board a study that identifies the proportionate share of the cost of the required improvement. The Planning Board may, at the expense of the applicant, refer such study to a consultant of its own choosing to determine the reliability of the findings that shall be considered by the Board to arrive at an amount to be paid by the applicant for the offsite improvement. The applicant shall be assessed his/her proportionate share of the cost of the project. In cases where it is determined that an improvement is necessary for the proper functioning of a site plan or subdivision, but the applicant, for whatever reason is determined to contribute more than his/her proportionate share to the improvement under this section, and, therefore, that the improvement will also accommodate other future development, the Planning Board, at the request and expense of the applicant, may establish a separate, project related impact fee that assesses other future site plans or subdivisions for their proportionate share of the improvement to reimburse the applicant for such disproportionate contribution. Such future impact fees shall provide for the payment to the original applicant, with any interest.

The Planning Board may request that said boards, agencies or other bodies indicate the extent to which the Town’s public services and facilities can accommodate the demands created by the proposed project in terms of the present capabilities of the Town and the realistic and planned projections of future increases in said capabilities. In this regard, reference may be made to the Master Plan, Capital Improvements Plan, Budget or other documents or plans that are operative or under study in the Town at the time that this application is being reviewed.
7
4.02 PREMATURE DEVELOPMENT
The Planning Board, in its discretion, will not approve such scattered or premature development as would involve danger or injury to health, safety or prosperity by reason of the lack of water supply, drainage, transportation, schools, fire protection, public safety or other public services; nor will the Planning Board approve such development which will necessitate an excessive expenditure of public funds for the supply of such services.
These regulations are designed to guide the Town’s future growth in a balanced and responsible manner. Towards this end, the Planning Board shall consider the following items when determining whether a proposed development is scattered or premature:
a. Existing and projected capacity of the Town’s school system and the effect of the development on school bus transportation;
b. Adequacy of existing access roads;
c. Adequacy of water for domestic needs and firefighting purposes;
d. Potential health problems regarding the relationship between on-site sewage disposal systems and the soil conditions of the parcels, as well as the potential impact on surrounding water quality;
e. Potential problems with the delivery of municipal services (such as fire protection, ambulance and police services);
f. Potential drainage problems both on-site and downstream and within existing receiving municipal systems;
g. General compliance with applicable Master Plan goals and recommendations, and;
h. Other issues which, in the view of the Planning Board, may cause the proposed development to be scattered or premature.
4.03 OFF-SITE IMPROVEMENTS
If the Board determines that the proposed subdivision will adversely affect existing public facilities, roads, sidewalks, drainage, septage or water supply, causing them to be inadequate to meet the additional needs created by the subdivision, then the applicant shall pay a reasonable share for such upgrading of the public facilities to an extent necessary to protect the public interest. If other properties benefit from the upgrading of such off-site public improvements, the Board shall determine the portion of the cost to be paid by the applicant, taking into consideration the following elements:
a. The character of the area;
b. The extent that other public and private property will be benefited by the upgrading, and;
c. Any other factors that the Board deems appropriate to establish a rational connection between the needs created by the development and the amount to be paid by the applicant.
4.04 WAIVERS
The Planning Board may grant a waiver to any portion of the Subdivision Regulations only when the Board finds, by majority vote, that:
a. Strict conformity to the Subdivision Regulations would pose an unnecessary hardship to the applicant and a waiver would not be contrary to the spirit and intent of the regulations, or,
8
b. Specific circumstances relative to the subdivision, or conditions of the land in such subdivision, indicate that the waiver will properly carry out the spirit and intent of the regulations.
A waiver of any specific requirement shall not be construed as a waiver in full or in part of any other requirement, nor shall such waiver constitute a waiver of requirements on any other subdivision proposal. The basis for any waiver granted by the Planning Board shall be recorded in the minutes.
4.05 ABUTTER NOTIFICATION
The applicant and the abutters shall be notified of the initial public hearing by certified mail (as necessary), return receipt requested, mailed at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing. The notice shall include the time and place of the public hearing and a general description of the application and shall identify the applicant and the location of the application.
4.06 AMENDMENTS
These regulations may be amended or rescinded by the Board, but only following a public hearing on the proposed changes as required by RSA 675:6. A record of any changes, certified by the signatures of a majority of the members of the Board, shall be transmitted to the Town Clerk and the New Hampshire Office of Strategic Initiatives. (See RSA 675:8 & 9.)
4.07 PENALTY
Any owner, or agent of the owner, of any land located within a subdivision in the Town of New Boston, who transfers or sells any land before a plat of said subdivision has been approved by the Planning Board and filed with the Register of Deeds of Hillsborough County under RSA 674:37, shall forfeit and pay a civil penalty of $1,000 for each lot or parcel so transferred or sold; and the description by metes and bounds in the instrument of transfer or other document used in the process of selling or transferring shall not exempt the transaction from such penalties. The town may enjoin a transfer or sale which violates the provision of RSA 676:16 and may recover the penalty imposed by civil action. In any action to recover a penalty, the prevailing party may recover reasonable court costs and attorney's fees as may be ordered by the Court.
4.08 APPEALS
For purposes of appeals of Planning Board decisions, such decision shall be deemed "final" on the date when the Board takes its last official action on a subdivision; provided that, if an approval is granted with conditions and the subdivider wishes to challenge the Board's authority to require any or all of the conditions, the date on which said condition(s) is/are imposed shall be deemed to be the date of final action. Application of appeal to the Hillsborough County Superior Court shall be made within 30 days of the Board's decision, pursuant to RSA 677:15. Any Planning Board decisions appealable to the board of adjustment shall be appealed pursuant to RSA 676:5.

ARTICLE V: PERMITTING PROCEDURE
5.01 APPLICATION
Whenever a subdivision as defined herein and covered by these regulations is proposed to be made, and before any conveyance of such subdivision or any part thereof is made, the owner of the land involved, or his agent shall make application for approval in writing to the Board on a form provided by the Board. This form shall include a cover sheet that consists of a certification by the applicant that the application being submitted is a completed application as provided for in Section 5.09. The completed application shall be accompanied by all supporting information and supporting plans and documentation required herein, and by the fees established by the Board for notification as required by Statute, RSA 676:4,I,(d)(1).
5.02 FEES
a. All costs of notices, whether mailed or posted, shall be paid in advance by the applicant. Failure to pay costs shall constitute valid grounds for the Board to terminate further consideration and to disapprove the plat without a public hearing.
b. The Board may require special investigative studies, environmental assessments, a legal review of documents, administrative expenses, and other matters necessary to make an informed decision, provided that the review and consultation does not substantially replicate a review and consultation obtained by the Zoning Board of Adjustment. The cost of such studies and investigations shall be paid by the applicant prior to the service or study being provided.
5.03 PUBLIC HEARING AND NOTICES
Except as provided for in Section 5.02.a, no application shall be heard, accepted, approved or disapproved by the Planning Board without affording a public hearing thereon.
A public hearing will be held for any of the following:
a. An amendment to a previously approved plan;
b. A waiver request;
c. Design Review, per RSA 676:4 II(b);
d. Formal review
5.04 PRE-APPLICATION REVIEW
a. Preliminary Conceptual Consultation. Prior to the formal submission of a subdivision layout, the applicant is strongly encouraged to meet with the Board to review the basic concept of the proposal and to consider the Board's suggestions which might be of assistance later on in resolving problems with meeting town requirements during final plat consideration. Preliminary consultation and review shall not bind either the subdivider or the Board.
The Board and the applicant may discuss proposals in conceptual form and in general terms only, such as desirability of types of development and proposals under the Master Plan. Such discussion may occur without the necessity of giving formal notice to the public and abutters, but such discussion may occur only at formal meetings of the Board.
b. Design Review Phase. The Board may engage in non-binding discussions with the applicant beyond conceptual and general discussions which involve more specific design and engineering details. Design review requires the submission of an application form. Design review may
10
proceed only after identification of, and notice to, the owner, applicant, abutters, holders of conservation, preservation and agricultural preservation restrictions and every licensed professional whose seal appears on the plans, and the general public as required by RSA 676:4,I,(d).
Preliminary conceptual consultation and design review shall be separate and apart from formal consideration, and the time limits for acting under RSA 676:4,I,(c),(1) shall not apply until formal application is submitted.
5.05 FORMAL REVIEW
The applicant shall file the completed application for Formal Review with the Planning Department at least twenty-one (21) days prior to the meeting at which the application will be accepted, per the schedule of regular Planning Board meetings. Click items* for link to form, Application Cover Sheet*, Application Checklists - Design Review* or Final (Formal) Review* and Subdivision Application*. Forms are also available from the Planning Department and online at www.newbostonnh.gov/planning.
At a properly noticed public hearing, the Planning Board may:
a. Vote to determine if the application poses potential regional impact and take corresponding action. If the Planning Board determines there is potential regional impact, further action on the application will be tabled until after the public hearing on potential regional impact, or;
b. Determine if an application is complete and if so accept the application, or if the application is determined not to be complete, the Board will deny or table the acceptance of the application and thereafter shall communicate to the applicant in writing why such action has been taken by the Planning Board, or;
c. Vote to table, approve, approve with conditions, or deny the application.
5.06 DETERMINATION OF POTENTIAL REGIONAL IMPACT
Determination of potential regional impact shall apply to all Formal applications requiring abutter notification and shall be made at an abutter notified public hearing to provide notice to and an opportunity for response from potentially affected municipalities and the regional planning commission(s) concerning developments which are likely to have impacts beyond the boundaries of the Town of New Boston, in accordance with RSA 36:54-58, as amended.
Determination of potential regional impact may be found for applications which meet any of the following impacts:
a. Relative size or number of dwelling units as compared with existing stock.
b. Proximity to the borders of a neighboring community.
c. Transportation networks.
d. Anticipated emissions such as light, noise, smoke, odors, or particles.
e. Proximity to aquifers or surface waters which transcend municipal boundaries1.
f. Shared facilities such as schools and solid waste disposal facilities.
1 SNHPC guidelines suggest: Proposed developments located within 1,000 feet of any aquifer or surface waters that transcend municipal boundaries and there will be either a large water withdrawal (defined as 57,600 gallons by NHDES) or there will be indoor, outdoor, or underground storage of chemicals or other potential pollutants.
11
If a determination of potential regional impact is made by the Board, the Planning Board will notify the regional planning commission and affected municipalities, in accordance with RSA 36:57 as amended.
All costs associated with notification shall be borne by the applicant.
5.07 VOLUNTARY MERGER
Any applicant owning two (2) or more contiguous pre-existing approved or subdivided lots who wishes to consolidate them for municipal regulations and taxation purposes may do so by applying to the Planning Board as follows:
a. A notice of the merger sufficient to identify the relevant parcels shall be submitted to the Planning Board for endorsement in writing. Said notice of merger shall be recorded with the Hillsborough County Registry of Deeds.
b. No new survey plat need be recorded.
c. No public hearing or notice shall be required.
d. Provided that such merger does not create a violation of the current ordinances and regulations of the Town, all such requests shall be approved by the Board.
e. A copy of the approved notice of merger shall be forwarded to the Town's assessing official(s).
This section is not intended to be the exclusive means of accomplishing merger and, thus, nothing in this section is intended to affect any other legally available or operative mechanism that would accomplish a similar merger.
5.08 MINOR SUBDIVISION
The applicant may first meet with the Board for preliminary conceptual consultation and/or design review of the proposal to discuss if it qualifies as a minor subdivision as defined in these regulations.
For a minor subdivision, the applicant shall submit:
a. A completed application, as required in Section 5.09, and
b. A final plat as provided in Section 5.09.01.

e. DESIGN STANDARDS
The following standards shall be applied in planning for stormwater management and erosion and sediment control:
1. All measures in the plan shall meet, as a minimum, the Best Management Practices set forth in the "New Hampshire Code of Administrative Rules, Chapter Env-Wq 1500 Alteration of Terrain, current edition and the New Hampshire Stormwater Management Manual, New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services, Volumes 1 - 3, December 2008, as amended, a copy of which is available in the Office of the Planning Board/Planning Dept.
2. Whenever practical, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected or supplemented. The stripping of vegetation shall be done in a manner that minimizes soil erosion.
3. Appropriate erosion and sediment control measures shall be installed prior to soil disturbance.
4. The area of disturbance shall be kept to a minimum. Disturbed areas remaining idle for more than 30 days shall be stabilized.
5. Measures shall be taken to control erosion within the project area. Sediment in runoff water shall be trapped and retained within the project area using approved measures. Wetland areas and surface waters shall be protected from sediment.
27
6. Off-site surface water and runoff from undisturbed areas shall be diverted away from disturbed areas where feasible or carried non-erosively through the project area. The integrity of downstream drainage systems shall be maintained.
7. Measures shall be taken to control the post-development peak rate of runoff so `that it does not exceed pre-development runoff for the 2, 10 and 50-year frequency 24-hour duration storm event and for additional storm event frequencies as specified in the design criteria of the New Hampshire Code of Administrative Rules, Chapter Env-Wq 1500 Alteration of Terrain, current edition and the "New Hampshire Stormwater Management Manual", New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services, Volumes 1 - 3, December 2008, as amended.
8. Drainage facilities shall be designed using the twenty-five (25) year storm return frequency. Appropriate facilities shall be provided to mitigate the post development peak rate of runoff so that it does not exceed the pre-development peak rate of runoff. Applicants are encouraged to use innovative stormwater management techniques to retain stormwater onsite and reintroduce it to the groundwater.
9. Stormwater management basins and roadway cross culverts shall be evaluated using the fifty (50) year storm return frequency to check flood impacts and demonstrate that downstream properties will not be adversely affected.
10. Drainage swales with a slope of five (5) percent or greater shall be adequately protected against soil erosion. Permanent rip rap armor or erosion control matting shall be designed by a Professional Engineer.
11. When segments of closed drainage are required, drainage structures (catch basins or drain manholes) shall not be spaced greater than three hundred (300) feet apart. Drainage structures shall be required at all changes in grade, changes in alignment and intersections of multiple pipes.
12. Underdrains shall be required where a) the roadway is in a 4-foot cut; and, b) in all ledge cuts. The design engineer shall specify underdrain locations on the plan. The Highway Department reserves the right for the Road Agent or designated representative to require additional underdrain based on field conditions encountered during construction.
13. Underdrains shall outlet into a headwall or drainage structure.
14. Priority should be given to preserving natural drainage systems including perennial and intermittent streams, wetlands, swales, and drainage ditches for conveyance of runoff leaving the project area.
15. All temporary erosion and sediment control measures shall be removed after final site stabilization. Trapped sediment and other disturbed soil areas resulting from the removal of temporary measures shall be permanently stabilized within 30 days unless conditions dictate otherwise.
16. All stormwater management basins shall be constructed with an outlet structure which conforms to the "New Boston Typical Stormwater Management Basin Outlet Structure" detail provided herein.
17. Access roads shall be provided to drainage structures that will require Town maintenance. Access roads shall be 10' wide, with a 12" crushed gravel base (NHDOT 304.3), shall not exceed 10%, and shall have all appropriate easements for Town use and maintenance.
18. All drainage swales, ponds, conveyance or contaminant systems shall be stabilized prior to directing any stormwater to them.
28
19. For any infiltration system, either at or below grade, do not discharge sediment laden waters from construction activities (runoff or water from excavations) to the infiltration system. Temporary sediment basins or traps shall be provided. Do not traffic exposed soil surface with construction equipment. If feasible, perform excavations with equipment positioned outside the limits of the infiltration systems. After the area is excavated to the final design elevation, the bottom of the infiltration area shall be deeply tilled with a rotary tiller or disc harrow to restore infiltration rates, followed by a pass with a leveling drag. Infiltration ponds shall not be placed into service until the contributing areas have been fully stabilized.

ARTICLE VIII PERFORMANCE AND MAINTENANCE SECURITIES
8.01 INCOMPLETE IMPROVEMENT GUARANTEE
Completion of improvements required by the Board as a condition of approval such as streets, utilities and stormwater management, etc., which have not been completed, shall be guaranteed by the subdivider by one of the following alternatives:
a. Posting of a performance bond or submission of an irrevocable letter of credit, or other security providing the type and form of the security is acceptable to the Board and approved by the legal counsel of the town, and providing the amount is sufficient to cover the cost of necessary construction, including a cost escalation factor of no more than 10 percent (10%) per year. Additionally, the Board reserves the right to require that the applicant demonstrate the financial trustworthiness of any bonding company acting as Surety on a performance bond and to insist, if, in the judgment of the Board, it is deemed necessary, that such company acting as Surety be a company organized under the laws of the State of new Hampshire and/or be licensed to operate and be in good standing in the State of New Hampshire and that the laws of the State of New Hampshire shall govern any disputes or actions taken under such bond. (See RSA 674:36,III,(b).) All performance bonds shall be calculated using the road bond estimate form of the Town of New Boston and the final amount shall be approved by the Town's Consulting Engineer.
b. The performance bond or letter of credit shall include language which will either (1) provide for the automatic extension of the security, without amendment, for a minimum period of one (1) year, or; (2) provide that the Surety shall provide a replacement bond or letter of credit or a written commitment to provide a replacement bond or letter of credit a minimum of 120 days prior to the expiration date of the initial term of the security or any extension thereof. Any such security shall meet all of the requirements of the initial bond as well. Failure to timely provide such replacement security or commitment shall constitute a breach in the conditions of the bond and entitle the Town to act to recover under the bond and/or proceed with any other available remedies including revocation of approval pursuant to RSA 676:4-a. This requirement shall not be applicable if the applicant has provided a letter of credit that is "self-calling". The initial term of any such security shall be at least 90 days beyond the time stated for completion of applicable improvements.
c. Submission of cash or a passbook in an amount sufficient to cover the cost of necessary construction, including a cost escalation factor of no more than 10 percent per year.

7.2 Members shall not directly or indirectly solicit any gifts or
accept or receive any gift (whether in money, services, loans, travel, entertainment, hospitality, premises or in some other form), under circumstances in which it could be reasonably inferred that the gift was intended to influence them in the performance of their duties or was intended as a reward for any recommendation or decision on their part.
7.3 To avoid conflict of interest or even the appearance of
impropriety, any member who may receive some private benefit from a public Planning Board decision must not participate in that decision. The private benefit may be direct or indirect; create a material personal gain or provide an advantage to relations, friends, groups or associations that hold a significant share of the official's loyalty. An official with a conflict of interest must make that interest public, abstain from voting on the matter, and except as specified below, leave the table or podium area when Board members deliberate and vote on a matter.

Section 10 Board Preparation for Meetings
10.1 Ten (10) days prior to the meeting, at the same time as public notice is made, a copy of the agenda is placed in the Board's bins located at the front entrance to the Town Hall.
10.2 By the end of the Friday before the Tuesday night meeting, materials for the Board will be placed in the Board's bins. These materials, prepared by Planning Department staff, include, but are not limited to, "cover sheets" for hearings on individual applications; background information from minutes, ordinances or regulations; copies of relevant materials submitted by the applicant, including plans, letters, memos, permits, studies, waiver requests and so on; a miscellaneous business agenda with relevant supporting information and documentation; copies of presentations that will be made at the meeting, if available.
10.3 Some materials may be too large to be copied to individual Board members. Those materials may either be placed in the "Read File" attached to the Board's bins for review, or may be available in the office for review. A notation to this effect will be made on the agenda and/or cover sheet, as necessary.
10.4 Additional pages of miscellaneous business may be produced up to and including the day of the meeting. The Board will determine whether or not any action will be taken on those items not received a week prior to the meeting date and will take matters under advisement for action at a future meeting should the Board deem it appropriate.
10.5 "Cover sheets" are documents prepared by Planning Department staff that are intended to pull together the various parts of an application into one report designed to assist the Planning Board in their consideration of the application. To this end, the cover sheet may list the chronology of an application; provide statutory references where appropriate; list the submitted items and dates of submission; indicate the time periods for Board action on an application; provide a report of the office plan review; indicate items requiring further research and/or documentation; point out areas and issues requiring the Board's consideration and discussion; indicate any past action by the Planning Board or other Board or committee with regard to the property; list correspondence received regarding an application; offer recommendations for further action by the Board; and offer suggested motions for approval or disapproval. Preparation of the cover sheet and the office plan review do not represent any opinion of the Planning Board as to the acceptability of the plans or application; they are only to verify that the standard details and issues are addressed in some manner for the Board to consider. There may be items discussed at the hearing that have not been mentioned as part of the checklist review and there may
NEW BOSTON PLANNING BOARD
RULES OF PROCEDURE
- 14 -
be issues noted on the cover sheet that the Board deems immaterial.
10.6 Individual Board members may research and investigate general or specific factual issues between meetings, provided however, that if the research is with regard to a particular application, the member shall report all findings to the Board at the public hearing and the applicant shall be given meaningful opportunity to respond.
10.7 Email is used by Planning Department staff as a means to distribute information to the Board in a timely and efficient manner. For example, meeting agenda and minutes for approval are distributed to the Board via email. It may also be used to schedule last minute drive by inspections prior to a meeting and to send reminders of site walks or other events, and so on. No response is generally expected.
10.8 Email may be used by Board members to ask questions of Planning Department staff regarding scheduling or agenda items, to alert the department in the event that a member will be absent from a meeting and so on.
10.9 Email may be used by Board members to ask other Board members or Planning Department staff procedural questions or questions about ordinances or regulations that do not result in any discussions about particular applications or the merits thereof.
10.10 Email or other electronic discussions between meetings regarding a pending application in which a quorum of the Board is involved are prohibited. Such discussion may occur only at noticed public hearings.
10.11 Messages circulated to a quorum of the Planning Board via email shall be considered public records, in accordance with RSA 91-A.

12.1 Planning Department staff, as assigned, shall maintain files for applications received for Planning Board consideration, kept in sequence of the time at which an application is received in the Planning Department.
12.2 Planning Department staff may offer their opinion as to whether or not an application appears to be complete, however, pursuant to State law, an application may only be "accepted" as complete by the Planning Board at a public hearing held by the Board.
12.3 The public hearing on the merits of an application shall immediately follow the acceptance of the application as complete by the Board, unless noticed otherwise.
12.4 Requests by an applicant to be placed on an agenda, other than a new application, must be received not less than fifteen days prior to the date of the meeting.
12.5 Every effort is made to schedule applications in the order of their receipt, providing, however, that applications continued from a previous meeting will take precedence over new applications, and the Planning Department staff reserves the right to schedule the agenda in order to make the most efficient use of the time available.
12.6 The Planning Board endeavors to remain on track with the timing of scheduled agenda items. The Planning Department staff assigns a time to each hearing before the Board. No hearing may start before its noticed time. It is entirely possible, however, that any given hearing may overrun its allotted time, particularly if it is a large or complicated subdivision or if the Board wishes to come to closure on an aspect of the discussion prior to adjourning. The Board makes every effort to extend the same professional level of review and discussion to each application and appreciates applicants', abutters' and others' understanding that their own issue will be dealt with in the same thorough manner.
12.7 If an agenda item is scheduled with a +/- notation it may begin within five (5) minutes either side of the noted time.
12.8 Miscellaneous Business is usually scheduled at the end of the agenda after the public hearings have been finished. However, Miscellaneous Business may also be taken up between scheduled hearings and other items if there is enough time before the noticed start of the next hearing.
12.9 Information regarding an application under consideration by the Board, or for inclusion on the Miscellaneous Business agenda,
NEW BOSTON PLANNING BOARD

Section 19 Site Walks
19.1 A "site walk" is defined as a visit by the Board, or a member of the Board, and representatives of Town departments and other Town Boards and Commissions who have an interest in the proposal, to a location which is the subject of an application before the Board, where the visit is in the company of the owner, applicant, their agents or employees and involves going onto the property or visiting areas which are not customarily available for public inspection. (This does not include a view of a site from adjoining public highways or other observations that can be made without entering on the property.)
19.2 A "drive by" is defined as a visit by the Board, or a member of the Board, to a location which is the subject of an application before the Board and which includes viewing the site from an adjoining public highway or other observation point that can be made without entering on the property. Drive bys are commonplace for items on the Miscellaneous Business agenda and for confirming compliance with administrative conditions not requiring further hearing by the Board. In the event that the item requiring inspection is not visible from the street, the Board may individually enter the site to view said item.
19.3 When the Board deems it necessary for the adequate consideration of an application, the Board shall request the applicant to allow a site walk by the Board.
19.4 When the Board schedules a site walk for Board membership, it shall be posted as a meeting of the Board in accordance with RSA 91-A.

19.6 A site walk is an opportunity for the Planning Board and others to visit a site and gather information through viewing the location in conjunction with prepared plans and asking questions of the applicant and/or their agent or representative. A site walk is not the venue for making decisions on an application. Any comments, motions or direction to the applicant should be made at the next hearing on the application.
19.7 Minutes of site walks shall be kept only if there is a quorum of the Board conducting the site walk. Notes of all site walks shall, however, be made for the purpose of reporting the findings
