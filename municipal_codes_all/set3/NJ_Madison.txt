section. The Shade Tree Management Board may remove such Borough
tree if, but only if:
(1) Such tree is so diseased or so infested so as to be a danger to other
trees in the Borough or surrounding communities.
(2) Such tree is dead or dying and its presence would cause hardship
or endanger the public or an adjoining property owner.
(3) Such a tree or shrub is a hazard to the public safety because it
obstructs the view of motor vehicle operators or otherwise
interferes with traffic or pedestrian safety. In the event that the full
removal of the tree or shrub is not required, it may be pruned
pursuant to § 45-8.
(4) Such a tree, if the Shade Tree Management Board determines for
other reasons, is necessary to be removed.
(5) In the case of construction on Borough property as provided in
Subsection C below:
(a) The presence of such tree would cause hardship or endanger
the public or an adjoining property owner.
(b) Such tree is located in an area to be occupied by buildings,
driveways, recreation areas or other construction or within a
distance of 15 feet around the perimeter of such construction,
depending on tree species and conditions to be determined by
the Shade Tree Management Board.
(c) Such tree is located in an area to have a cut or fill of land
deemed injurious or dangerous to such tree. The determination
of the Shade Tree Management Board in this respect shall
depend on the species of trees and degree of injury.
C. If the Borough Council directs the construction of any building,
driveway, recreation area or anything else upon the property owned by
the Borough, such construction shall be located to the extent
practicable so as to conserve a maximum number of trees consistent
with the appropriate and practical use and enjoyment of the land in
question. The Shade Tree Management Board shall be advised prior to
the start of such work and shall advise the Borough or other party
performing the work how the work can be accomplished, minimizing
the number of trees to be removed and the damage done to remaining
trees. To prevent damage to remaining trees, no material, machinery or
temporary soil deposits shall be placed within the drip line of any
existing tree, and proximity of said construction shall be established to
prevent damage to such tree during construction.
D. The electric utility of the Borough of Madison shall have the right to
remove trees, without the prior approval of the Management Board,
when an emergency as defined herein exists and when obtaining the
§ 45-7 SEAL § 45-7
44:125
§ 45-8. Permission required for certain actions.
prior approval of the Management Board is not practical. At all times,
the electric utility shall have the right to trim trees which reasonably
are required to be trimmed for the purpose of ensuring continuous
electric utility service or to avoid danger to the public or electric utility
personnel or equipment.
E. In the event that the governing body has reason to believe that the
removal of a Borough tree at the direction of the Shade Tree
Management Board, or otherwise, does not meet the criteria set forth in
this section or will be detrimental to the welfare of the Borough, the
Council may stay the removal of said tree pending a report on the
reasons for removal, which report shall be submitted promptly by the
Shade Tree Management Board. After consideration of the Shade Tree
Management Board's report and such other information as is pertinent
to the decision to remove the tree, the Council shall either approve or
disapprove the removal of the tree.
F. In the event that the governing body has reason to believe that the
Shade Tree Management Board's refusal to agree to a requested
removal of a Borough tree is inconsistent with the criteria of this
chapter or will be detrimental to the welfare of the Borough, the
Council may order the Shade Tree Management Board to submit a
report explaining its reason for refusing to remove the tree, which
report shall be promptly submitted by the Management Board. After
consideration of the Shade Tree Management Board's report and such
other information as is pertinent to the decision of whether or not to
remove the tree, the Council shall either approve the Shade Tree
Management Board's refusal to remove the tree or order the removal of
the tree, which the Shade Tree Management Board shall promptly do.
A. It shall be unlawful to commit any of the following acts with respect to
Borough trees without the prior written consent of the Shade Tree

(5) Cut any tree roots within 10 feet of any trunk or any roots four
inches in diameter.
(6) String or bury wires or lines through a public park.
B. The Shade Tree Management Board shall grant such written
permission if the activity for which such permission is requested is in
the public interest and is not likely to injure any Borough tree. The
Shade Tree Management Board will notify the Superintendent of Public
Works if written permission is granted for any of the above so that the
terms of the consent are followed.
C. Any person or persons who cause damage to any Borough tree or
Borough trees by machines, autos, etc., shall be held liable for damages
to said tree or trees. Damages shall be corrected or repaired and the
liable person or persons billed for the damages.
D. Any and every person having or maintaining any electric, telephone,
telegraph or other wires or lines running through a public street or
park shall securely fasten and maintain such wires and lines in such a
manner as will safeguard Borough trees against any damage therefrom

damage to Borough trees and Borough shrubs.

along a public street, any person having any wires or lines running

operations (tree trimming) done for them by any other person or
persons shall first obtain the written approval of the Shade Tree

along any street without having first obtained a valid permit from the
Borough Engineer, which, if the Borough Engineer deems necessary,
may require the mover to furnish a bond or cash deposit in an amount
sufficient to cover any damage to or destruction of Borough trees on
such street or streets as a result of such moving operations.
H. No person shall operate, place or maintain, within the dripline of any
Borough tree, any machinery, equipment, heavy object, stone, rocks,
cement, earth, soil or other substance which may harmfully affect such
Borough trees by unduly compressing the earth or otherwise impeding
or preventing the access of water or air to the roots of such tree or
excavate around to remove earth or soil from or cause any water to flow
upon the roots of any tree. The Borough Engineer may waive, in whole
or in part, such provisions, but only to the extent absolutely necessary

alarm attributable to the permittee for the year in which the notice

false alarms, or in the event that the permittee shall fail to remit
the required service fee, the permittee shall disconnect and
deactivate the alarm system within 10 days of receipt of written
notice from the Chief of Police to do so. The Chief of Police is

comply with the notice to disconnect shall constitute a separate
violation of this provision.
C. Any person aggrieved by the action of the Police Chief in denying a
permit or in the suspension or revocation of any permit provided for by
this chapter may appeal to the Mayor and Council of the Borough of
Madison by filing a written notice of appeal with the Borough Clerk

the alarm.
E. Any permittee shall be deemed to have consented to inspection of the
premises on which said alarm device is installed, at reasonable hours,
by the Police or Fire Chief or his designated representative. This
provision shall not be construed to impose a duty on the municipality to
make inspections or to relieve the alarm owner from inspecting, testing
and maintaining his own alarm device(s).
F. If the location of the fire or police communications facilities should be
changed at any time, permittees or licensees under this chapter shall
not be permitted to charge the municipality with any resulting cost of
moving the alarm equipment.
G. All costs and recurring charges incurred in the installation and
maintenance of alarm systems shall be borne by the permittee except
where this chapter indicates that such costs shall be paid by the

emergency. This shall not affect any alarm device that has been
approved by the effective date of this provision, nor shall it have any
effect on equipment used by the Madison Police Department.

devices that limit the audible signal to a duration not to exceed 10

§ 54-7 MADISON CODE § 54-7
48:144
periodic intervals exceeding 10 minutes each repeatedly, or of any
provisions of this chapter, the operation or maintenance of the alarm
system shall be deemed to constitute the grant of permission by the
owners and occupants of the premises for law enforcement, first aid
or fire officials to enter the said premises and investigate and to
disconnect the alarm system. The owners and occupants, by operating
or maintaining the alarm system, agree to hold harmless and defend
the Borough or its law enforcement, first aid or fire officials, agents
and employees from any and all claims for such entry on the premises
and any liability and damages that may occur. The minimum fine for
violation of this section shall be $25 with a maximum of $500.
J. Any alarm produced by any alarm system shall clearly distinguish
between intrusion-related alarms and fire-related alarms. No alarm
system shall be permitted that produces the same or similar signal from
both calls, nor shall any alarm system be permitted that produces the
same or similar signal for more than one location.

presently conducting or intend to conduct business within the Borough

and boundaries of areas on or within 1,000 feet of property owned by or
leased to any elementary or secondary school or school board which is used

§ 91-1 DRUG-FREE ZONES § 91-5

§ 91-5. Additional provisions.
The following additional matters are hereby determined, declared, recited
and stated:
A. The maps approved and adopted pursuant to § 91-1 of this article were
prepared and are intended to be used as evidence in prosecutions
arising under the criminal laws of this state, and, pursuant to N.J.S.A.
2C:35-7, these maps shall constitute prima facie evidence of the
following:
(1) The location of elementary and secondary schools within the
Borough of Madison.
(2) The boundaries of the real property which is owned by or leased to
such schools or a school board.
(3) That each such school property is and continues to be used for
school purposes.
(4) The location and boundaries of areas which are on or within 1,000
feet of each such school property.
B. All of the property depicted on the maps approved and adopted herein
as school property was owned by or leased to an elementary or
secondary school or school board and was being used for school

failure of any map approved herein to depict the location and
boundaries of any property which is, in fact, used for school purposes
and which is owned by or leased to any elementary or secondary school
or school board, whether the absence of such depiction is the result of
inadvertent omission or the result of any changes in the location and
boundaries of such property which have not yet been incorporated into
a revised approved map, shall not be deemed to be an official finding
and record that such property is not owned by or leased to an
elementary or secondary school or school board or that such property is
not used for school purposes.

§ 91-9. Additional provisions.
The following matters are hereby determined, declared, recited and stated:
A. It is understood that the map approved and adopted pursuant to § 91-6
of this article was prepared and is intended to be used as evidence in
prosecution arising under the criminal laws of the State of New Jersey,
and that pursuant to state law, such map shall constitute prima facie
evidence of the following:
§ 91-6 DRUG-FREE ZONES § 91-9
91:207
§ 91-10. Severability.
If any article, section, subsection, paragraph, phrase or sentence of this
article is for any reason held to be unconstitutional or invalid by any court of
competent jurisdiction, said article, section, subsection, paragraph, phrase
or sentence shall be deemed separable and shall not affect the validity of
the remaining portions hereof.
(1) The location of public housing facilities, public parks and public
buildings owned, leased or controlled by the Borough of Madison or
the Madison Housing Authority.
(2) The boundaries of the real property which is utilized in connection
with public housing facilities, public parks and public buildings
owned, leased or controlled by the Borough of Madison or the
Madison Housing Authority.
(3) That such property continues to be used as public housing
facilities, public parks and/or public buildings.
(4) The location and boundaries of areas which are on or within 500
feet of such public housing facilities, public parks and public
buildings.
B. Except as is otherwise expressly noted on the face of the approved map,
all of the property depicted on the map as drug-free public area was
owned, leased or controlled by the Borough of Madison or the Madison
Housing Authority and was being used for public housing facilities,
public parks and/or public buildings as of January 9, 1998, that being
the effective date of P.L. 1997, c. 327 (N.J.S.A 2C:35-7.1).

prosecutor is not precluded from introducing or relying upon any other
evidence or testimony to establish a violation of the offense defined in
that statute, including use of a map or diagram other than the one
approved and adopted pursuant to § 91-6 of this article. The failure of
the map approved herein to depict the location and boundaries of any
property which is, in fact, used for public housing facilities, public parks
and/or public buildings and which is owned, leased or controlled by the
Borough of Madison or the Madison Housing Authority, whether the
absence of such depiction is the result of inadvertent omission or the
result of any change in the location and boundaries of such property
which has not yet been incorporated into a revised approved map, shall
not be deemed to be an official finding and record that such property is
not owned or leased by the Borough of Madison or the Madison
Housing Authority or that such property is not used for public housing
facilities, public parks or public buildings.
D. All of the requirements of P.L. 1997, c. 327 (N.J.S.A. 2C:35-7.1)

GENERAL REFERENCES
Hazardous materials  See Ch. 111.
Land development  See Ch. 195.
Property maintenance  See Ch. 145.
§ 97-1. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to regulate the outdoor application of
fertilizer so as to reduce the overall amount of excess nutrients entering
waterways, thereby helping to protect and improve surface water quality
and also to prevent degradation of the environment. This chapter does not
apply to fertilizer application on commercial farms.
§ 97-2. Basis and background.
A. Elevated levels of nutrients, particularly phosphorus, in surface water
bodies can result in excessive and accelerated growth of algae and
aquatic plants (eutrophication). Excessive plant growth can result in
diurnal variations and extremes in dissolved oxygen and pH, which, in
turn, can be detrimental to aquatic life. As algae and plant materials die
off, the decay process creates a further demand on dissolved oxygen
levels. The presence of excessive plant matter can also restrict use of
the affected water for recreation and water supply.
§ 94-7 ELEVATOR SAFETY § 97-2

§ 97-3. Definitions.
For the purpose of this chapter, the following terms, phrases, words, and
their derivations shall have the meanings stated herein unless their use in
the text of this chapter clearly demonstrates a different meaning. When not
inconsistent with the context, words used in the present tense include the
future, words used in the plural number include the singular number, and
words used in the singular number include the plural number. The word
"shall" is always mandatory and not merely directory.
BUFFER  The land area, 25 feet in width, adjacent to any water body.
However, in situations that warrant additional flexibility, such as where lot
sizes are exceptionally small or where the twenty-five-foot buffer constitutes
the majority of the available property, the required buffer may be reduced
to 10 feet in width, with the additional requirement that a drop spreader be
used for fertilizer application.
COMMERCIAL FARM  A farm management unit producing agricultural or
horticultural products worth $2,500 or more annually.
FERTILIZER  A fertilizer material, mixed fertilizer or any other substance
containing one or more recognized plant nutrients, which is used for its
plant nutrient content, which is designed for use or claimed to have value in
promoting plant growth, and which is sold, offered for sale, or intended for
sale.
IMPERVIOUS SURFACE  A surface that has been covered with a layer of
material so that it is highly resistant to infiltration by water. This term shall
be used to include any highway, street, sidewalk, parking lot, driveway, or
other material that prevents infiltration of water into the soil.
PERSON  Any individual, corporation, company, partnership, firm,
association, or political subdivision of this state subject to municipal
jurisdiction.
PHOSPHORUS FERTILIZER  Any fertilizer that contains phosphorus,
expressed as P2O5, with a guaranteed analysis of greater than zero, except
that it shall not be considered to include animal (including human) or
B. Fertilizer applied immediately prior to a runoff-producing rainfall
outside the growing season or to impervious surfaces is most likely to
be carried away by means of runoff without accomplishing the desired
objective of supporting target vegetation growth. Therefore, the
management of the type, amount and techniques for fertilizer
application is necessary as one tool to protect water resources.
C. This chapter does not apply to application of fertilizer on commercial
farms, but commercial farmers are expected to implement best
management practices in accordance with conservation management
plans or resource conservation plans developed for the farm by the
Natural Resource Conservation Service and approved by the Soil
Conservation District Board.

vegetable manures, agricultural liming materials, or wood ashes that have
not been amended to increase their nutrient content.
SOILS TEST  A technical analysis of soil conducted by an accredited
soil-testing laboratory following the protocol for such a test established by
Rutgers Cooperative Research and Extension.
WATER BODY  A collection of or body of surface waters, such as a lake,
river, stream, creek, pond, or any accumulation of or standing water.
§ 97-4. Prohibited conduct.
No person may do or cause to occur any of the following:
§ 97-5. Phosphorus fertilizer application.
A. Apply fertilizer when a runoff-producing rainfall is occurring or
predicted and/or when soils are saturated and a potential for fertilizer
movement off site exists.
B. Apply fertilizer to an impervious surface. Fertilizer inadvertently
applied to an impervious surface must be swept or blown back into the
target surface or returned to either its original or another appropriate
container for reuse.
C. Apply fertilizer within the buffer of any water body.
D. Apply fertilizer more than 15 days prior to the start of or at any time
after the end of the recognized growing season from and during March
1 to November 15.
A. No person may do the following:
(1) Apply phosphorus fertilizer in outdoor areas except as
demonstrated to be needed for the specific soils and target
vegetation in accordance with a soils test and the associated annual
fertilizer recommendation issued by Rutgers Cooperative Research
and Extension.
B. Exceptions:
(1) Application of phosphorus fertilizer needed for:
(a) Establishing vegetation for the first time, such as after land
disturbance, provided the application is in accordance with the
requirements established under the Soil Erosion and Sediment
Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq. and implementing rules;
(b) Establishing or repairing a turf area in accordance with good
soil practices.
(2) Application of phosphorus fertilizer that delivers liquid or granular
fertilizer under the soils surface, directly to the feeder roots.

or her membership on the Historic Preservation Commission
terminated. If the Commission determines that a member is
absent from any meeting without just cause, it shall be duly
noted in the minutes of that meeting, and it shall be the duty of
the Chairperson to so notify that member in writing. The

Commission may also initiate the designation of an historic site or
district. The administrative officer will schedule a hearing before
the Commission to review the proposed historic site or district.
(2) The formal historic district nomination shall include: a building-bybuilding
inventory of all properties within the district; black and
white photographs of all properties within the district; a property
map of the district showing boundaries; and a physical description
and statement of significance which address the criteria for
designation set forth herein. The formal historic site nomination

by the Borough Council of the adoption of an ordinance designating
the proposed historic site or district.
D. Designation of districts. The following historic districts are delineated
and described in the Master Plan and are each hereby a designated
historic district for purposes of this chapter: [Amended 3-24-2008 by
Ord. No. 15-2008]
(1) Designated districts.
(a) Madison Civic Commercial Historic District. The designated
historic district is set forth on the Zoning Map of the Borough
of Madison which is incorporated herein by reference.

any written report which may have been submitted.
B. On all matters referred to the Commission which require approval by
the Planning Board or Zoning Board of Adjustment, the decision of the
Commission shall be a recommendation only.
C. An approval by the Planning Board or Zoning Board of Adjustment, as
the case may be, does not relieve the applicant of the requirements to
obtain a certificate of historic review for properties within the Historic
District.
A. When required. A certificate of historic review issued by the
Commission shall be required before a permit is issued or before work
can commence for any of the following activities within the historic

applications involving change in exterior appearance, the
Commission's report shall contain advice and recommendations for
the applicant in regard to the appropriateness of the proposed
action, but the report shall not contain any mandatory conditions.
The administrative officer shall include the advice and
recommendations of the Commission in the permit but the

§ 112-5 HAZARDOUS MATERIALS § 112-6
111:269
B. When not required. A certificate of historic review shall not be required
before a permit is issued by the Construction Code Official for changes

C. Procedures.
(1) All applicants shall complete an application form. Application forms
shall be made available in the office of the administrative officer/
Borough Engineer. Completed applications shall be filed with the
administrative officer/ Borough Engineer.
(2) Each application shall be accompanied by sketches, drawings,
photographs, descriptions and other information to show the
proposed alterations, additions, changes or new construction. The
Commission may require additional materials as it reasonably
requires to make an informed decision.
(3) The Commission shall reach a decision on an application and
submit its report to the administrative officer within 45 days of
referral of same by the administrative officer. Nothing herein shall
prohibit an extension of time by mutual agreement of the applicant
and the Commission.
(4) Informational meetings. Persons considering action that requires a
certificate of historic review, as set forth in this section, are
encouraged to request an informal informational meeting with the
Commission and/or its Chairman. Requests for such informational
meetings can be made to the administrative officer, who will
contact the Chairman of the Commission. The Commission shall

§ 112-6 MADISON CODE § 112-6
111:270
(d) An applicant is encouraged to attend the Historic Preservation

represented at the meeting to consider the application for a
certificate of historic review and the Commission may take
action in the absence of the applicant.
(e) When an application is approved, the Commission shall
forthwith issue a certificate of historic review which shall be
forwarded to the applicant. Failure to report within a forty-fiveday
period shall be deemed to constitute a default approval in
favor of the proposed work.
(6) Emergency procedures.
(a) When a structure or improvement requires immediate repair to
preserve the continued habitability of the structure and/or the
health and safety of its occupants or others, emergency repairs
may be performed in accordance with construction codes
without first obtaining a certificate of historic review. Under
such circumstances, the repairs performed shall be only such
as are necessary to protect the health and safety of the
occupants of the structure or others and/or to maintain the
habitability of the structure.
(b) A request for the Commission's review shall be made
simultaneously with the onset of emergency work. Such
emergency work shall be permitted only if the administrative
officer certifies the immediate necessity for such permit
issuance. Upon notice to the full Commission by telephone,
personal contact or other appropriate means of
communication, at least three members of the Commission
shall convene as soon as possible and such convening members
shall proceed to review the certificate of historic review
application as provided in this chapter. Subsequent to such
review, a certificate of historicc review may be issued upon a
majority vote of the members convened.
(7) Procedure for granting certification of appropriate municipal
actions.
(a) It is recognized that the intent and purposes of this chapter
would not be fully served if the municipality were to control the
actions of others but fail to apply similar constraints to itself.
Accordingly, a certificate of historic review shall be required
before final approval of any municipal actions on public as well
as private lands, streets, easements and rights-of-way within
the Historic District or listed in the Historic Sites Inventory of
the Master Plan. This requirement shall be deemed to include
any action by any party which requires the approval or
concurrence of the municipality or any municipal agency and
§ 112-6 HAZARDOUS MATERIALS § 112-6
111:271
§ 112-7. Standards, design guidelines and criteria.
The purpose of this section is to provide uniform standards, design
guidelines and criteria for the regulations of the Historic District for use by
the Historic Preservation Commission. All projects requiring a certificate of
historic review and all applications for development in the Historic District
shall be guided by the principles of the Secretary of the Interior's Standards
for Rehabilitation of Historic Buildings.
which is not otherwise covered by the provisions of this
chapter.
(b) In those circumstances where the municipality cannot require
compliance, as in certain cases involving the county, state and
federal governments, the Borough urges, most strongly, the
voluntary cooperation of such agencies in seeking a certificate
of historic review and hereby authorizes the Commission to
consider such requests and applications. This does not relieve
the property owner from complying with applicable state and
federal regulations regarding historic preservation.
A. Secretary of Interior's Standards. In carrying out all of its duties and
responsibilities, the Commission shall be guided by the Secretary of the
Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation of Historic Buildings which are
as follows:
(1) Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible use
for a property which requires minimal alteration of the building,
structure or site and its environment or to use a property for its
originally intended purpose.
(2) The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building,
structure or site and its environment shall not be destroyed. The
removal or alteration of any historic material or distinctive
architectural features should be avoided when possible.
(3) All buildings, structures and sites shall be recognized as products
of their own time. Alterations that have no historical basis and
which seek to create an earlier appearance shall be discouraged.
(4) Changes which may have taken place in the course of time are
evidence of the history and development of a building, structure or
site and its environment. These changes may have acquired
significance in their own right, and this significance shall be
recognized and respected.
(5) Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship
which characterize a building, a structure or site shall be treated
with sensitivity.
(6) Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than
replaced wherever possible. In the event that replacement is
§ 112-6 MADISON CODE § 112-7
111:272
necessary, the new material should match the material being
replaced in composition, design, color, texture and other visual
qualities. Repair or replacement of missing architectural features
shall be substantiated by historic, physical or pictorial evidence
rather than on conjectural design or the availability of different
architectural elements from other buildings or structures.
(7) The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the
gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods
that will damage the historic building materials shall not be
undertaken.
(8) Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve
archeological resources affected by or adjacent to any project.
(9) Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing
properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and
additions do not destroy significant historical, architectural or
cultural material and such design is compatible with the size, scale,
color, material and character of the property, neighborhood or
environment.
(10) Wherever possible, new additions or alterations to structures shall
be done in such a manner that if such additions or alterations were
to be removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the
structure would be unimpaired.
B. Visual compatibility factors. In assessing the design of any proposed
additions or new construction, the following visual compatibility factors
shall be considered in conjunction with the Secretary of Interior's
Standards set forth above by the Historic Preservation Commission.
(1) Height. The height of the proposed building shall be visually
compatible with adjacent buildings.
(2) Proportion of building's front facade. The relationship of the width
of the building to the height of the front elevation shall be visually
compatible with buildings and places to which it is visually related.
(3) Proportion of openings within the facility. The relationship of the
width of windows to the height of windows in a building shall be
visually compatible with the buildings and places to which it is
visually related.
(4) Rhythm of solids to voids in front facades. The relationship of solids
to voids in the front facade of a building shall be visually
compatible with the buildings and places to which it is visually
related.
(5) Rhythm of spacing of buildings on streets. The relationship of the
building to the open space between it and adjoining buildings shall
§ 112-7 HAZARDOUS MATERIALS § 112-7
111:273
be visually compatible with the buildings and places to which it is
visually related.
(6) Rhythm of entrance and/or porch projections. The relationship of
entrance and porch projections to the street shall be visually
compatible with the buildings and places to which it is visually
related.
(7) Relationship of materials, texture and color. The relationship of
materials, texture and color of the facade and roof of a building
shall be visually compatible with the predominant materials used in
the buildings to which it is visually related.
(8) Roof shapes. The roof shape of a building shall be visually
compatible with buildings to which it is visually related.
(9) Walls of continuity. Appurtenances of a building, such as walls,
open-type fencing and evergreen landscape masses, shall form
cohesive walls of enclosure along a street to the extent necessary
to maintain visual compatibility of the building with the buildings
and places to which it is visually related.
(10) Scale of building. The size of a building, its mass in relation to open
spaces and its windows, door openings, porches and balconies shall
be visually compatible with the buildings and places to which it is
visually related.
(11) Directional expression of front elevation. A building shall be
visually compatible with buildings and places to which it is visually
related in its directional character, whether this be vertical
character, horizontal character or nondirectional character.
(12) Exterior features. A building's related exterior features, such as
lighting, fences, signs, sidewalks, driveways and parking areas,
shall be compatible with the features of those buildings and places
to which it is visually related and shall be appropriate for the
historic period for which the building is significant.
C. Madison design guidelines for the Civic Commercial District; intent.
(1) In assessing change in the exterior appearance of any building,
improvement, site, place or structure by addition, reconstruction,
alteration or maintenance, the Commission's deliberations shall be
guided by the Madison Design Guidelines for the Civic Commercial
District, which are adopted as an appendix to this chapter and
which are incorporated by reference, and shall be considered in
conjunction with the Secretary of Interior's Standards set forth
above by the Historic Preservation Commission.
(2) It is not the intent of this chapter to discourage contemporary
architectural expression or to encourage new construction which
emulates existing buildings of historic or architectural style but
§ 112-7 MADISON CODE § 112-7
111:274
§ 112-8. Demolition.
rather to preserve the integrity and authenticity of the historic
preservation districts and to ensure the compatibility of new
structures therein.
A. As set forth in § 112-6A(1) hereinabove, a certificate of historic review
and compliance is required for the demolition of any building,
improvement, site, place or structure.
B. Criteria. In regard to an application to demolish or move an historic
building, site, place or structure, the following matters shall be
considered:
(1) Its historic, architectural, cultural and aesthetic significance in
relation to the criteria of § 112-4B.
(2) Its current and potential use for those purposes currently
permitted by the Zoning Ordinance or for the use proposed.
(3) Its importance to the municipality and the extent to which its
historical or architectural value is such that its removal would be
detrimental to the public interest.
(4) The extent to which it is of such old, unusual or uncommon design,
craftsmanship, texture or material that it could not be reproduced
or could be reproduced only with great difficulty.
(5) The extent to which its retention would increase property values,
promote business, create positions, attract tourists, students,
writers, historian, artists and artisans, attract new residents,
encourage study and interest in American history, stimulate
interest and study in architecture, educate citizens in American
culture and heritage or make the municipality a more attractive
and desirable place to live.
(6) The probable impact of its removal upon the ambiance of the
historic district.
(7) The structural soundness and integrity of the building and the
economic feasibility of restoring or rehabilitating the structure so
as to comply with the requirements of the applicable building
codes.
(8) The compelling reasons for not retaining the structure or
improvement at its present site, the proximity of the proposed new
location and its accessibility to residents of the municipality and
the probability of significant damage to the structure or
improvement as a result of the relocation.
(9) The compatibility, nature and character of the current and the
proposed surrounding areas as they relate to the intent and
purposes of this chapter and whether the proposed new location is
§ 112-7 HAZARDOUS MATERIALS § 112-8
111:275
visually compatible in accordance with the standards set forth
herein.
(10) A discussion with the applicant regarding applicant's consent to
the removal and reuse of certain important features of the historic
building or structure.
C. Procedure.
(1) Applications for a demolition permit must be made to the Building
Construction Official. For all properties within the Historic District,
a copy of the application will be forwarded to the Historic
Preservation Commission within 15 days of receipt of the complete
demolition application by the Building Code Official.
(2) When considering applications for demolition permits, the
Commission's report may contain mandatory conditions, in which
event the administrative officer shall include the conditions
contained in the certificate of historic review in any permit which is
issued.
(3) Applications for demolition shall include current and archival
photographs of the interior and exterior of the building and
drawings to document the condition of the building.
(4) The Commission's review of a demolition application may take up
to 45 days from receipt of completed application, just as in the case
of a development application.
(5) Demolition notice posting and publication. Notice of proposed
demolition shall be posted on the premises of the building, place or
structure in a location that is clearly readable from the street. In
addition, the applicant shall publish a notice in the official
newspaper of the Borough within 10 days of an application for a
demolition permit.
(6) Review of application.
(a) The Historic Preservation Commission will review the
application for demolition based on the criteria outlined above.
Its report may:
[1] Approve demolition without conditions.
[2] Stipulate conditions, including but not limited to
documentation of the building prior to demolition and/or
confirmation of applicant's consent to the removal and
reuse of certain important features of the historic building
or structure.
[3] In the event that the Commission disapproves an
application to demolish an historic building, place or
structure, the owner shall, nevertheless, as a matter of
§ 112-8 MADISON CODE § 112-8
111:276
§ 112-9. Enforcement.
It shall be the duty of all municipal officials reviewing all permit applications
involving real property or improvements thereon to determine whether such
application involves any activity which should also be the subject of an
application for a certificate of historic review. If it should, the officer shall
inform both the administrative officer and the applicant, as well as the
Historic Preservation Commission.
§ 112-10. Violations, penalties and injunctive relief.
right, be entitled to raze or demolish such building, place
or structure, provided that all of the other demolition
requirements of the Borough have been fully met.
(7) All new construction on the site of a building demolished within the
Historic District is subject to mandatory review by the Historic
Preservation Commission. The new construction shall be in the
character of the Madison Civic Commercial Historic District, and
all comments of the Commission in these circumstances are
binding upon the applicant. The certificate of historic review will be
issued only when the Historic Preservation Commission is satisfied
that the facades of the replacement structure meets all the criteria
of the Design Guidelines deemed applicable and fits appropriately
within the Historic District.
(8) When a certificate of historic review has been issued, the
administrative officer or his appointee shall, from time to time,
inspect the work approved by such certificate and shall regularly
report to the Commission the results of such inspections, listing all
work inspected and reporting any work not in accordance with
such certificate.
A. Violations.
(1) If any person shall undertake any activity regarding an historic site
or improvement within an historic district without first having
obtained and posted a certificate of historic review, such person
shall be deemed to be in violation of this chapter.
(2) Upon learning of the violation, the Zoning Officer shall personally
serve upon the owner of the lot whereon the violation is occurring a
notice describing the violation in detail and giving the owner 10
days to abate the violation by seeking review of the extent and
proposed work by the Historic Preservation Commission.
(3) If the owner cannot be personally served within the municipality
with said notice, a copy shall be posted on site and a copy sent by
certified mail, return receipt requested, to the owner at the last
known address as it appears on the municipal tax rolls.

acquisition between open space and improvements, it may do so and
charge the Open Space Trust Fund for the approximate value that it
deems appropriate relative to open space and the Borough's capital

§ 145-2. Findings and declaration of policy.
It is hereby found and declared that there exist in the Borough structures

future substandard with respect to structure, equipment or maintenance
or further that such conditions, including but not limited to structural
deterioration, lack of maintenance and appearance of exterior of premises,
infestation, lack of essential heating, plumbing, storage or refrigeration
equipment, lack of maintenance or upkeep of essential utilities and
facilities, existence of fire hazards, inadequate provisions for light and
air, unsanitary conditions and overcrowding, constitute a menace to the
health, safety, morals, welfare and reasonable comfort of the citizens and
inhabitants of the Borough. It is further found and declared that by reason
of lack of maintenance and because of progressive deterioration, certain
properties have the further effect of creating blighting conditions and
initiating slums and that, if the same are not curtailed and removed, the
aforesaid conditions will grow and spread and will necessitate in time
the expenditure of large amounts of public funds to correct and eliminate
the same, and that by reason of timely regulations and restrictions as
herein contained, the creation and growth of slums and blight may be
prevented and the neighborhood and property values thereby maintained,
the desirability and amenities of residential and nonresidential uses and
neighborhoods enhanced and the public health, safety and welfare
protected and fostered.
§ 145-3. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to protect the public health, safety, morals
and welfare by establishing minimum standards governing the
maintenance, appearance, condition and occupancy of residential and
nonresidential premises; to establish minimum standards governing
utilities, facilities and other physical components and conditions essential
to make the aforesaid facilities fit for human habitation, occupancy and
use; to fix certain responsibilities and duties upon owners and operators
and distinct and separate responsibilities and duties upon occupants; to
authorize and establish procedures for the inspection of residential and
nonresidential premises; to fix penalties for the violation of this code; and
to provide for the repair, demolition or vacation of premises unfit for human
habitation or occupancy or use.

SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIER  "Significant noncomplier," "significant
noncompliance" or "SNC" means any person who commits any of the
violations described below, unless the NJDEP uses, on a case-by-case basis,
a more stringent frequency or factor of exceedance to determine a
significant noncomplier and the NJDEP states the specific reasons therefor,
which may include the potential for harm to human health or the
environment.
Violations which cause a person to become or remain an SNC under the
state definition of "significant noncomplier" include:
A serious violation for the same pollutant, at the same discharge
point source, in any two months of any consecutive six-month
period;
(1)
Exceedance of an effluent limitation expressed as a monthly
average for the same pollutant, at the same discharge point source,
by any amount in any four months of any consecutive six-month
period;

over a twenty-four-hour period, or any other time span, as deemed
necessary by the NJDEP, to meet the requirements of a specific
situation.
B. Whenever it shall be necessary for the purpose of these general sewer
use requirements, authorized representatives of the MCJM, NJDEP,
USEPA or other governmental authorities having jurisdiction may, upon
presentation of credentials, enter upon the premises of any user as
follows:
(1) During business hours, on notice to authorized personnel of the
user, but without the necessity of a warrant, for the purposes of
inspecting, copying or photographing any records required to be
kept.
(2) At any time without a warrant or prior notice for the purpose of
installing or inspecting any monitoring equipment or method,
inspecting the process wastewater pretreatment facility, and/or
measuring, sampling and/or testing any discharge of wastewater
either from process wastewater pretreatment facilities or the point
of discharge to the MCJM wastewater facilities or wastewater
treatment works. The user shall instruct security personnel to
provide immediate access to such representatives upon
presentation of valid credentials at any hour and under any and all
circumstances. The user's security personnel will be entitled to
accompany the entering representatives.

§ 155-8.4. Emergency suspensions.
§ 155-8.5. Affirmative defenses to general prohibitions. [Added
9-24-2007 by Ord. No. 62-2007]
A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought
against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in § 155-8, if it
can prove that it did not know or have reason to know that its discharge,
alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause
pass-through or cause interference and that either:
operation. Payment for such expenses shall be made by the user within
10 days after the submission of an invoice by the MCJM.
A. Upon advance notice to the Borough Administrator and the Health
Officer, the Superintendent of the MCJM may immediately suspend a
user's discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such
suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge
which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or
substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. Upon
advance notice to the Borough Administrator and the Health Officer,
the Superintendent of the MCJM may also immediately suspend a user's
discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to
interfere with the operation of the POTW, which presents or may
present an endangerment to the environment, or for noncompliance
with pretreatment standards and requirements.
B. Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop
or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to
immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, and upon
advance notice to the Borough Administrator and the Health Officer,
the Superintendent may take such steps as deemed necessary,
including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or
minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment
to any individuals. The Superintendent of the MCJM and/or the NJDEP
may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has
demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Superintendent and/or the
NJDEP that the period of endangerment has passed.
A. A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in
compliance with each limit directly prior to and during the passthrough
or interference; or
B. No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in
nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the MCJM
was regularly in compliance with its NJPDES permit and, in the case of
interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal
requirements.

§ 155-8.6. Notification of changed conditions.
Each user must notify the Superintendent of the MCJM, and obtain prior
written approval, at least 10 days in advance of any planned significant
changes to the user's operations or system which might alter the nature,
quality, or volume of its wastewater, or result in the user meeting the
definition of "significant indirect user" established at N.J.A.C. 7:14A-1.2,
or of any substantial change in the volume or character of pollutants in
their discharge. The MCJM reserves the right to deny or condition new or
increased contributions of pollutants, or changes in the nature of pollutants,
where such contributions do not meet applicable pretreatment standards
and requirements or where such contributions would cause the MCJM to
violate its NJPDES permit.
§ 155-8.7. Notification of slug discharges. [Added 9-24-2007 by Ord.
No. 62-2007]
§ 155-8.8. Notification of significant indirect user status.
The MCJM shall notify the NJDEP at least annually which facilities within
the sewer service area meet the definition of "significant indirect user" as
set forth at N.J.A.C. 7:14A-1.2. The MCJM may use a variety of sources to
identify SIUs, including but not limited to user surveys, existing MCJM files,
A. The Superintendent may require the user to submit such information as
may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition.
B. For purposes of this requirement, significant changes include, but are
not limited to, flow increases of 20% or greater and the discharge of any
previously unreported pollutants.
A. An industrial user shall immediately notify the MCJM of any incident of
accidental or slug discharge. The notification shall include the location

of the waters of the state or other malfunction and the system cannot be
reasonably rehabilitated, an exemption may be granted.
G. If the application for the exemption is a request to allow the connection
of a proposed project which is publicly owned or operated, including
but not limited to a long-term health-care facility which has received a
certification of need from the New Jersey Department of Health, a
school, hospital, fire or police station or senior citizen housing, an
exemption may be granted, if there exists a sufficient public need for
the proposed project and there are no other reasonable alternatives
available, including alternative sites.

existing sewer connection, the proposed project is exempt only if the
building, structure or unit with the existing connection was in use at the

category and that all connections are banned unless they meet one of
the other categories outlined in this section.

housing owned or operated by nonprofit organizations incorporated
pursuant to N.J.S.A. 55:141-1 et seq. for the purpose of providing

The purpose and intent of this article is to provide procedures and
requirements pursuant to which all sewage collection and treatment costs
of the Borough of Madison, including operating and capital costs of the
collection system operated by the Borough and the Borough's share of
the cost of the treatment facility operated by the Madison-Chatham Joint
Meeting, shall be funded by a combination of ad valorem taxes and sewer
use charges applicable to tax-exempt properties which use sewer services
provided by the Borough, with the amount of the sewer use charges and the
amount of funds to be provided by ad valorem taxes to be established in a
manner which equitably allocates costs among all users of sewer services in
approximate proportion to usage.

§ 155-18.1. Surcharge for illegal connections. [Added 6-12-1989 by
Ord. No. 17-8995]

connected with and served by the sanitary sewer system operated by
the Borough of Madison and which does not contribute toward the cost
of providing such sewer services through the payment of ad valorem
taxes shall be subject to a sewer use charge. Said charge shall also be
applied to any real property subject to a payment-in-lieu-of-taxes
(PILOT) financial agreement with the Borough of Madison pursuant to
N.J.S.A. 40A:12A-1 et seq. [Amended 6-25-2012 by Ord. No.
10-2012]
B. The sewer use charge shall be billed at a rate of $0.0520 per cubic foot
of water consumed, which rate has been calculated and established
based on equitable allocation of costs of providing sewer services to all
users of sewer services on the basis of water consumption, subject to
certain accounting allowances and adjustments. [Amended 4-10-1989
by Ord. No. 10-89; 12-10-2007 by Ord. No. 77-2007; 4-13-2009 by

§ 155-20. Unpaid charges to become liens.
Unpaid sewer use charges shall be a lien upon the real property to which
they relate. If any sewer service bill shall remain in arrears for six months
or more from the due date thereof, the officer or employee charged with
the duty of collection thereof may file with the Tax Collector a statement
showing the arrearages, and, from the time of such filing, said amount shall
become a lien upon the real property to which sewer service was furnished
and in connection with which the charges were incurred, to the same extent
as taxes are a lien upon real property in the Borough, and shall be collected
and enforced by the same officers and in the same manner as liens for taxes.
§ 155-21. Severability.
Each section of this article and every part of each section is an independent

to be unconstitutional, void or ineffective for any cause shall not be deemed
to affect the validity or constitutionality of any other section or part thereof.

of water consumed during the quarter of the year in which the illegal
connection is identified and in any subsequent quarter until the illegal
connection has been eliminated. The sewer service surcharge fee shall
be included as a separate charge on the quarterly water bill sent to the
property owners, and the owner shall be responsible for payment in
accordance with the procedures and requirements in Chapter 190 of
the Borough Code. Notwithstanding this billing procedure, the sewer
service surcharge fee shall be deemed to constitute a charge for sewer
use for accounting purposes and for purposes of § 155-20, which
provides for unpaid charges to be a lien upon the real property.
A. The owner of each parcel of land containing a building or structure
connected to and served by the sewer system and which is subject to
the sewer use charge provided for in § 155-18 shall be billed for the
sewer service provided by the Borough on a quarterly basis. [Amended

TREE PROTECTION
§ 178-1. Findings of fact.
The Borough Council finds that indiscriminate, uncontrolled and excessive
destruction and removal of trees upon lots and tracts of land within the
Borough of Madison will cause increased drainage control costs, increased
soil erosion and sedimentation, decreased fertility of the soil, degradation
of water resources, decreased groundwater recharge, increased buildup
of atmospheric carbon dioxide, the establishment of a heat island effect
and increased dust and pollution. The singular or cumulative effect of any
of the foregoing could adversely impact the character of the Borough,
decrease property values, render the land unfit and unsuitable for its most
appropriate use, and negatively affect the health, safety and general welfare
of the Borough's residents.
§ 178-2. Purpose.
The Governing Body desires to regulate and control indiscriminate and
excessive removal of trees within the Borough and to require appropriate
tree replacement.

a charge as set forth in § 190-33 will be made for the test. Meters found
to be defective or out of order during the course of such tests will be
replaced or repaired, and the test fee will be waived. Water charges for
the quarter in which the meter is found to be defective or out of order
shall be based on the water consumed during the same quarter the
previous year or on an average of the meter readings for the four
quarters preceding that in which the meter was found to be defective or
out of order, whichever is greater. The customer is responsible for
maintaining adequate access to the meter as well as maintaining the

report as requested by the Borough within 60 days of request
by the Borough will result in a penalty being assessed of up to
$100 per day. The Borough reserves the right to demand that
the customer replace the meter with a different design or type
approved by the Borough if the Borough deems the current meter
is not appropriate for the current use based on accepted industry
standards. Valves that permit water to bypass the meter shall be
affixed with a Borough seal to ensure that said valve has not been
used without permission of the Borough of Madison. Removal or
tampering of the seal without the permission of the Borough shall
result in a penalty of $750 per offense.
(2) If any such test reveals defects, the customer shall make the
repairs as requested by the Borough within 60 calendar days.

§ 195-8. Planning Board.
A. Establishment of Planning Board.
(1) The Madison Planning Board, created pursuant to N.J.S.A.
40:55D-23 et seq., shall consist of nine members of the following
four classes:
(a) Class I: the Mayor.
(b) Class II: One of the officials of the municipality, other than a
member of the governing body, to be appointed by the Mayor,
provided that, if there is a Madison Borough Environmental
Commission (herein referred to as the "Environmental
Commission"), the member of the Environmental Commission
who is also a member of the Planning Board, as required by
N.J.S.A. 40:56A-1, shall be deemed to be the Class II Planning
Board member for the purposes of this chapter in the event
that there is among the Class IV or alternate members of the
Planning Board both a member of the Zoning Board of
Adjustment and a member of the Board of Education.
(c) Class III: a member of the Borough Council to be appointed by
the Borough Council.
(d) Class IV members: six other citizens of the municipality to be
appointed by the Mayor. The members of Class IV shall hold no
other municipal office, except that one member may be a
member of the Board of Adjustment. One Class IV member may
be a member of the Board of Education. If there is an
Environmental Commission, the member of the Environmental
Commission who is also a member of the Planning Board, as
required by N.J.S.A. 40:56A-1, shall be a Class IV Planning
Board member unless there are among Class IV members of
the Planning Board both a member of the Zoning Board of
Adjustment and a member of the Board of Education, in which
case the member common to the Planning Board and the
Environmental Commission shall be deemed a Class II member
of the Planning Board. For the purpose of this section,
membership on a municipal board or commission whose
function is advisory in nature, the establishment of which is
discretionary and not required by statute, shall not be
considered the holding of municipal office.
§ 195-8 WATER EMERGENCIES § 195-8
191:665
(2) Terms. The term of the member composing Class I shall correspond
to his or her official tenure as Mayor. The terms of the members
composing Class II and Class III shall be for one year or terminate
at the completion of their respective terms of office, whichever
occurs first, except for a Class II member who is also a member of
the Environmental Commission. The term of a Class II or Class IV
member who is also a member of the Environmental Commission
shall be for three years or terminate at the completion of his or her
term of office as a member of the Environmental Commission,
whichever comes first. The term of a Class IV member who is also a
member of the Board of Adjustment or Board of Education shall
terminate whenever he is no longer a member of such other body or
at the completion of his or her Class IV term, whichever occurs
first. The term of all other Class IV members shall be four years. If a
vacancy in any class shall occur otherwise than by expiration of the
Planning Board term, it shall be filled by appointment, as above
provided, for the unexpired term.
(3) Substitute members when conflict exists. If the Planning Board
lacks a quorum because any of its members are prohibited by
N.J.S.A. 40:55D-23 or N.J.S.A. 40:55D-23.1 from acting on a matter
due to the member's personal or financial interest, regular
members of the Board of Adjustment shall be called upon to serve,
for that matter only, as temporary members of the Planning Board
in order of seniority of continuous service to the Board of
Adjustment until there are the minimum number of members
necessary to constitute a quorum to act upon the matter without
any personal or financial interest. If a choice has to be made
between regular members of equal seniority, the Chairperson of the
Board of Adjustment shall make the choice.
(4) The Planning Board shall organize annually by selecting from
among its Class IV members a Chairperson and a Vice Chairperson.
The Board shall also select a Secretary, who may or may not be a
member of the Board or a municipal employee, and create and fill
such other offices as established by ordinance.
(5) The governing body shall make provisions in its budget and
appropriate funds for the expenses of the Planning Board.
(6) The Planning Board may annually appoint an attorney at law of
New Jersey other than the Municipal Attorney as Planning Board
Attorney and may fix his or her compensation or rate of
compensation not exceeding the amount appropriated.
(7) The Planning Board may also employ or contract for and fix the
compensation of such experts and other staff and services as it may
deem necessary. The Board, however, shall not authorize
expenditures which exceed, exclusive of gifts or grants, the amount
appropriated by the governing body for its use.
§ 195-8 MADISON CODE § 195-8
191:666
(8) No member of the Planning Board shall be permitted to act on any
matter in which there is any personal or financial interest, either
directly or indirectly. Any member other than a Class I member,
after a public hearing, if requested, may be removed by the
governing body for cause.

requesting approval of the variance or direction of the issuance
of a permit and a subsequent application for any required
approval of a subdivision, site plan or conditional use. The
separate approval of the variances or direction of the issuance
of a permit shall be conditioned upon the grant of all required
subsequent approvals by the Planning Board. No such
subsequent approval shall be granted unless the approval can
be granted without substantial detriment to the public good
and without substantial impairment of the intent and purpose
of the zone plan and Zoning Ordinance.
(2) Time periods.

approval of the application within 120 days after submission by
an applicant of a complete application to the administrative

administrative officer as to the failure of the Planning Board to
act shall be issued on request of the applicant. It shall be
sufficient in lieu of the written endorsement or other evidence
of approval, herein required, and shall be so accepted by the
county recording officer for purposes of filing subdivision plats.

the Planning Board shall condition any approval that it grants
upon timely receipt of a favorable report on the application by
the County Planning Board or approval by the County Planning

Board deems appropriate. The Borough Council, when considering
the adoption of a development regulation, revision or amendment
thereto, shall review the report of the Planning Board and may
disapprove or change any recommendation by a vote of a majority
of its full authorized membership and shall record in its minutes the

requirements of this subsection in regard to the proposed
development regulation, revision or amendment referred to the
Planning Board. Nothing in this section shall be construed as
diminishing the application of the provisions of N.J.S.A. 40:55D-32

N.J.S.A. 40:55D-62 to any Zoning Ordinance or any amendment or

Council fails to confirm a nomination, then the appointment shall
be made by the Borough Council by the vote of a majority of the
§ 195-8 WATER EMERGENCIES § 195-9
191:669
members present at the meeting, provided that at least three
affirmative votes shall be required, with the Mayor to have no vote
thereon except in the case of a tie. All persons so appointed shall
serve for terms of four years from January 1 of the year of their
appointment.
(2) Alternate members shall be appointed for terms of two years and at
the time of their appointments shall be designated Alternate No. 1
and Alternate No. 2, respectively. Alternate members may
participate in discussions of the proceedings but may not vote
except in the absence or disqualification of a regular member. A
vote shall not be delayed in order that a regular member may vote
instead of alternate member. In the event that a choice must be
made as to which alternate member is to vote, Alternate No. 1 shall
vote.
(3) No member of the Board of Adjustment shall hold any elective
office or position under the municipality. For the purpose of this
section, membership on a municipal board or commission whose
function is advisory in nature, the establishment of which is
discretionary and not required by statute, shall not be considered
the holding of municipal office.
(4) No member of the Board of Adjustment shall be permitted to act on
any matter in which he/she has, either directly or indirectly, any
personal or financial interest.
(5) A member, after a public hearing, if requested, may be removed by
the governing body for cause. A vacancy occurring otherwise than
by expiration of term shall be filled for the unexpired term only.
(6) The Board of Adjustment shall annually elect a Chairperson and
Vice Chairperson from its members and a Secretary who may or
may not be a member of the Board or a municipal employee.
(7) If the Board of Adjustment lacks a quorum because its regular or
alternate members are prohibited by N.J.S.A. 40:55D-69 from
acting on a matter due to the member's personal or financial
interest, Class IV members of the Planning Board shall be called
upon to serve, for that matter only, as temporary members of the
Board of Adjustment. The Class IV members of the Planning Board
shall be called upon to serve in order of seniority of continuous
service to the Planning Board until there are the minimum number
of members necessary to constitute a quorum to act upon the
matter without any personal or financial interest. If a choice has to
be made between Class IV members of equal seniority, the
Chairperson of the Planning Board shall make the choice.
(8) The governing body shall make provisions in its budget and
appropriate funds for the expenses of the Board of Adjustment.
§ 195-9 MADISON CODE § 195-9
191:670
(9) The Board of Adjustment may employ or contract for and fix the
compensation of legal counsel, other than the Municipal Attorney,
and experts and other staff services as it shall deem necessary, not
exceeding, exclusive of gifts and grants, the amount appropriated
by the Borough Council for its use.
B. Powers and jurisdiction of Zoning Board of Adjustment.
(1) The Board of Adjustment shall have the following powers:
(a) Appeals. Hear and decide appeals where it is alleged by the
appellant that there is an error in any order, requirement,
decision or refusal made by an administrative officer based on
or made in the enforcement of the Zoning Ordinance.
(b) Interpretations. Hear and decide requests for interpretation of
the Zoning Map or Ordinance or for decisions upon other
special questions upon which such Board is authorized to pass
by any Zoning or Official Map Ordinance in accordance with
N.J.S.A. 40:55D-1 et seq.
(c) Variances.
[1] Where, by reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness
or shape of a specific piece of property, or by reason of
exceptional topographic conditions or physical features
uniquely affecting a specific piece of property, or by reason
of an extraordinary and exceptional situation uniquely
affecting a specific piece of property or the structures
lawfully existing thereon, the strict application of any
regulation pursuant to Article 8 of this Act,137 would result
in peculiar and exceptional practical difficulties to or
exceptional and undue hardship upon the developer of
such property, grant, upon an application or an appeal
relating to such property, a variance from such strict
application of such regulation so as to relieve such
difficulties or hardship; or
[2] Where, in an application or appeal relating to a specific
piece of property, the purposes of this Act would be
advanced by a deviation from the Zoning Ordinance
requirements and the benefits of the deviation would
substantially outweigh any detriment, grant a variance to
allow departure from regulations pursuant to Article 8 of
this Act,138 provided, however, that the fact that a
proposed use is an inherently beneficial use shall not be
dispositive of a decision on a variance under this
subsection, and provided that no variance from those
departures enumerated in Subsection B(1)(d) of this
137. Editor's Note: See N.J.S.A. 40:55D-62 et seq.
138. Editor's Note: See N.J.S.A. 40:55D-62 et seq.
§ 195-9 WATER EMERGENCIES § 195-9
191:671
section shall be granted under this subsection; and
provided, further, that the proposed development does not
require approval by the Planning Board of a subdivision,
site plan or conditional use in conjunction with which the
Planning Board has the power to review a request for a
variance pursuant to Subsection a of § 47 of this Act.139
(d) Use variances. In particular cases and for special reasons,
grant a variance to allow departure from regulations pursuant
to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-62 et seq. to permit a use or principal
structure in a district restricted against such use or principal
structure; an expansion of a nonconforming use; deviation
from a specification or standard pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-67
pertaining solely to a conditional use; an increase in the
permitted floor area ratio as defined in N.J.S.A. 40:55D-4; an
increase in the permitted density as defined in N.J.S.A.
40:55D-4 except as applied to the required lot area for a lot or
lots for detached one- or two-dwelling unit buildings which lot
or lots are either an isolated undersized lot or lots resulting
from a minor subdivision; or a height of a principal structure
which exceeds by 10 feet or 10% the maximum height
permitted in the district for a principal structure. A variance
under this subsection shall be granted only by affirmative vote
of at least five members.
(e) If an application for development requests one or more
variances but not a variance for a purpose enumerated in
Subsection B(1)(d) of this section, the decision on the
requested variance or variances shall be rendered under
Subsection B(1)(c) of this section.
(f) No variance or other relief may be granted under the terms of
this section unless such variance or other relief can be granted
without substantial detriment to the public good and will not
substantially impair the intent and the purpose of the zone plan
and zoning ordinance.
(g) An application under this section may be referred to any
appropriate person or agency for its report, provided that such
reference shall not extend the period of time within which the
Zoning Board of Adjustment shall act.
(2) The Zoning Board of Adjustment shall have such other powers:
(a) To direct issuance of a permit pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-34
for a building or structure in the bed of a mapped street or
public drainageway, flood control basin or public area reserved
pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-32.
139. Editor's Note: See N.J.S.A. 40:55D-60, Subdivision a.
§ 195-9 MADISON CODE § 195-9
191:672
(b) To direct issuance of a permit pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-36
for a building or structure not related to a street.
(c) To grant, to the same extent and subject to the same
restrictions as the Planning Board, subdivision or site plan
approval pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-37 et seq. or conditional
use approval pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-67 whenever the
proposed development requires approval by the Board of
Adjustment of a variance pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70d. The
developer may elect to submit a separate application
requesting approval of the variance and a subsequent
application for any required approval of a subdivision, site plan
or conditional use. The separate approval of the variance shall
be conditioned upon grant of all required subsequent
approvals of a site plan or subdivision by the Board of
Adjustment. No such subsequent approval shall be granted
unless such approval can be granted without substantial
impairment to the public good and without substantial
impairment to the intent and purpose of the zone plan and
Zoning Ordinance. The number of votes of Board members
required to grant any such subsequent approval shall be as
otherwise provided in this chapter for the approval in question,
and the special vote pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70d shall not
be required.
(d) Whenever an application for development requests relief
pursuant to Subsection B(2)(c) of this section, the Board of
Adjustment shall grant or deny approval of the application
within 120 days after submission by a developer of a complete
application to the administrative officer or within such further
time as may be consented to by the applicant. In the event that
the developer elects to submit separate consecutive
applications, the aforesaid provision shall apply to the
application for approval of the variance. The period for
granting or denying any subsequent approval shall be as
otherwise required in N.J.S.A. 40:55D-1 et seq. Failure of the
Board of Adjustment to act within the period prescribed shall
constitute approval of the application, and a certificate of the
administrative officer as to the failure of the Board of
Adjustment to act shall be issued on request of the applicant. It
shall be sufficient in lieu of the written endorsement or other
evidence of approval herein required and shall be so accepted
by the county recording officer for purposes of filing
subdivision plats.
(3) Whenever review or approval of the application by the County
Planning Board is required by N.J.S.A. 40:27-6.3 in the case of a
subdivision, or N.J.S.A. 40:27-6.6 in the case of a site plan, the
Board of Adjustment shall condition any approval that it grants
upon timely receipt of a favorable report on the application by the
§ 195-9 WATER EMERGENCIES § 195-9
191:673
County Planning Board or approval by the County Planning Board
by its failure to report thereon within the required time.
C. Annual report on variances heard by Zoning Board of Adjustment. The
Board of Adjustment shall, at least once a year, review its decisions on
applications and appeals for variances and prepare and adopt by
resolution a report of its findings on Zoning Ordinance provisions which
were the subject of variance requests and its recommendations for
Zoning Ordinance amendment or revision, if any. The Board of
Adjustment shall send copies of the report and resolution to the
governing body and Planning Board.
D. Appeals and applications to Zoning Board of Adjustment.
(1) Appeals to the Board of Adjustment may be taken by any interested
party affected by any decision of an official of Madison based on or
made in the enforcement of the Zoning Ordinance or Official Map.
Such appeal shall be taken within 20 days by filing a notice of
appeal with the official from whom the appeal is taken, with three
copies of the notice given to the Secretary of the Board of
Adjustment. The notice shall specify the grounds for the appeal.
The official from whom the appeal is taken shall immediately
transmit to the Board all the papers constituting the record upon
which the action appealed from was taken.
(2) A developer may file an application for development with the Board
of Adjustment for action under any of its powers without prior
application to an administrative officer.
(3) The Board may reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or may modify
the action, order, requirement, decision, interpretation or
determination appealed from and to that end have all powers of the
municipal official from whom the appeal is taken.
(4) An appeal to the Board of Adjustment shall stay all proceedings in
furtherance of the action in respect to which the decision appealed
from was made unless the municipal official from whose action the
appeal is taken certifies to the Board, after the notice of appeal
shall have been filed with him, that by reason of facts stated in the
certificate, a stay would, in, his opinion, cause imminent peril to life
or property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed other
than by an order of the Superior Court of New Jersey upon notice to
the municipal official from whom the appeal is taken and on due
cause shown.
(5) If, in the case of an appeal made pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70, the
Board of Adjustment determines there is an error in any order,
requirement, decision or refusal made by the administrative officer
pursuant to a report submitted by the Historic Preservation
Commission or Planning Board in accordance with N.J.S.A.
40:55D-111, the Board of Adjustment shall include the reasons for
its determination in the findings of its decision.

day period or within such further time as may be consented
to by the applicant shall constitute a decision favorable to the
applicant.

the Zoning Ordinance or Official Zoning Map shall be submitted in

by proof that no taxes or assessments for local improvements are
due or delinquent on the property which is the subject of such
application, or, if it is shown that taxes or assessments are
delinquent on said property, any approvals or other relief granted

191:676
(4) The officer presiding at the hearings or such person as he/she may

conclusions through:
[a] A resolution adopted at a meeting held within the time
period provided in the act for action by the municipal
board on the application for development; or
[b] A memorializing resolution adopted at a meeting held
not later than 45 days after the date of the meeting at
which the municipal board voted to grant or deny
approval. Only the members of the municipal board
who voted for the action taken may vote on the
memorializing resolution, and the vote of a majority of
such members present at the meeting at which the
resolution is presented for adoption shall be sufficient
to adopt the resolution. An action pursuant to N.J.S.A.
40:55D-9 resulting from the failure of a motion to
approve an application shall be memorialized by
resolution as provided above, with those members
voting against the motion for approval being the
§ 195-10 WATER EMERGENCIES § 195-10
191:677
members eligible to vote on the memorializing
resolution. The vote of any such resolution shall be
deemed to be a memorialization of the action of the
municipal board and not to be an action of the
municipal board; however, the date of the adoption of
the resolution shall constitute the date of the decision
for purposes of the mailings, filings and publications
required by this section.
[2] If the municipal board fails to adopt a resolution or
memorializing resolution as hereinabove specified, any
interested party may apply to the Superior Court in a
summary manner for an order compelling the municipal
board to reduce its findings and conclusions to writing
within a stated time, and the cost of the application,
including attorney's fees, shall be assessed against the
municipality.
(b) A copy of the decision shall be mailed by the municipal board
within 10 days of the date of decision to the applicant or, if
represented, then to his or her attorney, without separate
charge, and to all who request a copy of the decision for a
reasonable fee. A copy of the decision shall also be filed by the
municipal board in the office of the administrative officer. The
administrative officer shall make a copy of such filed decision
available to any interested party for a reasonable fee and
available for public inspection at his or her office during
reasonable hours.
(c) A brief notice of the decision shall be published in the official
newspaper of the municipality. Such publication shall be
arranged by the Secretary of the Planning Board or Zoning
Board of Adjustment, as the case may be, provided that nothing
contained in this chapter shall be construed as preventing the
applicant from arranging such publication if he/she so desires.
The municipality may make a reasonable charge for its
publication. The period of time in which an appeal of the
decision may be made shall run from the first publication of the
decision, whether arranged by the municipality or the
applicant.
C. Notice of applications.
(1) Public notice of a hearing on an application for development shall
be given, except for:

such list.

subdivision or court of competent jurisdiction to protect the public
health or welfare and the developer is otherwise ready, willing and able
to proceed with said development, the running of the period of approval
under this section shall be suspended for the period of time said local
action is pending or such directive or order is in effect.
G. Time extensions. The Board and an applicant may mutually agree to
extend the time limit specified for action. Such extension shall be made
§ 195-10 WATER EMERGENCIES § 195-10
191:681
in writing or verbally at a public meeting of the Board for a specific
period of time and indicated in the minutes of the meeting.
H. Expiration of variance. Any variance from the terms of this chapter
hereafter granted by either Board permitting the erection or alteration
of any structure or structures or permitting a specified use of any
premises shall expire by limitation unless such construction or
alteration shall have been actually commenced on each and every
structure permitted by said variance, or unless such permitted use has
actually been commenced, within two years from the date of publication
of the notice of the judgment or determination of the Board; except,
however, that the running of the period of limitation herein provided
shall be tolled from the date of filing an appeal from the decision of the
Board to the governing body or to a court of competent jurisdiction,
until the termination in any manner of such appeal or proceeding.
I. Appeal or petition in certain cases to the Board of Public Utility
Commissioners.
(1) If a public utility, as defined in N.J.S.A. 48:2-13, is aggrieved by the
action of a municipal board through said agency's exercise of its
powers under this Act, with respect to any action in which the
public utility has an interest, an appeal to the Board of Public
Utility Commissioners of the State of New Jersey may be taken
within 35 days after such action without appeal to the municipal
governing body pursuant to § 8 (N.J.S.A. 40:55D-17) of this Act
unless such public utility so chooses. In such case appeal to the
Public Utility Commissioners may be taken within 35 days after
action by the governing body. A hearing on the appeal of a public
utility to the Public Utility Commissioners shall be had on notice to
the agency from which the appeal is taken and to all parties
primarily concerned, all of whom shall be afforded an opportunity
to be heard. If, after such hearing, the Board of Public Utility
Commissioners shall find that the present or proposed use by the
public utility of the land described in the petition is necessary for
the service, convenience or welfare of the public, the public utility
may proceed in accordance with such decision of the Board of
Public Utility Commissioners, any ordinance or regulation made
under the authority of this Act notwithstanding.
(2) This chapter shall not apply to a development proposed by a public
utility for installation in more than one municipality for the
furnishing of service if, upon a petition of the public utility, the
Board of Public Utility Commissioners shall after hearing, of which
any municipalities affected shall have notice, decide the proposed
installation of the development in question is reasonably necessary
for the service, convenience or welfare of the public.
(3) Nothing in this Act shall be construed to restrict the right of any
interested party to obtain a review of the action of the municipal

191:682
§ 195-11. Appeal to governing body.
board or of the Board of Public Utility Commissioners by any court
of competent jurisdiction according to law.
A. Any interested party may appeal to the Borough Council any final
decision of the Board of Adjustment approving an application for
development pursuant to Subsection d of N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70. Such
appeal shall be made within 10 days of the date of publication of such
final decision pursuant to Subsection i of N.J.S.A. 40:55D-10. The appeal
to the Borough Council shall be made by serving the Borough Clerk in
person or by certified mail with a notice of appeal, specifying the
grounds thereof and the name and address of the appellant and the
name and address of his or her attorney, if represented. Such appeal
shall be decided by the Borough Council only upon the record
established before the Board of Adjustment.
B. Notice of the meeting to review the record below shall be given by the
Borough Council by personal service or certified mail to the appellant,
to those entitled to notice of a decision pursuant to Subsection h of
N.J.S.A. 40:55D-10 and to the Board from which the appeal is taken, at
least 10 days prior to the date of the meeting. The parties may submit
oral and written argument on the record at such meeting, and the
Borough Council shall provide for verbatim recording and transcripts of
such meeting pursuant to Subsection f of N.J.S.A. 40:55D-10.
C. The appellant shall:
(1) Within five days of service of the notice of the appeal pursuant to
Subsection A hereof, arrange for a transcript pursuant to
Subsection f of N.J.S.A. 40:55D-10 for use by the Borough Council
and pay a deposit of $50 or the estimated cost of such transcript,
whichever is less; or
(2) Within 35 days of service of the notice of appeal, submit a
transcript as otherwise arranged to the Borough Clerk; otherwise,
the appeal may be dismissed for failure to prosecute.
D. The Borough Council shall conclude a review of the record below not
later than 95 days from the publication of the notice of the decision
below pursuant to Subsection i of N.J.S.A. 40:55D-10, unless the
applicant consents in writing to an extension of such period. Failure of
the Borough Council to hold a hearing and conclude a review of the
record below and to render a decision within such specified period shall
constitute a decision affirming the action of the Board.
E. The Borough Council may reverse, remand or affirm, with or without
the imposition of conditions, the final decision of the Board of
Adjustment approving a variance pursuant to Subsection d of N.J.S.A.
40:55D-70. The review shall be made on the record before the Board of
Adjustment.
§ 195-10 WATER EMERGENCIES § 195-11

§ 195-12. Fees.
Fees for applications or for the rendering of any services by the Planning
Board or the Zoning Board of Adjustment or any member of their
administrative staffs shall be as provided in the Fee Ordinance of Madison
Borough.
F. The affirmative vote of a majority of the full authorized membership of
the Borough Council shall be necessary to reverse or remand to the
Board of Adjustment or to impose conditions on or alter conditions to
any final action of the Board of Adjustment. Otherwise the final action
of the Board of Adjustment shall be deemed to be affirmed; a tie vote of
the Borough Council shall constitute affirmance of the decision of the
Board of Adjustment.
G. An appeal to the Borough Council shall stay all proceedings in
furtherance of the action in respect to which the decision appealed from
was made, unless the Board from whose action the appeal is taken
certifies to the Borough Council, after the notice of appeal shall have
been filed with the Board, that by reason of facts stated in the
certificate, a stay would, in its opinion, cause imminent peril to life or
property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed other than by an
order of the Superior Court on application upon notice to the Board
from whom the appeal is taken and on good cause shown.
H. The Borough Council shall mail a copy of the decision to the appellant
or, if represented, then to his attorney, without separate charge, and for
a reasonable charge to any interested party who has requested it, not
later than 10 days after the date of the decision. A brief notice of the
decision shall be published in the official newspaper of the municipality,
if there be one, or in a newspaper of general circulation in the
municipality. Such publication shall be arranged by the applicant unless
a particular Borough officer is so designated by ordinance, provided
that nothing contained herein shall be construed as preventing the
applicant from arranging such publication if he so desires. The Borough
Council may make a reasonable charge for its publication. The period of
time in which an appeal to a court of competent jurisdiction may be
made shall run from the first publication, whether arranged by the
Borough or the applicant.
A. Application fees. At the time of filing any application for development,
any application for amendment to or extension of any development

B. Technical review fees.
(1) Components of fee. Each applicant shall pay to the Borough of
Madison a technical review fee in connection with each application
for development, each application for amendment to or extension
of any development approval, any request for a zone change or
recommendation of a zone change, any request for amendment of
the Master Plan, and/or any request for concept review of a
development proposal. All such requests are included in this
Subsection B with the term "application." The technical review fee
shall be equal to the sum of the following two components:
(a) The dollar amount of all charges by outside professionals (as
defined herein) for professional services rendered to the
Borough and/or the reviewing board in connection with the
application, plus all actual out-of-pocket disbursements
incurred in regard to such services. All charges for services by
each outside professional shall be billed at the same rate as all
other work of the same nature performed by such professional
for the Borough when fees are not reimbursed or otherwise
imposed on an applicant. Charges for professional services of
outside professionals shall be based upon a schedule of fees
§ 195-12 MADISON CODE § 195-12
191:686
established by resolution of the reviewing board, in the case
of professionals retained by the board, and by resolution of
the Borough Council, in the case of professionals retained by
the Borough. Such schedules shall be subject to revision from
time to time in the discretion of the reviewing board and/or the
Borough Council, as the case may be.
(b) The dollar amount of the hourly base salary of each in-house
professional (as defined herein) who has rendered professional
services to the Borough and/or the reviewing board in
connection with the application, multiplied by both the total
number of hours of professional services spent by each inhouse
professional in connection with the application, and
200%. The hourly base salary of each in-house professional
shall be established by ordinance annually.
(2) Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms shall have
the meanings indicated:
IN-HOUSE PROFESSIONAL  Engineers, planners, attorneys and
other professionals whose salary, staff support and overhead are
provided by the Borough of Madison.
OUTSIDE PROFESSIONALS  Engineers, planners, attorneys and
other professionals whose salary, staff support and overhead are
not provided by the Borough of Madison. "Outside professionals"
shall include, without limitation, consultants who are not normally
utilized by the Borough or the reviewing board when an application
presents issues which are beyond the scope of the expertise of
the professionals who normally serve the reviewing board or the
Borough.
PROFESSIONAL SERVICES  Time spent by a professional
engineer, professional planner, attorney, traffic expert or other
professional in connection with review of an application and/or
review and preparation of documents in regard to such application.
In appropriate cases, such services shall include, without
limitation, review of plans, reports, relevant ordinance provisions,
statutory law, case law and prior approvals for the same parcel;
site inspections; and preparation of resolutions, developer's
agreements and other documents.
(3) Limitations on scope of charges for professional services.
(a) All charges for professional services shall be reasonable and
necessary given the status and progress of the application.
Such charges shall be made only in connection with:
[1] An application which is presently pending before a
reviewing board;
[2] Review of an applicant's compliance with conditions of
approval; and/or
§ 195-12 WATER EMERGENCIES § 195-12
191:687
[3] Review of an applicant's request for modification or
amendment of an application or approval.
(b) A professional shall not review items which are subject to
approval by a state governmental agency and which are not
under municipal jurisdiction, except to the extent that
consultation with a state agency is necessary due to the effect
of a state approval on the applicant's application.
(c) If the Borough or the reviewing board shall retain a different
professional in place of the professional originally responsible
for review of an application, the Borough or the reviewing
board, as the case may be, shall be responsible for all time and
expenses of the new professional to become familiar with the
application. Neither the Borough nor the reviewing board shall
charge the applicant or the applicant's technical review fee
deposit for such services.
(d) Neither the Borough nor the reviewing board shall bill an
applicant, or charge the applicant's technical review fee
deposit, for any municipal clerical or administrative functions,
overhead expenses, meeting room charges or other municipal
costs and expenses, except as provided for in this § 195-12, nor
shall any professional add any such charges to his or her bill.
(4) Payment of technical review fee deposits. At the time of filing any
application with the Planning Board or Board of Adjustment, each
applicant shall pay a technical review fee deposit, or deposits, in
accordance with the following schedule. The applicant shall pay the

§ 195-12 WATER EMERGENCIES § 195-12
191:689
(a) All technical review fee deposits shall be placed into an escrow
account, which account shall be maintained by the Chief
Financial Officer of the Borough of Madison. The Chief
Financial Officer shall make all payments for the escrow
account.
(b) All payments charged to an applicant's technical review fee
deposit shall be pursuant to vouchers from the professionals
performing professional services in connection with the
application. All vouchers shall identify the professional
performing the services, the dates when services were
performed, the hours spent to one-quarter-hour increments,
the hourly rate and the expenses incurred.
(c) All outside professionals shall submit vouchers to the Chief
Financial Officer on a monthly basis. A copy of the voucher
shall be sent to the applicant simultaneously. All in-house
professionals shall submit to the Chief Financial Officer on a
monthly basis a statement containing the same information as
the voucher of an outside professional. A copy of the statement
shall be sent to the applicant simultaneously.
(d) The Chief Financial Officer shall prepare, and send to the
applicant on a monthly basis a statement providing an
accounting of the applicant's technical review fee deposits. The
accounting shall include all deposits made, interest earned,
disbursements made and cumulative deposit balance.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if monthly charges to an
applicant's deposit are $1,000 or less, such statement may be
provided by the Chief Financial Officer on a quarterly basis.
(6) Replenishing of deposit.
(a) If a technical review deposit shall be insufficient to enable the
Borough or the reviewing board to perform required
application reviews, the Chief Financial Officer shall notify the
applicant (this notice is referred to herein as an "insufficiency
notice") of both the insufficient deposit balance and the
amount of additional funds required, in the judgment of the
Chief Financial Officer, to cure the insufficiency. In order for
work to continue on the application, the applicant shall, within
a reasonable time period post additional funds to the escrow
account in an amount to be agreed upon by the Borough
(acting through its Chief Financial Officer) and the applicant.
(b) The determination of insufficiency shall be made by the Chief
Financial Officer in his or her reasonable discretion.
Furthermore, as used herein, a "reasonable time period" for
the posting of additional funds to the escrow account shall be
not longer than 15 days after the date of the Chief Financial
Officer's insufficiency notice. The applicant shall be deemed to
§ 195-12 MADISON CODE § 195-12
191:690
agree to the terms of the insufficiency notice unless, within 15
days after the date of such notice, the applicant shall deliver to
the Chief Financial Officer a written notice of objection.
(c) If the applicant timely files such an objection, the applicant
shall have the right to pay the amount requested under protest
and the right to challenge same in the Superior Court, Law
Division, in an action in lieu of prerogative writs filed within 45
days after the applicant's receipt of the Chief Financial
Officer's final accounting with respect to the applicant s
technical review fee deposit.
(d) If the applicant fails to timely pay (under protest or otherwise)
the amount requested, the Borough, the reviewing board and
all professionals shall have the right to cease all further work
on the application immediately, and the reviewing board shall
have the right to deny without prejudice any pending
application, because of the applicant's failure to post additional
technical review fees needed for the proper review of such
application. In no event shall any approved plans be signed or
delivered to the applicant, nor shall any construction permits,
certificates of occupancy or other approvals or authorizations
be issued to an applicant when there exists any deficiency in
the applicant's technical review fee deposit.
(7) Final accounting; return of unused balance of deposit. After the
reviewing board has granted final approval and signed the
approved subdivision plat or site plan, or otherwise taken final
action on the application, the applicant shall provide written notice
of the same, by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by
personal delivery, to the Chief Financial Officer, the reviewing
board and all professionals who have rendered services in
connection with the application. Within 30 days after receipt of
such notice, each professional shall submit a final bill (or a
statement in lieu of bill in the case of in-house professionals) to the
Chief Financial Officer with a copy to the applicant. The Chief
Financial Officer shall render to the applicant a final accounting
within 45 days after receipt of all final bills and/or statements. The
Chief Financial Officer shall return to the applicant with the final
accounting any unused balance of the deposit, including any
interest earned thereon in accordance with Subsection E.
C. Transcript fees. Each applicant shall be required to reimburse the
Borough of Madison for its actual costs for the preparation of a
transcript of all hearings on any site plan application, major subdivision
application, application for amendment to the Master Plan or appeal to
the Borough Council of decisions by the Board of Adjustment. Fifty
percent of the estimated cost of the transcript shall be deposited at the
time the transcript is ordered.
§ 195-12 WATER EMERGENCIES § 195-12
191:691
D. Special meeting fees. A fee of $1,500 shall be charged to the applicant
for any special meeting of the Planning Board or Board of Adjustment
held at the request of the applicant to hear and/or decide any site plan
application, major subdivision application, application for amendment
of the Master Plan or any other matter. Nothing herein shall obligate
any board to hold a special meeting on any application for development.
E. Deposits with the Borough; escrow accounts; interest.
(1) Whenever an amount of money in excess of $5,000 shall be
deposited by an applicant with the Borough for technical review fee
deposits, for inspection fees or to satisfy the requirement for any
performance guaranty or the requirement for any maintenance
guaranty pursuant to this chapter, such money, until repaid or
applied for the purposes for which it was deposited, including the
applicant's portion of the interest earned thereon, shall continue to
be the property of the applicant and shall be held in trust by the
Borough, except as otherwise provided for in this section.
(2) The Borough shall deposit such money in a banking institution or
savings and loan association located in the State of New Jersey and
insured by an agency of the federal government or in any other
fund or depository approved for such deposits by the State of New
Jersey. Such moneys shall be maintained in an account bearing
interest at the minimum rate currently paid by such institution or
depository on time or savings deposits.
(3) The Borough shall notify the applicant in writing of the name and
address of the institution or depository in which such deposit is
made and the amount of the deposit. The Borough shall not be
required to refund an amount of interest paid on a deposit which
does not exceed $100 for the year. If the amount of interest exceeds
$100 for any year, that entire amount shall belong to the applicant
and shall be refunded to the applicant by the Borough annually, or
at the time the deposit is repaid or applied to the purposes for
which it was deposited, as the case may be. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary above, the Borough may retain for
administrative expenses a sum equal to 33 1/3% of the annual
interest earned by such deposit. The amount so retained shall be in
lieu of all other administrative and custodial expenses charged by
the Borough in connection with the deposit.
F. Borough tree protection deposit. At the time of filing any application
with the Planning Board or Board of Adjustment, each applicant shall
pay a deposit to protect Borough trees, as such trees are defined in the
Shade Tree Management Board Ordinance, Chapter 45 of the Madison
Borough Code. The deposit amount shall be $750 per Borough tree
which may be damaged during construction, and such deposit shall be
held in trust by the Borough in accordance with Chapter 195, § 195-12,
Subsection E. Such deposit may be applied by the Borough to remedy or
replace Borough trees damaged by the applicant, as determined by the
§ 195-12 MADISON CODE § 195-12
191:692

months from issuance of the C. O. to insure the Borough tree survives
the construction. Any balance will thereafter be returned to the
applicant. [Added 11-13-2017 by Ord. No. 43-2017]
A. No person shall be charged a construction permit surcharge fee or
enforcing agency fee for any construction, reconstruction, alteration or
improvement designed and undertaken solely to promote accessibility
by disabled persons to an existing public or private structure or any of
the facilities contained therein.
B. A disabled person, or a parent or a sibling of a disabled person, shall not
be required to pay any municipal fee or charge in order to secure a
construction permit for any construction, reconstruction, alteration or
improvement which promotes accessibility to his/her own living unit.
C. For the purposes of this section, "disabled person" means a person who
has the total and permanent inability to engage in any substantial
gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or
mental impairment, including blindness, and shall include, but not be
limited to, any resident of this state who is disabled pursuant to the

Retirement Act of 1974 (45 U.S.C. § 231 et seq.) or is rated as having a
60% disability or higher pursuant to any federal law administered by
the United States Veterans' Act. For purposes of this subsection,
"blindness" means central visual acuity of 20/200 or less in the better
eye with the use of a correcting lens. An eye which is accompanied by a
limitation in the fields of vision such that the widest diameter of the
visual field subtends an angle no greater than 20° shall be considered
as having a central visual acuity of 20/200 or less.
A. A corporation or partnership applying to the Planning Board, the Board
of Adjustment or the governing body for permission to subdivide a
parcel of land into six or more lots, or applying for a variance to

approval of a site to be used for commercial purposes shall list the
names and addresses of all stockholders or individual partners owning
at least 10 percent of its stock of any class or at least 10% of the
interest in the partnership, as the case may be.

corporation or interest of 10% or greater in a partnership, either of
which is subject to disclosure pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-48.2, that

improvements; and in the case of a site plan, any
requirements peculiar to site plan approval pursuant to
N.J.S.A. 40:55D-41, except that nothing herein shall be
construed to prevent the Borough from modifying by ordinance
such general terms and conditions of preliminary approval as
related to public health and safety.
(b) That the applicant may submit for final approval on or before
the expiration date of preliminary approval the whole or a
section or sections of the preliminary subdivision plat or site
plan, as the case may be.

§ 195-22 MADISON CODE § 195-22
191:716
appropriate Board to be reasonable taking into consideration

that the developer was barred or prevented, directly or
indirectly, from proceeding with the development because of
delays in obtaining legally required approvals from other
governmental entities and that the developer applied promptly
for and diligently pursued the required approvals. The
developer shall apply for the extension before what would
otherwise be the expiration date of the preliminary approval or
the 91st day after the developer received the last legally
required approval from other governmental entities, whichever
is later. An extension granted pursuant to this section shall not
preclude the Board from granting an extension pursuant to

plan, the reasons for disapproval shall be remedied prior to further
consideration.

approval and has duly recorded the plat with the county recording
officer, the Board may extend such period of protection for
extensions of one year but not to exceed three extensions.

before or after what would otherwise be the extension date.
(4) The Board shall grant an extension of final approval for a period
determined by the Board but not exceeding one year from what
would otherwise be the expiration date, if the developer proves to
the reasonable satisfaction of the Board that the developer was
barred or prevented, directly or indirectly, from proceeding with
the development because of delays in obtaining legally required
approvals from other governmental entities and that the developer
applied promptly for and diligently pursued these approvals. A
developer shall apply for an extension before what would otherwise

§ 195-23 MADISON CODE § 195-24
191:732
§ 195-24. General design standards.
In reviewing any application for development, the Board shall consider the
following standards. Where applicable, the residential site improvement
standards (RSIS), as amended from time to time, shall apply.
§ 195-24.1. Circulation.
§ 195-24.2. Design and building layout.
A. The Board shall consider pedestrian and vehicular traffic movement
within and adjacent to a lot or tract with particular emphasis on the
provision and layout of parking areas, off-street loading and unloading,
movement of people, goods and vehicles from access roads, within the
lot or tract, between buildings and between buildings and vehicles. In
site plans, the Board shall determine which roads shall be public and
which shall remain private.
B. The Board shall ensure that all parking areas are landscaped and
spaces are usable and are safely and conveniently arranged. Access to a
lot or tract from adjacent roads shall be designed so as to interfere as
little as possible with traffic flow and to permit vehicles a safe ingress to
and egress from the lot or tract.
C. The circulation plan of each development shall reflect the Master Plan's
circulation plan element. Private and public transit facilities shall be
clearly defined and delineated. Major access improvements in critical
environmental areas shall be discouraged. The location and provision of
bikeways, sidewalks and other pedestrian linkages shall be encouraged
and clearly indicated.
D. Applicants shall be encouraged to develop and implement mass transit
programs and to minimize the use of private automobiles wherever
possible. These programs may include the use of company buses to
connect tracts with rail and other public transit, use of vans, carpooling,
construction of bike paths and bike storage areas and
construction of convenient bus pickup and drop-off points. In order to
minimize peak-hour traffic impacts, applicants shall encourage
staggered starting and quitting times and changes in work hours where
appropriate and include the details within the application to the Board.
A. The design and layout of buildings and parking areas shall be
aesthetically pleasing and provide for efficient arrangement. Particular
attention shall be given to energy conservation, safety and fire
protection and impact on surrounding development. Architectural
design shall be compatible with the environmental and natural
characteristics of the tract and the surrounding neighborhood.
B. In order to promote the general welfare and with a view of encouraging
the most appropriate use of land throughout the Borough of Madison,
no permit shall be issued by the Construction Official for the
§ 195-24 WATER EMERGENCIES § 195-24.2
191:733
construction or alteration of a building, structure or addition thereto, or
for any use of land when such construction or use will adversely affect
the use and enjoyment of adjacent or nearby property or the health and
welfare of residents in the Borough.
C. Fire escapes shall be constructed only against the side or rear wall of a
building and shall be located and/or screened so as not to detract from
the appearance of such buildings.
D. Layout of a single-family or multifamily dwelling not requiring Board
approval shall still be required to submit an individual lot grading plan
to the Borough Engineer for purposes of calculating building height and
compliance with other standards regarding general protection and
welfare of the public. The plan must include information concerning
grades, building location, building height, first-floor elevation, coverage
and such other information as may be required, not limited to decks,
driveways, patios, walls, drainage, drywells, accessory structures,
equipment, screening, etc.
E. Guidelines for development in the GVRSU District, Sub-Zone II. [Added
12-13-2010 by Ord. No. 57-2010]
(1) Purpose and intent.
(a) The purpose of these standards and guidelines is to ensure that
all development within the district gives due consideration to
the historic, physical, visual and spatial character and scale of
the area in which it is located.
(b) These standards and guidelines are intended to preserve and
enhance the district's unique setting and context, to maintain
or improve upon pedestrian access and circulation, and to
guide and encourage rehabilitation and new construction that
is compatible with traditional form and scale.
(c) The physical, visual and spatial characteristics of the district
context shall be maintained and reinforced through the
consistent use of compatible urban design and architectural
design elements. Such elements shall relate the design
characteristics of an individual structure or development to
other existing and planned structures or developments in a
harmonious and integrated manner, resulting in a coherent
overall development pattern and streetscape.
(2) Applicability.
(a) These standards and guidelines shall be applicable to any
project requiring subdivision, variance and/or site plan
approval. The design standards and guidelines shall be applied
concomitantly with the applicable use and bulk regulations of
the district, as well as with other standards within this chapter.
Where the standards conflict, the more restrictive requirement
§ 195-24.2 MADISON CODE § 195-24.2
191:734
shall govern. These standards are not, however, a substitute
for any required review or approval by Madison's Historic
Preservation Commission in any historic district.
(b) The scope of the standards and guidelines includes exterior
aspects of the rehabilitation of existing structures, additions to
existing structures, and construction of new buildings, as well
as site design and improvements.
(c) These standards and guidelines shall be used by the reviewing
board in reviewing the materials provided as part of any site
plan, variance or subdivision approval request.
(3) Modifications and exceptions.
(a) Modifications or exceptions to the design guidelines and
standards contained in this section may be approved by the
Board, provided the applicant has met the criteria for
exceptions pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-51 and can provide
testimony that the resulting change will conform to all of the
following:
[1] Generally satisfy the purpose and intent of this section.
[2] Generally enhance the development plan.
[3] Generally enhance the streetscape and neighborhood.
(4) District design standards and guidelines.
(a) Context, continuity, massing and scale.
[1] Individual development plans shall be evaluated in relation
to the surrounding physical context, including the existing
design features of the streetscape or neighborhood.
[2] Individual development plans shall reflect a sense of
continuity with the dominant design features of their
physical context. Continuity can be achieved through
scale, through careful facade composition, (e.g.,
fenestration, cornice or soffit line, or floor-to-floor
elevation), through the use of related materials, through
site details (e.g., street trees, decorative lamp posts,
textured sidewalk) or by other means.
[3] In those cases where there is no consistent pattern of
streetscape or buildings abutting a development
application or where that pattern is inconsistent with
these guidelines, the applicant is encouraged to view its
application as an opportunity to establish the future
context for the area.
§ 195-24.2 WATER EMERGENCIES § 195-24.2
191:735
[4] Buildings located at the borders or edges of the district
shall mark the transition into and out of the district in a
distinct fashion, using massing, height extensions,
contrasting materials and/or architectural embellishments
to obtain this effect.
[5] Individual development plans shall be designed to
facilitate pedestrian circulation, both external and
internal, in particular between parking facilities and
sidewalks. Safe and attractive mid-block linkages are also
encouraged, as are barrier-free connections.
[6] Focal points, or points of visual termination, shall
generally be occupied by structures with distinctive
architectural treatments. Applicants may also submit
plans in which building voids or natural features, such as a
plaza or a park, act as points of visual termination.
[7] The layout, materials and details used in the treatment of
exterior spaces shall be selected to enhance their
immediate surroundings. Exterior spaces shall be
functional and provide visual and/or physical amenities for
their users, including, but not limited to, textured paving,
landscaping, lighting, street trees, benches, bicycle racks,
trash receptacles and other items of street furniture, as
appropriate.
[8] Structures shall be considered in terms of their
relationship to the height and massing of surrounding
structures, as well as in relation to the human scale.
Structures shall maintain an appropriate scale in relation
to neighboring structures and implement external
architectural details that maintain a human scale.
(b) Building orientation, design and architectural treatment.
[1] Orientation and spacing.
[a] Buildings' principal orientation shall be towards and
relate to public streets, both functionally and visually.
Buildings shall not be oriented to front parking lots.
[b] In a sequence of structures along a street, the spacing
between them (sidewall to sidewall) is an important
element in defining the observer's perception of
rhythm. New structures shall reflect the existing
rhythm or, in the absence of a clear rhythm, shall
better define it. In new development, a sequence of
structures shall seek to establish a spacing rhythm
that is related to the scale of the individual buildings,
their height, the composition of the facade and the
width of the street.
§ 195-24.2 MADISON CODE § 195-24.2
191:736
[2] Architectural style.
[a] A diversity of architectural styles adds interest to a
streetscape or district. No particular architectural
style is preferred outside of local historic districts, and
both contemporary contributions and
reinterpretations of older architectural styles with a
contemporary flavor may be acceptable. However, a
diversity of appearance in facades shall be
counterbalanced with continuity in massing, wall line,
verticality and spacing.
[b] In rehabilitations of older buildings in the district,
distinctive stylistic features or characteristic
examples of skilled craftsmanship shall be treated
with sensitivity. If deteriorated, these architectural
features shall be restored rather than replaced,
wherever possible. In the event replacement is
necessary, the new material shall match that being
replaced in composition, design, color, texture and

property line of the subject property shall not exceed 0.1
footcandle in a vertical plane on residentially zoned property.
(c) Outdoor light fixtures properly installed and thereafter
maintained shall be directed so that there will not be any direct
glare source visible from any property.
(3) Outdoor lighting energy conservation.
(a) All exterior lighting shall be designed so as not to exceed the
exterior lighting unit power allowances of ASHRAE/IESNA
Standard 90.1-2004, or the version currently adopted by the
New Jersey Department of Energy.
(b) All outdoor lighting not essential for safety and security
purposes or to illustrate changes in grade or material shall be

D. Lighting applications.
(1) Where used for roadways and parking lots and walkways or
security purposes.
(a) Average maintained illuminances shall not exceed IESNA
recommendations.
(b) Only outdoor enclosed light fixtures shielded from public view
and having the performance characteristics of a cutoff light
fixture shall be used.
§ 195-25.6 WATER EMERGENCIES § 195-25.6
191:755
(c) For parking lots, light poles that are visible to the public shall
not exceed 20 feet in height (base plus pole).
(d) For walkways and other pedestrian areas, light poles that are
visible to the public shall not exceed 12 feet in height (base
plus pole).
(e) Freestanding lights shall be so located and protected to avoid
being damaged by vehicles. Foundations supporting lighting
poles installed less than four feet behind the curb shall not be
less than 24 inches above the ground.
(f) The style of the light and light standards shall be consistent
with the architectural style of the principal building or
surrounding area.
(g) Floodlight-type fixtures attached to buildings shall be
prohibited.
(h) All wiring shall be laid underground.
(2) Where used for private, commercial and industrial purposes such
as in merchandise display areas, work areas, platforms, signs,
architectural, landscape or sports or recreational facilities:
(a) All light fixtures shall be equipped with automatic timing
devices and shall comply with the following.
(b) Externally illuminated signs, including building identification
or other similar illuminated signs, shall comply with the
following:
[1] Top-mounted light fixtures shall have illumination levels
plotted such that 100% of the beam angle used is not
greater than the size of the externally illuminated sign and
are preferred over any other positioned light fixtures.
[2] When top-mounted light fixtures are not feasible for good
cause shown, illumination from other positioned light
fixtures shall continue to be restricted to the sign area.
Visors or other directional control devices shall be used to
eliminate any spill light. Furthermore, when any signage is
viewed from the opposite side of that being illuminated,
luminous portions of light fixtures, and stray light, shall
not be visible.
[3] Detailed plans are to be provided to illustrate floodlight
distribution patterns. Once properly installed, the fixtures
are to be aimed, permanently affixed and maintained in the
approved position according to the terms of approval
outlined in the approving resolution.
§ 195-25.6 MADISON CODE § 195-25.6
191:756
(c) Outdoor light shall not be attached or mounted to public
property (i.e., public buildings, utility poles, telephone poles,
streetlights, road/street signs). Furthermore, these fixtures
shall not tap or extend power from sources servicing public
lighting and/or power devices. Temporary holiday lighting shall
be exempt.
(d) All outdoor lighting, during nonoperating hours of the business
on site, not necessary for safety and security purposes shall
have reduced light levels, activated by motion sensors,
photocells, timers or other lighting control devices, or be
turned off.
(3) Where used for sports and recreational lighting.
(a) Design considerations. Nighttime sports and recreational
lighting is proliferating and controls must be place to minimize
the negative impact on the community environment and to
minimize the utility power demand.
[1] Outdoor lighting systems. Outdoor lighting systems
primarily consist of direct distribution floodlights aimed at
the playing surface.
[a] Light sources. Metal halide (MH) high-intensity
discharge (HID) is the preferred source. Highpressure
sodium (HPS) should be used only in
conjunction with metal halide.
[b] Luminaires. General purpose or heavy duty luminaires
with full cutoff optical systems to provide superior
visibility for the players and to reduce off-site impacts.
[c] Poles. The location and height of poles have a major
impact on lighting system effectiveness and quality
and off-site impact. Contrary to public understanding,
the lower the mounting height, the higher the aiming
angle and the more light that is delivered off site. The
higher the pole (with limits), the lower the aiming
angle, and less light is delivered off site.
[d] Design factors. Outdoor lighting is generally visible
far beyond facility boundaries and careful
consideration should be given to:
[i] Spill light encroaching on neighboring properties.
[ii] Light that contributes to skyglow.
[iii] Durability of equipment and wiring subject to
continuous outdoor exposure.
[iv] Electrical power, voltage and system selection.
§ 195-25.6 WATER EMERGENCIES § 195-25.6
191:757
[v] Controls for multiple sports and energy
conservation.
(b) Standards. All outdoor sports and recreational lighting shall
comply with the following requirements:
[1] Only light fixtures shielded with internal and/or external
shields shall be used. The upper limit of the defined beam
should be no more than 80° above nadir and no more than
5% of the luminaires used should violate this rule.
[2] Illumination levels shall not exceed those recommended in
the IESNA Lighting Handbook, 9th Edition, as amended
from time to time, and IESNA publication RP-6-01
(reaffirmed 2009), Recommended Practice for Sports and
Recreational Area Lighting, as amended from time to time.
[3] Where used for sports or recreational facilities, all lighting
fixtures shall comply with the following:
[a] For field sports such as football, soccer, baseball and
track and field, a minimum pole height shall be 70 feet
and a maximum pole height shall be 85 feet.
[b] The minimum distance of the pole to any property line
shall be twice the height of the pole. For example, an
eighty-foot pole must be a minimum of 160 feet from
any property line.
[c] Trespass lighting shall not be more than 0.1
footcandle at any adjacent residential property line at
grade.
[d] A natural landscape buffer shall be required to
sufficiently screen the source of light and the lit object
from any adjacent residences. The buffer areas shall
consist of a planted berm with a mix of deciduous and
coniferous plants sufficient to provide year-round
screening and with plants at least six feet in height/2.5
DBH at time of planting.
[e] When not in use or, under any circumstance, not later
than 10:00 p.m., all lighting shall be turned off.
[4] Light fixtures properly installed and thereafter maintained
shall be directed so that there will not be any direct glare
source visible from any other property.

(1) Air pollution.
(a) General. No substance shall be emitted into the atmosphere in
quantities which are injurious to human, plant or animal life or
to property or which interferes unreasonably with the
comfortable enjoyment of life and property anywhere in the
Borough. All provisions of Title 7, Chapter 27 of the New Jersey
Administrative Code (N.J.A.C.), or the regulations contained in
this section, whichever shall be more stringent, shall apply.
(b) Smoke. In any nonresidential zone, no smoke, the shade or
appearance of which is darker than No. 1 on the Ringelmann
§ 195-26 WATER EMERGENCIES § 195-26
191:771
Smoke Chart, shall be emitted into the open air from any fuelburning
equipment; provided, however, that smoke emitted
during the cleaning of a firebox or the building of a new
fire, the shade or appearance of which is not darker than No.
2 on the Ringelmann Smoke Chart, may be permitted for a
period or periods aggregating no more than three minutes

the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection
(NJDEP). No liquid waste shall be discharged into the public
sewage collection and disposal system unless the appropriate
Borough official shall have first investigated the character and
volume of such wastes and shall have certified that the
Borough will accept the discharge of such waste material into
the system. The applicant shall comply with any requirements
of said officials, including the pretreating of such wastes, the
installation of processing methods, separation or screening of
wastes, control of pH and other methods of improving such
wastes prior to discharge, as a condition of approval of such
facilities.
(b) Solid waste. Each property owner shall be responsible for:
[1] Adequate and regular collection and removal of all refuse,

191:772
§ 195-27. Construction requirements.
(5) Glare. No single standard for glare is promulgated in this chapter
due to the impracticality of establishing such standards. It is the
intent of these performance standards to ensure that both direct
and indirect glare, to the extent possible, are eliminated or that
activities producing such glare are carried on within a structure.
Necessary glare-producing devices such as glazing, roadway and
walkway lighting shall be designed, constructed and maintained in
such a manner as not to be a nuisance to surrounding uses.
(6) Trespass lighting. All applications shall comply with the provisions
of this article.

the applicant has complied with all applicable Borough fire
prevention regulations.
A. Borough standards. All standards and specifications of the Borough as
now or hereafter adopted, if any, shall govern the design, construction
and installation of all required improvements. Failure of the developer,
his contractor or agent to conform to said specifications shall be just
cause for the suspension of the work being performed. No developer
shall have the right to demand or claim damages from the Borough, its
officers, agents or servants by reason of said suspension.
B. Other standards. In the event that the Borough has not adopted
standards for a specific type of improvement, then generally accepted
engineering standards, as set forth in current engineering and
construction manuals as may be approved and modified by the Borough
Engineer for a specific situation, shall be used.
C. Grades. All construction stakes and grades shall be set by or under the
supervision of a licensed land surveyor. One copy of all cut sheets shall
be filed with the Borough Engineer prior to the commencement of any
construction.
D. Approved plans. Prior to commencement of construction of required
improvements, the Borough Engineer shall have received and approved
§ 195-26 WATER EMERGENCIES § 195-27
191:773
the complete plans and profiles of all improvements to be installed or
constructed. No improvements shall be accepted by the governing body
and no performance guaranties released until the Borough Engineer
has received and approved drawings showing the plans, grades and
profiles of all improvements as finally constructed.

rubbish, brush, weeds, dead and dying trees, debris and excess or scrap
building materials shall be removed or destroyed immediately upon the
request of and to the satisfaction of the Construction Official prior to
issuing an occupancy permit. No such refuse shall be buried on the site.
G. Changes in elevation.
(1) No change shall be made in the elevation or contour of any lot or
site by the removal of earth to another lot or site other than as
shown on an approved preliminary plan.
(2) Minimal changes in elevation or contours necessitated by field
conditions may be made only after approval by the Borough
Engineer. All said changes shall be shown on the final plan and
indicated as a change from the preliminary, or if final approval has
been granted, all changes shall be shown on the as-built plans.
(3) Immediately following the installation of the foundation for any
new principal structure and prior to the commencement of the
framing of the building, a foundation location and elevation survey
shall be submitted to the Municipal Engineer, Zoning Officer and
Construction Official for purposes of establishing (a) compliance
with applicable zoning setback and yard requirements and (b)
compliance with the individual lot grading plan approved by the
municipality for the development. The survey shall show the
elevation of the top of the foundation wall at each corner of the
foundation wall with reference to the approved grade elevation and
building height and the horizontal dimensions and distances from
lot lines with reference to approved setback distances. Every
foundation survey shall be certified by a New Jersey licensed land
surveyor. [Added 3-11-2019 by Ord. No. 5-2019]
H. Excavations. No excavation shall be created or maintained, except
when required for the foundations of structures or in connection with
and during the installation of facilities for permitted uses. Such
excavation shall be used for the intended purpose or shall be refilled to
the average surrounding ground level, in such a manner as to prevent
the collection of water, erosion of earth or collapse or sliding of banks,

§ 195-28. Installation of improvements; required guarantees.
[Amended 3-26-2018 by Ord. No. 12-2018]
The following payments, contributions, and requirements shall be
applicable to all site plans and subdivisions in addition to other applicable
ordinances for any such development as follows:
within six months from the date of commencement of such excavation.
All open excavations of greater than four feet in depth shall be fully
encircled with durable and stable four-foot-high construction fence (or
six-foot-high chain link fence if required elsewhere in the Code due to
excavation depth or proximity to public facilities). Topsoils must have
an approved stockpile location. Subsoils can not function as screened,
well-graded organic topsoils. Subsoils can only be used for structural
backfills where suitable engineered properties can be demonstrated.
Tree root systems must be protected from grading cuts and fills. Excess
excavation subsoils must be removed from the site entirely in
conjunction with soil movement ordinances. Individual lot grading
plans are required wherever new grades are to be established on a
property. [Amended 10-23-2006 by Ord. No. 50-2006]
I. Topsoil removal. The applicant shall obtain all necessary permits.
J. Preconstruction meeting. Prior to the commencement of construction,
the developer shall arrange for and attend a preconstruction meeting in
conformance with the requirements of the Borough Engineer.

the issuance of a zoning permit pursuant to Subsection d of Section 52
of P.L. 1975, c.291 (N.J.S.A. 40:55D-65), the Borough will require and
shall accept in accordance with the standards adopted by ordinance
and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 1 of P.L. 1999, c.68
(N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53a) for the purpose of assuring the installation and
maintenance of certain on-tract improvements, the furnishing of a
performance guarantee and provision for a maintenance guarantee in
accordance with Subsection A(1) and (2) of this subsection. In
accordance with the Borough ordinance requiring a successor
developer to furnish a replacement performance guarantee, as a
condition to the approval of a permit update under the State Uniform
Construction Code, for the purpose of updating the name and address
of the owner of property on a construction permit, the governing body
may require and shall accept in accordance with the standards adopted
by ordinance and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 1 of P.L.
1999, c.68 (N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53a) for the purpose of assuring the
installation and maintenance of certain on-tract improvements, the
furnishing of a performance guarantee and provision for a maintenance
guarantee, in accordance with Subsection A(1) and (2) of this
subsection.
(1) Performance guarantee.
§ 195-27 WATER EMERGENCIES § 195-28
191:775
(a) The developer shall furnish a performance guarantee in favor
of the Borough in an amount not to exceed 120% of the cost of
installation of only those improvements required by an
approval or developer's agreement, ordinance, or regulation to
be dedicated to a public entity, and that have not yet been
installed, which cost shall be determined by the Borough
Engineer, according to the method of calculation set forth in
Section 15 of P.L. 1991, c.256 (N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.4), for the
following improvements as shown on the approved plans or
plat: streets, pavement, gutters, curbs, sidewalks,
streetlighting, street trees, surveyor's monuments, water
mains, sanitary sewers, drainage structures, public
improvements of open space, any grading necessitated by the
preceding improvements or as otherwise described in
§ 195-28.1 of the Borough ordinance. The Borough Engineer
shall prepare an itemized cost estimate of the improvements
covered by the performance guarantee, which itemized cost
estimate shall be appended to each performance guarantee
posted by the obligor.
(b) The Borough may also require a performance guarantee to
include, within an approved phase or section of a development
privately owned perimeter buffer landscaping, as required by
local ordinance or imposed as a condition of approval. At the
developer's option, a separate performance guarantee may be
posted for the privately owned perimeter buffer landscaping.
(c) In the event that the developer shall seek a temporary
certificate of occupancy for a development, unit, lot, building,
or phase of development, as a condition of the issuance
thereof, the developer shall furnish a separate guarantee,
referred to herein as a "temporary certificate of occupancy
guarantee," in favor of the municipality in an amount equal to
120% of the cost of installation of only those improvements or
items which remain to be completed or installed under the
terms of the temporary certificate of occupancy and which are
required to be installed or completed as a condition precedent
to the issuance of the permanent certificate of occupancy for
the development, unit, lot, building, or phase of development
and which are not covered by an existing performance
guarantee. Upon posting of a temporary certificate of
occupancy guarantee, all sums remaining under a performance
guarantee, required pursuant to Subsection A(1)(a) of this
section, which relate to the development, unit, lot, building, or
phase of development for which the temporary certificate of
occupancy is sought, shall be released. The scope and amount
of the temporary certificate of occupancy guarantee shall be
determined by the Zoning Officer, Municipal Engineer, or other
municipal official designated by ordinance. At no time will the
Borough hold more than one guarantee or bond of any type
§ 195-28 MADISON CODE § 195-28
191:776
with respect to the same line item. The temporary certificate of
occupancy guarantee shall be released by the Zoning Officer,
Municipal Engineer, or other municipal official designated by
ordinance upon the issuance of a permanent certificate of
occupancy with regard to the development, unit, lot, building,
or phase as to which the temporary certificate of occupancy
relates.
(d) Safety and stabilization guarantee.
[1] In addition to a performance guarantee required by the
Borough ordinance, a developer shall furnish to the
municipality a separate guarantee, referred to herein as a
"safety and stabilization guarantee," in favor of the
municipality, to be available to the municipality solely for
the purpose of returning property that has been disturbed
to a safe and stable condition or otherwise implementing
measures to protect the public from access to an unsafe or
unstable condition, only in the circumstance that:
[a] Site disturbance has commenced and, thereafter, all
work on the development has ceased for a period of at
least 60 consecutive days following such
commencement for reasons other than force majeure;
and
[b] Work has not recommenced within 30 days following
the provision of written notice by the Borough to the
developer of the Borough's intent to claim payment
under the guarantee. The Borough shall not provide
notice of its intent to claim payment under a safety
and stabilization guarantee until a period of at least 60
days has elapsed during which all work on the
development has ceased for reasons other than force
majeure. The Borough shall provide written notice to a
developer by certified mail or other form of delivery
providing evidence of receipt.
[2] The amount of a safety and stabilization guarantee for a
development with bonded improvements in an amount not
exceeding $100,000 shall be $5,000.
[3] The amount of a "safety and stabilization guarantee" for a
development with bonded improvements exceeding
$100,000 shall be calculated as a percentage of the
bonded improvement costs of the development or phase of
development as follows:
[a] $5,000 for the first $100,000 of bonded improvement
costs; plus
§ 195-28 WATER EMERGENCIES § 195-28
191:777
§ 195-28.1. Specific improvements to be constructed or installed.
[b] Two-and-one-half percent of bonded improvement
costs in excess of $100,000 up to $1,000,000; plus
[c] One percent of bonded improvement costs in excess of
$1,000,000.
(2) Maintenance guarantee.
(a) The developer shall post with the municipality, prior to the
release of a performance guarantee required pursuant to
Subsection A(1), Subsection A(2), or both Subsection A(1) and
(2) of this subsection, a maintenance guarantee in an amount
not to exceed 15% of the cost of the installation of the
improvements which are being released.
(b) If required, the developer shall post with the municipality,
upon the inspection and issuance of final approval of the
following private site improvements by the Municipal
Engineer, a maintenance guarantee in an amount not to exceed
15% of the cost of the installation of the following private site
improvements: stormwater management basins, inflow and
water quality structures within the basins, and the outflow
pipes and structures of the stormwater management system, if
any, which cost shall be determined according to the method of
calculation set forth in Section 15 of P.L. 1991, c.256 (N.J.S.A.
40:55D-53.4).
(c) The term of the maintenance guarantee shall be for a period
not to exceed two years and shall automatically expire at the
end of the established term.
(d) The Borough shall not require that a maintenance guarantee
required pursuant to this section be in cash or that more than
10% of a performance guarantee pursuant to this section be in
cash. A developer may, however, provide at his option some or
all of the maintenance guarantee in cash, or more than 10% of
a performance guarantee in cash (N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.3).
A. Stormwater. The on-site stormwater disposal system shall be in
accordance with this chapter.151

the Zoning Board of Adjustment.
§ 195-29.5. Conditional uses.
Notwithstanding compliance with specific conditional use standards
hereinafter set forth, conditional uses shall require site plan approval by the
appropriate board.
§ 195-30. Supplementary regulations.
A. The zone boundary lines are intended generally to follow street center
lines, existing lot lines, center lines of railroad rights-of-way,
waterways, sewer and utility easements or as otherwise indicated on
the Zoning Map. Where a zone boundary line does not coincide with any
such line as above set forth, its location or relation to another boundary
line shall be as designated on said Zoning Map by means of figures or
dimensions expressing distance in feet from a street side line or other
boundary line. In cases of uncertainty or disagreement as to the true
location of any zone boundary line, the determination thereof shall be
with the Board of Adjustment.
B. In the event that a zone boundary line divides one or more lots, then the
zone boundary line shall be considered the lot limit for computing all
area, bulk, yard buffer and any other dimension requirements specified
in this article.
A. No building or structure shall be erected and no existing building or
structure shall be moved, altered, added to or enlarged, nor shall any
land or building be designed, used or intended to be used for any
purpose or in any manner other than as specified among the uses listed
as permitted, accessory or conditional in the district in which such
building or land is located.
B. No building or structure shall be erected, restructured, or structurally
altered to exceed in height the limit designated in the district in which
such building or structure is located. [Amended 5-30-2018 by Ord.

improvements in Article IV, § 195-25.15 are hereby incorporated by
reference.)
C. No building or structure shall be erected, no existing buildings or
structures shall be altered, enlarged or rebuilt, nor shall any open
space surrounding any building be encroached upon or reduced in any
manner, except in conformity with the yard, lot area and building
location regulations hereinafter designated for the district in which
such building or open space is located.
D. The area or dimension of any lot, yard, parking area or other space shall
not be reduced to less than the minimum required by this article; and if
already less than the minimum required by this chapter, said area or
dimension shall not be further reduced.
E. Upon issuance of any demolition permit, the site grading, particularly
open foundation areas, shall be filled, stabilized and regraded within
one week after initiating said demolition work, weather permitting, in
such a manner as to prevent the collection of water, increase of erosion,
damage to shade tree root systems, or any slope-related hazards
associated with open excavation in residential areas. Alternatively,
demolition permits are not encouraged to be sought until all related
applications for permits under the local development regulations
(zoning, site, environmental or special regulated features) are
submitted as complete and approved. [Added 10-23-2006 by Ord.

(a) Permitted districts.
[1] A satellite earth station shall be permitted as an accessory
use in all zone districts. Satellite earth stations shall
require site plan approval from the Planning Board, except
where accessory to a one- or two-family residential use. In
the case of a one- or two-family residential use, the
application shall be determined by the Zoning Officer, or
by the Zoning Board of Adjustment whenever a request for
interpretation is necessary or variance is requested by the
applicant.
[2] Whenever an antenna is accessory to a one- or two-family
dwelling; whenever an applicant claims that any general
regulation standard must be modified because of inability
to obtain a reasonably satisfactory signal, impracticability,
under hardship or other criteria for modification or
whenever the adequacy of and/or reasonableness of
screening is in issue, such application shall be referred to
the Board of Adjustment for interpretation pursuant to
N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70b.
(b) Application. The plans of such antenna shall be submitted with
each application for a building permit, which shall include:
[1] A site plan drawn at a scale of no smaller than one inch
equals 20 feet indicating the diameter, location, setbacks,
and screening (if ground-mounted) and a mounting detail
drawn at a scale no smaller than 1/2 inch equals one foot
zero inches indicating height, color, style or type and
method of installation. The plans must be prepared by a
§ 195-30.5 MADISON CODE § 195-30.5
191:790
New Jersey professional engineer or other qualified expert
with a statement that the proposed installation complies
with the requirements of the Uniform Construction Code.
[2] The name and address of the applicant and owner of the
property on which the satellite earth station is to be
located.
[3] The tax lot and block numbers and the property lines of the
property.
[4] All existing buildings and structures and all accessory
buildings and structures on the property.
[5] Such other information as required by development
procedures of this chapter.154
[6] Applications for the installation of satellite earth stations
capable of transmitting and receiving signals will
additionally be required to submit a report prepared by a
radio frequency engineer. The minimum requirements of
this report are as follows:
[a] The calculated levels of electromagnetic field
intensities (EMP-power densities) compared to
allowable residential environment continuous
exposure to levels as per accepted industry standards.
[b] An analysis of the findings and conclusion.
[c] Copies of data, sketches and specifications which are
the basis for the calculations and analysis. The
conclusions shall include an assessment of relative
health risk to people living or working near the
proposed facility.
[7] If a ground-mounted transmit/receive-type antenna is
proposed, the site plan shall additionally include the
proposed location of a protective fence surrounding the
antenna on all sides necessary to address all health and
safety issues.
(c) Performance standards.
[1] No satellite earth station may be placed in the front yard of
any lot in the Borough. A corner lot shall be deemed to
have a front yard facing each street.
[2] Receive-only satellite earth stations 36 inches in diameter
or less shall be located on the roof. Receive-only satellite
earth stations greater than 36 inches in diameter shall be
154. Editor's Note: See Art. IV, Development Requirements and Standards.
§ 195-30.5 WATER EMERGENCIES § 195-30.5
191:791
placed on a lot only in the rear yard; provided, however,
that on a clear and convincing showing by an applicant
that a reasonably satisfactory signal cannot be obtained
from a rear yard location, the Board may permit the
antenna to be located in the side yard, and if such signal
cannot be obtained in either rear or side yard, the Board
may permit the antenna to be located on the roof of any
principal or accessory building on the lot.
[3] A transmit/receive satellite earth station shall be placed on
the roof of the principal building of the lot; provided,
however, that on a clear and convincing showing by an
applicant that this requirement is impracticable or would
cause undue hardship or that installation elsewhere would
substantially further the purposes and objectives of this
subsection without substantial adverse impact on
adjoining properties, the Board may permit the antenna to
be located in the rear yard of the lot. If a ground-mounted
transmit/receive-type antenna is proposed, the site plan
shall include the proposed location of a protective fence, a
minimum of four feet in height, surrounding the antenna
on all sides. The proposed fence shall be constructed in
accordance with Article IV of this chapter.
[4] No satellite earth stations shall be closer to the side
property line than a distance equal to the diameter of said
antenna or side yard setback requirement for the principal
structure on the lot, whichever results in the greatest
setback.
[5] No satellite earth stations shall be closer to the rear
property line than a distance equal to the diameter of said
antenna or rear yard setback requirement for the principal
structure on the lot, whichever results in the greatest
setback.
[6] When mounted on the ground, the overall height from the
surrounding ground level to the lowest point of the
antenna shall not exceed two feet, except in instances
where additional clearance is needed to satisfactorily
receive and/or transmit signals. No ground-mounted
satellite earth station shall exceed 12 feet in height, as
measured from the average grade of the base of the
antenna to the highest point of the antenna.
[7] Roof-mounted antennas.
[a] Flat roofs and mansard-style roofs. No roof-mounted
satellite earth station may extend above the roofline
more than nine feet six inches when mounted on a flat
roof or mansard-style roof. However, upon a showing
§ 195-30.5 MADISON CODE § 195-30.5
191:792
that such a roof-mounted antenna will not receive
adequate reception under the restrictions of this
subsection, the minimum height necessary for
reasonable satisfactory reception my be allowed. Roofmounted
antennas on a flat roof shall be located in the
center of the roof structure to reduce visibility.
[b] All other style roofs. No roof-mounted satellite earth
stations may extend above the highest point of the
roof more than three feet when mounted on all other
style roofs, and the roof-mounted satellite earth
station must be located on the portion of the roof
facing the rear yard or, if this would unreasonable
limit signal reception, the side yard. However, upon a
showing that such a roof-mounted antenna will not
receive adequate reception under the restrictions of
this subsection, the minimum height necessary for
reasonably satisfactory reception may be allowed.
[8] The diameter of satellite earth stations shall not exceed 12
feet for C-band technology for receiving and shall not
exceed eight feet in diameter for Ku-band V Sat technology
for transmitting, subject to Subsection D(4)(c)[7]. All
satellite earth stations shall be of the mesh-type only, with
not more than 85% of the surface being solid.
[9] All satellite earth stations shall be painted a solid, dark,
nonmetallic, non-glossy color if ground-mounted. Roofmounted
antennas mounted on a flat roof or mansard-style
roof shall be painted a solid, dark, nonmetallic, non-glossy
light to medium gray. When mounted on all other style
roofs, the satellite antenna shall be painted the color of the
surface to which it is attached.
[10] The ability of the applicant to install a satellite earth
station in an unobtrusive location and to minimize the
visual and health impacts on neighboring properties shall
be a major factor in determining whether or not a permit is
issued.
[11] The number of allowable satellite earth stations is as
follows:
[a] For single-family and two-family dwellings: one per
building.
[b] For attached dwellings, patio homes and duplex,
townhouse and multifamily dwellings: one per
building.
§ 195-30.5 WATER EMERGENCIES § 195-30.5
191:793
[c] For all other uses permitted in residential zones not
specifically provided for otherwise (e.g., schools,
churches, nursing, homes, etc.): one per building.
[12] The satellite earth station may only be used for occupants
of the building located on the property.
[13] When the use of a satellite earth station is abandoned it
shall be removed.
[14] Satellite earth stations may not be mounted on a portable
or movable structure, such as a trailer.
[15] To the extent permitted by law, no satellite earth station

[Amended 12-12-2005 by Ord. No. 53-2005]
158. Editor's Note: Former Subsection B(3), Residential cluster development, was repealed
12-12-2005 by Ord. No. 53-2005.
§ 195-32.2 MADISON CODE § 195-32.2
191:810
(1) Minimum tract size: 25 acres.
(2) Open space requirement. The following open space requirement
shall apply to any proposed development for single-family detached
dwellings:
(a) Amount. Except as provided for in § 195-32.2.F(5)(c) below, at
least 50% of any residential development tract shall be set
aside as permanently deed-restricted open space (as defined in
§ 195-5 of this chapter) for the benefit of the residents of the
development and/or general public. The open space calculation
shall not include any areas in individual residential lots and
areas devoted to public streets or rights-of-way.
(b) Location and suitability. The developer's open space proposal
shall be designed to preserve environmentally sensitive lands,
scenic features and existing outdoor recreational facilities and
shall further the purposes of this subsection. All open spaces
shall be located and sized in accordance with sound planning
and design principles. The Planning Board shall determine the
suitability of the open space proposal and in doing so shall
consider, among other factors, the relationship of the proposed
open space to its surroundings both within and outside of the
proposed development.
(c) The layout of the subdivision shall avoid and preserve historic
resources listed in the historic preservation element of the
Master Plan. The development shall incorporate creative
development techniques to conserve historic sites and
resources. The visual pattern of the historic resources on the
property and on adjoining properties shall be harmonized. New
construction shall strengthen the historic design features of
the property by, for example, framing views, enclosing open
space or continuing design features or statements. Historic
structures and resources shall be maintained within the
development and shall be designed with adequate buffers and
transition areas to preserve the integrity of the historic
structures.
(d) Structures built in open space areas. Any structure(s)
accessory to conservation open space (e.g., paths) may be
erected within the dedicated open space. These accessory
structures shall not exceed, in the aggregate, 1% of the
required open space area. A portion of the open space may also
be used for the construction of retention or detention facilities.
Easements shall be no larger than reasonably necessary, and
the Planning Board shall require reasonable assurances and
covenants that such facilities shall be maintained.
(e) Access to open space. Open space intended for use by the
public, if any, shall be easily accessible to pedestrians.
§ 195-32.2 WATER EMERGENCIES § 195-32.2
191:811
(f) Pedestrian walks. A portion of the open space may be used for
ways serving as pedestrian walks if such a use, in the opinion
of the Planning Board, enhances better site and community
planning and the general purpose of the RC Zone and if the
Planning Board finds that adequate assurances and covenants
exist to ensure proper maintenance of such walks.
(g) Dedication of open space and historic resources. The developer
may dedicate any open space and historic resources as
required by this section to the Borough of Madison, and the
Borough Council may accept such a dedication in its discretion.
(h) Restrictive covenant. The developer shall prepare a restrictive
covenant, which shall embody the open space and historic
preservation restrictions where such open space and historic
resources are not dedicated to the Borough of Madison. The
restrictive covenant shall be recorded simultaneously with the
subdivision plat and shall be referred to therein. The form and
substance of the restrictive covenant shall be appropriate to
accomplish the purposes of this section and shall be
satisfactory to the Planning Board and Borough Attorney.
(i) Homeowners' association. If the proposed open space and/or
historic resources are not dedicated to and accepted by the
Borough, the developer shall establish a homeowners'
association for the purpose of owning and maintaining the
common open space and/or the historic resources within the
development for the benefit of its residents. Membership in the
homeowners' association shall be mandatory for the owners of
all lots within the development. The homeowners' association
shall not be dissolved and shall not dispose of any open space
or historic resources without first offering to dedicate such
open space or historic resources to the Borough. In the event
that any homeowners' association organized pursuant to this
subsection fails to maintain its open space or historic
resources in reasonable order and condition, the Borough shall
have all rights and remedies provided by the Municipal Land
Use Law (N.J.S.A. 40:55D-43). The certification of
incorporation or other document creating the homeowners'
association shall be prepared by the developer and submitted
to the Borough Attorney for review and approval of form and
substance.
(3) Design standards.
(a) Yards. Front and side yards may be staggered to provide a
variety in the size of such yards.
(b) Common open space shall include irreplaceable natural
features located on the parcel, such as but not limited to stands
§ 195-32.2 MADISON CODE § 195-32.2
191:812
of trees, individual trees of significant size, steep slopes and
wetlands.
(c) Diversity and originality in lot layout and individual building
design shall be encouraged to achieve the best possible
relationship between development and the land.
(d) The construction of all roadways, interior streets, sidewalks,
curbing, street trees, stormwater control and utilities shall be
in accordance with the standards specified in the subdivision
regulations of this chapter. The Planning Board shall consider
allowing deviations from those sections of the subdivision
standards in the interest of good design if it determines that
adequate access will be provided to all lots in the development
by ways that will be safe and convenient for travel. While each
development proposal is unique, the Planning Board shall
consider allowing deviations from standards for cartway width,
curbing, right-of-way, cul-de-sac streets, street trees and
sidewalks and methods of stormwater removal, where the
deviation significantly minimizes or reduces land disturbance,
tree removal, cut and/or filling and impervious coverage or
sensitive or scenic natural features of the land, or otherwise
furthers the purposes of this subsection and is reasonable and
consistent with the purposes of this subsection without
resulting in a detriment to the public good and surrounding
neighborhood.
(4) Findings. The Planning Board shall not approve any residential
cluster development in the RC Zone unless the proposal meets all
applicable requirements for preliminary major subdivision
approval and the Planning Board makes all applicable findings and
conclusions as set forth in N.J.S.A. 40:55D-45.
(5) Development standards for residential clustering.
(a) The maximum number of residential lots in a cluster
development shall be determined by Planning Board approval
of a conceptual subdivision plan for conventional development
of the tract under the standards applicable to the R-1 Zone.
(b) Residential lots produced by clustering shall comply with the
standards of the R-2 Zone, except that a minimum lot size of
12,700 square feet shall be required.
(c) Where open space suitable for active recreation at the
discretion of the Planning Board and amounting to at least 40%
of the tract area is dedicated to the Borough of Madison, the
Planning Board may permit the maximum number of clustered
residential lots determined by way of a conceptual R-1
conventional development to be increased by 15%, the
required amount of open space shall be minimum of 40%,
including dedications to the Borough of Madison, and the

may be considered impervious for purposes of stormwater
management.
[3] The Planning Board may consider an increase in the
maximum impervious coverage, from 17.5 to 20%,
provided that there is no net increase in runoff volume and
that low-impact development techniques are incorporated
to provide enhanced water quality and groundwater
recharge.
(f) Open space organization. Open space shall be deeded to a
corporation, association or other legal entity consisting of one
or more of the property owners within the PCD-O for their use,

§ 195-32.8 WATER EMERGENCIES § 195-32.8
191:829
intended to protect the interests of the public and of the occupants
and owners of the proposed development in the total completion of
the development are adequate.
(6) That the proposed development will promote the PCD-O objectives.
F. Infrastructure.

is adequate to meet the expected sanitary sewage demand.
(c) The proposed potable water system is adequate to meet
expected water demands.
(d) The proposed solid waste management plan can adequately
handle the proposed solid waste to be generated by the
project.
(e) The roadways and intersections surrounding the zone and
leading to and from the tract are capable of handling the
expected traffic demands generated by the proposed
development. In determining the capability of such roadways
and intersections to handle the expected traffic demands to be
generated by the proposed development, the Planning Board
should endeavor to apply, whenever feasible and appropriate,
"Level of Service C," as defined in ASHTO.
(f) The electric supply system is capable of handling the demand
required by the proposed development.
(g) The proposed landscape management plan shall limit the use
of pesticides and chemical fertilizers by following the
principles and practices of integrated pest management.
(2) In determining whether the systems are adequate, the Planning
Board should determine that the existing system and all proposed
improvements needed and necessary to accommodate the
proposed development are either in existence, being constructed,
bonded or included under any developer's agreement between the
developer and municipality or other agency responsible for the
system.
(3) Where appropriate, the Planning Board should make submission of
a developer's agreement to be approved by the Borough Council,

No. 9-2002]
(a) Purposes. It is the overall purpose of this subsection to provide
specific zoning conditions and standards for the location and
operation of wireless communications antennas within the
Borough of Madison, to recognize the need to safeguard the
public good and preserve the intent and the purposes of the
Madison Borough Master Plan and Zone Plan.
(b) Overall objective. The overall objective of this subsection is to
enable the location within the Borough of Madison of those
antennas which are necessary to provide adequate wireless
communications services while, at the same time, limiting the
number of supporting towers to the fewest possible.
(c) Specific goals. The specific goals are to:
[1] Minimize the total number of wireless communications
towers within the Borough of Madison;
[2] Limit the impact of wireless communications antennas,
towers and related facilities upon the residences and the
streetscapes throughout the Borough of Madison;
§ 195-33 WATER EMERGENCIES § 195-33
191:863
[3] Safeguard the prevailing and historic character of
development throughout the Borough of Madison;
[4] Encourage the location of antennas upon, or within,
existing structures, including existing wireless
communications towers, existing buildings, existing water
towers or standpipes, and existing telephone and electric
poles and towers, especially those existing structures
situated on public property;
[5] Encourage as many antennas as possible, of as many of the
wireless communications carriers as possible, to be
collocated on the fewest number of existing structures
within the Borough of Madison;
[6] Discourage the construction of new towers which do not
have the likelihood of being used by a number of wireless
communications carriers;
[7] Encourage the communications carriers to configure their
facilities in a manner that minimizes and mitigates any
adverse impacts upon affected properties, streetscapes
and vistas through careful design, siting, landscape
screening and innovative camouflaging techniques;
[8] Formulate and maintain, for land use planning purposes, a
complete inventory of all wireless communications
antennas, towers and related facilities within the Borough
of Madison, and others in the vicinity of the Borough,
which are capable of providing service within the Borough;
[9] Enhance the ability of the carriers of wireless
communications services who adhere to the letter and
intent of this subsection to provide such services quickly,
effectively and efficiently; and
[10] Comply with the mandate of the Federal
Telecommunications Act of 1996, 47 U.S.C. Section 332
(c)(7), which preserves local government authority to
enforce zoning requirements which protect public safety,
public and private property and community aesthetics.
(d) Exemptions of applicability. These wireless communications
antennas provisions shall not apply to the following:
[1] This subsection shall not govern any tower, or the
installation of any antenna, that is under 70 feet in height

[1] In order to effectuate the purposes, objective and goals of
this subsection as noted hereinabove, any applicant to the
Borough of Madison for approval to erect a wireless
communications antenna, in addition to all other
information required by this subsection, shall provide
threshold evidence that the proposed location of the
proposed antenna(s), and any proposed supporting tower
and/or ancillary cabinets enclosing related electronic
equipment, has been planned to result in the fewest
number of tower locations within the Borough of Madison
at the time full service is provided by the applicant
throughout the Borough. Therefore, the applicant shall
provide an overall comprehensive plan indicating how it
intends to provide full service throughout the Borough of
Madison and, to the greatest extent reasonably possible,
shall indicate how its plan specifically relates to and is
coordinated with the needs of all other providers of
wireless communications services within and around the
Borough.
[2] More specifically, the overall comprehensive plan shall
indicate the following:
[a] The mapped location and written description of all
existing antennas and existing and approved
supporting structures within the Borough;
[b] The mapped or GIS database location and written
description of all existing or approved water towers or
water standpipes and existing telephone or electric
poles or towers within the Borough;
[c] How the proposed location of the proposed antenna(s)
specifically relates to the suitability or unsuitability of
such existing structures to be utilized to provide the
intended wireless communication;
[d] How the proposed location of the proposed antenna(s)
specifically relates to the anticipated need for
additional antennas and supporting structures within
and near the Borough of Madison by the applicant and
by other providers of wireless communications
services within the Borough;
[e] How the proposed location of the proposed antenna(s)
specifically relates to the objective of collocating the
antennas of many different providers of wireless
§ 195-33 WATER EMERGENCIES § 195-33
191:865
communications services on a single supporting
structure; and
[f] How the proposed location of the proposed antenna(s)
specifically relates to the overall objective of providing
full wireless communications services within the
Borough of Madison while, at the same time, limiting
the number of towers to the fewest possible, including
alternate technologies which do not require the use of
towers.
(f) Location priorities. [Amended 3-10-2003 by Ord. No.
2-2003]
[1] Based upon the overall comprehensive plan submitted by
the applicant in accordance with § 195-33B(10)(e)
hereinabove, if the Borough of Madison determines the
proposed antenna(s) to be needed for the provision of full
wireless communication services within the Borough,
utilizing the fewest number of towers as reasonably
possible, wireless communication antennas shall be
permitted within the Borough at the following prioritized
locations:
[a] The first priority location shall be an existing or
municipally approved wireless communication tower
in any zone, or an existing telephone or electric pole
or tower in the nonresidential zones listed in
§ 195-33B(10)(f)[1][b] hereof.
[b] The second priority location shall be on lands situated
within the Borough of Madison zoned within the
CBD-1, CBD-2, CC, U, OSGU or OR Zoning Districts;
or on lands within the Borough of Madison situated in
any zoning district, which land contains an existing
utility facility with an aboveground structure that
contains one or more existing ground buildings.
[2] Notwithstanding any provision of this Land Development
Ordinance to the contrary, the location of antenna(s) on an
existing municipally approved structure shall not require a
use variance in accordance with N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70d.(1) of
the Municipal Land Use Law.
(g) Area and setback requirements.
[1] If the proposed antenna(s) will be attached to an existing
or approved tower, an existing building, an existing or
approved water tower or water standpipe, or an existing
telephone or electric pole or tower, no land area shall be
required in addition to the land area upon which the
existing structure is situated; or
§ 195-33 MADISON CODE § 195-33
191:866
[2] If the proposed antenna(s) will be supported by a new
tower and will be situated on lands owned by the Borough
of Madison, the land area required shall be as approved by
the Borough Council in consideration of existing site
conditions and surrounding land uses, and shall be subject
to a written lease agreement between the applicant and
the Borough of Madison; or
[3] If the proposed antenna(s) will be supported by a new
tower and will be situated on lands within the Borough of
Madison not owned by the municipality, the following
minimum area and setback requirements shall be met:
[a] The proposed antenna(s) and proposed supporting
tower and ancillary related electronic equipment shall
be located on a land area equal to in size or larger
than the minimum lot area specified in Schedule I of
this chapter164 for the applicable zoning district;

tower and ancillary related electronic equipment, and
any approved building housing the electronic
equipment and any approved camouflaging of the
tower, shall be the only land uses located on the
subject land area, whether a separate lot or a leased
portion of a lot; and
[d] Except for any access driveway into the property, any
required landscaping and any underground utility
lines reviewed and approved by the Planning Board as
part of the site plan submission, no building, structure
and/or disturbance of land shall be permitted within a
one-hundred-foot setback distance from any street
line, from any other existing or proposed property
line, and provided that if a tower will exceed 100 feet
in height, the tower shall be set back from any street
line and from any other existing or proposed property
line a distance equal to or greater than the height of
the tower.

be prepared by the applicant or a sign professional. The Master
Sign Plan application shall include a sketch or photograph
showing the dimensions of each facade, window and canopy of
the building to which a sign is to be attached, in sufficient
detail to clearly indicate the location, dimension and area of all
existing and proposed permanent signs affixed to the walls,
windows and canopies of the building. These dimensions shall
either be shown on the sketch or photograph or on an attached
table. Samples of construction materials shall be submitted.
(d) In the case of a freestanding sign, a plot plan of the lot shall be
required as part of the Master Signage Plan, showing the
location of buildings, parking lots, driveways, landscaped
areas and all other existing and proposed signs.
(e) Whenever a Master Signage Plan is filed with the Planning

development application, the Construction Official shall issue a
sign permit only if the proposed sign is consistent with the
reviewing board's approval.
(4) Site plan approval.
(a) Any application for a sign permit requires site plan approval by
the Planning Board or the Zoning Board of Adjustment unless
the requirement is waived by the Zoning Officer pursuant to
the provisions of this chapter. When an application for a sign
permit is received by the Zoning Officer for a development that
consists solely of the erection or modification of signs for an
existing use, he shall:
[1] In the case of a commercial use, refer the Master Signage
Plan within three days to the Sign and Facade Committee
of the Downtown Development Commission for review and
recommendation.
[2] If located in the Historic District, refer the Master Signage
Plan within three days to the Historic Preservation
Commission, which shall review and make
recommendations before a permit is issued.
§ 195-34 MADISON CODE § 195-34
191:876
(b) The Zoning Officer may waive the requirement for site plan
approval only if he finds that the proposed sign meet the
requirements of this section and, in the case of any sign for a
commercial use, if the Sign and Facade Committee of the
Downtown Development Commission or the Historic
Preservation Commission finds that the signage plan meets all
requirements of the sign regulations. The Zoning Officer shall
refer the signage plan to the Sign and Facade Committee
within three days of receipt. The Zoning Officer and the Sign
and Facade Committee shall review the Master Signage Plan
and make recommendations within 10 days. If a request for
waiver of site plan is denied by the Zoning Officer, the
applicant may apply for waiver of site plan or for site plan
approval from the Board having jurisdiction. In any case, if
located in the Historic District, the Zoning Officer shall refer
the signage plan to the Historic District, the Zoning Officer
shall refer the signage plan to the Historic Preservation
Commission, which shall review within 10 days and make
recommendations before a permit is issued.
(5) The Sign and Facade Committee of the Downtown Development
Commission, in reviewing applications for a sign permit, pursuant
to Subsection B(4)(a), shall advise the Zoning Officer whether the
Master Signage Plan, including the plans for the individual signs, is
based on an integrated design, including all the elements listed in
Subsection B(2)(b)[1] through [8] above, and whether the above
elements are designed to be in harmony and are consistent with
each other, the architecture and materials of the principal
structure and the landscaping plan. The Committee may
recommend that a waiver will better promote the purposes of this
section.
(6) Whenever acting on a development application for commercial uses
where installation or modification by any sign is proposed, the
Planning Board or Zoning Board of Adjustment, as the case may be,
shall refer the application to the Sign and Facade Committee of the
Downtown Development Commission for review and
recommendation prior to approving or denying any application for
preliminary approval. If located in the Historic District, the
application shall also be referred to the Historic Preservation
Commission for review and recommendation. Upon receipt of any
development application for commercial use which proposes the
installation or modification of any sign, the Secretary of the Board
hearing the application shall forward one complete copy of the
application to the Sign and Facade Committee and, when
appropriate, to the Historic Preservation Commission. The Sign
and Facade Committee and, when appropriate, the Historic
Preservation Commission shall review the applicant's Master
Signage Plan and submit recommendations to the reviewing board
within 15 days after receipt of a copy of the application.
§ 195-34 WATER EMERGENCIES § 195-34
191:877
C. Measurement of sign area.
(1) Measurement of area of individual signs. The area of a sign face
(which is also the sign area of a wall sign or other sign with only
one face) shall be computed by means of the smallest square,
circle, rectangle, triangle or combination thereof that will
encompass the extreme limits of the writing, graphic illustration,
picture, symbol or other display, together with any material or color
forming an integral part of the background of the sign and used to
differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which
it is placed, but not including any supporting framework, bracing or
decorative fence or wall when such fence or wall otherwise meets
zoning regulations and is clearly incidental to the sign itself. No
sign shall have more than two display faces. The sign area for a
sign with two faces shall be computed by adding together the area
of all sign faces visible from any one point. When a sign having two
faces is such that both faces cannot be viewed from any point at the
same time, the sign area shall be computed by the measurement of
the larger of the two faces. For purposes of calculating window
signs, a window shall be considered the glazed area. Signs which
are required by county, state or federal agencies are exempt from
calculation of permanent and temporary signage up to the
minimum size required by such agencies. The area of the sign in
excess of the minimum shall be subject to the sign calculation. In
the event that no size requirement is imposed by such agency, the
sign shall not exceed one square foot. Neon signs and internally
illuminated signs shall be subject to modified area computations
specified elsewhere in this chapter. [Amended 4-12-2004 by Ord.
No. 8-2004]
(2) Measurement of height. The height of a freestanding sign shall be
computed as the distance from the base of the sign at normal grade

grade shall be construed to be the lower of existing grade prior to
construction or the newly established grade after construction,
exclusive of any filling, berming, mounding or excavation solely for
the purpose of locating the sign. In cases in which the normal grade
cannot reasonably be determined, sign height shall be computed on

(1) No nonconforming sign may be enlarged or altered in a way which
would increase its nonconformity. Existing nonconforming
permanent signs may continue to exist; however, when the sign is
modified either in shape, size, illumination or structure, the sign
shall be altered to conform to the provisions of this section.
Notwithstanding the above, all sandwich boards must receive a
permit.
(2) Should any nonconforming sign be damaged by any means to an
extent of more than 50% of its replacement cost at time of damage,

such written notice to remove, the Zoning Officer is hereby
authorized to cause removal of such sign, and any expenses
incidental to such removal shall be charged to the owner of the
property upon which the sign is located and shall constitute a lien
upon the property. For the purpose of this section, the word

for each individual use unless it can be demonstrated to the
satisfaction of the approving authority that staggered hours of
parking usage would permit modification of the total parking
required due to shared parking principles and that adequate
restrictions on the nature of the uses are imposed which would
§ 195-34 MADISON CODE § 195-35

§ 195-37.1. Stormwater control.
A. General.
(1) It is the intent and purpose of this section that all land in the
Borough be developed according to the following requirements.
(2) Any application for a building permit shall include sufficient
information to carry out the intent and purpose of this section,
which shall be administered by the Borough Engineer, except that
applications for additions or alterations of less than 400 square feet
to one- and two-family residences shall be exempt from this
requirement.
(3) Evaluation shall be made of the individual drainage structures
proposed, the entire site runoff, the off-site subwatershed(s) of
which the site is a part, downgradient properties, and the receiving
stream channel capacities. A point of confluence shall be
maintained so that valid comparisons of time of concentration can
be made between existing and proposed conditions.
(4) Control of water quality in surface water, soil erosion, transport of
sediment, and nonpoint source pollution related to development
activities shall be demonstrated and promote natural and
nonstructural management approaches and which maximize
prevention of stormwater generation as well as mitigation of
unavoidable stormwater impacts wherever possible.
(5) in support of comprehensive stormwater management, the State of
New Jersey's surface water quality standards (N.J.A.C. 7:9B-1.1 et
seq.) establish surface water quality standards and antidegradation
policies applicable to all surface waters, the Revised Manual for
New Jersey: Best Management Practices for Control of Nonpoint
Source Pollution from Stormwater, provides effective and
economical alternatives for better stormwater management and, in
particular, the control of nonpoint source pollution from land
development, and New Jersey residential site improvement
standards have been enacted (N.J.A.C. 5:21-1) to standardize
stormwater management standards for residential development
projects.
B. Runoff standards. All land area in the Borough shall be developed so
that:
§ 195-37 MADISON CODE § 195-37.1
191:896
(1) The peak rate of stormwater runoff occurring from the site as a
result of the development proposed in the application shall be
reduced as follows:
(a) To 50% of the predevelopment rate for the two-year storm;
(b) To 75% of the predevelopment rate for the ten-year storm; and
(c) To 80% of the predevelopment rate for the one-hundred-year
storm.

storm of lesser intensity, there shall be no increase in stormwater
runoff volumes over predevelopment levels.
(3) The drainage of the adjacent areas is not adversely affected.
(4) Soil absorption and groundwater recharge capacity of the area
shall not decrease below what occurs there under existing
conditions.

one watershed to another.
(6) Recharge of the aquifer and associated groundwater must be
maintained.
(7) Maximum use shall be made of presently existing surface water
runoff control devices, mechanisms or areas, such as existing
berms, terraces, grass waterways, favorable hydrologic soils,
swamps, swales, watercourses, woodlands and floodplains in
accordance with their functional capabilities, as well as any
proposed retention structures.
(8) The plan shall avoid the concentration of flow and shall provide for
the dissipation of velocities at all concentrated discharge points.
(9) Reestablishing vegetative cover shall be in accordance with
Standards and Specification for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control
in New Jersey, adopted by the Morris County Soil Conservation
District, latest edition, and with all other applicable statutes.
(10) Timing for the plan shall establish permanent surface water
management measures prior to construction or other land
disturbance.
C. Runoff control details. In order to duplicate as nearly as possible
natural drainage conditions, regulation and control of stormwater
runoff and erosion for any land area to be developed shall be through
on-site stormwater detention and/or ground absorption systems which
include, but are not limited to, the following:
§ 195-37.1 WATER EMERGENCIES § 195-37.1
191:897
(1) Reduce site runoff to predevelopment conditions through any and
all of the following methods:
(a) Methods.
[1] Reduction in the amount of impervious coverage.
[2] Consider a cluster development design.
[3] Reserve open space.
[4] Divert stormwater to pervious areas.
[5] Minimize use of storm sewers.
[6] Maximize use of natural vegetated overland flow.
[7] Recharge of stormwater runoff.
[8] Other methods approved by the Borough Engineer.
(b) Other considerations. Additionally, new developments should:
[1] Minimize disruption of natural channels.
[2] Minimize storm sewers and paved drainage structures.
[3] Promote filtering and infiltration.
(2) Detention areas which may be depressions in the parking areas,
excavated basins, basins created through use of curbs, stabilized
earth berms or dikes, or any other form of grading which serves to
temporarily impound and store water.
(3) Seepage pits which control stormwater runoff through ground
absorption and temporary storage.
(4) Porous asphaltic pavement, which preserves the natural ground
absorption capacity of a site and provides a subsurface reservoir
for temporary storage of stormwater.
(5) Any system or porous media, such as gravel trenches drained by
porous wall or perforated pipe, which temporarily stores and
dissipates stormwater through ground absorption.
(6) Pretreatment of stormwater runoff through the use of sediment
forebay or micropools; grass filter strips and grass swales; catch
basin pretreatments; and/or sediment chambers.
(7) Any combination of the above-mentioned techniques.
D. Design of stormwater/detention facilities.
(1) General standards.
§ 195-37.1 MADISON CODE § 195-37.1
191:898
(a) Stormwater detention facilities shall be designed to contain an
amount equal to the increase in volume of runoff which results
from development of a site.
(b) Provisions for water quality within a detention facility shall be
addressed with the goal of maintaining eighteen-hour
detention time to promote settlement.
(c) For estimating runoff discharge, design engineers shall have
the option to choose the methodology to calculate peak rate
and volume of discharge, as follows:
[1] For relatively small drainage areas of up to 20 acres, the
peak rate of runoff may be calculated by the Rational
Method, Modified Rational Method, or more recent
derivatives as approved by the Borough Engineer.
[2] For areas up to 320 acres, Urban Hydrology for Small
Watersheds, Technical Release No. 55 (TR-55), U.S.
Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service,
Engineering Division, as supplemented or amended to
date.
(d) When the proposed stormwater management control measures
(infiltration basins, etc.) depend on the hydrologic properties
of soils to function properly, then a soils report shall be
submitted. The soils report shall include an on-site
geotechnical evaluation including borings or test pit
documentation, in combination with documentary evidence of
regional soils and geology, in order to determine the type,
distribution and long-term suitability of soils present at the
location of the proposed facility and surrounding region, to be
reviewed and approved by the Borough Engineer.
(e) A runoff coefficient or a groundwater recharge land cover for
an existing condition may be used on all or a portion of the site
if the design engineer verifies that the hydrologic condition has
existed on the site or portion of the site for at least five years
without interruption prior to the time of application. If more
than one land cover has existed on the site during the five
years immediately prior to the time of application, the land
cover with the lowest runoff potential shall be used for the
computations. In addition, there is the presumption that the
site is in good hydrologic condition (if the land use type is
pasture, lawn, or park), with good cover (if the land use type is
woods), or with good hydrologic condition and conservation
treatment (if the land use type is cultivation). [Added
4-24-2006 by Ord. No. 5-2006]
(f) In computing pre-construction stormwater runoff, the design
engineer shall account for all significant land features and
§ 195-37.1 WATER EMERGENCIES § 195-37.1
191:899
structures, such as ponds, wetlands, depressions, hedgerows,
or culverts, that may reduce pre-construction stormwater
runoff rates and volumes. [Added 4-24-2006 by Ord. No.
5-2006]
(g) In computing stormwater runoff from all design storms, the
design engineer shall consider the relative stormwater runoff
rates and/or volumes of pervious and impervious surfaces
separately to accurately compute the rates and volume of
stormwater runoff from the site. To calculate runoff from
unconnected impervious cover, urban impervious area
modifications as described in the NRCS Technical Release 55 -
Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds and other methods may
be employed. [Added 4-24-2006 by Ord. No. 5-2006]
(h) If the invert of the outlet structure of a stormwater
management measure is below the flood hazard design flood
elevation as defined at N.J.A.C. 7:13, the design engineer shall
take into account the effects of tailwater in the design of
structural stormwater management measures. [Added
4-24-2006 by Ord. No. 5-2006]
(2) Design standards.

191:900
water runoff from the areas upstream from the point of
interception.
(d) All water-carrying structures and/or retention areas shall be
completed and stabilized prior to diversion of water to them.

of the site showing all existing natural and man-made drainage
features (berms, terraces, grass waterways, favorable
hydrologic or poorly drained soils, swamps, swales,
watercourses, woodlands, floodplains). These shall be
incorporated in the plan to the greatest possible extent in
accordance with their functional capability.
(f) The design plan and calculations shall show that due
consideration has been given to the relationship of the subject
property to the natural or established drainage pattern of the
subwatershed(s) of which it is a part.
(g) Increased runoff resulting from disturbance of soil and
vegetation during development, construction, or other activity
shall be minimized into those drainage ways and watercourses

(4) Surface impoundment. If detention facilities utilizing surface
impoundment, such as detention basins, are used, sufficient volume
to fully contain the total volume of rainfall excess shall be provided.
The outlets of such facilities shall be designed to limit the maximum
discharge rate of stormwater runoff to what occurs at the site
under existing conditions and shall discharge in such a way as not
to adversely affect any other property. If earth berms or dikes are
used to create the impounding area, they shall be adequately
stabilized and the slopes protected with vegetative cover, paving or
rip-rap to protect against failure or breaching.

No. 5-2006]
the systems shall be large enough to fully contain the total volume
of rainfall excess.171
A. A. Statement and purpose. This section establishes minimum
stormwater management requirements and controls for major
development. Flood control, groundwater recharge, and pollutant
reduction through nonstructural or low-impact techniques shall be
explored before relying on structural BMPs. Structural BMPs will be
integrated with nonstructural stormwater management strategies and
proper maintenance plans. Nonstructural strategies include both
environmentally sensitive site design and source controls that prevent
pollutants from being placed on the site or from being exposed to
stormwater. Source control plans will be developed based upon physical
site conditions and the origin, nature, and the anticipated quantity or
amount of potential pollutants. Multiple stormwater management BMPs
may be necessary to achieve the established performance standards for
water quality, quantity, and groundwater recharge.
B. B. Applicability.
(1) (1) This section shall be applicable to all site plans and subdivisions
for the following major developments that require preliminary or
final site plan or subdivision review:
(a) (a) Nonresidential major developments: and
(b) (b) Aspects of residential major developments that are not
preempted by the Residential Site Improvement Standards at
N.J.A.C. 5:21.
(2) (2) This section shall also be applicable to all major developments
undertaken by the Borough of Madison.
C. C. Compatibility with other permit and ordinance requirements.
Development approvals issued for subdivisions and site plans pursuant
to this section are to be considered an integral part of development
approvals under the subdivision and site plan review process and do not
relieve the applicant of the responsibility to secure required permits or
approvals for activities regulated by any other applicable code, rule,
act, or ordinance. In their interpretation and application. the provisions
of this section shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the
promotion of the public health, safety, and general welfare. This section
is not intended to interfere with, abrogate, or annul any other
ordinances, rule or regulation, statute, or other provision of law except
171. Editor's Note: Former Subsections B(11) through (13), which immediately followed this
subsection, were repealed 4-24-2006 by Ord. No. 5-2006. For the provisions of former
Subsection D(11), Safety Measures, see now § 195-37.6A(1). For the provisions of former
Subsection B(12), Maintenance, see now § 195-37.7B(2)(b).

development. [Added 4-24-2006 by Ord. No. 5-2006172]
that, where any provision of this section imposes restrictions different
from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule or regulation, or other
provision of law, the more restrictive provisions or higher standards
shall control.
D. D. Design and performance standards for stormwater management
measures.
(1) Stormwater management measures for major development shall be
developed to meet the erosion control, groundwater recharge,
stormwater runoff quantity, and stormwater runoff quality
standards as identified herein. To the maximum extent practicable,
these standards shall be met by incorporating nonstructural
stormwater management strategies into the design. If these
strategies alone are not sufficient to meet these standards,
structural stormwater management measures necessary to meet
these standards shall be incorporated into the design.
(2) The standards apply only to major development and are intended to
minimize the impact of stormwater runoff on water quality and
water quantity in receiving water bodies and maintain groundwater
recharge. The standards do not apply to new major development to
the extent that alternative design and performance standards are
applicable under a regional stormwater management plan or water
quality management plan adopted in accordance with Department
rules. Note: Alternative standards shall provide at least as much
protection from stormwater-related loss of groundwater recharge,
stormwater quantity and water quality impacts of major
development projects as would be provided under the standards in
N.J.A.C. 7:8-5.
A. The development shall incorporate a maintenance plan for the
stormwater management measures incorporated into the design of a
major development.
B. Stormwater management measures shall avoid adverse impacts of
concentrated flow on habitat for threatened and endangered species as
documented in the Department' Landscape Project or Natural Heritage
Database established under N.J.S.A. 13:1B-15.147 through 15.150,
particularly Helonias bullata (swamp pink) and/or Clemmys
muhlnebergi (bog turtle).
C. The following linear development projects are exempt from the
groundwater recharge, stormwater runoff quantity, and stormwater
runoff quality requirements:

or trail with a maximum width of 14 feet, provided that the access
is made of permeable material.
D. A waiver from strict compliance from the groundwater recharge,
stormwater runoff quantity, and stormwater runoff quality
requirements of Subsections F and G may be obtained for the
enlargement of an existing public roadway or railroad, or the
construction or enlargement of a public pedestrian access, provided
that the following conditions are met:
(1) The applicant demonstrates that there is a public need for the
project that cannot be accomplished by any other means;
(2) The applicant demonstrates, through an alternatives analysis, that
through the use of nonstructural and structural stormwater
management strategies and measures, the option selected
complies with the requirements of Subparagraph F and G to the

(1) To the maximum extent practicable, the standards in Subsections F
and G shall be met by incorporating nonstructural stormwater
management strategies set forth herein into the design. The
applicant shall identify the nonstructural measures incorporated
into the design of the project. If the applicant contends that it is not
feasible for engineering, environmental, or safety reasons to
incorporate any nonstructural stormwater management measures
identified in Subsection E(2) below into the design of a particular
project, the applicant shall identify the strategy considered and
provide a basis for the contention.

(c) This standard does not apply:
[1] Where the review agency determines that this standard
would cause inadequate hydraulic performance that could
not practicably be overcome by using additional or larger
storm drain inlets that meet these standards;
[2] Where flows from the water quality design storm as
specified in Subsection G(1) are conveyed through any
device (e.g., end-of-pipe netting facility, manufactured
treatment device, or a catch basin hood) that is designed,
at a minimum, to prevent delivery of all solid and floatable
materials that could not pass through one of the following:
[a] A rectangular space 4 5/8 inches long and 1 1/2 inches
wide (this option does not apply for outfall netting
facilities); or
[b] A bar screen having a bar spacing of 0.5 inch.

specified in Subsection G(1); or
[4] Where the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection determines, pursuant to the New Jersey
Register of Historic Places Rules at N.J.A.C. 7:4-7.2(c), that
action to meet this standard is an undertaking that
constitutes an encroachment or will damage or destroy the
New Jersey Register listed historic property.
(4) Any land area used as a nonstructural stormwater management
measure to meet the performance standards in Subsections F and
G shall be dedicated to a government agency, subjected to a
conservation restriction filed with the appropriate County Clerk's
office, or subject to an approved equivalent restriction that ensures
that measure or an equivalent stormwater management measure
approved by the reviewing agency is maintained in perpetuity.
(5) Guidance for nonstructural stormwater management strategies is
available in the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management
Practices Manual.
F. Erosion control, groundwater recharge and runoff quantity standards.
(1) This subsection contains minimum design and performance
standards to control erosion, encourage and control infiltration and
groundwater recharge, and control stormwater runoff quantity
impacts of major development.
(a) The minimum design and performance standards for erosion
control are those established under the Soil Erosion and
Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq. and
implementing rules.
(b) The minimum design and performance standards for
groundwater recharge are as follows:
[1] The design engineer shall, using the assumptions and
factors for stormwater runoff and groundwater recharge
calculations herein, either:
[a] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis that the site and its stormwater management
measures maintain 100% of the average annual preconstruction
groundwater recharge volume for the
site; or
[b] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis that the increase of stormwater runoff volume
§ 195-37.3 WATER EMERGENCIES § 195-37.3
191:909
from pre-construction to post-construction for the
two-year storm is infiltrated.
[c] Enhanced groundwater recharge standards in the
WHPA district. [Added 11-8-2010 by Ord. No.
56-2010]
[i] Within WHPA Tiers 1 and 2, the design engineer
must demonstrate that the increase in runoff from
pre-construction to post-construction for the
entire five-year storm is infiltrated.
[ii] Within WHPA Tier 3, the design engineer must
demonstrate that the increase in runoff from preconstruction
to post-construction for the entire
ten-year storm is infiltrated.
[2] This groundwater recharge requirement does not apply to
projects within the "urban redevelopment area," or to
projects subject to Subsection F(1)(b)[3] below.
[3] The following types of stormwater shall not be recharged:
[a] Stormwater from areas of high pollutant loading. High
pollutant loading areas are areas in industrial and
commercial developments where solvents and/or
petroleum products are loaded/unloaded, stored, or
applied; areas where pesticides are loaded/unloaded
or stored; areas where hazardous materials are
expected to be present in greater than "reportable
quantities" as defined by the United States
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR
302.4; areas where recharge would be inconsistent
with a Department-approved remedial action work
plan or landfill closure plan; and areas with high risks
for spills of toxic materials, such as gas stations and
vehicle maintenance facilities; and
[b] Industrial stormwater exposed to source material.
"Source material" means any material(s) or
machinery, located at an industrial facility, that is
directly or indirectly related to process,
manufacturing or other industrial activities, which
could be a source of pollutants in any industrial
stormwater discharge to groundwater. Source
materials include, but are not limited to, raw
materials; intermediate products; final products;
waste materials; by-products; industrial machinery
and fuels; and lubricants, solvents, and detergents
that are related to process, manufacturing, or other
industrial activities that are exposed to stormwater.
§ 195-37.3 MADISON CODE § 195-37.3
191:910
[4] The design engineer shall assess the hydraulic impact on
the groundwater table and design the site so as to avoid
adverse hydraulic impacts. Potential adverse hydraulic
impacts include, but are not limited to, exacerbating a
naturally or seasonally high water table so as to cause
surficial ponding, flooding of basements, or interference
with the proper operation of subsurface sewage disposal
systems and other subsurface structures in the vicinity or
downgradient of the groundwater recharge area.
(c) In order to control stormwater runoff quantity impacts, the
design engineer shall, using the assumptions and factors for
stormwater runoff calculations at § 195-37.1D(1)(f) and (g),
complete one of the following:
[1] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
that for stormwater leaving the site, post-construction
runoff hydrographs for the two-, ten-, and one-hundredyear
storm events do not exceed, at any point in time, the
pre-construction runoff hydrographs for the same storm
events;
[2] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
that there is no increase, as compared to the preconstruction
condition, in the peak runoff rates of
stormwater leaving the site for the two-, ten-, and onehundred-
year storm events and that the increased volume
or change in timing of stormwater runoff will not increase
flood damage at or downstream of the site. This analysis
shall include the analysis of impacts of existing land uses
and projected land uses assuming full development under
existing zoning and land use ordinances in the drainage
area;
[3] Design stormwater management measures so that the
post-construction peak runoff rates for the two-, ten-, and
one-hundred-year storm events are 50%, 75% and 80%,
respectively, of the pre-construction peak runoff rates. The
percentages apply only to the post-construction
stormwater runoff that is attributable to the portion of the
site on which the proposed development or project is to be
constructed. The percentages shall not be applied to postconstruction
stormwater runoff into tidal flood hazard
areas if the increased volume of stormwater runoff will not
increase flood damages below the point of discharge; or
[4] In tidal flood hazard areas, stormwater runoff quantity
analysis in accordance with Subsection F(1)(c)[1], [2] and
[3] above shall only be applied if the increased volume of
stormwater runoff could increase flood damages below the
point of discharge.
§ 195-37.3 WATER EMERGENCIES § 195-37.3
191:911
(2) Any application for a new agricultural development that meets the
definition of major development shall be submitted to the
appropriate Soil Conservation District for review and approval in
accordance with the requirements of this section and any
applicable Soil Conservation District guidelines for stormwater
runoff quantity and erosion control. For the purposes of this
section, "agricultural development" means land uses normally
associated with the production of food, fiber and livestock for sale.
Such uses do not include the development of land for the
processing or sale of food and the manufacturing of agriculturally
related products.
G. Stormwater runoff quality standards.
(1) Stormwater management measures shall be designed to reduce the
post-construction load of total suspended solids (TSS) in
stormwater runoff by 80% of the anticipated load from the
developed site, expressed as an annual average. Stormwater
management measures shall only be required for water quality
control if an additional 1/4 acre of impervious surface is being
proposed on a development site. The requirement to reduce TSS
does not apply to any stormwater runoff in a discharge regulated
under a numeric effluent limitation for TSS imposed under the New
Jersey Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NJPDES) rules,
N.J.A.C. 7:14A, or in a discharge specifically exempt under a
NJPDES permit from this requirement. The water quality design
storm is 1.25 inches of rainfall in two hours. Water quality
calculations shall take into account the distribution of rain from the
water quality design storm, as reflected in Table 1. The calculation
of the volume of runoff may take into account the implementation
of nonstructural and structural stormwater management measures.

(2) For purposes of TSS reduction calculations, Table 2 below presents
the presumed removal rates for certain BMPs designed in
accordance with the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management
Practices Manual. TSS reduction shall be calculated based on the
removal rates for the BMPs in Table 2 below. Alternative removal
rates and methods of calculating removal rates may be used if the
design engineer provides documentation demonstrating the
capability of these alternative rates and methods to the review
agency. A copy of any approved alternative rate or method of
calculating the removal rate shall be provided to the Department at
the following address: Division of Watershed Management, New
Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, PO Box 418,
Trenton, New Jersey 08625-0418.
(3) If more than one BMP in series is necessary to achieve the required
eighty-percent TSS reduction for a site, the applicant shall utilize
the following formula to calculate TSS reduction:
R = A + B  (AXB)/100
Where
R = total TSS percent load removal from application of both BMPs
A = the TSS percent removal rate applicable to the first BMP
B = the TSS percent removal rate applicable to the second BMP

(4) If there is more than one on-site drainage area, the eighty-percent
TSS removal rate shall apply to each drainage area, unless the
runoff from the subareas converge on site, in which case the
removal rate can be demonstrated through a calculation using a
weighted average.
(5) Stormwater management measures shall also be designed to
reduce, to the maximum extent feasible, the post-construction
nutrient load of the anticipated load from the developed site in
stormwater runoff generated from the water quality design storm.
In achieving reduction of nutrients to the maximum extent feasible,
the design of the site shall include nonstructural strategies and
structural measures that optimize nutrient removal while still
achieving the performance standards in Subsections F and G.
(6) Additional information and examples are contained in the New
Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual.
(7) In accordance with the definition of FW1 at N.J.A.C. 7:9B-1.4,
stormwater management measures shall be designed to prevent
any increase in stormwater runoff to waters classified as FW1.
(8) Special water resource protection areas shall be established along
all waters designated Category One at N.J.A.C. 7:9B, and perennial
or intermittent streams that drain into or upstream of the Category
One waters as shown on the USGS Quadrangle Maps or in the
County Soil Surveys, within the associated HUC14 drainage area.
These areas shall be established for the protection of water quality,
aesthetic value, exceptional ecological significance, exceptional
recreational significance, exceptional water supply significance,
and exceptional fisheries significance of those established Category
One waters. These areas shall be designated and protected as
follows:
(a) The applicant shall preserve and maintain a special water
resource protection area in accordance with one of the
following:
[1] A three-hundred-foot special water resource protection
area shall be provided on each side of the waterway,
measured perpendicular to the waterway from the top of
the bank outwards or from the center line of the waterway
where the bank is not defined, consisting of existing

191:914
vegetation or vegetation allowed to follow natural
succession.
[2] Encroachment within the designated special water
resource protection area under Subsection G(8)(a)[1]
above shall only be allowed where previous development
or disturbance has occurred (for example, active
agricultural use, parking area or maintained lawn area).
The encroachment shall only be allowed where the
applicant demonstrates that the functional value and
overall condition of the special water resource protection
area will be maintained to the maximum extent
practicable. In no case shall the remaining special water
resource protection area be reduced to less than 150 feet
as measured perpendicular to the top of bank of the
waterway or center line of the waterway where the bank is
undefined. All encroachments proposed under this
subsection shall be subject to review and approval by the
Department.
(b) All stormwater shall be discharged outside of and flow through
the special water resource protection area and shall comply
with the standard for off-site stability in the "Standards for Soil
Erosion and Sediment Control in New Jersey," established
under the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A.
4:24-39 et seq.
(c) If stormwater discharged outside of and flowing through the
special water resource protection area cannot comply with the
standard for off-site stability in the "Standards for Soil Erosion
and Sediment Control in New Jersey," established under the
Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq.,
then the stabilization measures in accordance with the
requirements of the above standards may be placed within the
special water resource protection area, provided that:
[1] Stabilization measures shall not be placed within 150 feet
of the Category One waterway;
[2] Stormwater associated with discharges allowed by this
section shall achieve a ninety-five-percent TSS postconstruction
removal rate;
[3] Temperature shall be addressed to ensure no impact on
the receiving waterway;
[4] The encroachment shall only be allowed where the
applicant demonstrates that the functional value and
overall condition of the special water resource protection
area will be maintained to the maximum extent
practicable;
§ 195-37.3 WATER EMERGENCIES § 195-37.3
191:915
[5] A conceptual project design meeting shall be held with the
appropriate Department staff and Soil Conservation
District staff to identify necessary stabilization measures;
and
[6] All encroachments proposed under this section shall be
subject to review and approval by the Department.
(d) A stream corridor protection plan may be developed by a
regional stormwater management planning committee as an
element of a regional stormwater management plan, or by a
municipality through an adopted municipal stormwater
management plan. If a stream corridor protection plan for a
waterway subject to Subsection G(8) has been approved by the
Department of Environmental Protection, then the provisions
of the plan shall be the applicable special water resource
protection area requirements for that waterway. A stream
corridor protection plan for a waterway subject to Subsection
G(8) shall maintain or enhance the current functional value
and overall condition of the special water resource protection
area as defined in Subsection G(8)(a)[1] above. In no case shall
a stream corridor protection plan allow the reduction of the
Special Water Resource Protection Area to less than 150 feet
as measured perpendicular to the waterway subject to this
subsection.
(e) Subsection G(8) does not apply to the construction of one
individual single-family dwelling that is not part of a larger
development on a lot receiving preliminary or final subdivision
approval on or before February 2, 2004, provided that the
construction begins on or before February 2, 2009.

§ 195-37.4. Structural stormwater management measures. [Added
4-24-2006 by Ord. No. 5-2006]
A. Standards for structural stormwater management measures are as
follows:
(1) Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed to
take into account the existing site conditions, including, for
example, environmentally critical areas, wetlands; flood-prone
areas; slopes; depth to seasonal high water table; soil type,
permeability and texture; drainage area and drainage patterns; and
the presence of solution-prone carbonate rocks (limestone).
(2) Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed to
minimize maintenance, facilitate maintenance and repairs, and
ensure proper functioning. Trash racks shall be installed at the
intake to the outlet structure as appropriate, and shall have parallel
bars with one-inch spacing between the bars to the elevation of the
water quality design storm. For elevations higher than the water
quality design storm, the parallel bars at the outlet structure shall
be spaced no greater than 1/3 the width of the diameter of the
orifice or 1/3 the width of the weir, with a minimum spacing
between bars of one inch and a maximum spacing between bars of
six inches. In addition, the design of trash racks must comply with
the requirements herein.
(3) Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed,
constructed, and installed to be strong, durable, and corrosionresistant.
Measures that are consistent with the relevant portions
of the Residential Site Improvement Standards at N.J.A.C. 5:21-7.3,
7.4, and 7.5 shall be deemed to meet this requirement.
(4) At the intake to the outlet from the stormwater management basin,
the orifice size shall be a minimum of 2 1/2 inches in diameter.
(5) Stormwater management basins shall be designed to meet the
minimum safety standards for stormwater management basins at
§ 195-37.6 herein.
B. Stormwater management measure guidelines are available in the New
Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual. Other
stormwater management measures may be utilized, provided the
design engineer demonstrates that the proposed measure and its
design will accomplish the required water quantity, groundwater
recharge and water quality design and performance standards
established herein.
C. Manufactured treatment devices may be used to meet the requirements
of this section, provided the pollutant removal rates are verified by the
New Jersey Corporation for Advanced Technology and certified by the
Department.

A. This section sets forth requirements to protect public safety through
the proper design and operation of stormwater management basins.
This section applies to any new stormwater management basin. County
stormwater management plans and ordinances may, pursuant to their
authority, require existing stormwater management basins to be
retrofitted to meet one or more of the safety standards for trash racks,
overflow grates, and escape provisions at outlet structures.
§ 195-37.5 MADISON CODE § 195-37.6
191:918
(1) Safety measures. Stormwater detention, sedimentation or
infiltration facilities shall incorporate safety measures including
but not limited to warning signs, gauges, fencing, shallow grade
benches, trash racks, etc.
B. Requirements for trash racks, overflow grates and escape provisions.
(1) A trash rack is a device designed to catch trash and debris and
prevent the clogging of outlet structures. Trash racks shall be
installed at the intake to the outlet from the stormwater
management basin to ensure proper functioning of the basin
outlets in accordance with the following:
(a) The trash rack shall have parallel bars, with no greater than
six-inch spacing between the bars.
(b) The trash rack shall be designed so as not to adversely affect
the hydraulic performance of the outlet pipe or structure.
(c) The average velocity of flow through a clean trash rack is not to
exceed 2.5 feet per second under the full range of stage and
discharge. Velocity is to be computed on the basis of the net
area of opening through the rack.
(d) The trash rack shall be constructed and installed to be rigid,
durable, and corrosion-resistant, and shall be designed to
withstand a perpendicular live loading of 300 pounds per
square foot.
(2) An overflow grate is designed to prevent obstruction of the
overflow structure. If an outlet structure has an overflow grate,
such grate shall meet the following requirements:
(a) The overflow grate shall be secured to the outlet structure but
be removable for emergencies and maintenance.
(b) The overflow grate spacing shall be no less than two inches
across the smallest dimension.
(c) The overflow grate shall be constructed and installed to be
rigid, durable, and corrosion-resistant, and shall be designed
to withstand a perpendicular live loading of 300 pounds per
square foot.
(3) For purposes of this Subsection B(3), "escape provisions" means
the permanent installation of ladders, steps, rungs, or other
features that provide easily accessible means of egress from
stormwater management basins. Stormwater management basins
shall include escape provisions as follows:
(a) If a stormwater management basin has an outlet structure,
escape provisions shall be incorporated in or on the structure.
With the prior approval of the appropriate review agency a

191:919
§ 195-37.7. Maintenance and repair of stormwater management
facilities. [Added 4-24-2006 by Ord. No. 5-2006]
freestanding outlet structure may be exempted from this
requirement.
(b) Safety ledges shall be constructed on the slopes of all new
stormwater management basins having a permanent pool of
water deeper than 2 1/2 feet. Such safety ledges shall be
comprised of two steps. Each step shall be four to six feet in
width. One step shall be located approximately 2 1/2 feet below
the permanent water surface, and the second step shall be
located one to 1 1/2 feet above the permanent water surface.
(c) In new stormwater management basins, the maximum interior
slope for an earthen dam, embankment, or berm shall not be
steeper than three horizontal to one vertical.
C. Variance or exemption from safety standards. A variance or exemption
from the safety standards for stormwater management basins may be
granted only upon a written finding by the appropriate reviewing
agency (municipality, county or Department) that the variance or
exemption will not constitute a threat to public safety.
A. Applicability. Projects subject to review shall comply with the
requirements of Subsections B and C.
B. General maintenance.
(1) The design engineer shall prepare a maintenance plan for the
stormwater management measures incorporated into the design of
a major development.
(2) Maintenance plans.
(a) The maintenance plan shall contain specific preventative
maintenance tasks and schedules; cost estimates, including
estimated cost of sediment, debris, or trash removal; and the
name, address, and telephone number of the person or persons
responsible for preventative and corrective maintenance
(including replacement). Maintenance guidelines for
stormwater management measures are available in the New
Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual. If the
maintenance plan identifies a person other than the developer
(for example, a public agency or homeowners' association) as
having the responsibility for maintenance, the plan shall
include documentation of such person's agreement to assume
this responsibility, or of the developer's obligation to dedicate a
stormwater management facility to such person under an
applicable ordinance or regulation.
§ 195-37.6 MADISON CODE § 195-37.7
191:920
(b) Stormwater facilities shall be constantly maintained by the
owner or association to assure continual functioning of the
system at design capacity and to prevent the health hazards
associated with debris buildup and stagnant water.
Maintenance responsibilities, inspection schedules and tasks
will be clearly shown in the proposed plan. In no case shall
water be allowed to remain in any facility long enough to
constitute a mosquito breeding disease or any other type of
health problem. The maintenance plan must include inspection
routines to reduce the potential for extensive, difficult, and
costly remedial or emergency maintenance efforts, including
inspection checklists. Inspection checklists may include such
items as:
[1] Obstruction of inlet or outlet devices by trash and debris;
[2] Evidence of erosion, sedimentation or instability;
[3] Malfunctioning of valves, gates, locks, access hatches or
equipment;
[4] Deteriorated conduit outlet or seepage around outlet;
[5] Cracks or other deterioration of inlets, outlets, pipes, and
conduits;
[6] Inadequate draining, clearing or clogging of control

specified;
[11] Saturated conditions or standing water;
[12] Animal burrowing; and
[13] Vandalism or other nonspecified occurrences.
(3) Responsibility for maintenance shall not be assigned or transferred
to the owner or tenant of an individual property in a residential
development or project, unless such owner or tenant owns or
leases the entire residential development or project.
(4) If the person responsible for maintenance identified under
Subsection B(2) above is not a public agency, the maintenance plan
and any future revisions based on Subsection B(7) below shall be
recorded upon the deed of record for each property on which the
§ 195-37.7 WATER EMERGENCIES § 195-37.7
191:921
maintenance described in the maintenance plan must be
undertaken.
(5) Preventative and corrective maintenance shall be performed to
maintain the function of the stormwater management measure,
including repairs or replacement to the structure; removal of
sediment, debris, or trash; restoration of eroded areas; snow and
ice removal; fence repair or replacement; restoration of vegetation;
and repair or replacement of nonvegetated linings.
(6) The person responsible for maintenance identified under
Subsection B(2) above shall maintain a detailed log of all
preventative and corrective maintenance for the structural
stormwater management measures incorporated into the design of
the development, including a record of all inspections and copies of
all maintenance-related work orders.
(7) The person responsible for maintenance identified under
Subsection B(2) above shall evaluate the effectiveness of the
maintenance plan at least once per year and adjust the plan and the
deed as needed.
(8) The person responsible for maintenance identified under
Subsection B(2) above shall retain and make available, upon
request by any public entity with administrative, health,
environmental, or safety authority over the site, the maintenance
plan and the documentation required by Subsection B(6) and B(7)
above.
(9) The requirements of Subsection B(3) and B(4) do not apply to
stormwater management facilities that are dedicated to and
accepted by the municipality or another governmental agency.
Where the ordinance requires the facility to be dedicated to the
municipality, certain aspects of the maintenance and repair plan
may be deleted, but otherwise should require the posting of a twoyear
maintenance guarantee in accordance with N.J.S.A.
40:55D-53. Guidelines for developing a maintenance and
inspection program are provided in the New Jersey Stormwater
Best Management Practices Manual and the NJDEP Ocean County
Demonstration Study, Stormwater Management Facilities
Maintenance Manual, dated June 1989, available from the NJDEP,
Watershed Management Program.
(10) In the event that the stormwater management facility becomes a
danger to public safety or public health, or if it is in need of
maintenance or repair, the municipality shall so notify the
responsible person in writing. Upon receipt of that notice, the
responsible person shall have 14 days to effect maintenance and
repair of the facility in a manner that is approved by the municipal
engineer or his designee. The municipality, in its discretion, may
extend the time allowed for effecting maintenance and repair for

requirements of this chapter.
B. Runoff from roof areas shall be transported to seepage pits for recharge
of groundwater resources.
C. Seepage pits shall have the capacity to temporarily store a volume
equal to four inches of runoff from roof areas. Alternatively, the capacity
of the seepage pit wells may be determined by routing a fifty-year,
twenty-four-hour storm through the dry well system taking into
consideration soil infiltration and permeability, water table depth, and
dry well capacity.
D. Roof gutters, vertical conductors and leaders, and horizontal storm
drains shall conform with Chapter 13 of the National Standard
Plumbing Code, most recent edition. Design shall be based on a rainfall
intensity of six inches per hour.
E. All roof gutters shall be protected from the accumulation of leaves and
litter.
F. Where gutters are not used on a building, a gravel-filled trench with a
perforated pipe shall be constructed under the roof overhang to collect
roof runoff, having a capacity not less than a comparable roof drain
system, subject to approval by the Borough Engineer.
G. Seepage pits shall have an overflow pipe extending to grade. Aluminum
pins, or gutter nails, shall be extended through the pipe at its outlet to
prevent small animals from entering.
H. Seepage pits shall generally be constructed of precast concrete rings
surrounded by clean crushed stone or gravel. The nominal stone size
shall be 1 1/2 inches. A bed of coarse sand not less than four inches

A. Intent and purpose. The governing body of the Borough of Madison
finds that riparian lands adjacent to streams, lakes, or other surface
water bodies that are adequately vegetated provide an important
environmental protection and water resource management benefit. It is
necessary to protect and maintain the beneficial character of riparian
areas by implementing specifications for the establishment, protection,
and maintenance of vegetation along the surface water bodies within
the jurisdiction of the Borough, consistent with the interest of
landowners in making reasonable economic use of parcels of land that
include such designated areas. The purpose of this section is to
designate riparian zones, and to provide for land use regulation therein
in order to protect the streams, lakes, and other surface water bodies of
the Borough of Madison; to protect the water quality of watercourses,
reservoirs, lakes, and other significant water resources within the
Borough of Madison; to protect the riparian and aquatic ecosystems of
Madison; to provide for the environmentally sound use of the land
resources of the Borough, and to complement existing state, regional,
county, and municipal stream corridor protection and management
regulations and initiatives. The specific purposes and intent of this
section are to:
§ 195-37.9 MADISON CODE § 195-37.10
191:926
(1) Restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological
integrity of the water resources of the Borough of Madison;
(2) Prevent excessive nutrients, sediment, and organic matter, as well
as biocides and other pollutants, from reaching surface waters by
optimizing opportunities for filtration, deposition, absorption,
adsorption, plant uptake, biodegradation, and denitrification,
which occur when stormwater runoff is conveyed through
vegetated buffers as stable, distributed sheet flow prior to reaching
receiving waters;
(3) Provide for shading of the aquatic environment so as to moderate
temperatures, retain more dissolved oxygen, and support a healthy
assemblage of aquatic flora and fauna;
(4) Provide for the availability of natural organic matter (fallen leaves
and twigs) and large woody debris (fallen trees and limbs) that
provide food and habitat for small bottom-dwelling organisms
(insects, amphibians, crustaceans, and small fish), which are
essential to maintain the food chain;
(5) Increase stream bank stability and maintain natural fluvial
geomorphology of the stream system, thereby reducing stream
bank erosion and sedimentation and protecting habitat for aquatic
organisms;
(6) Maintain base flows in streams and moisture in wetlands;
(7) Control downstream flooding; and
(8) Conserve the natural features important to land and water
resources, e.g., headwater areas, groundwater recharge zones,
floodways, floodplains, springs, streams, wetlands, woodlands, and
prime wildlife habitats.
B. Statutory authority. The municipality of the Borough of Madison is
empowered to regulate land uses under the provisions of the New
Jersey Municipal Land Use Law, N.J.S.A. 40:55D-1 et seq., which
authorizes each municipality to plan and regulate land use in order to
protect public health, safety and welfare by protecting and maintaining
native vegetation in riparian areas. The Borough of Madison is also
empowered to adopt and implement this section under provisions
provided by the following legislative authorities of the State of New
Jersey:
(1) Water Pollution Control Act, N.J.S.A. 58:10A-1 et seq.
(2) Water Quality Planning Act, N.J.S.A. 58:11A-1 et seq.
(3) Spill Compensation and Control Act, N.J.S.A. 58:10-23.11 et seq.
(4) Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq.
§ 195-37.10 WATER EMERGENCIES § 195-37.10

(5) Flood Hazard Area Control Act, N.J.S.A. 58:16A-50 et seq.
C. Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms shall have the
meanings indicated:
ACID-PRODUCING SOILS  Soils that contain geologic deposits of iron
sulfide minerals (pyrite and marcasite) which, when exposed to oxygen
from the air or from surface waters, oxidize to produce sulfuric acid.
Acid-producing soils, upon excavation, generally have a pH of 4.0 or
lower. After exposure to oxygen, these soils generally have a pH of
3.0 or lower. Information regarding the location of acid-producing soils
in New Jersey can be obtained from local Soil Conservation District
offices.
ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITY  The Planning Board or Board of
Adjustment or Construction Office for the Borough with all of the
powers delegated, assigned, or assumed by them according to statute
or ordinance.
APPLICANT  A person, corporation, government body or other legal
entity applying to the Planning Board, Board of Adjustment or the
Construction Office proposing to engage in an activity that is regulated
by the provisions of this section, and that would be located in whole or
in part within a regulated riparian zone.
FLOODWAY  Has the meaning ascribed to this term by the Flood
Hazard Area Control Act (N.J.S.A. 58:16A-50 et seq.) and regulations
promulgated thereunder published at N.J.A.C. 7:13 et seq., and any
supplementary or successor legislation and regulations from time to
time enacted or promulgated.
INTERMITTENT STREAM  Surface water drainage channels with
definite bed and banks in which there is not a permanent flow of
water. Streams shown as a dashed line on either the USGS topographic
quadrangle maps or the USDA County Soil Survey Maps of the most
recent edition that includes hydrography are included as intermittent
streams.
LAKE, POND, or RESERVOIR  Any impoundment, whether naturally
occurring or created in whole or in part by the building of structures,
for the retention of surface water, excluding sedimentation control
and stormwater retention/detention basins and ponds designed for
treatment of wastewater.
PERENNIAL STREAM  A stream that flows continuously throughout
the year in most years. These streams usually appear as a blue line on
USGS topographic quadrangle maps or on USDA County Soil Survey
Maps.
RIPARIAN ZONE  The land and vegetation within and directly
adjacent to all surface waters including, but not limited to, lakes, ponds,
perennial and intermittent streams, up to and including their point of
origin.
§ 195-37.10 MADISON CODE § 195-37.10
191:928
RIPARIAN ZONE MANAGEMENT PLAN  A plan approved by the
Engineer of the Borough of Madison. The plan shall be prepared by
a landscape architect, professional engineer or other qualified
professional, and shall evaluate the effects of any proposed activity/
uses on any riparian zone. The plan shall identify existing conditions,
all proposed activities, and all proposed management techniques,
including any measures necessary to offset disturbances to any affected
riparian zone.
RIPARIAN ZONE WATERS  Such which have been identified for
protection from degradation in water quality characteristics because of
their clarity, color, scenic setting, and other characteristics of aesthetic
value, exceptional ecological significance, exceptional recreational
significance, exceptional water supply significance, or exceptional
fisheries resources. Such waters shall also be such as may be defined
by statute or administrative regulation.
SURFACE WATER BODY  Any perennial stream, intermittent stream,
lake, pond, or reservoir, as defined herein. In addition, any state open
waters identified in a letter of interpretation issued by the New Jersey
Department of Environmental Protection Land Use Regulation Program
shall also be considered surface water bodies.
D. Establishment of riparian zones.
(1) Riparian zones adjacent to all waters shall be protected from
avoidable disturbance and shall be delineated as follows:
(a) The riparian zone shall be 300 feet wide along both sides of any
Category One water, and all upstream tributaries situated
within the same HUC-14 watershed. The riparian zone shall
equal the special water resource protection area, and shall be

be required by law to propose modifications to the maps required
by any naturally occurring or permitted change in the location of a
defining feature of a surface water body and to maintain files of
decisions or appeals, and by changes made by the New Jersey
Department of Environmental Protection in surface water
classifications or floodway delineations. Floodway delineations
shall be based upon the state's adopted floodway delineations.
However, requests for alterations to the adopted delineations can
be provided to the Department for consideration if site-specific
information is available.
(5) The applicant or designated representative shall be responsible for
the initial determination of the presence of a riparian zone on a
site, and for identifying the area on any plan submitted to the
Borough of Madison in conjunction with an application for a
construction permit, subdivision, land development, or other
improvement that requires plan submissions or permits. This initial
determination shall be subject to review and approval by the

minimum economically viable use of the property based upon
reasonable investment.
E. Uses permitted in riparian zones. Any other riparian zone area shall
remain in a natural condition or, if in a disturbed condition, including
agricultural activities, at the time of adoption of this section, may be
restored to a natural condition. There shall be no clearing or cutting of
trees and brush, except for removal of dead vegetation and pruning for
reasons of public safety or for the replacement of invasive species with
indigenous species. There shall be no altering of watercourses,
dumping of trash, soil, dirt, fill, vegetative or other debris, regrading or
construction. The following uses are permitted either by right or after
review and approval by the municipality in riparian zones. No new
§ 195-37.10 WATER EMERGENCIES § 195-37.10
191:931
construction, development, use, activity, encroachment, or structure
shall take place in a riparian zone, except as specifically authorized
in this section. The following uses shall be permitted within a riparian
zone:
(1) Open space uses that are primarily passive in character shall be
permitted by right to extend into a riparian zone, provided near
stream vegetation is preserved. Such uses include wildlife
sanctuaries, nature preserves, forest preserves, fishing areas,
game farms, fish hatcheries and fishing reserves, operated for the
protection and propagation of wildlife, but excluding structures.
Such uses also include passive recreation areas of public and
private parklands, including unpaved hiking, bicycle and bridle
trails, provided that said trails have been stabilized with pervious
materials.
(2) Fences, for which a permit has been issued by the Construction
Code Office, to the extent required by applicable law, rule or
regulation.
(3) Crossings by farm vehicles and livestock, recreational trails, roads,
railroads, stormwater lines, sanitary sewer lines, waterlines and
public utility transmission lines, provided that the land disturbance
is the minimum required to accomplish the permitted use, subject
to any applicable state permits that are acquired, and provided that
any disturbance is offset by buffer improvements and that the area
of the crossing is stabilized against significant erosion due to its
use as a crossing.
(4) Stream bank stabilization or riparian reforestation, which conforms
to the guidelines of an approved riparian zone management plan,
or wetlands mitigation projects that have been approved by the
Department of Environmental Protection.
F. Performance standards for riparian zones. For all riparian zones, the
following conditions shall apply:
(1) All new major and minor subdivisions and site plans shall be
designed to provide sufficient areas outside of the riparian zone to
accommodate primary structures, any normal accessory uses
appurtenant thereto, as well as all planned lawn areas.
(2) Portions of lots within the riparian zone must be permanently
restricted by deed or conservation easement held by the Borough
of Madison, its agent, or another public or private land
conservation organization which has the ability to provide
adequate protection to prevent adverse impacts within the riparian
zone. A complete copy of the recorded conservation restriction that
clearly identifies the deed book and pages where it has been
recorded in the office of the Morris County Clerk must be
submitted to the municipality.
§ 195-37.10 MADISON CODE § 195-37.10
191:932
(3) Any lands proposed for development which include all or a portion
of a riparian zone shall, as a condition of any major subdivision or
major site plan approval, provide for the vegetation or revegetation
of any portions of the riparian zone which are not vegetated at the
time of the application or which were disturbed by prior land uses,
including for agricultural use.
(4) For building lots which exist as of the date of adoption of this
section, but for which a building permit or a preliminary site plan
approval has not been obtained or is no longer valid, the required
minimum front, side, and rear setbacks may extend into the
riparian zone, provided that a deed restriction and/or conservation
easement is applied which prohibits clearing or construction in the
riparian zone.
(5) All stormwater shall be discharged outside of but may flow through
a riparian zone and shall comply with the standard for off-site
stability in the Standards for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control in
New Jersey, established under the Soil Erosion and Sediment
Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq. (See N.J.A.C. 2:90-1.3.)
(6) If stormwater discharged outside of and flowing through a riparian
zone cannot comply with the standard for off-site stability, then the
proposed stabilization measures must meet the requirements of the
Flood Hazard Area Control Act rule at N.J.A.C. 7:13-10.2 et. seq.,
and have an approved flood hazard permit.
G. Nonconforming structures and uses in riparian zones. Nonconforming
structures and uses of land within the riparian zone are subject to the
following requirements:
(1) Legally existing but nonconforming structures or uses may be
continued.
(2) For all other riparian zones:
(a) Encroachment within the riparian zone shall only be allowed
where previous development or disturbance has occurred.
(b) Existing impervious cover shall not be increased within the
riparian zone as a result of encroachments where previous
development or disturbances have occurred.
(c) Discontinued nonconforming uses may be resumed any time
within one year from such discontinuance but not thereafter
when showing clear indications of abandonment.
H. Uses prohibited in riparian zones. For all riparian zones, any use or
activity not specifically authorized elsewhere in this chapter shall be
prohibited. By way of example, the following activities and facilities are
prohibited, except where authorized or excepted elsewhere in this
chapter:
§ 195-37.10 WATER EMERGENCIES § 195-37.10
191:933

I. Activities permitted in riparian zones in the case of no reasonable or
prudent alternative or extreme hardship.
(1) For all riparian zones, hardship variances may be granted in cases
of a preexisting lot (existing at the time of adoption of this section)
when there is insufficient room outside the riparian zone for uses
permitted by the underlying zoning and there is no other
reasonable or prudent alternative to placement in the riparian
zone, including obtaining variances from setback or other
requirements that would allow conformance with the riparian zone
requirements, and provided that demonstrations are made
including but not limited to:
(a) The existence of an extreme economic hardship, which:
[1] Does not apply to or affect other property in the immediate
vicinity;
[2] Relates to or arises out of the characteristics of the subject
property because of the particular physical surroundings,
shape or topographical conditions.
[3] Demonstrates that there is no adjacent land that is
reasonably available or could be obtained, utilized,
expanded or managed in order to fulfill the basic purposes.
(b) An applicant shall be deemed to have established compelling
public need if the applicant demonstrates, based on specific
facts, that one of the following applies:
§ 195-37.10 MADISON CODE § 195-37.10
191:934
[1] The proposed project will serve an essential public health
or safety need;
[2] The proposed use is required to serve an existing public
health or safety need; or
[3] There is no alternative available to meet the established
public health or safety need.
(c) A variance can only be granted if it is shown that the activity is
in conformance with all applicable local, state, and federal
regulations, and that the exception granted is the minimum
relief necessary to relieve the hardship.
(2) If the above demonstrations are made, then the encroachment of
impervious surfaces (structures or pavement) otherwise permitted
by the underlying zoning is permitted to the extent of 750 square
feet total. Said encroachment is not permitted closer than 100 feet
from the top of the bank at bank-full flow or level of Category Two
waters for trout production (FW2-TP), or closer than 50 feet from
the top of the bank at bank-full flow or level of other surface water
bodies.
(3) If such an exception is granted, the applicant shall rehabilitate an
environmentally degraded riparian zone area within or adjacent to
the same site, and at least equivalent in size to the riparian zone
reduction permitted, or, if not possible, rehabilitate or expand a
riparian zone area at least equivalent in size within a nearby site
and, if available, within the same watershed. Rehabilitation shall
include reforestation, stream bank stabilization and removal of
debris, in accordance with a riparian zone management plan, as
described. The Borough may require financial contribution be
made to an open space or municipal stormwater management plan
mitigation plan fund in exchange for this requirement.
J. Riparian zone management plan.
(1) Within any riparian zone, no construction, development, use,
activity, or encroachment shall be permitted unless the effects of
such development are accompanied by preparation, approval, and
implementation of a riparian zone management plan.
(2) Plan contents.
(a) The landowner, applicant, or developer shall submit to the
Municipal Engineer, or his or her appointed representative, a
riparian zone management plan prepared by an environmental
professional, professional engineer or other qualified
professional which fully evaluates the effects of any proposed
uses on the riparian zone. The riparian zone management plan
shall identify the existing conditions including:

than 20%; and greater than 20%.
(b) The proposed plan shall describe all proposed uses/activities,
and fully evaluate the effects of all proposed uses/activities in a
riparian zone, and all proposed management techniques,
including proposed vegetation and any other measures
necessary to offset disturbances to the riparian zone. A
discussion of activities proposed as well as management
techniques proposed to offset disturbances and/or enhance the
site to improve the riparian zone's ability to function effectively
as a riparian zone shall also be included with the riparian zone
management plan submittal to the Borough of Madison.
(3) The plan shall be reviewed and must be approved by the Engineer
of the Borough of Madison, in consultation with the Environmental
Commission, as part of the subdivision and land development
process.

native, noninvasive species, and consistent with the soil, slope
and moisture conditions of the site. The Engineer of the
Borough of Madison may require species suitability to be
verified by qualified experts from the Soil Conservation
District, Natural Resources Conservation Service, New Jersey
Department of Environmental Protection, US Fish and Wildlife
Service and/or state or federal forest agencies.
(5) A riparian zone management plan is not required where the
riparian zone is not being disturbed and conservation easements/
deed restrictions are applied to ensure there will be no future
clearing or disturbance of the riparian zone.
(6) Performance of the riparian zone management plan shall be
guaranteed for a minimum of two years, by a surety, such as a bond,
cash or letter of credit, which shall be provided to the Borough of
Madison prior to the Borough issuing any permits or approving any
uses relating to the applicable use or activity.
K. Boundary interpretation; appeals procedures; inspections; conflicts;
severability.
(1) When a landowner or applicant disputes the boundaries of a
riparian zone, or the defined bank-full flow or level, the landowner
or applicant shall submit evidence to the Borough Engineer that
describes the riparian zone, presents the landowner or applicant's
proposed riparian zone delineation, and presents all justification
for the proposed boundary change. For Category One (C1) riparian
zones, the landowner or applicant must first obtain approval from
the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. A
decision from the Department must be included with the evidence
submitted for municipal review.
(2) Inspections.
(a) Lands within or adjacent to an identified riparian zone shall be
inspected by the Borough Engineer when:
[1] A subdivision or land development plan is submitted;
[2] A building permit is requested;
[3] A change or resumption of a nonconforming use is
proposed;
[4] A discontinued nonconforming use is resumed more than a
year later.
(b) The riparian zone may also be inspected periodically by
representatives from the Borough of Madison if excessive or
potentially problematic erosion is present, other problems are
discovered, or at any time when the presence of an
§ 195-37.10 WATER EMERGENCIES § 195-37.10
191:937
§ 195-38. Site plan in floodplain areas.
unauthorized activity or structure is brought to the attention of
municipal officials or when the downstream surface waters are
indicating reduction in quality.
(c) Inspections will be conducted on an as-needed basis, should
the Borough feel that a problem exists. All inspections will be
undertaken in accordance with local, state and federal
requirements for property owner notification and permission.
(3) Conflicts. All other ordinances, parts of ordinances, or other local
requirements that are inconsistent or in conflict with this section
are hereby superseded to the extent of any inconsistency or
conflict, and the provisions of this section apply.
(4) Severability.
(a) Interpretation. This section shall be so construed as not to
conflict with any provision of New Jersey or federal law.

invalid or unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction,
all remaining provisions of the Ordinance shall continue to be
of full force and effect.
(c) The provisions of this section shall be cumulative with, and not
in substitution for, all other applicable zoning, planning and
land use regulations.
L. Enforcement. A prompt investigation shall be made by the appropriate
personnel of the Borough of Madison of any person or entity believed to
be in violation hereof. If, upon inspection, a condition which is in
violation of this section is discovered, a civil action may be brought in
the Special Part of the Superior Court, or in the Superior Court, if the
primary relief sought is injunctive or if penalties may exceed the
jurisdictional limit of the Special Civil Part, by the filing and serving of
appropriate process. Nothing in this section shall be construed to
preclude the right of the Borough of Madison, pursuant to N.J.S.A.
26:3A2-25, to initiate legal proceedings hereunder in Municipal Court.
The violation of any section or subsection of this section shall constitute
a separate and distinct offense independent of the violation of any other
section or subsection, or of any order issued pursuant to this section.
Each day a violation continues shall be considered a separate offense.
M. Penalties. Any person(s) found to be in violation of the provisions of this
section shall be subject to a fine not to exceed $500 per violation, with
each day or documented act or occurrence to be considered a separate
violation.

§ 195-38 MADISON CODE § 195-38
191:940
§ 195-39. Specific floodplain requirements.
B. Permits. No person or persons shall engage in a permitted use within a
delineated floodplain until all necessary permits have been obtained
from those governmental agencies from which approval is required,
including Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act
amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C. § 1334.
C. Conditions. The Board may impose such conditions on permitted uses
as it deems appropriate to promote the public safety, health and
welfare, to protect public and private property, wildlife and fisheries
and to preserve, protect and enhance the natural environment of the
floodplain. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued unless all
conditions of approval have been complied with.
A. Preservation of natural land.
(1) It is hereby found that natural floodplains display complex intimate
relationships among streams, periodic flooding, soils, vegetation,
fish and wildlife and that periodic flooding of lowland areas,
marshes and swamps adjacent to stream channels produces a rich
physical chemical environment for many living organisms. It is
further found that floodplains contain biological communities
which are among the most productive of natural systems and
perform the following functions essential to the natural
environment:
(a) Passage and storage of storm floodwaters.
(b) Removal of sediment loads from streams through deposition.
(c) Replenishment of groundwater supplies through soil
infiltration.
(d) Dissipation of energy of flood flows, thereby reducing
downstream destruction.
(e) Provide areas of recreational and aesthetic pleasure.
(2) Because of the importance of the natural floodplain as cited above
all natural land within any delineated floodplain, except for land to
be developed in accordance with this chapter, shall be preserved in
its natural state, and where possible, developed land within the
floodplain shall be restored to its natural state so as to duplicate
the natural or undeveloped drainage characteristics in terms of
runoff and velocity.
(3) Whenever the alteration or relocation of a watercourse is required,
the applicant shall notify the Federal Insurance Administrator, New
Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, County of Morris,
and adjacent communities. The applicant shall assure that the
§ 195-38 WATER EMERGENCIES § 195-39
191:941
flood-carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of
any watercourse is maintained and conforms with the state plan.
B. Performance standards. In reviewing any proposed construction or
development, the Board shall be reasonably assured upon evidence
submitted by the applicant that any structure, when built or altered,
can be occupied without peril to the health or safety of the occupant
and that the proposed land use:
(1) Has an inherent low flood-damage potential.
(2) Either acting alone or in combination with existing or future uses,
does not obstruct flood flows.
(3) Does not affect adversely the water-carrying or storage capacity of
any channel floodway or flood fringe area.
(4) Does not increase erosion or the rate of local runoff.
(5) Does not unduly stress or degrade the natural environment of the
floodplain or degrade the quality of surface water or the quality and
quantity of groundwaters.
(6) Does not require channel modification or relocation.
(7) Is set forth in Article V as a permitted use for that portion of the
floodplain where proposed and is not a prohibited use as set forth
below.
C. Prohibited uses in channels, floodways and flood fringe areas.
(1) Channel. Within any channel, structures shall not be erected,
expanded or externally altered, and fill, excavation or other
improvements or changes shall not be permitted except in
connection with stream improvement or stabilization, which
improvements or changes shall have the specific approval of the
New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and the
Board. The Morris County Planning Board shall receive copies of all
exhibits for their review and approval as required.
(2) Floodway.
(a) Within any floodway, structures shall not be erected, enlarged,
expanded or externally altered, and fill, excavation or other
improvements or changes shall not be permitted, except in
connection with stream improvement or stabilization, which
improvement or changes shall have the specific approval of the
New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and the
Board. The Morris County Planning Board shall receive copies
of all exhibits for their review and approval as required.
(b) The accepted practices of soil husbandry and farming, as well
as recreational uses in the nature of parks, playgrounds, picnic
§ 195-39 MADISON CODE § 195-39
191:942
areas, golf courses and boat landings shall be permitted in
accordance with the issuance of a permit as provided by
§ 195-38B of this article. No material, equipment or vehicles
shall be parked or stored in the floodway, even in conjunction
with a permitted use.
(c) In all areas of special flood hazard in which base flood
elevation data has been provided and no floodway has been
designated, the cumulative effect of any proposed
development, when combined with all other existing and
anticipated development, shall not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood more than 0.2 of a foot at any point.
(3) Flood fringe area. Within any flood fringe area, structures other
than mobile homes may be constructed, erected, enlarged,
expanded, externally altered or modified, and fill, excavation and
other improvements may be permitted in the flood fringe area after
receiving specific approval of the Board for a use allowed in Article
V and further subject to the conditions set forth in this article.
(4) Upon application for such a permit, the Board shall notify the
Borough Environmental Commission and the governing bodies and
environmental commissions of other municipalities which may be
affected by the proposed use. Such notifications shall include the
name and address of the applicant, the location of the proposed use
and abbreviated description of the proposed use and
announcement as to where and at what times the complete
application may be reviewed and to whom and by what date
interested parties may communicate their positions concerning the
application and any data that they may have developed in reference
to the effects of the proposed use. The Board shall review the
application and all information received under § 195-38.
(5) In reviewing the application and arriving at findings, the Board
shall consult with the Borough Engineer and other experts and
consider the following criteria in addition to those set forth in
§ 195-38.
(a) The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights
or velocities caused by encroachments.
(b) The danger that materials may be swept onto other land or
downstream to the injury of others.
(c) The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the
insulation of these systems from disease, contamination and
unsanitary conditions resulting from flooding.
(d) The susceptibility of the proposed use to flood damage and the
effects of such damage.
(e) The need for a waterfront location.
§ 195-39 WATER EMERGENCIES § 195-39
191:943
(f) The availability of alternate locations not subject to flooding.
(g) The duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of
floodwaters expected at the site.
(h) The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
(i) The extent to which the hydraulic capacity of the floodway will
be disrupted.
(j) The degree to which the proposed use serves the general
public's health, safety and welfare.
(k) The degree to which any aspect of food chain or plant, animal,
fish or human life processes are affected adversely within or
beyond the proposed use area.
(l) The degree to which the proposed activity alters natural water
flow or water temperature.
(m) The degree to which the proposed use provides facilities for
the proper handling of litter, trash, refuse and sanitary and
industrial waste.
(n) The degree to which irreplaceable land types will be destroyed.
(o) The degree to which the natural, scenic and aesthetic values at
the proposed development site can be retained.
(p) The degree to which materials not subject to major damage by
floods are firmly anchored to prevent flotation and/or are
readily removable from the area within the time available after
flood warning.
(6) If the Board finds that the proposed use would violate or tend to
violate the purposes and intent of this article, the application shall
be denied.
D. Conditions of approval for permitted uses. If the application will not
violate the purposes and intent of this chapter, the Board may approve
the application and impose such conditions as are necessary to promote
the public safety, health and welfare, to protect public and private
property, wildlife and to preserve, protect and enhance the natural
environment of the floodplain.
(1) General conditions. These conditions may include, but are not
limited to, the following:
(a) Modification of waste disposal and water supply facilities.

equal to not less than twice the height of the retaining wall
or five feet, whichever is the greater.
(b) All new residential construction, residential additions and
substantial improvements of residential structures within the
floodplain shall have the lowest floor (including basement)
elevated to not less than six inches above the base flood
elevation. For purposes of site plan review and approval, the
requirement of six inches above the base flood elevation shall
not include a detached garage; nor shall it include a patio,
terrace, deck or an unheated and unenclosed porch, provided
that any entrance from such a structure to a main structure
shall be a minimum of six inches above the base flood
elevation. The floor of an attached garage may be not more
than two feet below the base flood elevation, provided that the
§ 195-39 WATER EMERGENCIES § 195-39
191:945
portions of all walls and partitions below the base flood
elevation are floodproofed and further provided that any
entrance from an attached garage to a main structure shall be
a minimum of six inches above the base flood elevation.
(c) All new nonresidential construction within the floodplain shall
have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to not less
than one foot above the base flood elevation or be floodproofed
as set forth in Subsection D(2)(d) below. Floodproofing alone
shall not be considered adequate for residences, hospitals,
nursing homes, schools, day-care centers and similar uses.
(d) Floodproofing measures shall be consistent with the base flood
elevation for the particular area, flood velocities, durations,
rates of rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces and other
similar factors. The Board shall require the applicant to submit
a plan or document certified by a registered professional
engineer that the floodproofing measures are consistent with
the base flood elevation and associated flood factors. Any or all
of the following floodproofing measures may be required:
[1] Anchorage to resist flotation, collapse and lateral
movement.
[2] Installation of watertight doors, bulkheads and shutters or
similar devices.
[3] Reinforced walls to resist water pressures.
[4] Use of paints, membranes or mortars to reduce seepage of
water through walls.
[5] Addition of weight to structures to resist flotation.
[6] Installation of pumps to lower water levels in structures.
[7] Pumping facilities or comparable measures for the
subsurface drainage systems of buildings to relieve
external foundation wall and basement flood pressures.
[8] Construction that resists rupture or collapse caused by
water pressure or floating debris.
[9] Installation of valves or controls on sanitary and storm
drains which will permit the drains to be closed to prevent
back up of sewage or stormwaters into the structure.
Gravity drainage of basements may be eliminated by
mechanical devices.
[10] Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and airconditioning
equipment and other service facilities shall
be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from
§ 195-39 MADISON CODE § 195-39
191:946
entering or accumulating within the components during
conditions of flooding.
[11] Storage facilities for chemicals, explosives, buoyant
materials, flammable liquids or other toxic or hazardous
materials shall be situated above the base flood elevation
and shall be floodproofed to prevent flotation of storage
containers or damage to storage containers which could
result in the escape of toxic materials into the floodwaters.
[12] Use of construction materials which are resistant to water
damage.
[13] For all new construction and substantial improvements,
fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject
to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for
the entry exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this
requirement must either be certified by a registered
professional engineer or architect or must meet or exceed
the following minimum criteria:
[a] Fully enclosed areas shall have a minimum of two
openings having a total net area of not less than one
square inch for every square foot of enclosed area
subject to flooding one foot above grade.
[b] Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers or
other coverings or devices, provided that they permit
the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.
(e) All manufactured homes shall be anchored to resist flotation,
collapse or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may
include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties
to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to
applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting
wind forces. All manufactured homes to be placed or
substantially improved within an area of special flood hazard
shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the top
of the lowest floor is at or above the base flood elevation.
E. Materials prohibited in channels, floodways and flood fringe areas. No
person shall hereafter engage in, cause or permit other persons to
engage in prohibited uses within a delineated floodplain. The following
uses shall be prohibited:
(1) Placing, depositing or dumping any solid waste, garbage, refuse,
trash, rubbish or debris.
(2) Dumping or discharging untreated domestic sewage or industrial
wastes, either solid or liquid.
§ 195-39 WATER EMERGENCIES § 195-39
191:947
§ 195-40. Flood insurance.
(3) The storage or disposal of pesticides.
(4) The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of flooding,
buoyant, flammable or explosive.
(5) The storage or processing of hazardous materials that could be
injurious in time of flooding to human, animal or plant life.
F. Preexisting nonconforming structures and uses.
(1) Structures or land uses in any floodplain which existed on or before
the effective date of this chapter may be permitted to continue,
subject to the following conditions:
(a) If any preexisting structure is destroyed by any means,
including floods, to an extent of 50% or more of its replacement
cost at time of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed, except
in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.
(b) No preexisting structure shall be moved, altered, expanded,
changed or enlarged unless the provisions of this chapter are
complied with. This provision does not apply to routine
maintenance and repair, provided that such maintenance and
repair does not increase the flood damage potential of the
structure.
(c) In any portion of the floodplain, an existing nonconforming use
or structure may be altered or expanded, provided that such
alteration or expansion does not increase its ground coverage
or flood damage potential.
(2) If actual construction of a structure is underway on or before the
effective date of this chapter, then such construction may be
completed. "Actual construction" is hereby defined to include the
placing of construction materials in a permanent position and
fastened in a permanent manner. The provisions of Subsection F(1)
above shall apply to such structures upon completion of
construction.
(3) Structures in the floodway abandoned for six consecutive months
or longer and structures abandoned for 12 consecutive months or
longer in the flood fringe area after the effective date of this
chapter shall not qualify as preexisting uses.
G. Flood map. The Board, after proper investigation, survey and public
hearing, may recommend amendments to the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development Flood Map.
A. Flood insurance, in accordance with the National Flood Insurance
Program of the United States Department of Housing and Urban
Development, shall be required for all development in the floodplain.
§ 195-39 MADISON CODE § 195-40
191:948
§ 195-41. Variances.
Insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to
actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance,
except as defined in § 195-41 of this article.
B. The Federal Insurance Rate Map shall be used to determine applicable
zones for flood insurance for a particular dwelling. The applicant shall
verify that the latest available flood elevations and the Federal
Insurance Rate Maps are being utilized in the determination of the
flood elevations.
C. The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Insurance
Administration in a scientific and engineering report entitled "The
Flood Insurance Study for the Borough of Madison," dated April 15,
2002, as subsequently amended with accompanying Flood Insurance
Rate Maps or any approved subsequent revision, is hereby adopted by
reference and declared to be a part of this article. The Flood Insurance
Study is on file at the Engineer's Office in the Borough of Madison.
A. The issuance of a variance is for floodplain management purposes only
and is subject to applicable state and federal laws and regulations. The
Board, after examining the applicant's hardships, shall approve or
disapprove a variance request.
B. While the granting of variances generally is limited to a lot size less
than 1/2 acre as set forth in Subsection E(2) of this section, deviations
from that limitation may occur. However, as the lot size increases
beyond 1/2 acre, the technical justification required for issuing a
variance increases.
C. The Federal Insurance Administrator may review the Board's findings
justifying the granting of variances, and if that review indicated a
pattern inconsistent with the objectives of sound floodplain
management, the Federal Insurance Administrator may take
appropriate action as set forth in Section 1909.24, Paragraph (b) of
Federal Register, Vol. 41, No. 207, dated Tuesday, October 26, 1976,
and as subsequently amended.
D. Variances may be issued by the Board for the reconstruction,
rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National
Register of Historic Places or a State Inventory of Historic Places
without regard to the procedures set forth in this section.
E. Procedures for the granting of variances by the Board are as follows:
(1) Variances shall not be issued by the Board within any designated
regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base
flood discharge would result.
(2) Variances may be issued by the Board only for the replacement or
reconstruction of existing nonconforming structures and for
§ 195-40 WATER EMERGENCIES § 195-41
191:949
§ 195-41.1. Wetland protection.
additions of not more than 150 square feet to existing residential
structures on lots of 1/2 acre or less in size contiguous to and
surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the
base flood elevation, in conformance with the procedures of
Subsection E(3) of this section.
(3) Variances shall only be issued by the Board upon:
(a) A showing of good and sufficient cause by the applicant, and
(b) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and
(c) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on
or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws
or ordinances.
(4) Variance shall only be issued after public hearing as required in
Article II, § 195-10C, upon determination that the variance is the
minimum necessary to afford relief, considering the flood hazard.
(5) The Board shall notify the applicant in writing that:
(a) The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the
base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood
insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance
coverage.
(b) Such construction below the base flood elevation increases
risks to life and property. Such notification shall be maintained
with a record of all variance actions as required in Subsection
E(6) of this section.
(6) The Board shall:
(a) Maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification
for their issuance.
(b) Report such variances issued in its annual report submitted to
the Federal Insurance Administrator.
(7) A burden of proof to establish all of the elements required for the
issuance of a variance shall be upon the applicant, who shall prove
these elements by expert testimony and documentation.
A. Wetland delineation. A wetlands letter of interpretation (LOI) from the
New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) shall be
submitted as part of the application for any major subdivision or major
site plan application. A minor subdivision application or a building
§ 195-41 MADISON CODE § 195-41.1
191:950
§ 195-41.2. Steep slopes analysis.
permit application for an individual lot shall be required to perform an
on-site wetland delineation as prepared by a wetland expert suitably
qualified to submit an LOI, but no LOI will be required by this section. If
wetlands or transition areas are present that could be impacted by the
proposed improvements, an NJDEP approved LOI shall be submitted
with the minor subdivision application or building permit application. If
no wetlands are observed, a note to that effect shall be shown on the
plans.
(1) Documentation. All wetland and transition areas required pursuant
to N.J.A.C. 7:7A-1 et seq. (New Jersey Freshwater Wetlands
Protection Act Rules) or any successor statutes or regulations shall
be clearly shown on all plats or site plans submitted for approval.
(2) All final plats, final site plans or individual lot building plans shall
include the wetland line(s) identification number as assigned by
NJDEP, pursuant to the Freshwater Wetlands Protection Act.
B. Wetland protection standards. To prevent adverse impacts on
delineated wetlands, the following guidelines shall be employed:
(1) A snow fence shall be installed along the limit of disturbance
outside of the final wetland transition area boundary line prior to
any other site disturbance, so as to prevent encroachment into
these regulated areas.
(2) A silt fence and/or hay bales should be installed downstream from
disturbance areas adjacent to the state-mandated wetland
transition area line (or buffer) so as to prevent the transport of silt
into the wetland areas.
(3) Prior to signing of the final plat for site plan, the applicant shall
provide evidence of the filing of any deed restriction required by
NJDEP to permit transition area modifications.
C. Conservation easement. When an LOI or wetlands delineation is
required under Subsection A above, all wetlands and transition areas to
remain undeveloped shall be protected by a conservation easement.
A. The purpose of this subsection is to regulate the intensity of use in
areas of steeply sloping terrain in order to limit soil loss and erosion
and the degradation of surface water. Steep slopes are present on a site
when the existing terrain has a slope of 15% or greater as defined
below:
(1) A slope is considered a moderate slope when the grade of the
existing terrain ranges from 15% to 25%.
(2) A slope is considered a critical slope when the grade of the existing
terrain is 25% or greater.
§ 195-41.1 WATER EMERGENCIES § 195-41.2
191:951
§ 195-42. Appeals.
If any person shall be aggrieved by the action of the Board, Construction
Code Official or Borough Engineer, an appeal in writing to the governing
body may be taken within 10 days after the date of such action. The
governing body shall fix and notify the appellant of a time and place for
a public hearing on said appeal, and the appellant shall cause notice of
such hearing to be published in the official newspaper of the Borough at
least 10 days prior to the hearing. All parties in interest shall be afforded
an opportunity to be heard there. After such hearing, the governing body
shall affirm or reverse the action of the Board, Construction Code Official
or Borough Engineer, stating its findings and reasons for its action, and a
written copy of such action shall be given to the appellant.
§ 195-43. Administration and enforcement.
B. If the steep slopes are present on the subject property, the applicant
shall prepare a steep slope map showing topography at two-foot
contour intervals. The moderate and critical slopes shall be determined
based upon the slope of all the land areas showing slope classes of 0%
to 14.99%, 15% to 24.99% and 25% or greater. The map shall also
include a calculation of the area of proposed disturbance of each slope
class on each existing and proposed lot, as well as within any proposed
road right-of-way, and be regulated as follows:
(1) Areas with slopes ranging from 0% to 14.99% are not restricted to
development.
(2) Areas of moderate slopes shall require detailed site grading and
architectural plans which focus on minimizing development activity
in these areas. Up to 1/4 of all moderate slopes identified on-site
are permitted to be developed. The architectural plans must be
specifically designed to accommodate the topography. Roads and
driveways should be designed to follow the natural topography to
the greatest extent possible and minimize disturbance.
(3) Areas of critical slopes are restricted from development unless the
disturbance is for roadway crossings or utility construction, or it is
demonstrated that the roadway or utility improvements are critical
and no reasonable alternatives exist. The applicant may be
required to provide additional documentation of soil types, land
cover, tree surveys, stability calculations or field controls on
specific encroachment areas in order to justify the control of
impacts.
C. Disturbance of steep slope areas in an amount greater than that
indicated in the foregoing section shall require variance.
A. The administration and enforcement of the provisions of this article
relating to the construction, erection, maintenance and continued
operation at design capacity of stormwater detention facilities and
§ 195-41.2 MADISON CODE § 195-43
191:952
other facilities, structures, devices and techniques required to carry out
the objectives of this article shall be the responsibility of the Borough
Engineer.
B. Failure to maintain any stormwater detention facility, structure or
device at design capacity or to carry out required procedures or
techniques shall be considered a violation of this article.
C. When base flood elevation and floodway data have not been provided by
the Federal Insurance Administrator, the Borough Engineer shall
obtain, maintain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation
data available from any federal, state or other source in order to
administer this Article VI.
D. The Borough Engineer shall maintain a permanent record of on-site
water detention facilities in the Borough of Madison and shall make
periodic inspections to determine that these facilities are being
maintained at design capacities.
E. The permanent record maintained by the Borough Engineer shall
include the following information: elevation in feet above sea level of
the lowest habitable floor and basement of all new construction and
substantial improvements; and elevation to which a structure has been
floodproofed. These records shall be made available for public
inspection and be supplied upon request for the purpose of determining
flood insurance premium rates.
F. The Borough Engineer shall serve notice on the owner or occupant to
correct any violation of Article VI within 30 days. Upon failure of said
owner or occupant to correct such violation, the Borough shall
prosecute a complaint to correct such violation before the Municipal
Judge and owner or occupant shall be liable to pay fines in accordance
with this chapter not to exceed $1,500 per violation.

ARTICLE VII
Soil Erosion and Sediment Control; Soil Moving
[Amended 3-9-1992 by Ord. No. 9-1992; 7-22-2002 by Ord. No.
26-2002]
§ 195-44. Soil erosion and sediment control.
A. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to control soil erosion and the
resulting sedimentation from occurring by requiring proper provisions
for water disposal and the protection of soil surfaces during and after
construction in order to promote the safety, public health, convenience
and general welfare of the community. These rules and regulations
further adopt the purposes of P.L. 1975, Chapter 251, N.J.S.A.4:29-39 et
seq. and N.J.A.C., Chapter 90, Title 2, entitled "Soil Erosion and
Sediment Control Act."
B. Control plan. No site plan or land subdivision involving more than two
acres or containing more than three lots shall be approved by any board
unless it includes a soil erosion and sediment control plan in
accordance with the "Standards for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control
in New Jersey" as adopted by the State Soil Conservation Committee on
April 12, 1999, or most recent revision (reference standards) and
enforced by the Morris County Soil Conservation District and further in
these regulations by the Borough of Madison. The Board may require a
soil erosion and sediment control plan for any exempted project, if, in
its judgment, the topography of the site requires consideration of soil
erosion and sediment control plans. No certificate of occupancy for any
building will be granted unless all needed soil erosion control measures
have been completed or substantially provided for in accordance with
this section. The applicant shall bear the responsibility for the
installation and construction of all required soil erosion and sediment
control measures according to the provisions of this chapter. The
applicant may consult with the Morris County Soil Conservation District
in the development of the plan and the selection of appropriate erosion
and sediment control measures.
C. Data required. The applicant shall submit a soil erosion and sediment
control plan for the entire tract of land. The soil erosion and sediment
control plan shall contain:
(1) Plans and specifications of soil erosion and sediment control
measures in accordance with the reference standards.
(2) A site-specific timing schedule indicating the anticipated starting
and completion dates of the development sequence in accordance
with reference standards and also the time of exposure of each area
prior to the completion of effective erosion and sediment control
measures.
D. Permits. No land subject to this section shall be cleared, graded,
transported or otherwise disturbed for any purpose, including but not
§ 195-44 WATER EMERGENCIES § 195-44
191:955
limited to the construction of buildings, the mining of minerals or
removal of other natural resources, the development of golf courses or
other recreational facilities and the construction of roads and streets by
any person, partnership or corporation within the Borough, unless:
(1) There has been a plan approved by the Board that provides for
minimizing soil erosion and sedimentation consistent with this
chapter and there has been a valid grading permit issued by the
Borough Engineer; or
(2) There has been a determination by the Board that a plan for
minimizing soil erosion and sedimentation is not necessary.
E. Preparation of plans. The plans shall be prepared and duly signed and
sealed by a professional engineer, architect or land surveyor.
F. Implementation. Since considerable soil erosion can take place during
land disturbance, development plans shall contain proposed soil
erosion and sediment control measures. These measures shall be
incorporated into the final plat and final construction drawings. Soil
erosion and sediment control measures shall conform to the reference
standards. The measures shall apply to all features of the construction
site, including street and utility installations, as well as to the
protection of individual lots. Measures shall also be instituted to
prevent or control soil erosion and sedimentation during the various
stages of development.
G. General design principles. The following principles are effective in
minimizing soil erosion and sedimentation and shall be included, where
applicable, in the soil erosion and sediment control plan:
(1) Stripping of vegetation, regrading or other development shall be
done in such a way that will minimize soil erosion.
(2) Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected
and supplemented.
(3) The disturbed area and the duration of exposure shall be kept to a
practical minimum.
(4) Temporary seedings and/or mulching shall be used to protect
exposed critical areas during development.
(5) Provisions shall be made to accommodate the increased runoff
caused by changed soil and surface conditions during and after
development.
(6) Sediment in the runoff water shall be trapped until the disturbed
area is stabilized by the use of sediment basins or other acceptable
methods.
§ 195-44 MADISON CODE § 195-44
191:956
(7) Diversions, sediment basins and so forth shall be constructed prior
to any other on-site grading or disturbance of existing surface
material.
H. Detailed design standards. Standards and specifications for measures
used in the soil erosion and sediment control plan shall be in
accordance with the reference standards. Copies of "Standards for Soil
Erosion and Sediment Control in New Jersey" of the Morris County Soil
Conservation District shall be on file in the offices of the Morris County
Soil Conservation District and the Borough Clerk.
I. Maintenance of control measures. Applicants or developers or
subsequent owners of property carrying out soil erosion and sediment
control measures under this article shall adequately maintain all
permanent soil erosion control measures, devices and plantings in
effective working condition.
J. Maintenance bond. Upon the certification of the Borough Engineer that
any permanent soil erosion and sediment control measures installed by
individuals or developers pursuant to this chapter have a direct effect
on public improvements in the vicinity of the proposed development,
the Board shall require the individual or developer to post a surety
maintenance bond with the Borough Clerk for an amount equal to 10%
of the improvements constructed. A direct effect on public
improvements shall mean that should the soil erosion and sediment
control measures constructed by a developer or applicant be destroyed,
fail to operate properly, be removed or any other such happenstance,
such occurrence would prevent or hinder the proper operation of a
public improvement in that vicinity. The value of the improvements
constructed shall be determined by the Borough Engineer, and the
surety maintenance bond shall be in a form acceptable to the Borough
Attorney. The maintenance bond shall be for a term of two years.
K. Fees. A fee of $20 per acre (with a minimum fee of $100) shall be paid to
the Board for each soil erosion and sediment control plan filed with the
Board to cover the cost of reviewing said plan and any on-site
inspections by the Borough Engineer.
L. Enforcement. The requirements of this section shall be enforced by the
Borough Engineer, who shall inspect or require adequate inspection of
the work. If the Borough Engineer finds any existing conditions not as
stated in any application, he may refuse to approve further work or
notify the district of noncompliance. The Morris County Soil
Conservation District or Borough of Madison may issue a stop-work
order if the applicant/owner takes no action to comply with the
approved plan.
M. Violations and penalties. Any person, firm or corporation who or which
shall violate any provision of this section shall be liable to a fine not
exceeding $2,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 90 days,
§ 195-44 WATER EMERGENCIES § 195-44
191:957
§ 195-45. Soil moving.
or both. Each day such violation continues shall constitute a separate
violation or offense. [Amended 5-8-2006 by Ord. No. 19-2006]
N. Appeal. If any person against whom a stop-work order is issued by the
district or local authority is aggrieved by such action, said person may,
within 10 days, appeal to the State Soil Conservation Committee which
shall schedule a hearing and make a determination in the case.
A. Permit required. No person shall remove or deposit soil on any
premises in the Borough of Madison other than on the premises from
which the soil shall be moved, unless a permit therefor is first secured
from the Borough Council as hereinafter set forth; provided, however,
that no permit shall be required for the following:
(1) The moving of excess soil resulting from foundation or cellar
excavations up to 100 cubic yards total.
(2) The moving of soil upon any lot containing less than 20,000 square
feet on which there is an existing one- or two-family dwelling.
(3) The moving of soil for gardening primarily for home consumption
or landscaping for aesthetic purposes, not to exceed 20% of the lot
area and 100 cubic yards.
(4) The moving of soil which does not result in either substantial
changes in grade and/or elevation or does not significantly alter
drainage runoff patterns from said lot.

opinion that the proposed soil moving will not create conditions
detrimental to the public health, welfare and safety; will not result
in the creation of any sharp declivities, pits or depressions, soil

ARTICLE VIII
Affordable Housing Development Fees
[Added 6-13-2005 by Ord. No. 19-2005; amended 12-11-2006 by
Ord. No. 57-2006; 5-30-2007 by Ord. No. 36-2007; 9-10-2007 by
Ord. No. 59-2007]
§ 195-46. Fees; exemptions; collection; housing trust fund; use of
fees.
A. Purpose.
(1) In Holmdel Builder's Association v. Holmdel Township, 121 N.J. 550
(1990), the New Jersey Supreme Court determined that mandatory
development fees are authorized by the Fair Housing Act of 1985,
N.J.S.A. 52:27d-301 et seq., and the State Constitution, subject to
the Council on Affordable Housing's (COAH's) adoption of rules.
This article establishes standards for the collection, maintenance,
and expenditure of development fees pursuant to COAH's rules.
Fees collected pursuant to this article shall be used for the sole
purpose of providing low- and moderate-income housing. This
article shall be interpreted within the framework of COAH's rules
on development fees.
B. Basic requirements. The Borough of Madison shall continue to collect
development fees, and shall spend those development fees in
accordance with any spending plan approved by COAH or approved in
the court action. [Amended 7-11-2016 by Ord. No. 52-2016]
C. Definitions. The following terms, as used in this article, shall have the
following meanings:
AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT  A development included
in the housing element and fair share plan and includes, but is not
limited to, an inclusionary development, a municipal construction
project or a one-hundred-percent affordable development.
COAH  The New Jersey Council on Affordable Housing.
DEVELOPMENT FEE  Funds paid by an individual, person,
partnership, association, company or corporation for the improvement
of property as permitted in COAH's rules.
EQUALIZED ASSESSED VALUE  The value of a property determined
by the municipal tax assessor through a process designed to ensure that
all property in the municipality is assessed at the same assessment ratio
or ratios required by law. Estimates at the time of issuance of a building
permit may be obtained utilizing estimates for construction cost. Final
equalized assessed value will be determined at project completion by
the municipal tax assessor.
D. Residential development fees.
§ 195-46 WATER EMERGENCIES § 195-46
191:965
(1) Within all zoning districts(s), developers of new residential
housing, which shall include any residential development on an
existing lot on which a former residential structure was located,
within the Borough shall pay a fee of 1% of the equalized assessed
value for residential development, provided no increased density is
permitted.
(2) When an increase in residential density pursuant to N.J.S.A.
40:55D-70d(5) (known as a "d" variance) has been permitted,
developers may be required to pay a development fee of 6% of the
equalized assessed value for each additional unit that may be
realized. However, if the zoning on a site has changed during the
two-year period preceding the filing of such a variance application,
the base density for the purposes of calculating the bonus
development fee shall be the highest density permitted by right
during the two-year period preceding the filing of the variance
application.
(3) No fee shall be charged pursuant to this section for any addition or
improvement to an existing residential structure, so long as such
addition or improvement does not increase the equalized assessed
value of the existing structure, as of the date hereof, by more than
50%.
E. Nonresidential development fees. Nonresidential development fees
shall be collected in accordance with The New Jersey Non-Residential
Development Fee Act, N.J.S.A. 40:55D-8.1 through 8.8. [Amended
7-11-2016 by Ord. No. 52-2016]
F. Eligible exactions, ineligible exactions and exemptions.
(1) Affordable housing developments shall be exempt from
development fees. All other forms of new construction shall be
subject to development fees unless exempted below.
(2) Developments that have received preliminary or final approval
prior to the imposition of a municipal development fee shall be
exempt from development fees unless the developer seeks a
substantial change in the approval.
(3) Subject to the provisions of § 195-46D(3), development fees shall
be imposed and collected when an existing structure is expanded
or undergoes a change to a more intense use. The development fee
shall be calculated on the increase in the equalized assessed value
of the improved structure.
(4) Developments that are providing for greater affordable housing
pursuant to § 195-48 and are subject to § 195-48 shall not be
subject to the development fee pursuant to this § 195-46.
[Amended 7-11-2016 by Ord. No. 52-2016]
§ 195-46 MADISON CODE § 195-46
191:966
G. Collection of fees. Fifty percent of the development fee will be collected
at the time of issuance of the building permit. The remaining portion
will be collected at the issuance of the certificate of occupancy. The
developer shall be responsible for paying the difference between the
fee calculated at building permit and that determined at issuance of
certificate of occupancy.
H. Contested fees. Imposed and collected development fees that are
challenged shall be placed in an interest-bearing escrow account by the
Borough of Madison. If all or a portion of the contested fees are
returned to the developer, the accrued interest on the returned amount
shall also be returned.
I. Affordable housing trust fund.
(1) There is hereby created a separate, interest-bearing housing trust
fund for the purpose of depositing development fees collected from
residential and nonresidential developers and proceeds from the
sale of units with extinguished controls. All development fees paid
by developers pursuant to this article shall be deposited into this
fund.
(2) Within seven days from the opening of the trust fund account, the
Borough of Madison shall provide COAH with written
authorization, in the form of a three-party escrow agreement
between the municipality, the bank, and COAH to permit COAH to
direct the disbursement of the funds as provided for in N.J.A.C.
5:94-6.16(b).
(3) No funds shall be expended from the affordable housing trust fund
unless the expenditure conforms to a spending plan approved by
COAH. All interest accrued in the housing trust fund shall only be
used on eligible affordable housing activities approved by COAH.
J. Use of funds.
(1) Funds deposited in the housing trust fund may be used for any
activity approved by COAH to address the municipal fair share.
Such activities include, but are not limited to: rehabilitation, new
construction, ECHO housing, purchase of land for affordable
housing, improvement of land to be used for affordable housing,
purchase of housing, extensions or improvements of roads and
infrastructure to affordable housing sites, financial assistance
designed to increase affordability, or administration necessary for
implementation of the housing element and fair share plan. The
expenditure of all funds shall conform to a spending plan approved
by COAH or a spending plan approved in the court action.
[Amended 7-11-2016 by Ord. No. 52-2016]
(2) Funds shall not be expended to reimburse the Borough of Madison
for past housing activities.
§ 195-46 WATER EMERGENCIES § 195-46
191:967
(3) After subtracting development fees collected to finance a
rehabilitation program or a new construction project that are
necessary to address the Borough of Madison's affordable housing
obligation, at least 30% of the balance remaining shall be used to
provide affordability assistance to low- and moderate-income
households in affordable units included in the municipal fair share
plan. One-third of the affordability assistance portion of
development fees collected shall be used to provide affordability
assistance to those households earning 30% or less of median
income by region. [Amended 7-11-2016 by Ord. No. 52-2016]
(a) Affordability assistance programs may include down payment
assistance, security deposit assistance, low-interest loans, and
rental assistance.
(b) Affordability assistance to households earning 30% or less of
median income may include buying down the cost of low- or
moderate-income units in the third round municipal fair share
plan to make them affordable to households earning 30% or
less of median income. The use of development fees in this
manner shall entitle the Borough of Madison to bonus credits
pursuant to N.J.A.C. 5:94-4.22.
(c) Payments in lieu of constructing affordable units on site and
funds from the sale of units with extinguished controls shall be
exempt from the affordability assistance requirement.
(4) The Borough of Madison may contract with a private or public
entity to administer any part of its housing element and fair share
plan, including the requirement for affordability assistance, in
accordance with N.J.A.C. 5:94-7.
(5) No more than 20% of the revenues collected from development fees
each year shall be expended on administration, including, but not
limited to, salaries and benefits for municipal employees or
consultant fees necessary to develop or implement a new
construction program, a housing element and fair share plan, and/
or an affirmative marketing program. In the case of a rehabilitation
program, no more than 20% of the revenues collected from
development fees shall be expended for such administrative
expenses. Administrative funds may be used for income
qualification of households, monitoring the turnover of sale and
rental units, and compliance with COAH's monitoring
requirements. Development fee administrative costs are calculated
and may be expended at the end of each year or upon receipt of the
fees. [Amended 7-11-2016 by Ord. No. 52-2016]
K. Monitoring. The Borough of Madison shall complete and return to
COAH all monitoring forms included in the annual monitoring report
related to the collection of development fees from residential and
nonresidential developers, payments in lieu of constructing affordable
§ 195-46 MADISON CODE § 195-46
191:968
units on site, funds from the sale of units with extinguished controls,
and the expenditure of revenues and implementation of the plan
certified by COAH. All monitoring reports shall be completed on forms
designed by COAH.173

immediately followed this subsection, was repealed 7-11-2016 by Ord. No. 52-2016.

monthly principal and interest, taxes, insurance and the
homeowners' association fees, if any. In making these calculations,
the following considerations shall govern:
(a) Mortgage payments shall be determined on the basis of a
thirty-year fixed-rate mortgage at the prevailing interest rate
obtainable from at least two major lenders in Morris County;
(b) Property taxes shall be determined by applying the equalized
property tax rate in the Borough of Madison currently in effect
to the proposed selling price of the unit;
(c) The developer shall use the best available assumptions to
determine the insurance and homeowners' association fees to
be applied to the units, subject to the approval of the
Administrator as to reasonableness only for use in this
calculation.
§ 195-47 MADISON CODE § 195-47
191:976
(d) Homeowners' association fees shall be set at a specified
percentage of those paid by market purchasers. This
percentage must be included in the master deed of any
inclusionary development.
(5) Rental prices shall be considered affordable where the household
renting the affordable housing unit will not spend more than 30% of
gross household income for rent, including utilities. Maximum rent
shall be calculated as a percentage of the regional median income
adopted by the COAH that applies to the rental housing unit. The
allowance for utilities shall be the personal benefit allowance for
utilities as defined by HUD.
(6) The Administrator shall submit all sales and rental prices, including
(where applicable) the proposed stratification, proposed
affordability level and documentation for all elements as set forth in
this section to the Madison Affordable Housing Corporation, which
may modify the prices where necessary to comply with this rule. No
representation with respect to the price of any low- and moderateincome
unit may be made by the Administrator until that price has
been approved by the Affordable Housing Corporation.
H. Procedures for resale transaction.
(1) All resale transactions of affordable housing units shall be
administrated by the Madison Affordable Housing Corporation.
From the date on which the MAHC receives notice of intent to sell
by the owner of a low- and moderate-income unit, the MAHC shall
have the exclusive right to purchase the unit or to refer prospective
purchasers to that unit for a period of 90 days unless waived in
writing by the MAHC. In the event that a contract for the unit is
executed within the ninety-day period set above and the
prospective buyer is unable to close, the period during which the
MAHC shall have the exclusive right to market the unit is
automatically extended for a period of 21 days from the date it is
notified of the buyer's inability to close.
(2) In the event no contract has been entered into for the unit at the
end of a ninety-day period, the owner of the unit may seek approval
from the MAHC to sell the unit directly. If the MAHC determines at
that point not to purchase the unit, it shall authorize the applicant
to sell the unit as follows. However, if the MAHC determines that
the failure to enter into a contract was the result of negligence,
absence of good faith effort or lack of cooperation on the part of the
Seller, the MAHC shall require the applicant to attempt to sell the
unit for an additional ninety-day period.
(a) In the case of a low-income unit, to a low- or moderate-income
buyer; or
(b) In the case of a moderate-income unit, to a buyer whose
income does not exceed 120% of median.
§ 195-47 WATER EMERGENCIES § 195-47
191:977
(c) Any subsequent sale shall be fully subject to the resale
restrictions contained in these regulations. The deed to the
above income purchaser shall specifically contain a deed
restriction establishing that it is subject to all the affordability
controls outlined in this section.
I. Calculation of resale price. The resale price of the affordable housing
unit shall be the base price increased pursuant to Subsection I(1) and
(2) herein.
(1) Percentage increase in household income. The price approved by
the MAHC at which the seller acquired the property shall be the
base price. The base price shall be multiplied by 100% plus the
percentage increase in the HUD uncapped median income by
family size for Morris County from the time of acquisition of the
property to the date that notice of intent to sell is given to the
MAHC. For example, if the base price is $100,000 and the median
income at the time of initial acquisition is $32,000 and at the time
of the resale transaction the median income has increased 25% to
$40,000, then the resale price is a follows:
100 + 25 = 1.25
100 100
$100,000 x 1.25 = $125,000
(2) Improvements.
(a) In addition, the seller shall be entitled to add to the selling
price of the unit, the cost of any eligible capital improvement,
affordable housing which pursuant to N.J.A.C. 5:92-12.8
renders the unit suitable for a larger household.
(b) Upon request of an owner of an affordable housing unit, the
MAHC shall consider within 30 days whether to grant prior
approval of an improvement and to approve a specific dollar
amount up to the amount actually expended for that
improvement.
J. Exempt sales.
(1) The following transactions shall be deemed nonsales for the
purpose of this plan. The owner of the affordable unit shall be
entitled to a statement of exemption from the MAHC upon
application.
(a) Transfer of an affordable housing unit between husband and
wife;
(b) Transfer of ownership of an affordable housing unit between
former spouses as a result of a judicial decree, judgment or
order of divorce, but not including sales to third parties;
§ 195-47 MADISON CODE § 195-47
191:978
(c) Transfer of ownership of an affordable housing unit as a result
of inheritance;
(d) Transfer of ownership of an affordable housing unit through an
order of the Superior court.
(2) A grant of exemption shall not eliminate the resale control
restrictions set forth in these regulations. Any subsequent sale
shall be subject to all of the terms of these regulations.
K. Rental increases. All rerental transactions shall be administered by the
MAHC. The rents of affordable housing units may increase based on the
percentage increase in median income for the Morris County housing
region as determined from the uncapped Section 8 income limits,
published by HUD, or other recognized standard adopted by COAH that
applies to the rental housing unit.
L. Rental of low- and moderate-income sales units. No owner of an
affordable housing unit may lease the unit to a tenant without prior
written approval of the MAHC. Such approval shall not be granted
except when justified by particular and unusual circumstances. An
owner seeking such approval shall submit a written request to the
MAHC setting forth the particular circumstances of the case, including
the reasons for the request to rent, the proposed duration of the
tenancy and certification that the proposed tenant is a qualified low- or
moderate-income household. In the event the MAHC approved the
request, it shall notify the owner of the unit. The owner shall rent the
unit only to a qualified low- or moderate-income tenant for the period
approved by MAHC at a rent affordable to a low- or moderate-income
tenant, whichever is applicable.
M. Conversion of rental units to sales units. Rental units may be converted
for sale as condominium, cooperative or fee-simple units, but any sale of
converted units shall continue to be restricted to persons meeting the
income eligibility standards as set forth in Subsection F unless COAH
otherwise requires.
N. Exemption from rent control ordinances. All rental units, both market
and affordable, shall not be subject to any rent control ordinance which
may be adopted in the Borough of Madison during the time period in
which the affordability housing price controls are effective.
O. Duration of controls.
(1) Except as otherwise provided in these regulations, all units for sale
or resale subject to the provisions of this section shall be subject to
resale and rental controls for a period of 30 years from the date of
acquisition of the unit by the initial purchaser or lessee. [Amended
1-28-2015 by Ord. No. 1-2015; 5-27-2015 by Ord. No.
35-2015]
§ 195-47 WATER EMERGENCIES § 195-47
191:979
(2) All lower-income dwelling units shall be covered by covenants to
ensure that in all initial sales and rentals, and in all subsequent
resales and rerentals, the units will continue to remain available
and affordable to the lower-income households for which they were
intended for the period specified in this subsection in accordance
with the requirements and standards established by COAH.
P. Expiration of controls.
(1) General provisions.
(a) The restrictive covenant governing the deeds of the low- and
moderate-income units shall include an option permitting
purchase of the affordable unit at the maximum allowable
restricted sales price at the time of the first nonexempt sale
after controls on affordability have been in effect on the unit
for the period specified in this section. The option to buy shall
be available to the Borough of Madison, the New Jersey
Department of Community Affairs (DCA), the New Jersey
Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency (NJHMFA), or a
qualified nonprofit as determined by the New Jersey Council on
Affordable Housing (COAH).
(b) All restrictive covenants governing low- and moderate-income
units shall require the owner to notify the MAHC by certified
mail of any intent to sell the unit 90 days prior to entering into
an agreement for the first nonexempt sale after controls have
been in effect on the housing units for the period specified in
this section.
(c) Upon receipt of such notice, the option to buy the unit at the
maximum allowable restricted sales price shall be available for
90 days. The MAHC shall notify the Borough of Madison, DCA,
NJHMFA and COAH that the unit is for sale. If the Borough of
Madison exercises this option, it may enter into a contract of
sale. If the Borough of Madison fails to exercise this option
within 90 days, the first of the other entities giving notice to
the seller of its intent to purchase during the ninety-day period
shall be entitled to purchase the unit. If the option to purchase
the unit at the maximum allowable restricted sale price is not
exercised by a written intent to sell, the owner may proceed to
sell the housing unit. If the owner does not sell the unit within
one year of the date of the delivery of notice of intent to sell,
the option to buy the unit shall be restored and the owner shall
be required to submit a new notice of intent to sell 90 days
prior to any future proposed date of sale.
(d) Any option to buy a housing unit at the maximum allowable
restricted sales price shall be exercised by certified mail and
shall be deemed exercised upon mailing.
(2) Borough of Madison.
§ 195-47 MADISON CODE § 195-47
191:980
(a) If the Madison Affordable Housing Corporation, as an entity of
the municipality, elects to purchase a low- or moderate-income
unit pursuant to this section, it may:
[1] Convey or rent the housing unit to a low- or moderateincome
purchaser or tenant at a price or rent not to exceed
the maximum allowable restricted sales price or rental for
a period of up to 30 years. [Amended 1-28-2015 by Ord.
No. 1-2015; 5-27-2015 by Ord. No. 35-2015]
[2] Convey the unit at fair market value, subject to the deposit
of the price differential in a trust account devoted solely to
the creation, rehabilitation or maintenance of low- and
moderate-income housing. Price differential is defined as
the difference between the restricted sales price and fair
market value as determined at the date of a proposed
contract of sale after reasonable real estate broker fees
have been paid. Money in the trust account may not be
expended until the MAHC develops a plan for its use which
is reviewed and approved by the governing body of the
Borough of Madison.
(b) In the event the Borough of Madison purchases low- or
moderate-income housing units, the Borough shall maintain
them as low-income housing units.
(c) In the event the Borough of Madison elects to purchase low- or
moderate-income housing units and convey them at fair market
value, the Borough shall:
[1] Notify COAH of any proposed sale and resale price 90 days
before closing;
[2] Notify COAH of the price differential;
[3] Deposit the price differential in a trust account devoted
solely to the creation, rehabilitation or maintenance of
low- and moderate-income housing; and
[4] Notify COAH by February 1 of each calendar year of the
existing balance within this trust account.
(d) Money deposited in trust accounts may not be expended until
the municipality submits and COAH approves a repayment
housing plan. COAH may approve the repayment housing plan
if it determines that it provides a realistic opportunity for the
creation, rehabilitation or maintenance of low- and moderateincome
housing.
(e) Extended period of controls.
[1] The Borough of Madison shall have the right to determine
that the most desirable means of promoting an adequate
§ 195-47 WATER EMERGENCIES § 195-47
191:981
supply of low- and moderate-income housing is to prohibit
the exercise of the repayment option and maintain controls
on lower-income housing units sold within the municipality
beyond the period required by this section. Such
determination shall be made by resolution of the municipal
governing body. The resolution shall specify the time
period for which the repayment option shall not be
applicable. During such period, no seller in the
municipality may utilize the repayment option permitted
by Subsection P(5).
[2] If the Borough of Madison exercises the option outlined
above, it shall:
[a] Provide public notice in a newspaper of general
circulation; and
[b] Notify the Madison Affordable Housing Corporation of
its governing body's action. The MAHC shall ensure
that the deed restriction on all affected housing units
reflect the extended period of controls.
(3) State option. When the DCA or NJHMFA elects to purchase a lowor
moderate-income unit pursuant to this section it may:
(a) Convey or rent the housing unit to a low- or moderate-income
purchaser or tenant at a price or rent not to exceed the
allowable restricted sales price or rental; or
(b) Convey the unit at fair market value and utilize the price
differential to subsidize the construction, rehabilitation or
maintenance of low- and moderate-income housing within the
appropriate housing region.
(4) Nonprofit option. Nonprofit agencies that have been designated by
COAH shall be eligible to purchase low- or moderate-income units
pursuant to this section for the sole purpose of conveying or
renting the housing unit to a low- or moderate-income purchaser or
tenant at a price or rent not to exceed the allowable restricted sales
price or rental. Low income units shall be made available to low
income purchasers or tenants and the housing units shall be
regulated by the restrictive covenant and lien adopted by COAH.
The term of the controls on affordability shall be the same as those
required by this section.
(5) Seller option. An eligible seller of a low- or moderate-income unit
which has been controlled for the period established in this plan
who has provided notice of intent to sell may proceed with the sale
if no eligible entity as outlined in Subsection P exercises its option
to purchase within 90 days.
(a) The seller may elect to:
§ 195-47 MADISON CODE § 195-47
191:982
[1] Sell to a qualified low- and moderate-income household at
the controlled unit sales price, providing the unit is
regulated by the restrictive covenant and lien adopted by
the Agency for a period of up to 30 years; or [Amended
1-28-2015 by Ord. No. 1-2015; 5-27-2015 by Ord. No.
35-2015]
[2] Exercise the repayment option and sell to any purchaser at
market price, providing that 95% of the price differential is
paid to the MAHC as instrument of the municipality, at
closing.
(b) If the sale will be to a qualified low- and moderate-income
household, the MAHC shall certify the income qualifications of
the purchaser and shall ensure the housing unit is regulated by
the restrictive covenant and lien required by the Board.
(c) The Madison Affordable Housing Corporation shall examine
any contract of sale containing a repayment option to
determine if the proposed sales price bears a reasonable
relationship to the housing unit's fair market value. In making
this determination, the MAHC may rely on comparable sales
data or an appraisal. The MAHC shall not approve any contract
of sale where there is a determination that the sales price does
not bear a reasonable relationship to fair market value. The
MAHC shall make a determination within 20 days of receipt of
the contract of sale and shall calculate the repayment option
payment.
(d) The Madison Affordable Housing Corporation shall also adopt
an appeal procedure by which the seller may submit written
documentation requesting the MAHC to (i) recomputed the
repayment obligation if the seller believes an error has been
made or to (ii) reconsider a determination that the sales price
does not bear a reasonable relationship to fair market value. A
repayment obligation determination made as a result of an
owner's appeal shall be a final administrative determination of
the MAHC.
(e) The repayment shall occur at the date of closing and transfer of
title for the first nonexempt transaction after the expiration of
controls on affordability. Repayment proceeds shall be
deposited in a trust account devoted solely to the creation,
rehabilitation or maintenance of low- and moderate-income
housing. Money deposited in trust accounts may not be
expended until the Madison Affordable Housing Corporation
develops and obtains municipal approval of a plan for its use.
(6) Continued application of options. When a housing unit has been
maintained as a low- and moderate-income unit after controls have
been in effect for the period specified in Subsection O, the
§ 195-47 WATER EMERGENCIES § 195-47
191:983
restrictive covenant governing the housing units shall allow the
municipality, the state, nonprofit agencies and sellers of low- and
moderate-income units to again exercise all the same options as
provided in this section.
Q. Foreclosure.
(1) Any mortgage for a low- and moderate-income unit shall contain a
provision requiring the holder of a mortgage on the property to
inform the Madison Affordable Housing Corporation at any time
that the purchaser of a unit is 45 days or more in arrears on
payment of his mortgage payments. The MAHC shall further be
notified by the mortgagee in the event of institution of a foreclosure
action. This notification provision does not apply to any mortgage
which prohibits notice to a third party.
(2) The Madison Affordable Housing Corporation shall at all times have
the right to intervene in any foreclosure action. In addition, the
MAHC shall have the right to advance and pay all sums necessary
to cure any arrears, to cure any other default or exercise any right
of redemption or pay and satisfy any first mortgage or other lien so
that the unit may be preserved and retained as a low- and
moderate-income unit. All sums advanced by the MAHC shall
become a lien against the unit and shall have higher priority than
any other lien except that of a first mortgage or tax or other lien
held by any governmental agencies.
R. Foreclosure exemption from resale controls. In the event of a
foreclosure by an institutional first mortgagee, the unit shall be exempt
from all further resale restrictions, provided that the following
conditions have been satisfied:
(1) The first mortgage did not exceed 100% of the authorized sales
price of the unit by the current occupant (unless written
authorization was given by the MAHC for the owner to enter into a
mortgage for a higher amount).
(2) The MAHC has been given both notice of the default by the
mortgagee, as well as notice of the institution of foreclosure. In
addition, the MAHC has not exercised its right to cure the default.
(3) The lender who is the foreclosing mortgagee is the successful
bidder at a sheriff's sale and takes title by deed from the sheriff; or
the MAHC has given written approval for a deed in lieu of
foreclosure.
S. Second mortgages. No second mortgages shall be placed upon the
property without prior written approval of the MAHC. In determining
whether to grant an approval for the second mortgage, the MAHC shall
consider the need for the second mortgage and the impact that the
second mortgage shall have upon the ability of the MAHC to maintain
this unit as a low- and moderate-income unit. Under no circumstances
§ 195-47 MADISON CODE § 195-47
191:984
shall a foreclosure of a second mortgage constitute grounds for
elimination of the resale controls provided for in this regulation. Prior
written approval shall be denied unless second mortgages are
specifically authorized by COAH regulations and the application is
consistent with these regulations.
T. Sale of personal items. Items of personal property which are
permanently affixed to the unit (e.g., refrigerator, freezer, washer,
dryer) and which were not included when the affordable housing unit
was purchased may be the subject of separate negotiations between the
parties subsequent to the signing of the contract for the purchase of the
house. Any agreed price for the purchase of any items of personal
property shall be reasonable considering the original cost, nature, age
and condition of the item. The price to be paid for items of personal
property shall not be used as a mechanism to avoid or circumvent the
limitations on the resale price of the unit itself. In no event shall the
right to purchase the unit be conditioned upon the buyer's willingness
to agree to purchase any item or items of personal property of the
seller.
U. Certification of occupancy.
(1) No certificate of occupancy for a low- and moderate-income unit
shall be issued until the developer shall have submitted and have
approved by the Madison Affordable Housing Corporation a deed
restriction encompassing all provisions of these regulations.
(2) No certificate of occupancy shall be issued for the resale of a lowand
moderate-income unit unless the MAHC shall certify that the
resale complies with the terms of these regulations.
(3) No low- and moderate-income unit may be occupied by an initial
purchaser or resale purchaser without a certificate of occupancy.
V. The Administrator shall implement the affirmative marketing program
for affordable housing that has been or will be approved by resolution of
the Mayor and Council of the Borough of Madison. [Amended
7-11-2016 by Ord. No. 52-2016]
W. Waiver. In the event of a special hardship or in the event that a minor
technical modification of these regulations is necessary to effectively
implement the policy of this section, the MAHC may waive or modify
these regulations relating to occupancy selection, sale or resale prices,
or income eligibility standards, provided that such waiver of
modification is (a) consistent with the intent of these regulations and
the Land Use Regulations; and (b) does not violate COAH policy,
regulations or statute.
X. Severability. The provisions of this section are hereby declared to be
severable. If any section, sentence, clause or phrase shall for any
reason be held to be invalid or unconstitutional, such judgment,

number. The required affordable housing unit(s) shall be
constructed on-site unless the Mayor and Council, after referral by

fewer than five dwelling units and/or single-family building lots, the
developer shall be required to make a payment in lieu of providing
affordable housing, which shall be placed in the payment-in-lieu
fund governed by § 195-48I. The amount of the required payment
shall be consistent with COAH regulations and shall be negotiated

providing affordable housing units. The minimum payment amount
shall be calculated based on $182,750 multiplied by the fractional
affordable housing requirement as calculated to two decimal
points.
E. All mixed-use developments that involve the creation and/or
development and/or addition of five or more market-rate dwelling units
and/or single-family building lots shall be subject to the affordable
housing inclusionary development requirements set forth in § 195-48 of
the Madison Borough Code. [Amended 7-11-2016 by Ord. No.
52-2016]
§ 195-48 WATER EMERGENCIES § 195-48

construction of multiple buildings, the total payment in lieu for the
development may be allocated on a proportionate basis in
connection with each building permit applied for in connection with
the development, according to the number of residential dwellings
units and/or total square footage of nonresidential development, as
applicable.
(2) The remaining balance of the required payment shall be paid prior
to issuance of any certificate of occupancy, subject to the potential
pro rata allocation as provided for in Subsection H(1). [Amended
7-11-2016 by Ord. No. 52-2016]
(3) All payments in lieu shall be deposited in the payment-in-lieu fund
provided for under § 195-48I.

§ 230-1. Title.
This chapter may be cited as the "Tanning Booth Ordinance of the Borough
of Madison."
§ 230-2. Findings.
Whereas tanning booth establishments have enjoyed a recent, rapid growth
in popularity; and whereas the operation of tanning booths involves a
serious potential hazard to the public health, welfare and safety, through
the exposure of persons to concentrations of ultraviolet light in excess
of those normally occurring in the environment; and whereas it has been
established that acute overexposure to the ultraviolet light emitted by
tanning booth lamps will cause skin burns and eye damage; and whereas it
has been established that chronic exposure to ultraviolet light can result in
increased incidences of skin cancer; now, therefore, it is the policy of the
Borough of Madison to protect the health, welfare and safety of its citizens
from the potential hazards associated with the operation of tanning booth
establishments by the adoption of licensing procedures and standards to
govern such facilities.
§ 230-3. Definitions.
Wherever used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the following
meanings:
TANNING BOOTH  Any enclosed or semienclosed area or room,
containing one or more ultraviolet lamps, intended for irradiation of any
part of the human body to induce skin tanning.
TANNING BOOTH ESTABLISHMENT  Any commercial enterprise or
facility containing one or more tanning booths, provided that this definition
shall not include any hospital, clinic or other medical facility wherein
ultraviolet radiation is or may be used, under the supervision of a trained
medical staff, for the diagnosis or treatment of disease,
§ 230-4. License required; application.
A. No person shall, at any time within the Borough of Madison, conduct,
maintain or operate a tanning booth establishment without first having
obtained a license to do so from the Board of Health of the Borough of
Madison.
§ 228-5 TANNING BOOTH ESTABLISHMENTS § 230-4
230:1047
§ 230-5. Conditions and requirements.
No license to conduct, maintain or operate a tanning booth establishment
shall be granted to any person until such person has demonstrated to
the satisfaction of the Board of Health that the following conditions and
requirements have been met:
B. Application for such a license shall be made to the Board of Health, on
forms approved by it, signed and executed by the applicant.
A. Each tanning booth shall have, prominently displayed on its door or
beside its entrance, a sign that states: "DANGER - Ultraviolet Radiation.
Follow instructions. As with natural sunlight, overexposure can cause
injury and sunburn; repeated exposure may cause premature aging of
skin and skin cancer. Exposure of eyes to ultraviolet light without
protective eyewear may cause serious injury to eyes. Medications or
cosmetics applied to the skin may increase oversensitivity to ultraviolet
light, as may a family history of skin problems or allergy to sunlight.
Consult a physician before using this booth if you are taking any
medication or if you believe yourself sensitive to sunlight."
B. Each tanning booth shall be equipped with handrails, floor markings or
other suitable physical aids to assure that the user maintains the proper
exposure distance from the lamps.
C. Users shall, on each visit, be provided, free of charge, with sanitary
protective eyewear that protects the user's eyes from ultraviolet
radiation but permits sufficient vision to enable the user to maintain
balance, read necessary labels or instructions and effect a quick, safe
exit from the tanning booth.
D. Each timer used to control exposure duration, whether controlled by
the user from within the tanning booth or by the operator of the tanning
booth establishment, shall be accurate to within plus or minus 10% or
any selected timer interval.
E. The ambient air temperature in each tanning booth shall at no time
exceed 100° F. (38° C.).
F. Each tanning booth shall be sufficiently strong and rigid to resist
collapse due to the impact of a falling person. Tanning booth access
doors shall open outwardly, shall be free of locks or latches and shall, in
all other respects, be designed to facilitate safe and rapid entrance to
and exit from the booths. Tanning booth floors shall provide adequate
traction, even when wet, to allow such safe and rapid ingress and
egress.
G. Each tanning booth shall be equipped with heavy wiregrids, ultraviolet
transmitting plastics or some similar physical barrier to protect users
from contact with ultraviolet lamps. Such barrier shall be sufficiently
strong and rigid to resist collapse due to the impact of a falling person.

dermatologist approved by the Board of Health stating that the
methods for exposure determination, both as to duration and distance,
utilized by the tanning booth establishment are safe and that such
methods comply with current medical standards.
J. Each tanning booth establishment and the equipment used therein shall
comply with the regulations promulgated by the United States Food and
Drug Administration and published in Volume 21 of the Code of Federal
Regulations at 1002.61(a)(4) and 1040.20.
A. Each license issued under the provisions of this chapter shall bear the
actual date of issue thereof, the legal name of the person, firm,
corporation or other organization, society or group to whom issued and

maintain or offer the senior discount specified in § A237-17B above.
A. In the event that the Borough approves or permits a cable system to

petition to the Board of Public Utilities as provided for in accordance
with N.J.S.A. 48:5A-47 and N.J.A.C. 14:17-6.7.
B. In the event that a nonfranchised multi-channel video programmer
provides service to residents of the Borough, Cablevision shall have a
right to request franchise amendments to this ordinance that relieve
Cablevision of regulatory burdens that create a competitive
disadvantage to the company. In requesting amendments, Cablevision
shall file with the Board of Public Utilities a petition for approval in
accordance with N.J.S.A. 48:5A-47 and N.J.A.C. 14:17-6.7 seeking to
amend the ordinance. Such petition shall: i) indicate the presence of a
nonfranchised competitor(s); ii) identify the basis for Cablevision's
belief that certain provisions of this franchise place it at a competitive
disadvantage; and iii) identify the regulatory burdens to be amended or
repealed in order to eliminate the competitive disadvantage. The
Borough shall not unreasonably withhold or object to granting the
company's petition.

minimum, the same terms and conditions of any other provider of multichannel

petition to the Board for modification of the consent in accordance
with N.J.S.A. 48:5A-47 and N.J.A.C. 14:17-6.7 to relieve the company of
competitive disadvantages identified in the company's petition.
A. Cablevision shall continue to make available noncommercial public,
educational and governmental (PEG) access as described in the
application for municipal consent.
(1) The Borough agrees that the company shall retain the right to use
the PEG access channel, or portion thereof, for non-PEG access
programming, during times when the Borough is not utilizing the
channel for purposes of providing PEG access programming. In the
event that the company uses said PEG access channel for the
presentation of such other programming, the PEG programming
shall remain the priority use and the company's rights with respect
to using the channel for non-PEG programming shall be
subordinate to the Borough provision of PEG access programming
on such channel.
(2) Within 90 days from the effective date of this franchise, Cablevision
shall provide and maintain one access return line at Madison Public
Library located at 39 Keep Street in Madison, New Jersey, for the
production of noncommercial educational and governmental access
programming on the cable system. Upon request of the Borough,

shall provide the Borough with an initial one-time grant of $10,000 (the
"initial grant"). Such amount shall be paid within 60 days following the
grant of the certificate from the Board. The grant may be used by the
Borough for any cable and/or other telecommunications-related
purpose as the Borough, in its discretion, may deem appropriate.
Beginning in year two of the franchise (measured by the certificate of
approval) and annually thereafter through year 10 of the franchise,
Cablevision shall provide the Borough with an annual amount of $1,500
(the "annual grant"). Cablevision shall not be obligated to make any

§ A238-11. Indemnification and legal defense.

A. Definitions. The terms of this Article VIII and the definition of

230:1081
provide for the legal defense of such claims in accord with the

failure to act was the result of actual fraud, willful misconduct or actual
malice of the person requesting defense and indemnification; or c) the

E. Criminal proceedings. In any other action or proceeding, including

provides for the defense of any action set forth herein and as a
condition of such defense, the Joint Meeting may assume exclusive
control over the representation of such persons defended, and such

services, all costs so incurred shall be the sole responsibility of such
member, employee, or appointee.
G. Manner of defense. The Joint Meeting may provide for the defense
pursuant to this Article VIII by authorizing its attorney to act on behalf

defense.
