Professional Service Contracts
[Adopted 9-27-2006 by Ord. No. 2006-159]
§ 10-1. Adoption of standards; applicability.
The following standards and criteria are hereby adopted and shall be made
applicable to all contracts awarded and/or confirmed by the Township
Committee and any and all boards, authorities, and committees appointed,
either through the authority of statute or ordinance, by the Township
Committee, unless a specific contrary intention is expressed in an individual
case by the Township Committee.
§ 10-2. Award of public professional services and other no-bid
contracts.
A. Purpose and intent. Although professional services contracts and
certain other contracts for goods and services are exempt from the
competitive bidding requirements of the Local Public Contracts Law,
N.J.S.A. 40A:11-1 et seq., the Township Committee deems it
appropriate, and consistent with the provisions of recently enacted
New Jersey legislation, now codified at N.J.S.A. 19:44A-20.1 et seq., to
henceforth award such contracts through a competitive, quality-based,
fair and open process, unless a specific determination to the contrary is
made by the Township Committee.
B. Process for award of professional services and other no-bid contracts.
The Township of Waterford, or any agency or instrumentality thereof,
shall not enter into a contract, including a professional services
contract, or such other contract which is exempt from public bidding
requirements, having an anticipated value in excess of $17,500, as
determined by the Township of Waterford or any agency or
instrumentality, with a business entity, except through a contract that is
awarded pursuant to a fair and open process if, during the preceding
one-year period, that business entity has made a contribution that is
reportable by the recipient under N.J.S.A. 19:44A-1 et seq. to any
municipal committee of a political party if a member of that political
party is in office as a member of the Township Committee when the
contract is awarded or to any candidate committee of any person
serving in an elected public office of the Township of Waterford when
the contract is awarded. The fair and open process shall be qualitybased
and shall be as follows:
(1) Professional services may be awarded by virtue of a publicly
advertised request for proposals (RFP) which will be issued as one
document for those appointments which are made on an annual
basis, such as, but not limited to, the positions of: Township

1:15
Attorney, Township Engineer, Township Planner, Planning Board
Attorney, Planning Board Engineer, Zoning Board Attorney, Zoning
Board Engineer, and such other statutory and/or ordinance public
positions.
(2) For said positions, no contract shall be awarded unless and until
the positions are:
(a) Publicly advertised in newspapers or on the internet website
maintained by the Township in sufficient time to give notice in
advance of the solicitation for the contracts;
(b) Awarded under a process that provides for public solicitation of
proposals and qualifications, including the following:
[1] Experience and reputation in the field;
[2] Knowledge of the subject matter of the services to be
provided to the Township;
[3] Knowledge of the Township, its affairs and operations;
[4] Availability to accommodate any required meetings of the
Township;
[5] Compensation proposal;
[6] Compliance with the minimum qualifications established
by the Township for the position;
[7] Other factors determined to be in the best interest of the
Township.
(c) Awarded and disclosed under criteria established in writing by
the Township of Waterford prior to the solicitation of proposals
or qualifications as set forth in this article;
(d) Publicly announced when awarded; and as to those RFPs which
prove to be unsuccessful, the Township Clerk shall retain a
copy of same on file for a period of not less than 60 days.
(3) For contracts which arise on an occasional basis, such as appraisals
needed for the acquisition of land and/or open space, as well as title
searches, surveying, and similar work associated with same; and
comparable assignments, such as planning services needed for
Master Plan updates, appraisals, special counsel, special project
engineer contracts, etc., professional services contracts may be
awarded without following the foregoing provisions, so long as:
(a) The anticipated value does not exceed the $17,500 threshold
set forth above; and
(b) The Township Clerk makes every effort to solicit at least two
proposals for said work.
§ 10-2 WATERFORD CODE § 10-2
1:16
C. Review of RFPs by review committee. A review committee shall be
established by the Mayor, consisting of not fewer than two committee
members, to prepare, process and evaluate any RFP issued pursuant to
the professional services contracting procedures set forth above. The
review committee shall evaluate the respective qualifications and/or
proposals, taking into consideration the designated qualifications and/
or performance criteria, experience, reputation of vendor, quality of
services, quoted fee and other relevant factors in making a
recommendation of award to the Township Committee; and the
Township Clerk may, in his/her sole discretion, conduct negotiations
with qualified vendors, after receipt of proposals, in order to achieve
the best possible contract terms and conditions for the Township and its
taxpayers. No contract shall be awarded, however, unless same is
authorized by resolution duly adopted in public session by the Township
Committee.
D. Contribution statement by professional business entity.
(1) Prior to awarding any contract or agreement to procure services,
including banking or insurance coverage services, with any
professional business entity, the Township or any of its purchasing
agents or agencies, as the case may be, shall receive a sworn
statement from the professional business entity, made under
penalty of perjury, that the bidder or offer or has not made a
contribution in violation of this article.
(2) The professional business entity shall have a continuing duty to
report any violations of this article that may occur during the
negotiation or duration of a contract. The certification required
under this subsection shall be made prior to entry into the contract
or agreement with the Township and shall be in addition to any
other certifications that may be required by any other provision of
law.
E. Contracts issued without use of the RFP process.
(1) In circumstances where the Township Committee determines that
the use of the RFP process is not appropriate, such as, but not
limited to, contracts with other government agencies, and
agreements with public utilities, the Township Clerk shall use his/
her best efforts to obtain at least two quotations for the work and
shall require the contractor to fully comply with the provisions of
N.J.S.A.19:44A-22 et seq. and related statutes.
(2) No business entity which enters into negotiations for, or agrees to,
any contract or agreement with the Township of Waterford or any
department or agency thereof, or of its independent authorities for
the rendition of professional, banking or insurance coverage
services, or any other consulting services, shall solicit or make any
contribution of money, or pledge of a contribution, including in-kind
contributions, to any Township of Waterford municipal candidate or
§ 10-2 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 10-2
1:17
holder of the public office having ultimate responsibility for the
award of the contract, or campaign committee supporting such
candidate or officeholder, or to any Waterford Township party
committee, between the time of first communications between that
business entity and the Township regarding a specific professional
services agreement and the later of the termination of negotiations
or the completion of the contract or agreement.
F. Emergency exceptions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Township
Committee recognizes that the New Jersey Legislature has provided for
certain emergencies and further recognizes that the procedure outlined
above might not be capable of being achieved in the event of an
emergency or other time constraints. Thus, should a situation arise, and
time does not permit resort to this procedure, and the immediate
performance of services is necessary, then an award for same may be
made in accordance with the provisions of the Local Public Contracts
Law relating to emergency contracts and such rules and regulations as
may be promulgated, from time to time, by the Township Committee
with regard to same. No such emergency contracts, however, may be
awarded without a resolution establishing a basis for the deviation from
the procedures outlined herein.

DEFENSE AND INDEMNIFICATION
GENERAL REFERENCES
Personnel policies  See Ch. 44.
§ 15-1. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
PUBLIC EMPLOYEE  Shall include any employee of the Township of
Waterford and shall include any elected or appointed official, counsel or
special counsel, or any officer, employee or servant, whether or not
compensated, who is authorized to perform any act or service for the
Township of Waterford. The term "public employee" shall also include
persons formerly holding office or employment, provided the events giving
rise to a cause of action or claim hereunder conform to the requirements
herein established.[Amended 6-9-2004 by Ord. No. 204-7]
DEFENSE  The means by which such public employee may respond to any
suit, allegation or cause of action. The Township of Waterford shall provide
the defense of any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, including a cross action, counterclaim or
cross complaint against any public employee because of any act or omission
of that employee in the scope of his or her employment and shall defray
all costs of defending such action, including reasonable counsel fees and
expenses, together with costs of appeal, if any, excepting actions, suits
or proceedings brought by the Township of Waterford against any such
employee. Expressly exempted from this chapter providing defense and
indemnification to public employees of the Township of Waterford are any
charges, allegations or actions of whatever nature asserted by the Township
of Waterford against its own public employees.
INDEMNIFICATION  To secure against loss or damage which may occur
in the future or to provide compensation for or to repair loss or damage
already suffered; to insure; to save harmless.
§ 15-2. Findings.
The Mayor and Committee for the Township of Waterford finds as follows:
A. The State of New Jersey, through the passage of the Tort Claims Act, as
amended and supplemented, from time to time (N.J.S.A. 59:1-1 et seq.)
has determined the circumstances under which claims may be made
against public entities and their officials, employees and servants.
B. Said Tort Claims Act also specifies under what circumstances a public
entity may defend and indemnify its officials, employees and servants.
§ 13-11 WATERFORD CODE § 15-2
15:32
§ 15-3. Provisions of indemnification.
C. The Mayor and Committee for the Township of Waterford hereby
provides, under certain circumstances, for the defense and
indemnification of its officers, employees and servants in the good faith
performance of their duties and responsibilities.
D. Such defense and indemnification are especially appropriate for
members of appointed boards who serve the Township of Waterford
without monetary compensation.
E. The indemnification of municipal employees is also expressly designed
to avoid a conflict between the employer and the employee when claims
are lodged. The Supreme Court for the State of New Jersey has noted
that because the law does not require, but does permit, indemnification
of local public entity employees, conflicts of interest may arise in the
absence of such indemnification where an entity and an employee are
both sued for compensatory damages in, for example, a civil rights
action and both employ the same attorney to defend. Likewise, the
Court pointed out such conflict could arise because the employee is
liable for punitive damages and the entity is not. (See Petition for
Review of Opinion 552. 102 N.J. 194.) Accordingly, this indemnification
policy is also intended to increase the efficiency and reduce the costs of
defending the Township of Waterford and its employees and agents in
the event of such actions.
A. Whenever a civil action shall be brought against any person holding an
office, position or employment with the Township of Waterford for any
action or omission arising out of or in the course of the performance of
the duties of such office, position or employment, the Township of
Waterford shall provide payment of that portion of any exemplary or
punitive damage award not otherwise covered by a policy of insurance.
Note, however, that the Township of Waterford does not, by
indemnifying its employees against punitive damage, indirectly or
directly waive its own immunity against such claims. (See T&M Homes,
Inc. v. Pemberton Twp., 190 N.J. Super. 637.)
B. Whenever a civil action shall be brought against any person holding an
office, position or employment with the Township of Waterford for any
action or omission arising out of or in the course of the performance of
the duties of such office, position or employment, the Township of
Waterford shall provide payment of that portion of any costs of defense
of said action not covered by a policy of insurance. Whenever any
insurance policy whose purpose is to provide the defense and
indemnification of the Township of Waterford or its public employees is
in dispute, the Township of Waterford will stand in the place of the
insurance carrier, subject to all rights of subrogation, provide for the
defense and indemnification of its employees as specified herein. Said
public employee has an affirmative duty, to be eligible for said defense
and indemnification, to cooperate with the Township of Waterford in
any and all of its efforts to resolve any disputed insurance coverage.
§ 15-2 DEFENSE AND INDEMNIFICATION § 15-4
15:33
§ 15-4. Limit of obligation.
By common law and the express provisions of this chapter, the Township
of Waterford's authority to indemnify is limited to acts by public employees
that are within the scope of their employment and which are not criminal,
fraudulent, malicious or instances of willful misconduct. Additionally, the
Township of Waterford will not provide the means for defense nor indemnify
any public employee in those instances where the Township of Waterford
has initiated the charges or action. In the event that any such public
employee is charged with criminal charges and he or she is later acquitted,
any application to recover the cost of his or her defense is expressly
conditioned upon the ultimate determination of administrative charges
which may or may not arise out of the same conduct or behavior.
Notwithstanding all of the above, in the event that the Township of
Waterford elects to assert such administrative charges and even if the
employee should hereafter prevail, all such claims for reimbursement for
costs of defense will be subjected to the controlling statutory and common
law as opposed to this chapter.

medical service responsibilities. Further, all members must comply
with any and all federal, state or other rules and regulations
pertaining to technical emergency rescue medical service

C. Nonpaid employees; waiver of compensation. All nonpaid members,

department shall sign waivers acknowledging that they will not be

right to compensation for their services. Said waiver and
acknowledgment shall be on a form approved by the Township Solicitor.
This waiver shall not prevent nonpaid officers from receiving expense
compensation or nonpaid members from receiving incentive
compensation, nor shall it create an entitlement to same. "Expense
compensation" is a yearly amount paid by the fire and rescue
departments to its officers to compensate them for expenses. "Incentive
compensation" is a yearly amount paid by the department to its
members based upon the number of calls responded to in the year.

increases or decreases.
(3) The Township of Waterford shall obtain services for the mailing and
enforcement of these billings, which services shall be obtained
through public bidding if required under the Local Public Contracts
Law.17 The Township Administrator, with input from the Director of
Public Safety, may grant relief from these billings upon the grounds
of hardship.
E. Use of tobacco. Members, volunteers and employees may not use any
tobacco products while on duty or at any time when in Township
vehicles, public buildings or during training. "Tobacco product" means

The Township deems the following rules to be critical and provides for the
immediate discharge of the employee for the following reasons:
A. The following rules and regulations of Waterford Township of Camden
County, in the State of New Jersey, are hereby adopted. The right is
reserved to alter, amend or abrogate any of the rules and regulations or
to make or adopt additional rules and regulations from time to time, as

own time card punched by another person.
O. Gambling in work area or while on duty.
P. Performing work of inferior quality due to the employee's negligence or
by willful intent.
Q. Soliciting or accepting a bribe.
R. Personal use of department vehicles.
S. Conduct that will reflect discredit upon the Township during working
hours.
T. Failing to report a vehicle accident.
A. These are important rules, and violations are considered major
infractions. They do not necessarily require immediate discharge.
However, the penalties for violations of these rules are as follows:
(1) First offense: written warning.
(2) Second offense: written warning and suspension without pay for
two working days (same rule within one year).
(3) Third offense: final written warning and suspension without pay for
five working days (same rule within two years).
(4) Fourth offense: discharge (same rule within three years).
B. Violations are as follows:
§ 44-12 WATERFORD CODE § 44-13
19:82
§ 44-14. Absenteeism.
(1) Creating or contributing to unsanitary conditions.

(3) Not excused.
B. Frequency of absences:
(1) One unexcused absence: first written warning.

two-day suspension.
(3) Third unexcused absence within six months from first warning:
five-day suspension.
(4) Fourth unexcused absence within one year from first offense:

steps detailed above, an unexcused absence does not occur within the
next specified period.
D. Administrative procedure and/or disciplinary action regarding
frequently excused absences or a continuing pattern of absences,
excused or unexcused. If any employee is too frequently absent or
establishes a continuing pattern of absences (either excused or
unexcused) which disrupt or hamper the department operations, under
these conditions he/she will consider himself/herself liable for

employment; and in such cases, the following will apply:
§ 44-13 ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION § 44-14
19:83
§ 44-15. Doctor's certificates.
In cases of illness of three days' duration or more, a doctor's certificate is
required on the day that the employee returns to work or the employee will
not be permitted to return.
§ 44-16. Lateness.
One of the greatest problems in operating an entity efficiently is the
attendance problem. An employee who arrives late for work or who fails
to report for work at all makes it necessary to rearrange personnel
assignments. When an employee is late, it cannot be known at the start of
the day whether he/she will be late several minutes or hours. It is the desire
of the Township to keep this problem to a minimum, not only to keep costs
down, but to be fair to those employees who are not habitually late.
(1) When it becomes apparent that the employee has been absent too
often, as compared with attendance records within the department,
the first written warning will be issued.
(2) If no marked improvement occurs, the final written warning will be
issued.
(3) If no marked immediate improvement occurs after the final written
warning: dismissal.
A. Types of lateness.
(1) Prearranged and excused.
(2) Caused by extreme weather conditions hampering transportation
generally.
(3) Unexcused.
B. Daily procedure.
(1) Any employee who is less than 15 minutes late will punch his time
card and report to his/her immediate supervisor and will advise him
of his/her presence and reason for lateness.
(2) Any employee who reports more than 30 minutes late (unless
prearranged) will report to his/her immediate supervisor before
punching in.
C. Procedures for unexcused lateness.
(1) An employee will be docked for the following:
Number of Minutes Late Docked
5 to 15 minutes 1/4 hour
16 to 30 minutes 1/2 hour
§ 44-14 WATERFORD CODE § 44-16
19:84
§ 44-17. Attendance and personal record card.
An attendance and personal record card will be maintained for each and
every employee of the Township.
Number of Minutes Late Docked
31 to 45 minutes 3/4 hour
46 to 60 minutes 1 hour
(2) For the first three unexcused latenesses: first written warning.
(3) For six or more latenesses during a three month period from the
first written date: three days off without pay.
(4) For any lateness after the sixth lateness during the twelve-month
period from the first written warning: dismissal.
D. Clearing of records. Any employee can clear his/her record if he/she is
not late for a period of six months after receiving the first written
warning.

(7) Patrol officers: Patrol officers are responsible for performing a
variety of duties related to the protection of life and property,
enforcement of criminal and traffic laws, prevention of crime,
preservation of the public peace, and the apprehension of
criminals. They will perform these duties as prescribed in
Department orders and as directed by their supervisors. In addition
to these and the general and individual responsibilities of all
members and employees, patrol officers are specifically
responsible for the following:
(a) Police mission. A patrol officer is responsible for the
accomplishment of the police mission on his patrol. He shall
constantly be alert for violations of the laws and ordinances
and shall make every effort to prevent breaches of the peace
and offenses against persons and property. He shall be held
accountable for crime, accidents, disorders, and other criminal
conditions on his patrol beat or post.
(b) Reporting for duty. He shall report promptly at the designated
hour and place, in proper uniform for assignment and
inspection. He shall listen attentively to orders and
instructions of his superior officers and read such materials as
are made available to him. He shall make written memoranda
of such information as necessary and shall immediately
proceed to his post or beat upon completion of these tasks.
(c) Familiarization with patrol. A patrol officer shall thoroughly
familiarize himself with the Township. He shall be familiar with
all public businesses, offices, and their entrances, exits,
skylights, fire escapes, and other possible means of escape.
While making security checks of doors, he shall familiarize
himself with the location of safes and night lights. Changes in
night lights will be particularly noted.
(d) Method of patrol. During his tour of duty, the patrolman shall
continuously patrol every part of his assigned area, giving
attention to and frequently rechecking locations where the
crime hazard is great. As far as possible, he shall not patrol his
assigned area according to any fixed route or schedule, but
shall alternate frequently and backtrack in order to be at the
location least expected.
(e) Unlocked buildings.
[1] When a door or window is found open under suspicious or
unusual circumstances on any tour of duty, a patrol officer
shall make a thorough investigation and determine, if
possible, whether a burglary or other crime has been
committed and whether the door or window can be
secured. He shall, if necessary, summon assistance to
examine the premises and to secure such doors and
§ 50-2 WATERFORD CODE § 50-2
47:98
windows. He shall notify his shift commander and the
property owner.
[2] Under circumstances indicating that an intruder is still
inside a building, the officer discovering same should
immediately summon assistance and then stand guard.
When the assistance arrives, he may enter and search the
building.
(f) Field interviews. When the occasion demands it, the patrol
officers shall courteously, but firmly, question persons on the
public streets as to their names, addresses, reason for being on
the street, and other matters relating to the circumstances. In
all cases, good judgment, probable cause, and discretion shall
be used in making a decision to arrest.
(g) Traffic law enforcement. Patrol officers are charged with the
enforcement of all provisions of local and state traffic codes.
Failure to take appropriate action in traffic violation cases is
considered neglect of duty.
(h) Complaint action. A patrol officer shall carefully investigate all
complaints on or near his patrol which are assigned to him or
which are brought to his attention by citizens. He shall take
suitable action in those cases which come under his
jurisdiction and inform interested parties of the laws or
ordinances relative to the particular complaint or incident. If
the legal remedy of the complaint lies outside the jurisdiction
of the Police Department, he shall advise the complainant
accordingly and refer him to the proper authority.
(i) Preliminary investigations. At the scenes of major crimes,
subject to direction from higher authority, the first officer at
the scene, after it has been established that the perpetrator is
no longer present, will begin the preliminary investigation
(except in the case of homicide or apparent homicide; in those
instances, the Chief of Police or Captain will be called to the
scene immediately). In all instances, members not assigned
will not enter the premises or do any other thing that might
interfere with the investigation or destroy evidence. In cases of
homicide, the first duty of the patrol officer is to guard the
scene, exclude all unauthorized persons, and detain all
witnesses for interrogation.
(j) Radio failure. Patrol officers shall pay strict attention to all
regular radio transmissions. When they fail to hear any radio
transmissions or time signals for a period not to exceed 15
minutes, they shall immediately call the dispatcher for a
special test. If he fails to receive an acknowledgment, he shall
immediately contact the dispatcher or commander. In case of
§ 50-2 PLANNING AND ZONING, DEPARTMENT OF § 50-2
47:99
§ 50-3. All members of the Police Department.
It shall be the responsibility of all sworn police members of the Police
Department to enforce the laws of the State of New Jersey and the Township
of Waterford.
§ 50-4. Salaries and wages.
The pay for all Waterford Police Department personnel will be as set forth in
the Township Salary Ordinance and/or the applicable labor contracts. Said
ordinances and contracts will be made available to the public by request
through the Township Clerk's office.
§ 50-5. Secondary employment (moonlighting).
Waterford Township police officers are expected to give their whole time
and attention to their duties in serving the public interest and public safety
of/for the residents of Waterford Township. They are required by police
rules and regulations to be armed at all practical times and are subject to
duty recall when determined to be necessary by the Chief of Police or other
appropriate authority. Additionally, there are certain private employment
activities that are in direct conflict with police power vested in the officer
by the Township of Waterford. Accordingly, effective upon passage of this
chapter, no Waterford Township police officer will be allowed to "moonlight"
in employment apart from their Township-held position except as follows:
radio trouble, the officer shall notify his shift commander and/
or dispatcher of the nature of the trouble.
(k) Patrol officers will be further responsible for daily performance
standards and such other duties as defined by S.O.P.
A. Any officer wishing to moonlight must first submit a written request
through the Chief of Police, with his endorsement recommending
approval or not, to the appropriate authority for a permit to do so. The
request will contain all necessary information, to include at a minimum:
the type of employment; the hours to be worked; the name, address and
phone number of the prospective employer and company; a certification
from the employer that the duties will not involve police powers, that
there will not be any conflict with the officer's police career, and that
the company will provide the officer with full insurance benefits to
indemnify the Township and cover the officer for his actions or inactions
or if injured in the course of or during actions arising out of or related to
the prospective moonlighting job. That is, the outside employer must
provide proof of sufficient insurance coverage to protect the Township
against liability for tort actions or other actions of the officer outside
the officer's official Police Department duties, and to defend and
indemnify and hold the Township and the officer harmless in any legal
proceedings not arising out of and not directly related to the lawful
exercise of police powers in furtherance of official police duties and
related to the moonlighting employment. Said permit will only be issued
§ 50-2 WATERFORD CODE § 50-5
47:100
by the appropriate authority, with the approval of the Mayor and
Township Committee, for officers who have been productive employees
for the Township as documented and certified by the Chief of Police.
All such permits will be revoked for employees whose performance
deteriorates after the secondary employment is started. The approved
permit will be valid for a period of two years and will need to be
reapplied for within 90 days prior to expiration. At any time this permit
may be revoked by the Chief of Police, without due process, if it
impedes or diminishes the ability to attain the departmental objectives
of this agency in any way or compromises the reputation of the Police
Department. [Amended 7-8-2015 by Ord. No. 2015-10]
B. Entrepreneurial endeavors (e.g., self employment) are strictly
prohibited subject to the same permit requirements listed in Subsection
A above. Additionally, no permits for those endeavors will be issued for
any business conducted within the boundaries of Waterford Township.
The appearance of impropriety (even in the absence of actual wrongful
behavior) necessarily stemming from paying attention to such business
practices on Township time and/or using police powers in regard to
such business enterprises has arisen in the past and may be particularly
troublesome. [Amended 7-8-2015 by Ord. No. 2015-10]
C. Permit criteria. The following standards shall be used to guide the
appropriate authority in deciding requests from officers to engage in
off-duty employment as well as operation of a business enterprise (i.e.,
self employment) off duty:
(1) Whether the business/employment has the potential to be aided or
furthered by an officer's use of confidential information that the
officer is privy to solely by virtue of his police position, whether or
not the officer may actually so use such information, based on the
appearance and potential conflict created;
(2) Whether the business/employment might tend to result in a loss of
departmental control or authority over the officer while engaged in
the business/employment beyond any loss of control over other offduty
officers not so employed or engaging in their own private
business;
(3) Potential for loss of the officer's police services as a result of injury
sustained in the alternate employment/business;
(4) Whether the employment/business has the potential to create the
appearance that those who patronize the business or place of
employment might curry favorable treatment by the officer in his
police capacity or by the Department, or the appearance that those
who patronize a competitor of the business/employer might be
subject to unfavorable treatment by the officer or Department;
§ 50-5 PLANNING AND ZONING, DEPARTMENT OF § 50-5
47:101
§ 50-6. Police related off-duty employment.
(5) Whether the business/employment has the potential to cause
diminished physical and mental capacity of the officer while on
duty;
(6) Whether the employment/business is in a publicly regulated
industry which might create actual or appearance of conflicts of
interest, even if with other branches or levels (e.g., state, county,
municipal) of government;
(7) Whether the employment/business has the potential for the
creation of an appearance of favoritism among officers from the
operation of a joint enterprise among multiple police officers
holding different ranks on the police force when the same officers
exercise their supervisory authority over each other in the course
of their police duties;
(8) The potential for possible pursuit of police time or resources to
pursue private employment/business functions;
(9) The potential civil liability of the Township for acts committed by
the officer in the private employment/business;
(10) Potential for the employment/business to affect the reputation and
effectiveness of the police force;
(11) The potential for the officer to be involved in the collection/
accounts receivable aspects of the business/employment such that
those dealing with the officer in the employment/business capacity
might feel pressure/coercion in paying debts beyond that which
would be present if such activities were not performed by an offduty
police officer;
(12) Any other factor unique to the employment/business request with
the potential to create a conflict or appearance of conflict with
police employment.
D. Divestiture. All employees currently moonlighting, conducting a side
business, or involved in any form of secondary employment without the
required permit will immediately submit written application for same or
terminate such employment within two weeks and/or divest themselves
of all side businesses prohibited in Subsection B above within 30 days.
A violation of this chapter constitutes grounds for immediate removal
from service as a Waterford Township police officer.

permitted off-duty police-related employment pursuant to the

A. Hearing authority.
§ 50-22 PLANNING AND ZONING, DEPARTMENT OF § 50-25
47:109
(1) In the event of any disciplinary proceedings against any member of
the Police Department of the Township of Waterford, the
appropriate authority or his/her designee shall be the sole hearing
officer and person in charge of all such proceedings. The decision
of the appropriate authority shall be final. The right of appeal shall
be to the New Jersey Superior Court pursuant to N.J.S.A.
40A:14-150, if and as applicable.
(2) In the event the appropriate authority designates a hearing
authority other than himself/herself, and the designated hearing
authority is to be an officer within the Waterford Township Police
Department, only a person of greater rank than the person charged
may be so designated for that purpose. Whenever Special Counsel
is designated to be the hearing authority, prior approval must be
obtained by resolution of the Mayor and Township Committee. The
decision of said hearing authority shall be provided within 10 days
to the appropriate authority, who shall render the final and binding
decision, both as to violation and penalty, within 10 days from when
he/she receives the decision and supporting documentation such as
a hearing transcript. The time lines established herein are to be
construed flexibly in the interest of justice so that fair and reasoned
decisions will follow. Should the appropriate authority fail to act
within 10 days or give notice of necessary extension, the decision of
the hearing authority shall become final.
B. Charging authority.
(1) In the event a Waterford Township Police Department officer is to
be charged in a disciplinary action and said employee is
subordinate to the rank of the Chief of Police, only the Chief of
Police or his/her designee may initiate such charges (N.J.S.A.
40A:14-118). In the event the office of the Chief of Police has been
abolished through intentional vacancy, pursuant to § 50-2A, then
the appropriate authority or his/her designee shall function as the
charging authority. Failure to initiate charges when same are
indicated may constitute a neglect or dereliction of duty [Gauntt v.
Bridgeton, 194 N.J. Super. 468, 477 A.2d 381 (App. Div. 1984)], but
the function of the charging authority may not be circumvented.
(2) In the event the Chief of Police for the Township of Waterford is to
be charged in a disciplinary action against the chief, the
appropriate authority or Special Counsel named by the appropriate
authority to act on his/her behalf shall be the charging authority.
The appropriate authority is hereby empowered to name a
designated Special Council to function as an alternative charging
authority without prior Council approval in an emergency. This is
necessitated by the statutory time lines involved in the charging
process. Notwithstanding this authority, at the earliest opportunity
the appropriate authority shall inform Council of the action that he/
she has taken and obtain its approval.
§ 50-25 WATERFORD CODE § 50-25
47:110
§ 50-26. Appeals.
Disciplinary action against any member of the Police Department shall be
taken in accordance with N.J.S.A. 40A:14-147. Any employee seeking to
appeal disciplinary charges shall do so in writing submitted to the office
of the appropriate authority. Said appeal shall be filed within five days, not
including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, of the date said charges were
served upon said employee. In either event, the appropriate authority shall
schedule a hearing in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and
state statute. Administrative disciplinary charges sewed on any employee
shall contain the date, time and location for a prospective hearing as
required by statute. Any failure to submit the required written request
for an appeal would constitute an act of insubordination and may effect
the employee's rights pertaining to said statutory time lines, the discovery
proceedings, as well as other legal rights and remedies appurtenant
thereto.
§ 50-27. Administrative investigations.
The Mayor and Township Committee, or the appropriate authority with
governing body approval, may appoint a committee and/or designate special
counsel to conduct investigations of the operation of the police force and
may delegate to such committee or special counsel any and all lawful
powers of inquiry. The appropriate authority or his designee for this
purpose, or special counsel appointed by the governing body, may examine
the operations of the force or the performance of any officer or member
thereof. Any resolution of the governing body appointing special counsel for
the purpose of examining or investigating the operation of the police force
or the performance of any officer or member thereof shall be considered
to vest the examining or investigating official or body with the authority
to perform a municipal investigation pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:48-25 and
the County and Municipal Investigations Law, N.J.S.A. 2A:67A-1 to 4. Any
such subpoenas as authorized by N.J.S.A. 40:48-25 shall be in the name of
the appropriate authority. In conducting any such external investigation or
examination, the investigating or examining authority shall not be bound by
those internal affairs investigation guidelines or regulations governing the
Police Department in conducting its own internal investigations, although
all applicable statutory restrictions and particularly N.J.S.A. 40A:14-147
shall not thereby be circumvented.
(3) Whenever any person, whether police officer, Special Counsel, or
the appropriate authority, serves in an investigative capacity and/or
as the charging authority relevant to a Waterford Township Police
Department disciplinary action; he/she may not thereafter be
designated as or serve as the hearing authority in that same
disciplinary action.
§ 50-25 PLANNING AND ZONING, DEPARTMENT OF § 50-28
47:111
§ 50-28. Emergency directives.
Nothing herein contained shall infringe upon or limit the power or duty of
the appropriate authority to act to provide for the health, safety or welfare
of the municipality in an emergency situation through special emergency
directives. (N.J.S.A. 40A:14-118; 40A:14-146.9)
§ 50-29. Police Department Rules and Regulations and Police
Manual.
A. Adoption and promulgation. The appropriate authority, pursuant to
N.J.S.A. 40A:14-118, is hereby authorized to update, adopt and
promulgate rules and regulations for the governing of the Police
Department and for the discipline of its members with a view to making
the Police Department and all members thereof efficient, vigilant and
effective in the service of the Township of Waterford. Said rules and
regulations will be in manual form and shall be called the "Rules and
Regulations of the Police Department for the Township of Waterford"
and shall govern the conduct of and be binding upon the entire
membership of said Police Department. Said rules and regulations shall
provide for discipline of the members of the police force. In the event of
any mutually inconsistent provisions between the police ordinance and
the rules and regulations, the ordinance shall govern; however, both
shall be interpreted so as to give full affect to both this chapter and the
rules and regulations wherever possible.
B. Distribution: The Rules and Regulations shall be distributed through
Power DMS as follows: An electronic copy will be issued to and
electronically signed for by each employee of the Police Department for
the Township of Waterford. A copy will be maintained by the Township
Clerk for the personnel designated as "special officers" and to provide
public access to same. [Amended 7-8-2015 by Ord. No. 2015-10]
C. Members' responsibility for manuals. No Police Department operating
policies will be inserted as part of this manual unless and until properly
assimilated by the appropriate authority. Each police officer and each
civilian employee is duty-bound to thoroughly familiarize himself/
herself with the provisions of the police manual. Failure to comply shall
be considered neglect of duty. In the event neglect of duty is charged
against a member for failure to observe the rules and regulations or
Department procedures or orders, ignorance of any provision of this
manual will not be accepted as an excuse. [Amended 7-8-2015 by

return it to the requestor. The Clerk shall sign and date the form and
provide the requestor with a copy thereof.

disclosure, the Clerk shall request an opinion from the Municipal
Attorney. A copy of the request form shall be forwarded to the Attorney,

seven business days after receiving the request, provided that the record
is currently available and not in storage or archived. In the event that the
Clerk fails to respond within seven business days after receiving a request,
the failure to respond shall be deemed a denial of the request, unless the
requestor has elected not to provide a name, address or telephone number,
or other means of contacting the requestor, the Clerk shall not be required
to respond until the requestor reappears before the custodian seeking a
response to the original request. If the government record is in storage or
archived, the requestor shall be so advised within seven business days after

promptly permit access to the remainder of the record.
E. If the record requested is temporarily unavailable because it is in use or
in storage, the Clerk shall so advise the requestor and shall make
arrangements to make a copy of the record available.

disrupt municipal operations, the Clerk may deny access to the record
after attempting to reach a reasonable solution with the requestor that
accommodates the interests of the requestor and the municipality.
G. As required by N.J.S.A. 47:1A-5(e), immediate access shall be granted

the Council on Affordable Housing's (COAH's) adoption of rules.
B. Pursuant to P.L. 2008, c. 46 § 8 (N.J.S.A. 52:27D-329.2) and the

funds and corresponding spending plans. Municipalities that are under
the jurisdiction of the Council or court of competent jurisdiction and
have a COAH-approved spending plan may retain fees collected from
nonresidential development.
C. This article establishes standards for the collection, maintenance, and
expenditure of development fees pursuant to COAH's regulations and in
accordance P.L. 2008, c. 46, §§ 8 and 32 to 38. Fees collected pursuant

§ 124-14. Residential development fees.
A. Imposed fees.
(1) Within all zoning districts, residential developers, except for
developers of the types of development specifically exempted
below, shall pay a fee of 1.5% of the equalized assessed value for
residential development, provided no increased density is
permitted.
(2) When an increase in residential density pursuant to N.J.S.A.
40:55D-70d(5) (known as a "d" variance) has been permitted,
developers may be required to pay a development fee of 6% of the
equalized assessed value for each additional unit that may be
realized. However, if the zoning on a site has changed during the
two-year period preceding the filing of such a variance application,
the base density for the purposes of calculating the bonus
development fee shall be the highest density permitted by right
during the two-year period preceding the filing of the variance
application.
B. Eligible exactions, ineligible exactions and exemptions for residential
development.
(1) Affordable housing developments and developments where the
developer has made a payment in lieu of on-site construction of
affordable units shall be exempt from development fees.
(2) Developments that have received preliminary or final site plan
approval prior to the adoption of a municipal development fee
ordinance shall be exempt from development fees, unless the

118:234
§ 124-15. Nonresidential development fees.
developer seeks a substantial change in the approval. Where a site
plan approval does not apply, a zoning and/or building permit shall
be synonymous with preliminary or final site plan approval for this
purpose. The fee percentage shall be vested on the date that the
building permit is issued.
(3) Expansion of a residential building, where no new unit is
constructed, shall be exempt from development fees.
(4) Development fees shall not be imposed on public school or
municipal facilities.
A. Imposed fees.
(1) Within all zoning districts, nonresidential developers, except for
developers of the types of development specifically exempted, shall
pay a fee equal to 2.5% of the equalized assessed value of the land
and improvements for all nonresidential construction.
(2) Nonresidential developers, except for developers of the types of
development specifically exempted, shall also pay a fee equal to
2.5% of the increase in equalized assessed value resulting from any
additions to existing structures to be used for nonresidential
purposes.
(3) Development fees shall be imposed and collected when an existing
structure is demolished and replaced. The development fee of 2.5%
shall be calculated on the difference between the equalized
assessed value of the preexisting land and improvement and the
equalized assessed value of the newly improved structure, i.e., land
and improvement, at the time final certificate of occupancy is
issued. If the calculation required under this section results in a
negative number, the nonresidential development fee shall be zero.
B. Eligible exactions, ineligible exactions, and exemptions for
nonresidential development.
(1) The nonresidential portion of a mixed-use inclusionary or marketrate
development shall be subject to the two-and-a-half-percent
development fee, unless otherwise exempted below.
(2) The two-and-a-half-percent fee shall not apply to an increase in
equalized assessed value resulting from alterations, change in use
within existing footprint, reconstruction, renovations and repairs.
(3) Nonresidential developments shall be exempt from the payment of
nonresidential development fees in accordance with the
exemptions required pursuant to P.L. 2008, c. 46, as specified in the

Certification/Exemption Form." Any exemption claimed by a
developer shall be substantiated by that developer.
(4) A developer of a nonresidential development exempted from the
nonresidential development fee pursuant to P.L. 2008, c. 46, shall
be subject to it at such time the basis for the exemption no longer
applies, and shall make the payment of the nonresidential
development fee, in that event, within three years after that event
or after the issuance of the final certificate of occupancy of the
nonresidential development, whichever is later.
(5) If a property which was exempted from the collection of a
nonresidential development fee thereafter ceases to be exempt
from property taxation, the owner of the property shall remit the
fees required pursuant to this section within 45 days of the
termination of the property tax exemption. Unpaid nonresidential
development fees under these circumstances may be enforceable
by the Township as a lien against the real property of the owner.
A. Upon the granting of a preliminary, final or other applicable approval
for a development, the applicable approving authority shall direct its
staff to notify the construction official responsible for the issuance of a
building permit. For nonresidential developments, the developer shall
also be provided with a copy of Form N-RDF "State of New Jersey
Nonresidential Development Certification/Exemption" and complete as
per the instructions provided.
B. For nonresidential developments only, the developer shall also be
provided with a copy of Form N-RDF "State of New Jersey
Nonresidential Development Certification/Exemption" to be completed
as per the instructions provided. The developer of a nonresidential
development shall complete Form N-RDF as per the instructions
provided. The construction official shall verify the information
submitted by the nonresidential developer as per the instructions
provided in the Form N-RDF. The Tax Assessor shall verify exemptions
and prepare estimated and final assessments as per the instructions
provided in Form N-RDF.
C. The construction official responsible for the issuance of a building
permit shall notify the local tax assessor of the issuance of the first
building permit for a development which is subject to a development
fee.
D. Within 90 days of receipt of that notice, the Municipal Tax Assessor,
based on the plans filed, shall provide an estimate of the equalized
assessed value of the development.
E. The construction official responsible for the issuance of a final
certificate of occupancy notifies the local assessor of any and all
§ 124-15 WATERFORD CODE § 124-16
118:236
§ 124-17. Affordable Housing Trust Fund.
requests for the scheduling of a final inspection on property which is
subject to a development fee.
F. Within 10 business days of a request for the scheduling of a final
inspection, the Municipal Assessor shall confirm or modify the
previously estimated equalized assessed value of the improvements of
the development to calculate the development fee, and thereafter notify
the developer of the amount of the fee.
G. Should the Township fail to determine or notify the developer of the
amount of the development fee within 10 business days of the request
for final inspection, the developer may estimate the amount due and
pay that estimated amount consistent with the dispute process set forth
in subsection b of § 37 of P.L. 2008, c. 46 (N.J.S.A. 40:55D-8.6).
H. Fifty percent of the development fee shall be collected at the time of
issuance of the building permit. The remaining portion shall be
collected at the issuance of the certificate of occupancy. The developer
shall be responsible for paying the difference between the fee
calculated at building permit and that determined at issuance of
certificate of occupancy.
I. Appeal of development fees.
(1) A developer may challenge residential development fees imposed
by filing a challenge with the County Board of Taxation. Pending a
review and determination by the Board, the collected fee shall be
placed in an interest-bearing escrow account by the Township.
Appeals from a determination of the Board may be made to the tax
court in accordance with the provisions of the State Tax Uniform
Procedure Law, N.J.S.A. 54:48-1 et seq., within 90 days after the
date of such determination. Interest earned on amounts escrowed
shall be credited to the prevailing party.
(2) A developer may challenge nonresidential development fees
imposed by filing a challenge with the Director of the Division of
Taxation. Pending a review and determination by the Director,
which shall be made within 45 days of receipt of the challenge,
collected fees shall be placed in an interest-bearing escrow account
by the Township. Appeals from a determination of the Director may
be made to the tax court in accordance with the provisions of the
State Tax Uniform Procedure Law, N.J.S.A. 54:48-1 et seq., within
90 days after the date of such determination. Interest earned on

damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
(4) The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community.
(5) The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
(6) The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which
are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
(7) The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development.
(8) The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program of that area.
(9) The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles.
(10) The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
(11) The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public
utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water
systems, and streets and bridges.
§ 143-13 FENCES § 143-13
131:263
§ 143-14. Conditions for variances.
E. Upon consideration of the factors of § 143-13D and the purposes of this
chapter, the Appeal Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.
F. The Zoning Official shall maintain the records of all appeal actions,
including technical information, and report any variances to the Federal
Insurance Administration upon request.
A. Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less
in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures
constructed below the base flood level, providing the items in
§ 143-13D(1) through (11) have been fully considered. As the lot size
increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required
for issuing the variance increases.
B. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as
an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to
preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
C. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is
the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
D. Variances shall only be issued upon:
(1) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
(2) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
(3) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or
victimization of the public as identified in § 143-13D, or conflict
with existing local laws or ordinances.
E. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built and that the cost
of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk
resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.

Grading and Drainage of Residential Lots
[Adopted 3-23-2005 by Ord. No. 2005-2]
§ 155-1. Applicability.
The requirements set forth herein shall apply to the development of all
lots within the Township of Waterford for residential purposes. For
developments where an overall grading plan has already been reviewed and
approved by either the Planning Board or the Zoning Board of Adjustment,
the review and approval of an individual lot grading plan prior to the
issuance of a building permit is required. Any lot greater than one acre shall
not be subject to the requirement to submit an individual lot grading plan,
unless in the opinion of the Zoning Officer or Township Engineer there are
special circumstances to require an individual lot grading plan.
§ 155-2. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
DEVELOPMENT  The construction, reconstruction or relocation of any
residential structure; the enlargement of a residential structure, the
construction or placement of an accessory structure including in-ground
swimming pools on a residential lot resulting in a land disturbance of 500
square feet or more on a 1/4 acre or less lot or 1,000 square feet or more on
a lot over 1/4 acre.
§ 155-3. Review and approval.
Nothing contained herein shall prohibit the Township Engineer from
requiring a new, overall grading plan for review and approval. The applicant
shall be entitled to administrative review, if the plan meets the performance
standards contained herein, provided that the proposed changes do not
violate or create a conflict with the prior approvals granted by the
approving authority. If in the opinion of the Township Engineer the revised
grading plan substantially deviates from the prior approval, the applicant
shall be required to seek the approval of the applicable board.
§ 155-4. Foundation location plan.
A. The State of New Jersey, through the Uniform Construction Code,77
requires that a foundation location survey be submitted to the Township
Construction Official as soon as possible after the installation of the
foundation wall. Further, the final verification of such a prior approval
rests with the Construction Official. This plan shall be prepared by a
land surveyor licensed by the State of New Jersey and show all building
corners of the foundation. To confirm that the top-of-block elevation
conforms to the approved plan, the permittee shall also submit a
77.Editor's Note: See Ch. 103, Construction Codes, Uniform.
§ 155-1 GAMES OF CHANCE § 155-4
149:269
§ 155-5. Final survey (as-built plan).
Prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, the permittee shall
submit two copies of an accurate final survey (as-built plan) to the Zoning
Officer and the Township Engineer for approval. The final survey (as-built
plan) shall be prepared by a New Jersey licensed professional land surveyor.
The purpose of the final survey (as-built plan) is to ensure that the lot
grading is in substantial conformance to the approved plan and that the lot
will adequately drain and have no adverse impact on adjoining properties.
The final survey (as-built plan) shall be reviewed by the Township Engineer
and determined to comply with the above standards.
§ 155-6. Performance standards.
foundation location plan to the Township Engineer for review. The
foundation plan shall contain the top of block.
B. Nothing in this section shall prohibit a permittee from commencing
with framing prior to the submission of the foundation location plan to
the Engineer but will instead be a matter to be resolved by the
contractor prior to the issuance of the certificate of occupancy.
However, since the permittee shall demonstrate conformance to the
performance standards listed below in § 155-5 prior to the issuance of
the certificate of occupancy, it is recommended that the foundation
location plan be submitted to the Engineer as soon after the installation
of the foundation walls as possible.
A. All grading shall be done in a manner that will result in no adverse
impact to adjacent properties. Adjacent properties with natural swales
and/or wetlands must be evaluated to insure that adequate capacity is
available to accept the runoff from the site being developed and graded.
Whenever possible, the land shall be graded in one of the following
methods:
(1) The rear yard shall drain overland to the street through side yard
swales on either side of the house, located on the common property
lines with adjoining lots, and the front yard shall drain directly to
the street;
(2) The rear yard shall drain and be collected in a system of interior
yard inlets and piping designed in accordance with accepted
standards, connected to the development's overall stormwater
drainage system, and the front yard shall drain directly to the
street; or
(3) The rear yard shall drain overland onto adjoining properties as
permitted by right, i.e., no net increase in rate of runoff or manner
of flow or via an acceptable easement, and the front yard shall
drain directly to the street.
§ 155-4 WATERFORD CODE § 155-6
149:270
(4) Groundwater collected by sump pumps must be discharged to the
ground surface, outside of the building, a storm drain or a sump
pump collection system. Sump pump discharge to Township streets
creates a nuisance problem with algae buildup in the warm months.
In the winter months, serious icing is created on the streets. Water
from sump pumps which flows across the homeowner's property
line can create a nuisance for neighbors. Extending the sump pump
hose across the public sidewalk is also prohibited since it creates
an obstruction along a walking path. Any discharge of water onto a
public street is strictly forbidden and is the responsibility of the
property owner to abate. Any stormwater or groundwater directed
to the outside of the property by a mechanical means shall drain
onto the private property as to not cause a hazard or other type of
condition that would affect pedestrians, sidewalks, Township rightof-
way or streets. No sump pump outlet shall drain or be pumped
directly or indirectly onto the sidewalk or public street. A sump
pump outlet shall be terminated within the area of the lot on which
it is located and shall not discharge onto adjoining properties. A
sump pump shall not discharge water, either directly or indirectly,
into the sanitary sewer system. [Added 8-8-2018 by Ord. No.
2018-21]
B. No more than three lots in a row shall be allowed to drain through a
swale unless protected by an acceptable easement.
C. The minimum slope for swales, lawns, and disturbed areas shall be 2%
and for smooth, hard surfaces, i.e., driveways, 0.5%. If slopes of 2%
cannot be maintained for swales, a grade of 1.5% may be acceptable,
under special circumstances and with justification, if the Township
Engineer accepts the justification.
D. The maximum grade for driveways shall be 10% unless waived by the
Township Engineer under special circumstances.
E. The top-of-block elevation shall be a minimum of eight inches above the
highest adjacent grade and shall be provided on all grading plans. The
notation of the finished floor alone is not acceptable.
F. Grading within eight feet of the dwelling shall be in accordance with
local building codes.
G. Retaining walls over three feet in height must be designed and then
reviewed and approved by the Township Engineer.
H. Topsoil moved during the course of construction shall be redistributed
so as to provide at least five inches of spread cover to all seeded and
planted areas of the development and shall be stabilized by seeding or
planting. Topsoil shall be reasonably free of stone and contain no stones
larger than two inches in any dimension. In the event that the quantity
of topsoil at the site is insufficient to provide five inches of cover for all
seeded and planted areas, the permittee shall provide and distribute a

149:271
§ 155-7. Performance bond and inspection escrow.
Where a performance bond and inspection escrow have already been or will
be established, the requirements for the posting of fees may be waived,
unless the permittee elects to proceed with the fixed fee schedule. In
those instances where a permittee elects not to proceed with the fixed
fee schedule, a separate line item for lot grading shall be included in
the performance bond estimate and inspection escrow deposit shall be
calculated pursuant to the Municipal Land Use Law (Chapter 291, Laws
of N.J. 1975, N.J.S.A. 40:55D-1 et seq.). The bond amount for grading,
stabilization and yard drainage for nonmunicipal property shall be $2,000
per acre actually disturbed. Separate items are to be listed for municipal
and nonmunicipal property. The item for nonmunicipal property shall not
convert over to any subsequent maintenance bond. Dollar amounts shall be
updated as the need arises.
§ 155-8. Compliance with Pinelands stormwater management
standards.
All conditions and requirements herein shall be consistent with the
Pinelands stormwater management standards as set forth in the Pinelands
Comprehensive Management Plan and any standard adopted hereto.
§ 155-9. Checklist and application.
All of the requirements for the control of grading and drainage of residential
lots shall be required to adhere to the checklist and application which is
attached hereto and considered a requirement of this chapter.78
§ 155-10. Fees.
Fees shall be as set forth in § 124-7.
sufficient quantity of topsoil to provide such cover. The composition
of any borrowed topsoil shall be in accordance with New Jersey
Department of Transportation (NJDOT) standards and suitable for use
in a residential setting.
I. The permittee may request a waiver of a particular performance
standard upon presentation of a reasonable justification. The Township
Engineer shall have the authority to review the request and issue an

It is the Legislative intent of the Township Committee of the Township
of Waterford to repeal Ordinance 81-981 of the Township of Waterford in
order to authorize and comtemporize the regulation of sexually oriented
businesses within the borders of the Township of Waterford, County of
Camden, State of New Jersey.
§ 175-2. Statutory authorization; findings of fact; purposes and
objectives.
A. Statutory authorization. It is the responsibility of the local government
to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare. Such power has been delegated to the municipalities
from the legislature of the State of New Jersey. The Township
Committee of the Township of Waterford, in order to better promote the
public health, safety and general welfare of its citizens, does ordain as
follows.
B. Findings of fact.
(1) Pursuant to N.J.S.A. 2C:34-2b, the Legislature of the State of New
Jersey has determined that it is a fourth-degree crime to sell,
distribute, rent or exhibit material which is obscene. Consequently,
the State of New Jersey has preempted the Township of Waterford
from prohibiting the sale of material which the Township believes
to be obscene. However, in order to promote the public health,
safety and general welfare of its citizens, the Township of
Waterford may promulgate reasonable time, place and manner
regulations with respect to the sale, distribution, rental or
exhibition of various items by sexually oriented businesses.
(2) The Township of Waterford has determined that sexually oriented
businesses have a deleterious effect on both the existing businesses
adjacent to such establishments as well as the surrounding
residential areas; cause increased crime, especially prostitution;

extraction related commercial use that is in existence on
the date the permit is issued.
(b) Be located on a parcel of land at least 20 acres.
(c) Provide that all topsoil that is necessary for restoration will be
stored on the site and will be protected from wind or water
erosion. Topsoil shall not be stored within 200 feet of any
property line unless the area proposed for storage is
unforested and will be restored.
(d) Be fenced or blocked to prevent unauthorized entry into the
resource extraction operation through access roads.
(e) Provide ingress and egress to the resource extraction
operation from public roads by way of gravel or porous paved
roadways.
(f) Be designed so that the surface runoff will be maintained on
the parcel in a manner that will provide for on-site recharge to
groundwater.
(g) Not involve excavation below the seasonal high water table,
unless the excavation will serve as a recreational or wildlife
resource or a water reservoir for public, agricultural or
industrial uses or for any other use authorized in the zoning
district in which the site is located;
(h) Not involve excavation exceeding 65 feet below the natural
surface of the ground existing prior to excavation unless it can
be demonstrated that a depth exceeding 65 feet will result in
no significant adverse impact relative to the proposed final use
or on off-site areas.
(i) Be carried out in accordance with an extraction schedule that
depicts the anticipated sequence, as well as anticipated length
of time that each of the twenty-acre units of the parcel
§ 176-12 INSURANCE § 176-12
168:335
proposed for extraction will be worked. This shall not preclude
more than one twenty-acre unit from being worked at any one
time, provided that there is a demonstrated need for additional
units, restoration is proceeding on previously mined units and
the area of clearing does not exceed that specified in
Subsection G(1)(j) below.
(j) Not involve clearing adjacent to ponds in excess of 20 acres or
an area necessary to complete scheduled operations; or will
not involve unreclaimed clearing exceeding 100 acres or 50%
of the area to be mined, whichever is less, for surface
excavation at any time.
(k) Involve restoration of disturbed areas at the completion of the
resource extraction operation in accordance with the following
requirements:
[1] Restoration shall be a continuous process and each portion
of the parcel shall be restored such that the ground cover
be established within two years and tree cover established
within three years after resource extraction is completed
for each portion of the site mined.
[2] Restoration shall proceed in the same sequence and time
frame set out in the extraction schedule required in
Subsection G(1)(i) above.
[3] All restored areas shall be graded to conform to the
natural contours of the parcel to the maximum extent
practical. Grading techniques that help to control erosion
and foster revegetation shall be utilized. The slope of
restored surfaces shall not exceed one foot vertical to
three feet horizontal except as provided in Subsection
G(1)(k)[6] below of this section.
[4] Topsoil shall be restored in approximately the same quality
and quantity existing at the time the resource extraction
operation was initiated. All topsoil removed shall be
stockpiled and used for the next area to be restored,
unless it is immediately reused for reclamation that is
currently underway.
[5] Drainage flows, including direction and column, shall be
restored to the maximum extent practical to those flows
existing at the time the resource extraction operation was
initiated.
[6] Any body of water created by the resource extraction
operation shall have a shoreline not less than three feet
above and three feet below the projected average water
table elevation. The shoreline both above and below the
surface water elevation shall have a slope of not less than
§ 176-12 WATERFORD CODE § 176-12
168:336
five feet horizontal to one foot vertical. This requirement
shall apply to any water body or portion of a water body
created after December 5, 1994. For any water body or
portion of a water body created prior to December 5, 1994,
this requirement shall apply to the extent that it does not
require grading of areas which have not been disturbed
by mining activities. Where grading would require such
disturbance, a reduction in the distance of the graded
shoreline above and below the average water table
elevation shall be permitted.
[7] All equipment, machinery and structures, except for
structures that are usable for recreational purposes or any

(1) Except for land which was owned by a public agency on January 14,
1981, land which is thereafter purchased by the state for
conservation purposes, land which is subject to an easement
limiting the use of land to nonresidential uses or land otherwise
excluded from entitlement in this section, every parcel of land in
the Preservation District or Agricultural District shall have a use
right known as "Pinelands development credit" (PDC) that can be
used to secure a density bonus for lands located in the regional
growth area. Pinelands development credits may also be allocated
to certain properties in the Township by the Commission pursuant
to N.J.A.C. 7:50-4.61 et seq.
(2) PDCs are hereby established at the following ratios:
(a) In the Preservation District, including those areas designated
pursuant to N.J.A.C. 7:50-5.22(b)7:
[1] Uplands which are undisturbed but currently or previously
approved for resource extraction pursuant to this chapter:
two PDCs per 39 acres;
[2] Uplands which are mined as a result of a resource
extraction permit approved pursuant to this chapter: zero
PDCs per 39 acres;
[3] Other uplands: one PDC per 39 acres; and

shall be reduced as follows:
[1] Any parcel of 10 acres or less which is developed for a
commercial, industrial, resource extraction, intensive
recreation, institutional, campground or landfill use shall
not receive PDC entitlement. For such an improved
property of more than 10 acres, the area actively used for
such use or 10 acres, whichever is greater, shall not
receive PDC entitlement.
[2] The PDC entitlement of a parcel of land shall be reduced
by 0.25 PDC for each existing dwelling unit on the
property.
[3] The PDC entitlement for a parcel of land shall be reduced
by 0.25 PDC for each reserved right to build a dwelling
unit on the parcel retained by the owner of the property
pursuant to § 176-15B(2) below.
(d) If the allocations established in Subsection A(2)(a) and (b)
above are less than 0.25 PDC, the allocation shall be increased
to 0.25 of a PDC if the owner of record of 0.1 or greater acres
of land in the Preservation or Agricultural Production District,
as of February 7, 1979, owns a vacant parcel of land that was
not in common ownership with any contiguous land on or after
February 7, 1979, and the parcel has not been sold or
transferred except to a member of the owner's immediate
family.
(e) The provisions of Subsection A(2)(d) above shall also apply to
owners of record of less than 0.1 acre of land in the
Preservation and Agricultural Districts as of February 7, 1979,
provided that said owners acquire vacant, contiguous lands to
which PDCs are allocated pursuant to Subsection A(1) and
(2)(a) through (d) above, which lands, when combined with the
acreage of the parcel owned prior to February 7, 1979, total at
least 0.1 of an acre.
(3) The owners of parcels of land which are smaller than 39 acres shall
have fractional PDC at the same ratio established in Subsection
A(2) above for the management area in which the parcel is located.
B. Limitations on use of Pinelands development credits.

encumbered, or transferred unless the owner of the land from
which the credit has been obtained has received a PDC certificate
from the New Jersey Pinelands Development Credit Bank pursuant
to N.J.A.C. 3:42-3, and has deed restricted the use of the land in
perpetuity to those uses set forth in § 176-15E(2)(a) and (b), by a
recorded deed restriction which is in favor of a public agency or

enforceable by the Commission.
(2) Notwithstanding the provision of Subsection B(1) above, an owner
of a parcel from which PDCs are sold may retain a right for
residential development on that parcel, provided that the recorded
deed restriction expressly provided for same and that the total
allocation of PDCs for that property is reduced by 0.25 PDC for
each reserved right to build a dwelling unit. Subdivision of the
property shall not be required until such time as the residential
development right is exercised.
(3) The bonus density of a parcel of land on which PDCs are used shall
not exceed the upper limits of the density range of the zone in
which the parcel is located.
C. Pinelands development credit bonus multipliers. PDCs which are used
for securing a density bonus for parcels of land located in a regional
growth area shall yield a bonus of four dwelling units per credit.
D. Aggregation of Pinelands development credits. PDCs may be
aggregated from different parcels for use in securing a bonus for a
single parcel of land in a regional growth area, provided that the
density does not exceed the limits of the density range specified in the
municipal district in which the parcel is located.
E. Deed restriction to be recorded.

ownership and redemption of the requisite Pinelands development
credits; provided, however, that the approving authority may grant
general development plan, preliminary subdivision or preliminary
site plan approval conditioned upon such evidence being presented
as a prerequisite to final subdivision or site plan approval. For such
a final subdivision or site plan, the developer shall provide evidence

exceptional topographic conditions or physical features
uniquely affecting a specific piece of property; or c) by reason
of an extraordinary and exceptional situation uniquely
affecting a specific piece of property or the structures lawfully

168:368
(b) Where, in an application or appeal relating to a specific piece
of property the purposes of this chapter would be advanced by
a deviation from the zoning requirements and the benefits of
the deviation would substantially outweigh any detriment,
grant a variance to allow departure from such zoning
requirements of this chapter; provided, however, that the fact
that a proposed use is an inherently beneficial use shall not be
dispositive of a decision on a variance under this subsection
and provided that no variance from those departures
enumerated in § 176-18I(12) below (N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70d) shall
be granted under this subsection.

dwelling unit buildings, which lot or lots are either an
isolated undersized lot, or lots, resulting from a minor
subdivision, in which event applications would be made
pursuant to § 176-18I(11) above; or
[6] A height of a principal structure which exceeds by 10 feet

(13) General provisions.
§ 176-18 INSURANCE § 176-18
168:369

without substantial detriment to the public good and will not
substantially impair the intent and purpose of the zone plan
and the zoning provisions of this chapter.
(b) Referrals. An application under this section may be referred by
the Planning Board to any appropriate person or agency for its
review and report; provided that such reference shall not
extend the period of time within which the Planning Board
shall act.
(c) Conditions. The Planning Board, in granting any variance
which by law it is authorized to grant, may impose such
conditions, in addition to those required in this chapter, as are
necessary to assure that the general purposes and intent of
this chapter are met. Such conditions may include, but are not
limited to, harmonious design of buildings; maintenance of a
sign or sound screen; the minimizing of noxious, offensive or
hazardous elements; preservation of natural features;
landscaping; and the posting of performance guarantees of the
nature required in this chapter to assure compliance with the
requirements that will survive initial construction and the
issuance of the certificates of occupancy.
(d) Expiration. All variances shall expire within one year from the
date of approval unless the owner shall have secured a
construction permit and shall have commenced construction in
conformity with the variance approval, including any
conditions attached to the approval. For variances which
become the subject of litigation, the one-year period shall
commence on the date of the last reviewing court's decision to
grant the variance.
(e) Extensions. For good cause shown, and after a hearing before
the Board on notice in the manner required for original
variance applications, the Board may extend the variance by
resolution. Any extension may not exceed one year in duration
and no more than four extensions shall be permitted. To
receive consideration, an application for extension of a
variance shall be made prior to the expiration of the time limit
sought to be extended. Anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding, any variance granted with a site plan,
subdivision, and/or conditional use approval shall expire with
the expiration of the site plan, subdivision, and/or conditional
use approval.

[1] Any municipal variance which grants relief from the
density or lot area requirements set forth in Article XI for
the R1, R2, R3 or R4 District shall require that PDC be
used for all dwelling units or lots in excess of that
permitted without the variance.
[2] Any municipal variance or other approval for the
development of a residential use in the TC, NB, PHB, or PI
Zones, excluding Block 252, Lots 1 and 26, shall require
that Pinelands development credits be used for 50% of the
authorized units for parcels under 10 acres in size; for 75%
of the authorized units for parcels between 10 and 20
acres in size; and for 100% of the authorized units for
parcels over 20 acres in size.
[3] Any municipal variance or other approval for the
development of a nonresidential use not otherwise
permitted in the R1, R2, R3 or R4 Zones shall require that
the Pinelands development credit use in the zone in which
the nonresidential use will be located for parcels under 10
acres in size; at 75% of the maximum rate for parcels over
20 acres in size; and at 100% of the maximum rate for
parcels over 20 acres in size. This requirement shall not
apply to a variance or other approval that authorizes the
expansion of or changes to existing nonresidential uses in
accordance with N.J.A.C. 7:50-5.2.
[4] Any municipal variance approval which grants relief from
the density or lot area requirements in the PV District for a
residential or principal nonresidential use shall require
that PDCs be used for all dwelling units or lots in excess of
that permitted without the variance.

nonconforming use which would be prohibited under the

40:55D-34 for the construction of a building or structure within
the bed of a mapped street or public drainage way, flood
control basin or public area as shown on the duly adopted
Official Map, whenever one or more parcels of land within said
bed cannot yield a reasonable return to the owner unless a
construction permit is granted. The Board may grant such
relief only by the affirmative vote of at least five members,
ensuring that such relief will tend to cause a minimum change
of the Official Map and will not significantly add to the cost of
opening any proposed street. The Board shall impose
reasonable requirements as a condition of granting the
construction permit to promote the health, morals, safety and
general welfare of the public.
(b) Direct issuance of a construction permit pursuant to N.J.S.A.
40:55D-36 for a building or structure on a lot not abutting a
street which is shown on the duly adopted Official Map, or
which is a) an existing state, county or municipal street or
highway; or b) a street shown upon a plat approved by the
municipal Planning Board; or c) a street on a plat duly filed in
the office of the County Recording Officer. The Board may
grant such relief only when the enforcement of the statute
requirement that a building lot abut a street would entail
practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship, or where the
circumstances of the case do not require the building or
structure to abut a street. The Board shall impose
requirements or conditions that will provide adequate access
for fire-fighting equipment, ambulances and other necessary
emergency vehicles for the protection of the health and safety
and that will protect any future street layout on the Official
Map or on the Traffic Circulation Plan element of the municipal
Master Plan.
(15) Effective June 3, 1997, whenever the Planning Board grants
subdivision or site plan approval pursuant to the provisions of
N.J.S.A. 40:55D-76(b), then the Board shall ensure that any plans
and plats comply with the requirements of the rules of N.J.A.C. 5:21

approval.

residential development subject to review pursuant to the
provisions of N.J.S.A. 40:55D-37 and this chapter comply with the
requirements of N.J.A.C. 5:21 et seq., as latest revised, before

notice of the hearing shall include reference to all matters being
heard, and the approving authority shall review and approve or
deny the subdivision or site plan simultaneously with the
conditional use application. Failure of the approving authority to
act within the required time period shall constitute approval of the
application.
J. Combination of Planning and Zoning Boards. The Planning Board shall
exercise to the same extent and subject to the same restrictions, all the
powers of the Zoning Board of Adjustment; but the Class I and Class III
members shall not participate in the consideration of applications for
development which involves relief pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70(d).

may be, or within such further time as may be consented to by the
applicant, except that when an applicant elects to submit separate
consecutive applications for use variance approval and site plan,
subdivision or conditional use approval, the one-hundred-twentyday
time period for action shall apply to the application for
approval of the use variance, and the time period for granting or
denying any subsequent approval shall be as otherwise provided in
this chapter.
(6) All appeals and applications to the Board shall be in writing. Every
appeal or application shall refer to the specific provision of the
section of this chapter involved and shall exactly set forth the
interpretation that is claimed or the details of the variance that is

(1) The approving agency, when acting upon applications for
preliminary or minor subdivision approval or preliminary site plan
approval, shall have the power to grant such exceptions from the
design and performance standards of this chapter, as may be
reasonable and within the general purpose and intent of the
provisions for subdivision/site plan review and approval if the
literal enforcement of one or more provisions of this chapter is
impracticable or will exact undue hardship because of peculiar
conditions pertaining to the land in question.
(2) The approving agency shall have the power to review and approve
or deny conditional uses or site plans simultaneously with a review
for subdivision approval without the developer being required to
make further application or the approving agency being required to
hold further hearings. The longest time period for action by the
approving agency, whether it is for subdivision, conditional use or
site plan approval, shall apply whenever approval of a conditional
use is requested by the developer in conjunction with a site plan or
subdivision, notice of the hearing on the plat shall include
reference to the request for such conditional use.
(3) Notwithstanding the aforementioned exceptions, no such exception
shall apply to Pinelands application requirements or development
standards nor shall it affect the Township's compliance with the
standards of the Comprehensive Management Plan.
(4) Effective June 3, 1997, the approving agency may grant such de
minimis exceptions from the requirements of the residential site
improvement standards contained in N.J.A.C. 5:21 et seq, as latest

planning, legal, and other expenses connected with the review of
the submitted materials, including any traffic engineering review
or other special analysis related to the Township's review of the
submitted materials, or any necessary studies regarding off-tract
improvements. No application shall be deemed complete until the
initial required escrow fees have been paid. If additional sums are
deemed necessary, the applicant shall be notified of the required
additional amount and shall add such sum to the escrow prior to
any further consideration of the application by the Township. Sums
not utilized in the review process shall be returned to the applicant
within 20 days of the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the
development.
(2) The Township may enforce payment by withholding issuance of
building permits or certificates of occupancy. When a depleted
escrow is not brought current or a bill for deficiency remains
unpaid, the engineers and solicitors shall be authorized to withhold
all further services relating to the matter, including the granting of
any approvals, until such time as the depleted escrow account is
brought current or the deficiency is paid in full. In the event it is
necessary for the Township to file suit to collect any unpaid costs,
the applicant will be responsible for all costs of collection,
including reasonable attorneys' fees.
(3) Every application for development shall be accompanied by a check
payable to the Township of Waterford. No application shall be
deemed complete until the required fee has been paid. Where one
application for development includes several approval requests,
the sum of the required applications and escrow fees shall be paid.

pay all reasonable costs for professional review and inspection of
the improvements. All such costs for review shall be paid before

is issued. All remaining costs shall be paid in full before any

As a condition of approval, every applicant for major subdivision and site
plan approval shall be required to produce evidence of a comprehensive
general liability insurance policy in an amount not less than $300,000 per
occurrence, indemnifying and saving harmless Waterford Township and
its agencies, employees and agents from any liability for any act of the
developer or his agents, contractors or employees in the implementing
of the approved plan. A certificate of insurance issued by an insurance
carrier authorized to conduct business within the State of New Jersey shall
constitute acceptable evidence of such coverage. The applicant shall be
required to maintain such insurance until all improvements are completed
and, if required, a final certificate of occupancy is provided.
§ 176-22. Guarantees and inspections.
For the purposes of this section, the term "public improvements" shall
mean streets, grading, pavement, gutters, curbs, sidewalks, streetlighting,
street signs, shade trees, surveyor's monuments, fire prevention features,
water mains, culverts, sewers, sanitary sewers or other means of sewage
disposal, drainage structures, erosion control and sedimentation devices,
landscaping, public improvements of open space, and other on-site
improvements.
(c) 11 to 25 lots: $1,250.
(d) 26 to 50 lots: $2,500.
(e) More than 50 lots: $3,500.
A. Requirements specific to major subdivisions.
(1) No final major subdivision application, whether for an entire tract
or a section thereof, shall be approved by the Board until the
satisfactory completion and performance of all required public
improvements has been certified to the Board by the Township
Engineer unless the applicant has:
(a) Satisfactorily completed all required utility installations and
their appurtenances, including water mains, drainage and
detention facilities, culverts, storm sewers, sanitary sewers or
dry sewers and public improvements of open space;
(b) Satisfactorily completed all required grading and the macadam
base course surfacing of all streets;
(c) Satisfactorily completed the construction of all required curbs;
and/or
(d) Filed a performance guaranty in accordance with § 176-22D,
sufficient in amount to cover the cost of all remaining required
§ 176-20 WATERFORD CODE § 176-22
168:388
improvements, as estimated by the Township Engineer, and
assuring the installation of said improvements on or before an
agreed date and as hereinafter provided.
(2) Except as hereafter provided, the remaining required
improvements shall be at least 50% complete as to each category
set forth in the performance guaranty within one year from the
date of final approval or by such time as 50% of the lots in the
section in question have been conveyed in any manner by the
applicant, whichever shall occur first. At least 75% of the
remaining required improvements shall be complete as to each
category as set forth in the performance guaranty within 18 months
from the date of final approval, or at such time as 75% of the lots in
the section in question have been conveyed in any manner by the
applicant, whichever occurs first. Such improvements shall be
100% complete and accepted by the Township within two years
from the date of final approval or at such time as all of the lots in
the section in question have been conveyed in any manner by the
applicant, whichever occurs first. It is the intention of the Township
Committee that this requirement will provide, to those living in
each new section of a subdivision, a lot that is as complete as
possible with respect to tract and individual lot improvements.
B. Requirements specific to major site plans. No final major site plan
application, whether for an entire tract or a section thereof, shall be
approved by the Board unless:
(1) The Township Engineer has certified to the Board that all public
improvements required by the preliminary site plan approval have
been satisfactorily completed; or
(2) The applicant, with the approval of the Planning Board, has entered
into a developer's agreement with the Township, in a form
satisfactory to the Township Attorney and authorized by the
governing body, requiring the installation and maintenance of the
public improvements by the applicant and successors in interest;
imposing such limitations upon and/or staging of the development
of the site as are necessary to ensure orderly construction of the
public improvements on or before an agreed upon date by the filing
of a performance guaranty in accordance with § 176-22D.
C. Requirements specific to minor subdivisions and minor site plans. In the
case of a minor site plan and/or minor subdivision, in the event that the
developer elects to complete all improvements without posting the
performance guaranty required by § 176-22D, no construction shall be
commenced until a revised plan incorporating all conditions of approval
is submitted and signed. The developer shall still post the inspection
escrow and notify the Township Engineer prior to commencement of
work. The Township shall have the power to waive the requirement of
an inspection escrow for minor site plans only where the site
improvements are established to be less than $3,500, in which case the
§ 176-22 INSURANCE § 176-22
168:389
Township building inspection staff shall perform the inspections and
notice of work to be commenced shall be given to the Township Uniform
Construction Code Official instead of to the Township Engineer.
Whether or not an inspection escrow is required, all site improvements
under this subsection must be completed prior to the issuance of a
certificate of occupancy, or within 120 days of a temporary certificate
of occupancy if the performance guaranty covering the balance of the
uncompleted improvements has been posted.
D. Performance guaranty.
(1) A performance guaranty estimate shall be prepared by the
Township Engineer for review and approval, setting forth all
required improvements as determined by the Board and their
estimated cost. No performance guaranty shall be required for the
installation of utilities when they will be installed by the applicable
utility company. Any adjustment in the amount of the guaranty shall
be approved by resolution of the Township Committee.
(2) The cost of the installation of the required improvements shall be
estimated by the Township Engineer based on documented
construction costs for public improvements prevailing in the
Township.
(3) The applicant shall present two copies of the performance
guaranty, in an amount equal to 120% of the approved construction
cost estimate, for approval as to form and execution by the
Township Attorney. Additional copies of the performance guaranty
shall be forwarded by the owner to the Planning Board. The
performance guaranty estimates, as prepared by the Township
Engineer and approved by the Township Committee, shall be
appended to each performance guaranty posted by the obligor.
(4) The performance guaranty shall be made payable and deposited to
the Township and shall be in the form of cash, irrevocable letter of
credit, certified check, or performance bond, from an acceptable
surety company licensed to do business in the State of New Jersey,
in which the applicant shall be a principal. The Township shall issue
its receipt for such deposits. Deposits shall automatically renew for
one-year periods and shall be retained as security for completion of
all required work until the Township provides a resolution that the
required work has been completed or, in the event of default on the
part of the applicant, shall be used by the Township to pay the cost
and expense of completing all requirements. Upon receipt of the
resolution from the Township that the work has been completed
satisfactorily, the deposits shall be returned to the applicant.
(5) Ten percent of the amount of the approved performance guaranty
shall be deposited by the applicant in cash with the Township. The
remaining 90% may be in cash, irrevocable letter of credit or surety
bond. In the event of default, the 10% cash shall be applied to the
§ 176-22 WATERFORD CODE § 176-22
168:390
§ 176-23. Start of construction.
Construction pursuant to a site plan or subdivision approval shall not
commence until:
completion of the requirements and any bidding and legal costs
associated therewith. If the 10% cash is insufficient, the remaining
90% cash, letter of credit or surety bond shall be used for the
completion of the requirements and any additional bidding and
legal costs associated therewith.
E. Default by developer. If the required improvements are not completed
or corrected in accordance with the performance guaranty, the obligor
and surety, if any, under the performance guaranty shall be liable to the
Township for the cost of the improvements not completed or
constructed, and the Township, either prior to or after receipt of the
proceeds thereof, may complete the improvements. Such completion or
correction of improvements shall be subject to the public bidding
requirements of the Local Public Contracts Law, P.L. 1971, c. 198.110 For
the purposes of this subsection, "default" shall mean failure to install
the improvements in accordance with the Township standards of
construction, including, but not limited to, failure to install the
improvements prior to the expiration of the performance guaranty. The
Township Engineer's certification that the developer has defaulted in
compliance with the required standards of construction and installation
of improvements shall be the basis for Township Committee action
which rejects the improvements, withholds approval, withholds
construction permits or formally declares default and authorizes
collection on the performance guaranty.
F. Penalties. In addition to penalties for violation in accordance with
§ 176-13, the Township Engineer is specifically authorized to require
the replacement of any lands, buildings, structures and site
improvements (including clearing, whether on site or off site), or of any
other work commenced or continued on any site in violation of any stopconstruction
order or the standards for construction as established by
the Township.
A. The applicant has paid all fees required by this chapter;
B. The applicant has received all other governmental approvals required
by the Board's resolution of memorialization granting subdivision and/
or site plan approval;

§ 176-24. Special provisions for escrow deposits exceeding $5,000.
Whenever an amount of money in excess of $5,000 is deposited by an
applicant or developer with the Township for professionals employed by
the Township for the review of submitted applications for development
pursuant to § 176-20, or for inspections pursuant to § 176-25, or to satisfy
the guaranty requirements pursuant to § 176-22D, the money, until repaid
or applied to the purposes for which it is deposited, including the applicant's
portion of the interest earned thereon, except as otherwise provided in this
section, shall continue to be the property of the applicant or developer and
shall be held in trust by the Township in accordance with the following:
§ 176-25. Inspections and tests.
D. The applicant's construction plans have been filed with and approved
by the Township Engineer; and
E. The applicant has had a preconstruction meeting with the Township
Engineer in accordance with § 176-11A for the purpose of forecasting
and resolving problems that may arise during the time of construction.
A. The money deposited shall be held in escrow.
B. The money shall be deposited by the Township in a banking institution
or savings and loan association in New Jersey insured by an agency of
the federal government, or in any other fund or depository approved for
such deposits by the state.
C. The money shall be deposited in an interest-bearing account at the
minimum rate currently paid by the institution or depository on time or
savings deposits.
D. The Township shall notify the applicant, in writing, of the name and
address of the institution or depository in which the deposit is made and
the amount of the deposit.
E. The Township shall not be required to refund an amount of interest paid
on a deposit which does not exceed $100. However, if the amount
exceeds $100, the entire amount shall belong to the applicant or
developer and shall be refunded to him by the Township annually or at
the time the deposit is repaid or applied to the purposes for which it
was deposited, as the case may be; except that the Township may retain
for administrative expenses a sum equivalent to not more than 33 1/3%
of that entire amount which shall be in lieu of all other administrative
and custodial expenses.
A. All site improvements and utility installations for site plans,
subdivisions, plot plans and other realty improvements shall be
inspected during the time of their installation under the supervision of
the Township Engineer to insure satisfactory completion. The cost of
said inspection shall be the responsibility of the developer who shall
deposit with the Township Chief Financial Officer inspection fees in an
§ 176-23 WATERFORD CODE § 176-25
168:392
amount not to exceed, except for extraordinary circumstances, the
greater of $500 or 5% of the cost of the improvements as determined by
the Township Engineer in accordance with § 176-22D(2), provided that:
(1) For those developments for which the reasonable anticipated
inspection fees are less than $10,000 the fees may, at the option of
the developer, be paid in two installments. The initial amount
deposited by the developer shall be 50% of the reasonably
anticipated fees.
(2) For those developments for which the reasonable anticipated
inspection fees are $10,000 or greater, the fees may, at the option
of the developer, be paid in four installments. The initial amount
deposited by the developer shall be 25% of the reasonably
anticipated fees. When the balance of deposit drops to 10% of the
reasonably anticipated fees because the amount deposited by the
developer has been reduced by the amount paid to the Township
Engineer for inspections, the developer shall make additional
deposits of 25% of the anticipated inspection fees.
B. The inspection escrow shall be deposited by the Chief Financial Officer,
or his designee, in an account for such purposes under the sole control
of the Township. Said inspection escrow may be commingled with
similar escrows from other developers, but accurate accounts and
records shall be kept to identify the particular escrows and charges
made against the same. The inspection escrow funds shall be used
solely for payment of the inspection fees, expenses and costs on behalf
of the Township during the course of construction by the Township
Engineer, or such other officials as designated by the Township,
including the Township Planner or the Township Attorney, for
preparation of bond reduction resolutions and approval of guarantees.
C. The Township Engineer shall not perform any inspection if sufficient
funds to pay for those inspections are not on deposit. Failure of the
developer to deposit the required inspection fees in accordance with
§ 176-25A will subject the developer to a stop-work order and/or
suspension of construction permits.
D. In no case shall any paving work be done without permission from the
Township Engineer. At least two working days' notice shall be given to
the Township Engineer prior to any construction so that he, or a
qualified representative, may be present at the time the work is to be
done.
E. Streets shall not be paved with a top course until all heavy construction
is completed and, if determined by the Township Engineer to be
necessary, the macadam base course has first been restored. Shade
trees shall not be planted until all grading and earth moving is
completed. The placing of surveyor's monuments shall be among the
last operations.
§ 176-25 INSURANCE § 176-25
168:393
F. The Township Engineer's office shall be notified at least two working
days prior to the commencement of the following phases of work so that
he, or a qualified representative, may inspect the work:
(1) Road subgrade.
(2) Curb and gutter forms.
(3) Curbs and gutters.
(4) Road paving.
(5) Sidewalk forms.
(6) Sidewalks.
(7) Drainage pipes and other drainage construction.
(8) Street name signs.
(9) Monuments.
(10) Sanitary sewers and pump stations.
(11) Detention and/or retention basins.
(12) Topsoil, seeding and planting.
(13) Underground utilities.
(14) Potable water facilities.
G. Any improvement installed contrary to the plan or plat approved by the
Township shall constitute just cause to void the municipal approval.
H. Any improvement installed without notice for inspection pursuant to
§ 176-25D above shall constitute just cause for:
(1) Removal of the uninspected improvement;
(2) The payment by the developer of any costs for material testing;
(3) The restoration by the developer of any improvements disturbed
during any material testing; and/or
(4) The issuance of a stop-work order by the Township Engineer
pending the resolution of any dispute.
I. Inspection by the Township of the installation of improvements and
utilities shall not subject the Township of Waterford to liability for
claims, suits or liability of any kind that may at any time arise because
of defects or negligence during construction or at any time thereafter; it
being recognized that the responsibility to maintain safe conditions at
all times during construction and to provide proper utilities and
improvements is upon the owner and his contractor, if any.
§ 176-25 WATERFORD CODE § 176-25
168:394
§ 176-26. Release.
The Township Committee, by resolution, shall either approve the
improvements determined to be complete and satisfactory by the Township
Engineer, or reject any or all of these improvements upon the establishment
in the resolution of cause for rejection, and shall approve and authorize the
amount of reduction to be made in the performance guaranty relating to
the improvements accepted, in accordance with the itemized cost estimate
prepared by the Township Engineer and appended to the performance
guaranty pursuant to § 176-22D(3). This resolution shall be adopted not
later than 45 days after receipt of the list and report prepared by the
Township Engineer.
J. Upon substantial completion of all required street improvements,
except for the top course, and appurtenant utility improvements and
the connection of same to the public system, the obligor may request of
the Township Committee, in writing, by certified mail in care of the
Township Clerk, that the Township Engineer prepare, in accordance
with the itemized cost estimate appended to the performance guaranty
pursuant to § 176-22D(3), a list of all uncompleted or unsatisfactory
completed improvements. If such a request is made, the obligor shall
send a copy of the request to the Township Engineer. The request shall
indicate which improvements have been completed and which
improvements remain uncompleted in the judgement of the obligor. The
Township Engineer shall inspect all the improvements covered by the
obligor's request and shall file a written detailed list and report with the
Township Committee, and shall simultaneously send a copy thereof to
the obligor not later than 45 days after receipt of the obligor's request.
K. The list prepared by the Township Engineer pursuant to § 176-25J, shall
state, in detail with respect to each improvement determined to be
incomplete or unsatisfactory, the nature and extent of the
incompleteness of each incomplete improvement or the nature and
extent of, and remedy for, the unsatisfactory state of each completed
improvement determined to be unsatisfactory. The report prepared by
the Township Engineer shall identify each improvement determined to
be complete and satisfactory together with a recommendation as to the
amount of reduction to be made in the performance guaranty in
accordance with the itemized cost estimate appended to the
performance guaranty pursuant to § 176-22D(3).
A. Upon adoption of the resolution by the Township Committee, the
obligor shall be released from all liability pursuant to its performance
guaranty, with respect to those approved improvements, except for that
portion adequately sufficient to secure completion or correction of the
improvements not yet approved; provided that 30% of the amount of the
performance guaranty posted may be retained to ensure completion
and acceptability of all improvements.
B. In the event that the obligor has made a cash deposit with the Township
as part of the performance guaranty, then any partial reduction granted
§ 176-25 INSURANCE § 176-26
168:395
§ 176-27. Conditions and acceptance of improvements;
maintenance guaranty.
The approval of any application for development by the Township shall in
no way be construed as acceptance of any street or drainage system or
other improvement. No improvements shall be accepted by the Township
Committee unless and until all of the following conditions have been met:
in the performance guaranty shall be applied to the cash deposit in the
same proportion as the original cash deposit bears to the full amount of
the performance guaranty.
C. If any portion of the required improvements is rejected, the obligor
shall complete or correct such improvements and, upon completion or
correction, shall notify the Township Committee as specified in
§ 176-25J and the same procedures shall be followed as in the first
instance.
D. Prior to the Township Committee approving the final reduction and
release of the performance guaranty, all easements and open space
specified on the final plat shall be conveyed to the Township, or such
other grantee, by deed containing a metes and bounds legal
description.
A. The final application for development shall have been approved by the
Planning Board and the developer shall have submitted an affidavit,
signed by a licensed New Jersey professional land surveyor, certifying
that all required monuments have been set in accordance with the Map
Filing Law111 and any approved subdivision plat.
B. The Township Engineer shall have certified, in writing, that the
improvements are completed and that they comply with the
requirements of this chapter and the terms of the final application for
development approved by the Board.
C. The owner shall have filed with the Township Committee a maintenance
guaranty in an amount equal to and not more than 15% of the cost of
installing the improvements, the cost to be determined by the Township
Engineer in accordance with § 176-22D(2). The maintenance guaranty
shall run for a period of two years. The procedures and requirements
governing such maintenance guaranty shall be identical with the
procedures and requirements for a performance guaranty set forth in
this chapter. The requirements for a maintenance guaranty may be
waived by the Township Committee only if the Township Engineer has
certified that the improvements have been in continuous use for not
less than two years from the date the Township Engineer certified
completion of such improvements and that during this period the owner
has maintained the improvements in a satisfactory manner; and

§ 176-26 WATERFORD CODE § 176-27
168:396
§ 176-28. Off-tract improvements.
D. An as-built plan and profiles of all utilities and roads (two black and
white prints to be sent to the Township Engineer, plus a Mylar copy and
two black and white prints to be sent to the Administrative Officer),
with certification signed and sealed by a New Jersey licensed
professional engineer as to the actual construction as approved by the
Township Engineer, shall be provided.
A. Required improvements Applicants shall be required, as a condition for
approval of a subdivision, site plan or conditional use to pay their
proportionate share of the cost providing reasonable and necessary
street improvements and/or water, sewerage and drainage facility
improvements, and any necessary easements therefor located outside
the property limits of the subject premises and necessitated or required
by construction or improvements within such subdivision or
development.
B. Improvements to be constructed at the expense of the developer. In
cases where the need for an off-tract improvement is reasonably
created by the proposed subdivision or development and where no
other property owners receive a special benefit thereby, as opposed to a
mere incidental benefit, the applicant may be required, as a condition of
approval and at the applicant's sole expense, to acquire and/or improve
lands outside the tract and dedicate such lands to the Township of
Waterford, Camden County, or the State of New Jersey, or in lieu
thereof, require the subdivider or developer to deposit with the
Township a sum of money sufficient to allow the Township to acquire
and/or improve such lands or conditions it may deem appropriate under
the circumstances.
C. General standards for other improvements. In cases where the need for
any off-tract improvement to be implemented now or in the future is
reasonably necessitated by the proposed development application, the
following criteria, together with the provisions or rules and regulations
of the Township of Waterford or any department thereof, may be
utilized in determining the developer's proportionate share of such
improvements:
(1) Sanitary sewers.
(a) The capacity and the design of the sanitary sewer system shall
be based on the Rules and Regulations for the Preparation and
Submission of Plans for Sewerage Systems, NJDEP, and all
Waterford Township Municipal Utility Authority sewer design
standards, including infiltration standards.
(b) The applicant's engineer shall provide the Township Engineer
with the existing and anticipated gallons per day flow ratio.
The proportionate share shall be computed as follows:
§ 176-27 INSURANCE § 176-28
168:397
Developer's Proportionate
Share
Total project cost
=
Development gpd
Total tributary gpd
(c) Specific plans for the improved system or the extended system
shall be prepared by the developer's engineer and submitted to
the Planning Board during the time period when the Board is
reviewing the proposed subdivision and/or site plan
application. The total cost for the improvement and the
developer's proportionate share shall be calculated by the
developer's engineer, submitted to the Board, reviewed by the
Township Engineer and approved by the Board, with any
reasonable adjustments to the estimated costs, at the time
when preliminary approval of the application for development
is granted.
(2) Roadways. For street widening, alignment, channelization of
intersections, construction of barriers, new or improved traffic
signalization, signs, curbs, sidewalks, trees, utility improvements
not covered elsewhere, the construction or reconstruction of new
or existing streets and other associated streets or traffic
improvements:
(a) The applicant's engineer shall provide the Township Engineer
with the existing and anticipated peak-hour volumes that
impact the off-tract areas in question, which volumes shall
analyze pedestrian, bicycle and motor vehicle traffic. The
proportionate share shall be computed as follows:
Developer's proportionate share
Total cost of roadway
improvement and/or extension
=
Additional peak-hour
traffic
Generated by the
Development
Future total peak-hour
traffic
(b) The applicant shall furnish a plan for the proposed off-tract
improvements, which shall include the estimated peak-hour
traffic generated by the proposed development. The ratio of
the peak-hour traffic generated by the proposed development
to the future peak-hour traffic shall form the basis of the
proportionate share.
(c) Specific plans for the roadway improvement and/or extension
shall be prepared by the developer's engineer and submitted to
the Planning Board during the time period when the Board is
reviewing the proposed subdivision and/or site plan
application. The total cost for the enlargement or improvement
and the developer's proportionate share of the total cost shall
§ 176-28 WATERFORD CODE § 176-28
168:398
be calculated by the developer's engineer, submitted to the
Board, reviewed by the Township Engineer and approved by
the Board, with any reasonable adjustments to the estimated
costs, at the time when preliminary approval of the application
for development is granted.
(3) Drainage improvements. For the stormwater and drainage
improvements, including the installation, relocation or replacement
of storm drains, culverts, catch basins, manholes, riprap or
improved drainage ditches and appurtenances thereto and the
relocation or replacement of other storm drainage facilities or
appurtenances associated therewith:
(a) The capacity and design of the drainage system to
accommodate stormwater runoff shall be computed by the
developer's engineer and approved by the Township Engineer
and shall be based on a method either described in Natural
Resources Conservation Service Technical Release 55, or the
NRCS National Engineering Handbook, Section 4.
(b) Specific plans for the enlargement or improvement of the
drainage facilities shall be prepared by the developer's
engineer and submitted to the Planning Board during the time
period when the Board is reviewing the proposed subdivision
and/or site plan application. The total cost for the enlargement
or improvement and the developer's proportionate share of the
total cost shall be calculated by the developer's engineer,
submitted to the Board, reviewed by the Township Engineer
and approved by the Board, with any reasonable adjustments
to the estimated costs, at the time when preliminary approval
of the application for development is granted.
(4) Water.
(a) Regarding all nonresidential developments and all planned
developments, and regarding subdivisions where public water
is accessible, water mains shall be constructed and connected
to the existing public water supply systems by the applicant, at
the applicant's sole expense, and in such a manner as to make
adequate water service available to each lot or building within
the development. The entire system shall be designed in
accordance with the requirements and standards of the local
and/or state agency having approval authority and shall be
subject to their approval. The system also shall be designed
with adequate capacity and sustained pressure and in a looped
system with no dead-end lines whenever possible. For
purposes of this section with reference to subdivisions,
"accessible" shall mean that the property to be developed is no
further from an existing water main than the number of feet
calculated by multiplying the number of lots in the proposed
subdivision by 200 or, in the case of subdivisions in which more
§ 176-28 INSURANCE § 176-28
168:399
than 15 lots are proposed, "accessible" shall mean the property
to be developed is within one mile of an existing water main.
(b) Where no public water is accessible to a subdivision as defined
above, water shall be furnished on an individual lot basis. If
wells are installed on each lot and the lot also contains its own
sewage dispose facilities, the well shall be drilled and cased to
a depth of at least 100 feet unless the well penetrates an
impermeable clay aquiclude, in which case the well shall be
cased to at least 50 feet. Well installation, sealing and testing
shall be in accordance with the New Jersey Standards for
Construction of Water Supply Systems in Realty Improvements
(Chapter 199 of the Public Laws of 1954), as amended, and in
accordance with the guidelines and resolutions adopted by the
Camden County Department of Health. Prior to being placed in
consumer use and prior to issuance of a certificate of
occupancy for any building served by the well, the developer
shall certify to the County Department of Health that he has
complied with all applicable state, county and local
regulations.
(c) Where no public water is accessible to a subdivision as defined
above, in addition to complying with § 176-101, the applicant
shall deposit funds in escrow with the Township of Waterford in
an amount equal to the cost of connecting the subdivision to an
existing public water supply system, calculated on the basis of
200 feet per unit. The escrow amount shall be calculated by
determining the costs of providing such water main extension
as charged by the public water utility for such service,
including but not limited to, materials installation, taxes,
appurtenances and surcharges, if any.
(d) In lieu of depositing the aforesaid escrow funds, the applicant
may, at his option, elect to install water main extensions in the
subdivision, even though public water may not be accessible as
defined above.
D. Escrow accounts. Where the proposed off-tract improvement is to be
undertaken at a future date, funds required for the improvement shall
be deposited to the credit of the Township of Waterford in a separate
account until such time as the improvement is constructed. In lieu of a
cash escrow account developers may present irrevocable letters of
credit, for the term required, in a form acceptable to the Township
Attorney. If the off-tract improvement is not begun within 10 years of
the deposit, all monies and interest shall be returned to the applicant or
the letter of credit, as the case may be, surrendered. An off-tract
improvement shall be considered begun if the Township of Waterford
has taken legal steps to provide for the design and financing of such
improvements.
E. Referral to Township Committee.
§ 176-28 WATERFORD CODE § 176-28
168:400
(1) Where applications for development suggest the need for off-tract
improvements, whether to be installed in conjunction with the
development in question or otherwise, the reviewing municipal
Board shall forward, to the Township Committee, a list and
description of all such improvements together with a request that
the Township Committee determine and advise the Board of the
procedure to be followed in construction or installation thereof,
including timing. The Board shall defer final action upon the
subdivision or site plan until receipt of the Township Committee's
determination or the expiration of 90 days after forwarding such
list and description, whichever occurs first.
(2) The Township Committee, within 90 days after receipt of said list
and description, shall determine and advise the reviewing
municipal Board of the procedure to be followed and advise the
Board with regard to suggested conditions of approval, if any, to
adequately protect the municipality.
(3) In the event the reviewing municipal Board is required by statute to
act upon the application prior to receipt of the Township
Committee's determination regarding construction of off-tract
improvements, it shall request the applicant consent to an
extension of time within which to act, of sufficient duration to
enable the Township Committee to make the aforesaid
determination. In the event the applicant is unwilling to consent to
the requested extension of time, the reviewing municipal Board
shall condition its approval upon the subsequent determination of
the Township Committee.
F. Implementation of off-tract improvements.
(1) In all cases, developers shall be required to enter into an
agreement or agreements with the Township Committee, regarding
off-tract improvements, within one year from the date of municipal
subdivision or site plan approval in accordance with this chapter
and any other ordinances, policies, rules and regulations of the
Township of Waterford, Camden County, and the State of New
Jersey, and any departments, authorities or agencies thereof.
Should an agreement or agreements not be entered into within the
aforesaid time period, or within such extended time as may be
granted by the Township Committee, the municipal subdivision
and/or site plan approval shall be deemed null and void.
(2) Where properties outside the subject tract will be benefited by the
improvements, the Township Committee may require the applicant
to escrow sufficient funds, in accordance with § 176-25A
hereinabove, to secure the developer's proportionate share of the
eventual cost of providing future structural improvements based
upon the standards expressed herein.
§ 176-28 INSURANCE § 176-28
168:401
(3) Where properties outside the subject tract will benefit by the
improvements, the Township Committee may determine that the
improvement(s) are to be installed by the municipality as a general
improvement, the cost of which is to be borne as a general expense.
If the Township Committee shall determine that the
improvement(s) shall be constructed or installed as a general
improvement, the Township Committee may direct the Planning
Board to estimate, with the aid of the Township Engineer, the
amount, if any, by which the total cost thereof will exceed the total
amount by which all properties, including the subject tract, will be
specifically benefited thereby, and the subdivider or developer shall
be liable to the municipality for such expense.
(4) If the Township Committee shall determine that the
improvement(s) shall be constructed or installed as a local
improvement, all or part of the cost is to be assessed against
properties benefited thereby in proportion to the benefits conferred
by the improvements in accordance with Chapter 56 of Title 40 of
the Statutes of the State of New Jersey. The developer may be
required to sign an agreement acknowledging and agreeing to this
procedure and, in addition, the Township Committee may require
that the developer shall be liable to the municipality, in addition to
the amount of any special assessments against the subject property
for benefits conferred by the improvement(s), the difference
between the total cost actually incurred and the total mount by
which all properties, including the subject tract, are specially
benefited by the improvement as the same may be determined by
the Board of Improvements Assessors.
(5) If the Township Committee shall determine that the improvements
are to be constructed or installed by the applicant, such agreement
may contain provisions, consistent with the standards in this
chapter and any other rules, regulations or policies of Waterford
Township, Camden County and the State of New Jersey, and any
departments, authorities or agencies thereof with jurisdiction
therein, whereby the applicant shall be reimbursed by the
municipality or otherwise, as a result of any participation fees,
connection charges, charges paid in regard to developer's
agreements with other applicants and the like, all in accordance
with an agreement between the Township Committee and the
applicant.
(6) In determining the procedures to be followed in the event of the
submission of a list and request from the reviewing municipal
Board, the Township Committee shall be guided by the following
standards and considerations:
(a) The local trends in regard to the probability of development
within the drainage or circulation area in question and the
intensity of such development;
§ 176-28 WATERFORD CODE § 176-28
168:402
(b) The risk and exposure that neighboring areas are subject to in
the event that the improvements to be required are delayed;
(c) The extent to which temporary measures may sufficiently
alleviate the condition or conditions requiring the off-tract
improvement and the likelihood that larger regional or
subregional facilities will be required in the future to serve the
development tract and the general area of the municipality in
which the same is located; and
(d) The extent to which the health, safety and welfare of the
residents, both current and future, depend upon the immediate
implementation of the off-tract improvement.

Review and Procedures, § 176-14A through K inclusive, prior to
proceeding with submissions under this article.
§ 176-29. Informal workshop.
To assist with the application process, the Zoning Official and a
representative of the Commission are available to meet with developers
informally to discuss their plans and provide guidance. These meetings can
be scheduled in the Waterford Township Municipal Building on the third
Tuesday of each month. The following shall be submitted 15 days prior to
the meeting date:
§ 176-30. Responsibility during development application review.
The Planning Board's responsibilities are outlined in Article V.
A. When the developer requests the Municipal or Planning Board
Engineer be present, the required escrow must be deposited in
accordance with § 176-20D(6).
B. A statement listing the following information:
(1) Name, address and telephone number of applicant;
(2) Street address and/or lot and block numbers for the parcel to be
discussed;
(3) A brief description of the proposed development.
A. Simultaneous review. The Planning Board shall have the power to act
upon subdivision, conditional use, site plan or variance applications
simultaneously without the applicant making further application for
hearings. The longest time period for action by the Board, whether it is
for subdivision, conditional use, site plan or variance approval, shall
apply. Whenever approval of a conditional use or variance is requested
by the applicant in conjunction with a site plan or subdivision
application, notice of the hearing on the plan shall include reference to
the request for such conditional use or variance.
B. Exceptions. The Planning Board shall have the power to grant such
exceptions from the design and performance standards in accordance
with § 176-19N.

All applications requiring Planning Board review must be filed no later than
30 days prior to the anticipated hearing date.
§ 176-32. Revisions to correct adverse effect.
If it is determined that any proposed development may create, either
directly or indirectly, an adverse effect on either the remainder of the
property being developed or nearby property, the Planning Board may
require the developer to revise the plat. Where the remaining portion

subdivision or site plan, the approving Board shall condition the
approval it grants upon either timely receipt of a favorable report by the
County Board or approval by the County Board. If the County Board's
report is negative or attaches conditions, the original action by the
municipal Board shall be null and void and a new resolution shall be

§ 176-35. Planning Board applications.
A. Conditional use review. Conditional uses listed in this chapter and as
defined in § 176-9 are subject to the review procedures specified
herein.
B. Subdivision review. All subdivisions, as defined in § 176-9 (see
definitions of "major subdivision," "minor subdivision" and "subdivision
or resubdivision"), are subject to the review procedures specified
herein.
C. Site plan review. Review by the Planning Board shall be required for
minor site plans and major site plans as defined in § 176-9 (see
definitions of "site plan, minor" and "site plan, major," in Subsections C
and D of the definition of "site plan)," as well as proposals which do not
meet the requirements as defined in § 176-9 for exempt site plans and
administrative site plans (see definitions of "site plan, exempt" and "site
plan, administrative," in Subsections A and B of the definition of "site
plan"). No construction permit shall be issued for any new structure or
for any addition or alteration to an existing structure and no certificate
of occupancy shall be issued for any change of use of an existing
structure until the site plan has been reviewed and approved by the
appropriate Board, except that:
(1) A construction permit for a single-family detached dwelling unit or
a two-family dwelling unit shall not require site plan approval.
(2) A change of use from one permitted category of nonresidential use
to another permitted category of nonresidential use may not
require site plan approval if:
(a) The Administrative Review Committee certifies to the Board, in
writing, that the existing site development meets the
requirements of this chapter for the new use category; and
(b) The new use category does not require an increase in the
number of required parking spaces; and
(c) The Planning Board concurs with the findings of the
Administrative Review Committee.
(3) Permitted accessory buildings to residential and agricultural/
horticultural uses shall not require site plan approval, but may be
subject to administrative review.

public sewers, or will disturb more than 1,500 square feet of
land.
(5) An applicant may elect to file for preliminary and final site plan
approval simultaneously to expedite the review process. The site
plan shall be prepared according to the requirements stipulated for
final approval. Developers electing to by-pass preliminary approval
stage are doing so at the risk of added expense if changes in design
are required.
D. Informal review by the Planning Board.
(1) At the request of a developer, the Planning Board shall hear one
informal presentation of a conceptual plan for a development for
which the developer intends to prepare and submit an application

scale for a conceptual plan shall be sufficient to enable the
Planning Board and the applicant to comment upon design
concepts, such as building location, ingress and egress, parking,
and major natural features that will have to be recognized or may
influence certain design criteria and the applicant's basic intent for
water, sewerage and storm drainage facilities.
(2) The developer desiring to have a conceptual plan informally
reviewed by the Planning Board shall submit the required
information to the Clerk of the Board at least 20 days prior to the
meeting. The Clerk of the Board shall thereafter confirm to the
developer that the matter is scheduled, setting forth the time and
place of the meeting. No request for informal review shall take

and be subject to the same requirements of minor or major site plan
approval, as the case may be.
C. Review of conditional use application. In addition to the general
requirements of minor or major site plan review, as the case may be, the
Board shall review information regarding the number of employees or
users of the property and shall give due consideration to all reasonable
elements which would affect the public health, welfare, safety, comfort
and convenience of the community. The uses for which conditional use
permits are granted shall be deemed to be permitted uses in their
respective districts, and each conditional use shall be considered as an
individual case. In all requests for approval of conditional use, the

(1) For purposes here, "sustainable energy facilities," as defined in
§ 176-9, include solar and small wind generating systems designed
to:
(a) Provide all or a portion of the electrical power requirements to
provide power for the principal use of the property where said
system is to be located and shall not be for the generation of
power for commercial purposes, although this provision shall
not be interpreted to prohibit the sale of excess power
generated from time to time from a small wind or solar energy
system designed to meet the energy needs of the principal use.
For the purposes of this subsection, the sale of excess power
shall be limited so that in no event an energy system is
generating more energy for sale than what is otherwise
necessary to power the principal use on the property.
(b) Small wind and solar energy systems shall only be permitted as
an accessory use on the same lot as the principal use. All
energy systems require approval from the Zoning Officer and
Construction Office prior to installation. Applications for an
energy system shall include information demonstrating
compliance with the provisions of this subsection. In the event
that the Zoning Officer or Construction Office does not believe
the provisions of this subsection will be satisfied, an applicant
may request a variance from the Planning Board.119
(2) General conditions.
(a) Small wind and solar energy systems shall not be used for
displaying any advertising except for reasonable identification
of the manufacturer or operator of the system. In no case shall
any identification be visible from a property line.

combinations to achieve the stated objectives. Any required
landscaping in a buffer area shall comply with the vegetation standards
specified in § 176-72.
B. When required.
(1) Buffering shall be required when topographical or other barriers do
not provide reasonable screening and when the Planning Board
determines there is a need to shield the site from adjacent
properties and to minimize adverse impacts, such as incompatible
land uses, noise, glaring light, and traffic. No drainage basin shall
be located within the required landscaped portion of any buffer
area. In small lot developments, when building design and
placement do not provide privacy, the Planning Board may require
landscaping, fences, or walls to ensure privacy and screen dwelling
units.
(2) Where required, buffers shall be measured from side and rear
property lines, excluding access driveways, and shall not be
counted as part of any required front yard area. Buffers may be
counted as part of any required side or rear yard area conditioned
that no deviation shall occur to the type, size and width of the
buffer.
C. Dimensions.
(1) Where more intensive land uses abut less intensive uses a
landscaped buffer strip of 50 feet, but not to exceed 10% of the lot
area, in width shall be required.

unloading areas shall be screened around their perimeter by a
landscaped buffer strip a minimum of five feet wide. Such
screening shall be by an extension of the building, a fence, berm,
wall, evergreen planting, or combination thereof, and shall not be
less than four feet in height.
(4) Where residential subdivisions abut higher order streets, adjacent
lots should front on lower order streets, and a landscaped buffer
area shall be provided along the property line abutting the road.
The buffer strip shall be a minimum of 15 feet wide, but not exceed
10% of the lot area, and include both trees and shrubs.
(5) Parking area perimeters shall be buffered from adjoining
residential uses or zones by twenty-five-foot-wide landscaped
buffer areas that include both trees and shrubs.

D. Design. Arrangement of plantings in buffers shall provide maximum
protection to adjacent properties and avoid damage to existing plant
material. Possible arrangements include planting in parallel,
serpentine, or broken rows. If planted berms are used, the minimum top
width shall be four feet and the maximum side slope shall be 2:1.
E. Planting specifications. Plant materials shall be sufficiently large and
planted in such a fashion that a screen at least eight feet in height shall
be produced within three growing seasons. All plantings shall be
installed according to accepted horticultural standards.
(1) The preservation of natural wooded tracts shall be an integral part
of all site plans and subdivisions and may be calculated as part of
the required buffer area, provided that the growth is of a density
and the area is of a width to serve the purpose of a buffer.
(2) Shrubs and hedges used in screen planting shall be at least three
feet in height when planted and shall be of such density to obscure,
throughout the full course of the year, the glare of automobile
headlights emitted from the premises.
(3) Except for existing preserved or transplanted vegetation,
evergreen species shall be at least six feet in height at the time of
planting. Deciduous trees shall be at least 2 1/2 inches caliper and
a minimum of 10 feet in height at the time of planting.
(4) Screen plantings shall be placed in accordance with § 176-60B and
shall be no closer than 10 feet from any street or five feet from any
interior property line at maturity.
(5) All vegetation contained within a landscaped buffer shall be deed
restricted against removal, destruction or any modification other
than that normally required for maintenance.
F. Maintenance. Plantings shall be watered regularly and in a manner
appropriate for the specific plant species through the first growing
season. Dead or dying plants shall be replaced by the developer or
owner during the next planting season. No buildings, structures,
storage of materials, or parking shall be permitted within the
landscaped buffer area; buffer areas shall be maintained and kept free
of all debris, rubbish, weeds, and tall grass.
G. Scenic corridors.
(1) No buildings shall be located within 200 feet of any river, lake,
pond, or stream.
(2) All structures within 1,000 feet of the center line of the Mullica

provide for internal circulation within residentially developed
areas.
(4) No approval or permit shall be issued for development along the
scenic corridors as designated above, other than for establishments
for the sale of agricultural products, unless the applicant
demonstrates that all buildings are set back at least 200 feet from
the center line of the scenic corridor, except that:
(a) If compliance with the two-hundred-foot setback is constrained
by environmental or other physical considerations, such as
wetlands or active agricultural operations, the building shall
be set back as close to 200 feet as practical; provided, however,
that the location of the building conforms to the requirements
for wetlands as specified in § 176-103, and the site shall be
landscaped to provide screening between the building and the
corridor.
(b) If an applicant for development approval demonstrates that
more than 50% of the existing development patterns of the
corridor are such that buildings are set back less than 200 feet
within 1,000 feet of the site proposed for development, then a

infrastructure necessary to accommodate said increased densities; to
promote compliance with the energy conservation standards in
§ 176-63; to regulate growth so development occurs on lands suitable
for development based on analysis of the natural resource inventory
and considering the cumulative impact on developable lands as a result
of construction; to encourage the desired growth and densities only in
areas where the Master Plan anticipates development and the growth
of services to serve said development; and to achieve a sufficient
variation in the quality and type of tax rebates among residential,
commercial and industrial development to reduce the demand on
various Township services, including schools occasioned by
predominately residential development, the following standards shall
apply with regard to public sewer:

A. Scope and purpose.
(1) Purpose.
(a) It is hereby determined that:
[1] Land development projects and associated disturbance of
vegetation and soil and changes in land cover, including
increases in impervious cover, alter the hydrologic
response of local watersheds and increase stormwater
runoff rates and volumes. If inadequately or improperly
managed, this stormwater runoff can deplete groundwater
resources and increase flooding, stream channel erosion,
and sediment transport and deposition.
[2] This stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities
of waterborne pollutants.
[3] Increases of stormwater runoff, soil erosion and nonpoint
source pollutants have occurred in the past as a result of
land development, and contribute to the degradation of
the water resources of the Township of Waterford.
[4] All lands of the Township of Waterford lie within the
Pinelands Area, and therefore, development in the
Township of Waterford is subject to the requirements of
the Pinelands Protection Act (N.J.S.A. 13:18A-1 et seq.)
and the implementing regulations and minimum standards
contained in the Pinelands Comprehensive Management
Plan (N.J.A.C. 7:50-1.1 et seq.) (CMP). The purpose and
intent of these regulations and standards is to promote
orderly development of the Pinelands so as to preserve and
protect the significant and unique natural, ecological,
agricultural, archaeological, historical, scenic, cultural
and recreational resources of the Pinelands.
[5] Pinelands Area resources are to be protected in
accordance with Pinelands Comprehensive Management
Plan at N.J.A.C. 7:50 et seq., New Jersey's Stormwater
§ 176-58 WATERFORD CODE § 176-59
168:466
Management Rules at N.J.A.C. 7:8-1.1 et seq., and New
Jersey's surface water quality antidegradation policies
contained in the New Jersey Surface Water Quality
Standards at N.J.A.C. 7:9B-1.1 et seq. Permitted uses shall
maintain the ecological character and quality of the
Pinelands, including good water quality and natural rates
and volumes of flow.
[6] Increased stormwater rates and volumes and the
sediments and pollutants associated with stormwater
runoff from future development projects within the
Pinelands Area have the potential to adversely affect the
Township of Waterford's streams and water resources and
the streams and water resources of downstream
municipalities.
[7] Stormwater runoff, soil erosion and nonpoint source
pollution can be controlled and minimized through the
regulation of stormwater runoff from development sites.
[8] It is in the public interest to regulate the discharge of
stormwater runoff from major development projects, as
defined in Subsection G of this section, conducted within
the Pinelands Area, as provided in this section, in order to
control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates
and volumes, to maintain groundwater recharge, and to
control and minimize soil erosion, stream channel erosion
and nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater
runoff.
(b) Therefore, it is the purpose of this section to establish
minimum stormwater management requirements and controls
for major development, consistent with the statewide
stormwater requirements at N.J.A.C. 7:8, the regulations and
standards contained in the Pinelands CMP, and the provisions
of the adopted Master Plan and land use ordinances of the
Township of Waterford.
(2) Goals and techniques.
(a) Through this section, the Township of Waterford has
established the following goals for stormwater control:
[1] To reduce flood damage, including damage to life and
property;
[2] To minimize any increase in stormwater runoff from new
development;
[3] To reduce soil erosion from any development or
construction project;
§ 176-59 INSURANCE § 176-59
168:467
[4] To assure the adequacy of existing and proposed culverts
and bridges, and other in-stream structures;
[5] To maintain groundwater recharge;
[6] To minimize any increase in nonpoint pollution;
[7] To maintain the integrity of stream channels for their
biological functions, as well as for drainage;
[8] To restore, protect, maintain and enhance the quality of
the streams and water resources of the Township of
Waterford and the ecological character and quality of the
Pinelands Area;
[9] To minimize pollutants in stormwater runoff from new and
existing development in order to restore, protect, enhance
and maintain the chemical, physical and biological
integrity of the surface and groundwaters of the Township
of Waterford, to protect public health and to enhance the
domestic, municipal, recreational, industrial and other
uses of water; and
[10] To protect public safety through the proper design and
operation of stormwater management basins.
(b) In order to achieve the goals for stormwater control set forth in
this section, the Township of Waterford has identified the
following management techniques:
[1] Implementation of multiple stormwater management best
management practices (BMPs) may be necessary to
achieve the performance standards for stormwater runoff
quantity and rate, groundwater recharge, erosion control,
and stormwater runoff quality established through this
section.
[2] Compliance with the stormwater runoff quantity and rate,
groundwater recharge, erosion control, and stormwater
runoff quality standards established through N.J.A.C.
7:8-1.1 et seq., and this section shall be accomplished to
the maximum extent practicable through the use of
nonstructural BMPs, before relying on structural BMPs.
Nonstructural BMPs are also known as low impact
development (LID) techniques.
[3] Nonstructural BMPs shall include both environmentally
sensitive site design and source controls that prevent
pollutants from being placed on the site or from being
exposed to stormwater.
§ 176-59 WATERFORD CODE § 176-59
168:468
[4] Source control plans shall be developed based upon
physical site conditions and the origin, nature and the
anticipated quantity or amount of potential pollutants.
[5] Structural BMPs, where necessary, shall be integrated
with nonstructural stormwater management strategies
and proper maintenance plans.
[6] When using structural BMPs, multiple stormwater
management measures, smaller in size and distributed
spatially throughout the land development site, shall be
used wherever possible to achieve the performance
standards for water quality, quantity and groundwater
recharge established through this section before relying
on a single, larger stormwater management measure to
achieve these performance standards.
(3) Applicability. This section shall apply to:
(a) All site plans and subdivisions for major developments
occurring within the Pinelands Area that require preliminary
or final site plan or subdivision review; and
(b) All major development projects undertaken by the Township of
Waterford.121
(4) Procedures. In addition to other development review procedures
set forth in the Code of the Township of Waterford, major
developments located within the Pinelands Area shall comply with
the stormwater management requirements and specifications set
forth in this section. New agricultural development that meets the
definition of major development in Subsection G of this section
shall be submitted to the appropriate Soil Conservation District for
review and approval in accordance with the requirements of
N.J.A.C. 7:8-5.4(b).
(5) Compatibility with other permit and ordinance requirements.
(a) Development approvals issued for subdivisions and site plans
pursuant to this section are to be considered an integral part of
development approvals under the subdivision and site plan
review process and do not relieve the applicant of the
responsibility to secure required permits or approvals for
activities regulated by any other applicable ordinance, code,
rule, regulation, statute, act or other provision of law.
(b) In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this
section shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the
121. This clause is intended to provide consistency with DEP's stormwater management
requirements. As per normal practice, all development within the Pinelands Area which is
undertaken by a Pinelands Area municipality shall comply with all of the requirements of
the CMP.
§ 176-59 INSURANCE § 176-59
168:469
promotion of the public health, safety, and general welfare.
This section is not intended to interfere with, abrogate, or
annul any other ordinances, rule or regulation, statute, or
other provision of law except that, where any provision of
this section imposes restrictions different from those imposed
by any other ordinance, rule or regulation, or other provision
of law, the more restrictive or stringent provisions or higher
standards shall control.
(c) In the event that a regional stormwater management plan(s) is
prepared and formally adopted pursuant to N.J.A.C. 7:8-1.1 et
seq. for any drainage area(s) or watershed(s) of which the
Township of Waterford is a part, the stormwater provisions of
such a plan(s) shall be adopted by the Township of Waterford
within one year of the adoption of a regional stormwater
management plan (RSWMP) as an amendment to an Areawide
Water Quality Management Plan. Local ordinances proposed to
implement the RSWMP shall be submitted to the Commission
for certification within six months of the adoption of the
RSWMP per N.J.A.C. 7:8 and the Pinelands CMP (N.J.A.C. 7:50).

application requirements in the Pinelands CMP [N.J.A.C.
7:50-4.2(b)] shall be submitted to the NJ Pinelands Commission
unless the Executive Director waives or modifies the
application requirements.
C. Methodologies for the calculation of stormwater runoff rate and
volume, stormwater runoff quality, and groundwater recharge.
(1) Method of calculating stormwater runoff rate and volume.
(a) In complying with the stormwater runoff quantity and rate
standards in subsection D(2), the design engineer shall
calculate the stormwater runoff rate and volume using the
USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Runoff
Equation, Runoff Curve Numbers, and Dimensionless Unit
Hydrograph, as described in the NRCS National Engineering
Handbook Part 630, Hydrology and Technical Release 55,
Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds, incorporated herein
by reference, as amended and supplemented. Alternative
methods of calculation may be utilized, provided such
alternative methods are at least as protective as the NRCS
methodology when considered on a regional stormwater
management basis.
(b) In calculating stormwater runoff using the NRCS methodology,
the design engineer shall separately calculate and then
combine the runoff volumes from pervious and directly
connected impervious surfaces within each drainage area
within the parcel.
(c) Calculation of stormwater runoff from unconnected impervious
surfaces shall be based, as applicable, upon the two-Step
method described in the current New Jersey Stormwater Best
Management Practices Manual or the NRCS methodology.
§ 176-59 INSURANCE § 176-59
168:475
(d) In calculating stormwater runoff using the NRCS methodology,
the design engineer shall use appropriate twenty-four-hour
rainfall depths as developed for the project site by the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, available online at
http://hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/pfds/index.html.
(e) When calculating stormwater runoff for predeveloped site
conditions, the design engineer shall use the following criteria:
[1] When selecting or calculating runoff curve numbers (CNs)
for predeveloped project site conditions, the project site's
land cover shall be assumed to be woods in good condition.
However, another land cover may be used to calculate
runoff coefficients if:
[a] Such land cover has existed at the site or portion
thereof without interruption for at least five years
immediately prior to the time of application; and
[b] The design engineer can document the character and
extent of such land cover through the use of
photographs, affidavits, and/or other acceptable land
use records.
[2] If more than one land cover has existed on the site during
the five years immediately prior to the time of application,
the land cover with the lowest runoff potential shall be
used for the computations.
[3] All predeveloped land covers shall be assumed to be in
good hydrologic condition and, if cultivated, shall be
assumed to have conservation treatment.
[4] In calculating predeveloped site stormwater runoff, the
design engineer shall include the effects of all land
features and structures, such as ponds, wetlands,
depressions, hedgerows, and culverts, that affect
predeveloped site stormwater runoff rates and/or volumes.
[5] Where tailwater will affect the hydraulic performance of a
stormwater management measure, the design engineer
shall include such effects in the measure's design.
(2) Method of calculating stormwater runoff quality.
(a) In complying with the stormwater runoff quality standards in
Subsection D(6)(a), the design engineer shall calculate the
stormwater runoff rate and volume using the USDA Natural
Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Runoff Equation,
Runoff Curve Numbers, and Dimensionless Unit Hydrograph,
as described in the NRCS National Engineering Handbook Part
§ 176-59 WATERFORD CODE § 176-59
168:476
630, Hydrology and Technical Release 55, Urban Hydrology for
Small Watersheds, as amended and supplemented.
(b) The design engineer shall also use the NJDEP Water Quality
Design Storm, which is 1.25 inches of rainfall falling in a
nonlinear pattern in two hours. Details of the water quality
design storm are shown in Table 1.
(c) Calculation of runoff volumes, peak rates, and hydrographs for
the water quality design storm may take into account the
implementation of nonstructural and structural stormwater
management measures.

(d) Total suspended solids (TSS) reduction calculations.
[1] If more than one stormwater BMP in series is necessary to
achieve the required 80% TSS reduction for a site, the
applicant shall utilize the following formula to calculate
TSS reduction:
R = A + B - (A x B)/100
§ 176-59 INSURANCE § 176-59
168:477
Where:
R = Total TSS percent load removal from
application of both BMPs;
A = The TSS percent removal rate applicable to the
first BMP; and
B = The TSS percent removal rate applicable to the
second BMP.
[2] If there is more than one on-site drainage area, the 80%
TSS removal rate shall apply to each drainage area, unless
the runoff from the subareas converge on site, in which
case the removal rate can be demonstrated through a
calculation using a weighted average.
(e) TSS removal rates for stormwater BMPs.
[1] For purposes of TSS reduction calculations, Table 2
presents the presumed removal rates for certain BMPs
designed in accordance with the New Jersey BMP Manual.
The BMP Manual may be obtained from the address
identified in Subsection K or found on the NJDEP's website
at www.njstormwater.org. TSS reduction shall be
calculated based on the removal rates for the BMPs in
Table 2.
[2] Alternative stormwater management measures, removal
rates and methods of calculating removal rates may be
used if the design engineer provides documentation
demonstrating the capability of these alternative rates and
methods to the Township of Waterford. Any alternative
stormwater management measure, removal rate or
method of calculating the removal rate shall be subject to
approval by the Township of Waterford and a copy shall be
provided to the following:

presents the presumed removal rates for certain BMPs
designed in accordance with the New Jersey BMP Manual. If
alternative stormwater BMPs are proposed, the applicant shall
demonstrate that the selected BMPs will achieve the nutrient
removal standard required in Subsection D(6).
(3) Methods of calculating groundwater recharge.
(a) If complying with the groundwater recharge standards
contained in Subsection D(3)(a)[1], the design engineer may
calculate groundwater recharge in accordance with the New
Jersey Groundwater Recharge Spreadsheet (NJGRS) computer
program incorporated herein by reference as amended and
supplemented. Information regarding the methodology is
available in Subsection J(1) or from the New Jersey BMP
Manual.
(b) Alternative groundwater recharge calculation methods to meet
these requirements may be used upon approval by the
Municipal Engineer.
(c) If complying with the groundwater recharge standards
contained in Subsection D(3)(a)[2], the design engineer shall:
[1] Calculate stormwater runoff volumes in accordance with
the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service
(NRCS) methodology, including the NRCS Runoff Equation
and Runoff Curve Numbers, as described in the NRCS
National Engineering Handbook Part 630, Hydrology and
Technical Release 55, Urban Hydrology for Small
Watersheds, as amended and supplemented; and
[2] Use appropriate two-year, twenty-four-hour rainfall depths
as developed for the project site by the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration, available online at
http://hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/pfds/index.html.
(d) When calculating groundwater recharge or stormwater runoff
for predeveloped site conditions, the design engineer shall use
the following criteria:
[1] When selecting land covers or calculating runoff curve
numbers (CNs) for predeveloped project site conditions,
the project site's land cover shall be assumed to be woods.
However, another land cover may be used to calculate
runoff coefficients if:
[a] Such land cover has existed at the site or portion
thereof without interruption for at least five years
immediately prior to the time of application; and
§ 176-59 INSURANCE § 176-59
168:481
[b] The design engineer can document the character and
extent of such land cover through the use of
photographs, affidavits, and/or other acceptable land
use records.
[2] If more than one land cover, other than woods, has existed
on the site during the five years immediately prior to the
time of application, the land cover with the lowest runoff
potential (including woods) shall be used for the
computations.
[3] All predeveloped land covers shall be assumed to be in
good hydrologic condition and, if cultivated, shall be
assumed to have conservation treatment.
D. Stormwater management performance standards for major
development.
(1) Nonstructural stormwater management strategies.
(a) To the maximum extent practicable, the performance
standards in Subsection D for major development shall be met
by incorporating the nine nonstructural strategies identified in
Subchapter 5 of the NJ Stormwater Management Rules
(N.J.A.C. 7:8-5), and set forth in Subsection B(3)(d)[1], into the
design. The applicant shall identify within the land use
planning and source control plan required by Subsection
B(3)(d) of this section how each of the nine nonstructural
measures will be incorporated into the design of the project to
the maximum extent practicable.
(b) If the applicant contends that it is not practical for
engineering, environmental or safety reasons to incorporate
any of the nine nonstructural strategies into the design of a
particular project, the applicant shall provide a detailed
rationale establishing a basis for the contention that use of the
strategy is not practical on the site. This rationale shall be
submitted in accordance with the checklist requirements
established by Subsection B to the Township of Waterford. A
determination by the Township of Waterford that this rationale
is inadequate or without merit shall result in a denial of the
application unless one of the following conditions are met:
[1] The land use planning and source control plan is amended
to include a description of how all nine nonstructural
measures will be implemented on the development site,
and the amended plan is approved by the Township of
Waterford;
[2] The land use planning and source control plan is amended
to provide an alternative nonstructural strategy or
measure that is not included in the list of nine
§ 176-59 WATERFORD CODE § 176-59
168:482
nonstructural measures, but still meets the performance
standards in Subsection D, and the amended plan is
approved by the Township of Waterford; or
[3] The land use planning and source control plan is amended
to provide an adequate rationale for the contention that
use of the particular strategy is not practical on the site,
and the amended plan is approved by the Township of
Waterford.
(c) In addition to all other requirements of this section, each
applicant shall demonstrate that, at a minimum, existing trees
and vegetation on the development site will be preserved,
protected and maintained according to the minimum standards
established by provisions of Chapter 176, Land Use,
Development and Zoning, or by conditions of zoning or
variance approval. Existing trees and vegetation shall be
protected during construction activities in accordance with the
"Standard for Tree Protection During Construction" provided
in the NJ State Soil Conservation Committee Standards for Soil
Erosion and Sediment Control in New Jersey, which is
incorporated herein by reference as amended and
supplemented.
(d) In addition to all other requirements of this section, each
application for major development, and any other application
where the Township of Waterford otherwise requires a
landscaping plan, shall contain a landscaping or revegetation
plan in accordance with the Pinelands CMP standards at
N.J.A.C. 7:50-6.24(c).
(e) Any land area used as a nonstructural stormwater
management measure to meet the performance standards in
Subsection D shall be dedicated to a government entity; shall
be subjected to a conservation easement filed with the
appropriate County Clerk's office; or shall be subjected to an
equivalent form of restriction approved by the Township of
Waterford that ensures that that measure or equivalent
stormwater management measure is maintained in perpetuity,
as detailed in Subsection F of this section.
(f) Guidance for nonstructural stormwater management
strategies is available in the New Jersey BMP Manual, which
may be obtained from the address identified in Subsection K(1)
or found on the NJDEP's website at www.njstormwater.org.
(g) Exception for major development sites creating less than one
acre of disturbance. The use of nonstructural strategies to
meet the performance standards in Subsection D of this
section is not required for major development creating less
§ 176-59 INSURANCE § 176-59
168:483
than one acre of disturbance. However, the following
requirements shall be met:
[1] Each application for major development and any other
application where the Township of Waterford otherwise
requires a landscaping plan shall contain a landscaping or
revegetation plan prepared in accordance with the
Pinelands CMP standards [N.J.A.C. 7:50-6.24(c)];
[2] Each applicant shall demonstrate that, at a minimum,
existing trees and vegetation on the development site will
be preserved and protected according to the minimum
standards established by provisions of Chapter 176, Land
Use, Development and Zoning, or by conditions of zoning
or variance approval; and
[3] Existing trees and vegetation shall be protected during
construction activities in accordance with the "Standard
for Tree Protection During Construction" provided in the
NJ State Soil Conservation Committee Standards for Soil
Erosion and Sediment Control in New Jersey, which is
incorporated herein by reference as amended and
supplemented.
(2) Stormwater runoff quantity and rate standards.
(a) There shall be no direct discharge of stormwater runoff from
any point or nonpoint source to any wetland, wetlands
transition area or surface water body. In addition, stormwater
runoff shall not be directed in such a way as to increase the
volume and/or rate of discharge into any surface water body
from that which existed prior to development of the site.
(b) To the maximum extent practical, there shall be no direct
discharge of stormwater runoff onto farm fields so as to protect
farm crops from damage due to flooding, erosion and long-term
saturation of cultivated crops and cropland.
(c) For all major developments, the total runoff volume generated
from the net increase in impervious surfaces by a ten-year,
twenty-four-hour storm shall be retained and infiltrated on site.
(d) In addition, the design engineer, using the assumptions and
factors for stormwater runoff and groundwater recharge
calculations contained in Subsection C, shall either:
[1] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
that the post-developed stormwater runoff hydrographs
from the project site for the two-, ten-, and one-hundredyear
storms do not exceed, at any point in time, the site's
predeveloped runoff hydrographs for the same storms;
§ 176-59 WATERFORD CODE § 176-59
168:484
[2] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
that under post-developed site conditions:
[a] There is no increase in predeveloped stormwater
runoff rates from the project site for the two-, ten-, and
one-hundred-year storms; and
[b] Any increased stormwater runoff volume or change in
stormwater runoff timing for the two-, ten-, and onehundred-
year storms will not increase flood damage at
or downstream of the project site. When performing
this analysis for predeveloped site conditions, all offsite
development levels shall reflect existing
conditions. When performing this analysis for postdeveloped
site conditions, all off-site development
levels shall reflect full development in accordance
with current zoning and land use ordinances; or
[3] Demonstrate that the peak post-developed stormwater
runoff rates from the project site for the two-, ten-, and
one-hundred-year storms are 50%, 75% and 80%,
respectively, of the site's peak predeveloped stormwater
runoff rates for the same storms. Peak outflow rates from
on-site stormwater measures for these storms shall be
adjusted where necessary to account for the discharge of
increased stormwater runoff rates and/or volumes from
project site areas not controlled by the on-site measures.
These percentages do not have to be applied to those
portions of the project site that are not proposed for
development at the time of application, provided that such
areas are:
[a] Protected from future development by imposition of a
conservation easement, deed restriction, or other
acceptable legal measures; or
[b] Would be subject to review under these standards if
they are proposed for any degree of development in
the future.
(e) In tidal flood hazard areas, a stormwater runoff quantity
analysis in accordance with Subsection D(2)(d)[1], [2] and [3]
above shall only be applied if the increased volume of
stormwater runoff could increase flood damages below the
point of discharge.
(f) The standards for stormwater runoff quantity and rate
required by this section shall be met using the methods,
calculations and assumptions provided in Subsection C.
(3) Groundwater recharge standards.
§ 176-59 INSURANCE § 176-59
168:485
(a) For all major developments, with the exception of those
described in Subsection D(3)(d), below, the design engineer,
using the assumptions and factors for stormwater runoff and
groundwater recharge calculations contained in Subsection C,
shall either:
[1] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
that the post-developed project site maintains 100% of the
site's predeveloped average annual groundwater recharge
volume; or
[2] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
that any increase in the project site's stormwater runoff
volume for the two-year, twenty-four-hour storm from
predeveloped to post-developed conditions is infiltrated on
site.
(b) The design engineer shall assess the hydraulic impact on the
groundwater table and design the project site and all site
groundwater recharge measures so as to avoid adverse
hydraulic impacts. Adverse hydraulic impacts include, but are
not limited to: raising the groundwater table so as to cause
surface ponding; flooding of basements and other subsurface
structures and areas; preventing a stormwater infiltration
basin from completely draining via infiltration within 72 hours
of a design storm event; and interference with the proper
operation of subsurface sewage disposal systems and other
surface and subsurface facilities in the vicinity of the
groundwater recharge measure.
(c) The standards for groundwater recharge required by this
section shall be met using the methods, calculations and
assumptions provided in Subsection C.
(d) Exceptions.
[1] The preceding groundwater recharge standards shall not
apply to sites that create less than one acre of disturbance.
[2] The following types of stormwater shall not be recharged:
[a] Stormwater from areas of high pollutant loading. High
pollutant loading areas in industrial and commercial
developments where solvents and/or petroleum
products are loaded/unloaded, stored or applied;
areas where hazardous materials are expected to be
present in greater than reportable quantities as
defined by the United States Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR 302.4; areas
recharge would be inconsistent with department
approved remedial action work plan or landfill closure
plan and areas with high risks for spills of toxic
§ 176-59 WATERFORD CODE § 176-59
168:486
materials, such as gas stations and vehicle
maintenance facilities; and
[b] Industrial stormwater exposed to source material.
"Source material" means any material(s) or
machinery, located at an industrial facility that is
directly or indirectly related to process,
manufacturing or other industrial activities, which
could be a source of pollutants in any industrials
stormwater discharge to groundwater. Source

D(8)(a)[3][b] shall be void and the Township of
Waterford shall be prohibited from collecting in
lieu contributions.
(b) An exception from strict compliance granted in accordance
with Subsection D(8)(a) above shall not constitute a waiver of
strict compliance from the requirements of the Pinelands
Comprehensive Management Plan at N.J.A.C. 7:50. An
applicant should contact the Pinelands Commission to
determine whether a waiver of strict compliance is also
required in accordance with N.J.A.C. 7:50, Subchapter 4, Part
V.
E. Design, construction, and safety standards for structural stormwater
management measures.
(1) General design and construction standards.
(a) Structural stormwater management measures shall be
designed to meet the standards established in this subsection.
These standards have been developed to protect public safety,
conserve natural features, create an aesthetically pleasing site
and promote proper on-site stormwater management. Where
directed by the Township of Waterford, the applicant shall be
required to retrofit any existing substandard basin directly
impacted by the proposed development in order to comply with
the standards outlined in this subsection.
(b) The following structural stormwater management measures
may be utilized as part of a stormwater management system at
a major land development in the Pinelands, provided that the
applicant demonstrates that they are designed, constructed
and maintained so as to meet the standards and requirements
established by this subsection. If alternative stormwater
management measures are proposed, the applicant shall
demonstrate that the selected measures will achieve the
standards established by this subsection.
§ 176-59 INSURANCE § 176-59
168:491
[1] Bioretention systems;
[2] Constructed stormwater wetlands;
[3] Extended detention basins;
[4] Infiltration basins;
[5] Vegetated filter strips;
[6] Infiltration basins and trenches;
[7] Wet ponds with suitable liners;
[8] Pervious paving systems; and
[9] Manufactured treatment devices, provided their pollutant
removal rates are verified by the New Jersey Corporation
for Advanced Technology and certified by the NJDEP.
(c) Structural stormwater management measures shall be
designed to take into account the existing site conditions,
including environmentally critical areas, wetlands, flood-prone
areas, slopes, depth to seasonal high water table, soil type,
permeability and texture, and drainage area and drainage
patterns.
(d) Structural stormwater management measures shall be
designed and constructed to be strong, durable, and corrosion
resistant (measures that are consistent with the relevant
portions of the residential site improvement standards at
N.J.A.C. 5:21-7.3, 7.4, and 7.8 shall be deemed to meet this
requirement); to minimize and facilitate maintenance and
repairs; and to ensure proper functioning.
(e) For all stormwater management measures at a development
site, each applicant shall submit a detailed inspection,
maintenance and repair plan consistent with the requirements
of Subsection E of this section.
(f) To the maximum extent practicable, the design engineer shall
design structural stormwater management measures on the
development site in a manner that:
[1] Limits site disturbance, maximizes stormwater
management efficiencies, and maintains or improves
aesthetic conditions;
[2] Utilizes multiple stormwater management measures,
smaller in size and distributed spatially throughout the
land development site, instead of a single larger structural
stormwater management measure;
§ 176-59 WATERFORD CODE § 176-59
168:492
[3] Incorporates pretreatment measures. Pretreatment can
extend the functional life and increase the pollutant
removal capability of a structural stormwater management
measure. Pretreatment measures may be designed in
accordance with the New Jersey BMP Manual or other
sources approved by the Municipal Engineer.
(g) Stormwater management basins shall be designed in a manner
that complements and mimics the existing natural landscape,
including, but not limited to, the following design strategies:
[1] Use of natural, nonwetland wooded depressions for
stormwater runoff storage; and
[2] Establishment of attractive landscaping in and around the
basin that mimics the existing vegetation and incorporates
native Pinelands plants, including, but not limited to, the
species listed in N.J.A.C. 7:50-6.25 and 6.26.
(h) Stormwater management basins shall be designed with gently
sloping sides. The maximum allowable basin side slope shall be
five horizontal to one vertical.
(i) Guidance on the design and construction of structural
stormwater management measures may be found in the New
Jersey BMP Manual. Other guidance sources may also be used
upon approval by the Municipal Engineer.
(j) After all construction activities and required field testing have
been completed on the development site, as-built plans
depicting design and as-built elevations of all stormwater
management measures shall be prepared by a licensed land
surveyor and submitted to the Municipal Engineer. Based upon
the Municipal Engineer's review of the as-built plans, all
corrections or remedial actions deemed by the Municipal
Engineer to be necessary due to the failure to comply with the
standards established by this section and/or any reasons of
public health or safety, shall be completed by the applicant. In
lieu of review by the Municipal Engineer, the Township of
Waterford reserves the right to engage a professional engineer
to review the as-built plans. The applicant shall pay all costs
associated with such review.
(2) Design and construction standards for stormwater infiltration
BMPs.
(a) Stormwater infiltration BMPs, such as bioretention systems
with infiltration, dry wells, infiltration basins, pervious paving
systems with storage beds, and sand filters with infiltration,
shall be designed, constructed and maintained to completely
drain the total runoff volume generated by the basin's
maximum design storm within 72 hours after a storm event.
§ 176-59 INSURANCE § 176-59
168:493
Runoff storage for greater times can render the BMP
ineffective and may result in anaerobic conditions, odor and
both water quality and mosquito breeding problems.
(b) Stormwater infiltration BMPs shall be designed, constructed
and maintained to provide a minimum separation of at least
two feet between the elevation of the lowest point of the
bottom of the infiltration BMP and the seasonal high water
table.
(c) A stormwater infiltration BMP shall be sited in suitable soils
verified by field testing to have permeability rates between one
and 20 inches per hour. If such site soils do not exist or if the
design engineer demonstrates that it is not practical for
engineering, environmental or safety reasons to site the
stormwater infiltration BMP(s) in such soils, then the
stormwater infiltration BMP(s) may be sited in soils verified by
field testing to have permeability rates in excess of 20 inches
per hour, provided that a bioretention system, designed,
installed and maintained in accordance with the New Jersey
BMP Manual, is installed to meet one of the following
conditions:
[1] The bioretention system is constructed as a separate
measure designed to provide pretreatment of stormwater
and to convey the pretreated stormwater into the
infiltration BMP; or
[2] The bioretention system is integrated into and made part
of the infiltration BMP and, as such, does not require an
underdrain system. If this option is selected, the
infiltration BMP shall be designed and constructed so that
the maximum water depth in the bioretention system
portion of the BMP during treatment of the stormwater
quality design storm is 12 inches in accordance with the
New Jersey BMP Manual.
(d) The minimum design permeability rate for the soil within a
BMP that relies on infiltration shall be 0.5 inch per hour. A
factor of safety of two shall be applied to the soil's field-tested
permeability rate to determine the soil's design permeability
rate. For example, if the field-tested permeability rate of the
soil is four inches per hour, its design permeability rate would
be two inches per hour. The minimum design permeability rate
for the soil within a stormwater infiltration basin shall also be
sufficient to achieve the minimum seventy-two-hour drain time
described in Subsection E(2)(a) above. The maximum design
permeability shall be 10 inches per hour.
(e) A soil's field tested permeability rate shall be determined in
accordance with the following:
§ 176-59 WATERFORD CODE § 176-59
168:494
[1] The predevelopment field test permeability rate shall be
determined according to the methodologies provided in
Subsection J(3)(c);
[2] The results of the required field permeability tests shall
demonstrate a minimum tested infiltration rate of one inch
per hour;
[3] After all construction activities have been completed on
the site and the finished grade has been established in the
infiltration BMP, post-development field permeability tests
shall also be conducted according to the methodologies
provided in Subsection J(3)(c) of this section;
[4] If the results of the post-development field permeability
tests fail to achieve the minimum required design
permeability rates in five above utilizing a factor of safety
of two, the stormwater infiltration BMP shall be renovated
and retested until such minimum required design
permeability rates are achieved; and
[5] The results of all field permeability tests shall be certified
by a professional engineer and transmitted to the
Municipal Engineer.
(f) To help ensure maintenance of the design permeability rate
over time, a six-inch layer of K5 soil shall be placed on the
bottom of a stormwater infiltration BMP. This soil layer shall
meet the textural and permeability specifications of a K5 soil as
provided at N.J.A.C. 7:9A, Appendix A, Figure 6, and be
certified to meet these specifications by a professional
engineer licensed in the State of New Jersey. The depth to the
seasonal high water table shall be measured from the bottom
of the K5 sand layer.
(g) The design engineer shall assess the hydraulic impact on the
groundwater table and design the project site and all
stormwater infiltration basins so as to avoid adverse hydraulic
impacts. Adverse hydraulic impacts include, but are not limited
to: raising the groundwater table so as to cause surface
ponding; flooding of basements and other subsurface
structures and areas; preventing a stormwater infiltration
basin from completely draining via infiltration within 72 hours
of a design storm event; and interference with the proper
operation of subsurface sewage disposal systems and other
surface and subsurface structures in the vicinity of the
stormwater infiltration basin.
(h) The design engineer shall conduct a mounding analysis, as
defined in Subsection G, of all stormwater infiltration BMPs.
The mounding analysis shall be conducted in accordance with
the requirements in Subsection J(3)(c)[1]. Where the mounding
§ 176-59 INSURANCE § 176-59
168:495
analysis identifies adverse impacts, the stormwater infiltration
BMP shall be redesigned or relocated, as appropriate.
(i) Stormwater infiltration BMPs shall be constructed in
accordance with the following:
[1] To avoid sedimentation that may result in clogging and
reduce the basin's permeability rate, stormwater
infiltration basins shall be constructed according to the
following:
[a] Unless the conditions in Subsection E(2)[1][b] below
are met, a stormwater infiltration BMP shall not be
placed into operation until its drainage area is
completely stabilized. Instead, upstream runoff shall
be diverted around the BMP and into separate,
temporary stormwater management facilities and
sediment basins. Such temporary facilities and basins
shall be installed and utilized for stormwater
management and sediment control until stabilization
is achieved in accordance with the standards for soil
erosion and sediment control in New Jersey, which is
incorporated herein by reference as amended and
supplemented.
[b] If the design engineer determines that, for
engineering, environmental or safety reasons,
temporary stormwater management facilities and
sediment basins cannot be constructed on the site, the
stormwater infiltration basin may be placed into
operation prior to the complete stabilization of its
drainage area, provided that the basin's bottom
during this period is constructed at a depth at least
two feet higher than its final design elevation. All
other infiltration BMP construction requirements in
this subsection shall be followed. When the drainage
area is completely stabilized, all accumulated
sediment shall be removed from the infiltration BMP,
which shall then be excavated to its final design
elevation in accordance with the construction
requirements of this subsection and the performance
standards in Subsection D.
[2] To avoid compaction of subgrade soils of BMPs that rely on
infiltration, no heavy equipment, such as backhoes, dump
trucks or bulldozers, shall be permitted to operate within
the footprint of the BMP. All excavation required to
construct a stormwater infiltration BMP shall be
performed by equipment placed outside the BMP. If this is
not possible, the soils within the excavated area shall be
renovated and tilled after construction is completed to
§ 176-59 WATERFORD CODE § 176-59
168:496
reverse the effects of compaction. In addition, postdevelopment
soil permeability testing shall be performed
in accordance with Subsection E(2)(e) of this section.
[3] Earthwork associated with stormwater infiltration BMP
construction, including excavation, grading, cutting or
filling, shall not be performed when soil moisture content
is above the lower plastic limit.
(3) Safety standards for structural stormwater management measures.
(a) If a structural stormwater management measure has an outlet
structure, escape provisions shall be incorporated in or on the
structure. Escape provisions means the permanent installation
of ladders, steps, rungs, or other features that provide readily
accessible means of ingress and egress from the outlet
structure.
(b) A trash rack is a device intended to intercept runoff-borne
trash and debris that might otherwise block the hydraulic
openings in an outlet structure of a structural stormwater
management measure. Trash racks shall be installed upstream
of such outlet structure openings as necessary to ensure
proper functioning of the structural stormwater management
measure in accordance with the following:
[1] The trash rack should be constructed primarily of bars
aligned in the direction of flow with one inch spacing
between the bars to the elevation of the water quality
design storm. For elevations higher than the water quality
design storm, the bars shall be spaced no greater than 1/3
the width of the hydraulic opening it is protecting or six
inches, whichever is less. Transverse bars aligned
perpendicular to flow should be sized and spaced as
necessary for rack stability and strength.
[2] The trash rack shall not adversely affect the hydraulic
performance of either the outlet structure opening it is
protecting or the overall outlet structure.
[3] The trash rack shall have sufficient net open area under
clean conditions to limit the peak design storm velocity
through it to a maximum of 2.5 feet per second.
[4] The trash rack shall be constructed and installed to be
rigid, durable, and corrosion resistant, and shall be
designed to withstand a perpendicular live loading of 300
pounds per square foot.
(c) An overflow grate is a device intended to protect the opening in
the top of a stormwater management measure outlet structure.
§ 176-59 INSURANCE § 176-59
168:497
If an outlet structure has an overflow grate, such grate shall
meet the following requirements:
[1] The overflow grate shall be secured to the outlet structure
but removable for emergencies and maintenance;
[2] The overflow grate spacing shall be no more than two
inches across the smallest dimension; and
[3] The overflow grate shall be constructed and installed to be
rigid, durable, and corrosion resistant, and shall be
designed to withstand a perpendicular live loading of 300
pounds per square foot.
(d) The maximum side slope for an earthen dam, embankment, or
berm shall not be steeper than five horizontal to one vertical.
(e) Safety ledges shall be constructed on the slopes of all new
structural stormwater management measures having a
permanent pool of water deeper than 2 1/2 feet. Such safety
ledges shall be comprised of two steps. Each step shall be four
feet to six feet in width. One step shall be located
approximately 2 1/2 feet below the permanent water surface,
and the second step shall be located one to 1 1/2 feet above the
permanent water surface. See Subsection E(3)(e)[1] below, for
an illustration of safety ledges in a stormwater management
basin.

infiltration BMP is incorporated into the design of a major
development, the applicant shall include the following
requirements in its inspection, maintenance and repair plan:
(a) Once per month (if needed): mow side slopes, remove litter and
debris, stabilize eroded banks, repair erosion at inflow
structure(s);
(b) After every storm exceeding one inch of rainfall: ensure that
infiltration BMPs drain completely within 72 hours after the
storm event. If stored water fails to infiltrate 72 hours after the
end of the storm, corrective measures shall be taken. Raking or
tilling by light equipment can assist in maintaining infiltration
capacity and break up clogged surfaces;
(c) Four times per year (quarterly): inspect stormwater infiltration
BMPs for clogging and excessive debris and sediment
accumulation within the BMP, remove sediment (if needed)
when completely dry;
(d) Two times per year: inspect for signs of damage to structures,
repair eroded areas, check for signs of petroleum
contamination and remediate;
(e) Once per year: inspect BMPs for unwanted tree growth and
remove, if necessary, disc or otherwise aerate bottom of
infiltration basin to a minimum depth of six inches; and
(f) After every storm exceeding one inch of rainfall: inspect and, if
necessary, remove and replace K5 sand layer and accumulated
sediment, to restore original infiltration rate;
(g) Additional guidance for the inspection, maintenance and repair
of stormwater infiltration BMPs can be found in the New Jersey
BMP Manual.
(8) Maintenance guarantee.
(a) The applicant shall provide a maintenance guarantee in
accordance with N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53 to ensure that all
stormwater management measures required under the
provisions of this section will be maintained in accordance with
the specifications established herein.
(b) Additionally, for those stormwater management measures that
are to be inspected, maintained and repaired by a public
agency, the Township of Waterford shall collect an prepaid fee
from the applicant in the amount the Township of Waterford
determines is needed to provide long-term inspection,
maintenance and repair of all stormwater management
§ 176-59 WATERFORD CODE § 176-59
168:502
measures. This prepaid fee shall be placed in a dedicated
cash management account and expended by the Township of
Waterford for the sole purpose of conducting inspection,
maintenance and repair activities for all stormwater
management measures required under the applicant's major
development application approval. The calculation of the fee
shall be based upon the inspection, maintenance and repair
plan (plan) required to be prepared by the applicant and
approved by the Township of Waterford. The plan shall include
an estimate of the present value of the cost to inspect, maintain
and repair the stormwater management measure(s) in
accordance with the plan for the useful life of those
measure(s). The Township of Waterford shall furnish the
applicant their published hourly rates as prescribed by their
Salary Ordinance for public works' and other personnel having
responsibilities associated with stormwater management.
Added to this fee shall be an amount mutually determined by
the Township of Waterford and the applicant to account for
the reconstruction/reconditioning of stormwater management
measures that are based on the reasonable life expectancies
of those facilities. After an agreed number of years, depending
on the type of measure(s), the measure(s) will need to be
reconstructed/reconditioned. The amount shall be based on
the future value of the measure(s) being reconstructed/
reconditioned. Both inflation rates and bank interest rates
shall be based on the ten-year average published in the Wall
Street Journal or other approved publication. Interest accruing
in the account must also be accounted for at an agreed upon
interest rate, to arrive at an amount. The costs for
reconstructing/reconditioning the measure(s) shall be taken
from the engineer's probable cost estimate that is utilized to
determine the amount of the required performance guarantee.
It is acceptable to attach a percentage of failure to certain line
items in the estimate.
(c) Additionally, for those stormwater management measures that
are to be inspected, maintained and repaired by a
homeowners' association, condominium association or some
other form of nonpublic ownership, no fee shall be collected by
the Township of Waterford. Instead, the ownership entity shall
establish and maintain a fund for the annual inspection and
testing program, annual maintenance and repair program and
annual contribution to a contingency fund for long-term
reconstruction/reconditioning. The initial costs agreed to for
the annual inspection and testing program and annual
maintenance and repair program shall be based upon actual
itemized proposals offered to the applicant by prospective
vendors. The annual cost expended on inspection, testing and
maintenance shall be reported to the Township of Waterford to
verify that maintenance is not being deferred and to inform the
§ 176-59 INSURANCE § 176-59
168:503
Township of Waterford on the magnitude of those services. The
contingency fund shall require sufficient funds to be committed
for long-term reconstruction/reconditioning of the stormwater
management measure(s). Major reconstruction/reconditioning
activities will necessitate proper financial planning. After an
agreed number of years, depending on the type of measure(s),
the measure(s) will need to be reconstructed/reconditioned.
The contingency fund in the financial schedule shall be based
on the future value of the measure being reconstructed/
reconditioned. Both inflation rates and bank interest rates
shall be based on the ten-year average published in the Wall
Street Journal or other approved publication. Interest accruing
in the account must also be accounted for at an agreed upon
interest rate, to arrive at an annual contribution amount.

EXCESSIVELY COARSE HORIZON  A horizon of limited
thickness within the soil profile which provides inadequate
removal of pollutants from stormwater due to a high-coarse
fragment content, excessively coarse texture and/or
excessively rapid permeability.
EXCESSIVELY COARSE SUBSTRATUM  A substratum below

than 7% clay, less than 50% silt, and between 43% and 52%
sand.
SILT  A particle size category consisting of mineral particles
which are between 0.002 and 0.05 millimeters in equivalent
spherical diameter. It also means a soil textural class having

(c) Methods for assessing soil suitability for infiltration
stormwater management BMPs. The results of a subsurface
investigation shall serve as the basis for the site selection and
design of stormwater infiltration BMPs. The subsurface
investigation shall include, but not be limited to, a series of soil
test pits and soil permeability tests conducted in accordance
with the following:
[1] All soil test pits and soil permeability results shall be
performed under the direct supervision of a professional
engineer. All soil logs and permeability test data shall be
§ 176-59 INSURANCE § 176-59
168:519
accompanied by a certification by a professional engineer.
The results and location (horizontal and vertical) of all
soil test pits and soil permeability tests, both passing and
failing, shall be reported to the Township of Waterford.
[2] During all subsurface investigations and soil test
procedures, adequate safety measures shall be taken to
prohibit unauthorized access to the excavations at all
times. It is the responsibility of persons performing or
witnessing subsurface investigations and soil permeability
tests to comply with all applicable federal, state and local
laws and regulations governing occupational safety.
[3] A minimum of two soil test pits shall be excavated within
the footprint of any proposed infiltration BMP to
determine the suitability and distribution of soil types
present at the site. Placement of the test pits shall be
within 20 feet of the basin perimeter, located along the
longest axis bisecting the BMP. For BMPs larger than
10,000 square feet in area, a minimum of one additional
soil test pit shall be conducted within each additional area
of 10,000 square feet. The additional test pit(s) shall be
placed approximately equidistant to other test pits, so as
to provide adequate characterization of the subsurface
material. In all cases, where soil and or groundwater
properties vary significantly, additional test pits shall be
excavated in order to accurately characterize the
subsurface conditions below the proposed infiltration BMP.
Soil test pits shall extend to a minimum depth of eight feet
below the lowest elevation of the basin bottom or to a
depth that is at least two times the maximum potential
water depth in the proposed infiltration BMP, whichever is
greater.
[4] A soil test pit log shall be prepared for each soil test pit.
The test pit log shall, at a minimum, provide the elevation
of the existing ground surface, the depth and thickness (in
inches) of each soil horizon or substratum, the dominant
matrix or background and mottle colors using the Munsell
system of classification for hue, value and chroma, the
appropriate textural class as shown on the USDA textural
triangle, the volume percentage of coarse fragments
(larger than two millimeters in diameter), the abundance,
size, and contrast of mottles, the soil structure, soil
consistence, and soil moisture condition, using standard
USDA classification terminology for each of these soil
properties. Soil test pit logs shall identify the presence of
any soil horizon, substratum or other feature that exhibits
an in-place permeability rate less than one inch per hour.
§ 176-59 WATERFORD CODE § 176-59
168:520
[5] Each soil test pit log shall report the depth to seasonally
high water level, either perched or regional, and the static
water level based upon the presence of soil mottles or
other redoximorphic features, and observed seepage or
saturation. Where redoxomorphic features, including soil
mottles resulting from soil saturation, are present, they
shall be interpreted to represent the depth to the seasonal
high water table unless soil saturation or seepage is
observed at a higher level. When the determination of the
seasonally high water table shall be made in ground
previously disturbed by excavation, direct observation of
the static water table during the months of January
through April shall be the only method permitted.
[6] Any soil horizon or substratum which exists immediately
below a perched zone of saturation shall be deemed by
rule to exhibit unacceptable permeability (less than one
inch per hour). The perched zone of saturation may be
observed directly, inferred based upon soil morphology, or
confirmed by performance of a hydraulic head test as
defined at N.J.A.C. 7:9A-5.9.
[7] Stormwater infiltration BMPs shall not be installed in soils
that exhibit artesian groundwater conditions. A
permeability test shall be conducted in all soils that
immediately underlie a perched zone of saturation. Any
zone of saturation which is present below a soil horizon
which exhibits an in-place permeability of less than 0.2
inch per hour shall be considered an artesian zone of
saturation unless a minimum one-foot thick zone of
unsaturated soil, free of mottling or other redoximorphic
features and possessing a chroma of four or higher, exists
immediately below the unsuitable soil.
[8] A minimum of one permeability test shall be performed at
each soil test pit location. The soil permeability rate shall
be determined using test methodology as prescribed in
N.J.A.C. 7:9A-6.2 (Tube Permeameter Test), 6.5 (Pit Bailing
Test) or 6.6 (Piezometer Test). When the tube
permeameter test is used, a minimum of two replicate
samples shall be taken and tested. Alternative
permeability test procedures may be accepted by the
approving authority provided the test procedure attains
saturation of surrounding soils, accounts for hydraulic
head effects on infiltration rates, provides a permeability
rate with units expressed in inches per hour and is
accompanied by a published source reference. Examples
of suitable sources include hydrogeology, geotechnical or
engineering text and design manuals, proceedings of
American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM)
§ 176-59 INSURANCE § 176-59
168:521
symposia, or peer-review journals. Neither a soil
permeability class rating test, as described in N.J.A.C.
7:9A-6.3, nor a percolation test, as described in N.J.A.C.
7:9A-6.4, are acceptable tests for establishing
permeability values for the purpose of complying with this
section.
[9] Soil permeability tests shall be conducted on the most
hydraulically restrictive horizon or substratum to be left in
place below the basin as follows. Where no soil
replacement is proposed, the permeability tests shall be
conducted on the most hydraulically restrictive horizon or
substratum within four feet of the lowest elevation of the
basin bottom or to a depth equal to two times the
maximum potential water depth within the basin,
whichever is greater. Where soil replacement is proposed,
the permeability tests shall be conducted within the soil
immediately below the depth of proposed soil replacement
or within the most hydraulically restrictive horizon or
substratum to a depth equal to two times the maximum
potential water depth within the basin, whichever is
greater. Permeability tests may be performed on the most
hydraulically restrictive soil horizons or substrata at
depths greater than those identified above based upon the
discretion of the design or testing engineer. The tested
infiltration rate should then be divided by two to establish
the soil's design permeability rate. Such division will
provide a one-hundred-percent safety factor to the tested
rate.
[10] The minimum acceptable tested permeability rate of any
soil horizon or substratum shall be one inch per hour. Soil
materials that exhibit tested permeability rates slower
than one inch per hour shall be considered unsuitable for
stormwater infiltration. The maximum reportable tested
permeability rate of any soil horizon or substratum shall be
no greater than 20 inches per hour regardless of the rate
attained in the test procedure.
[11] After all construction activities have been completed on
the development site and the finished grade has been
established in the infiltration BMP, a minimum of one
permeability test shall be conducted within the most
hydraulically restrictive soil horizon or substratum below
the as-built BMP to ensure the performance of the
infiltration BMP is as designed. Hand tools and manual
permeability test procedures shall be used for the purpose
of confirming BMP performance. In addition, the
infiltration BMP shall be flooded with water sufficient to
§ 176-59 WATERFORD CODE § 176-59
168:522
demonstrate the performance of the BMP. Test results
shall be certified to the Municipal Engineer.
[12] A groundwater mounding analysis shall be provided for
each stormwater infiltration BMP. The groundwater
mounding analysis shall calculate the maximum height of
the groundwater mound based upon the volume of the
maximum design storm. The professional engineer
conducting the analysis shall provide the Municipal
Engineer with the methodology and supporting
documentation for the mounding analysis used and shall
certify to the Township of Waterford, based upon the
analysis, that the groundwater mound will not cause
stormwater or groundwater to break out to the land
surface or cause adverse impact to adjacent surface water
bodies, wetlands or subsurface structures, including, but
not limited to, basements and septic systems. If there is
more than one infiltration BMP proposed, the model shall
indicate if and how the mounds will interact. The
mounding analysis shall be calculated using the most
restrictive soil horizon that will remain in place within the
explored aquifer thickness unless alternative analyses is
authorized by the Municipal Engineer. The mounding
analysis shall be accompanied by a cross section of the
infiltration BMP and surrounding topography and the
mound analysis shall extend out to the point(s) at which
the mound intersects with the preexisting maximum water
table elevation.
[13] The applicant shall demonstrate that stormwater
infiltration BMPs meet the seventy-two-hour drain time
requirement established in Subsection E(2)(a) of this
section.
(4) Pretreatment measures for infiltration BMPs. By reducing
incoming velocities and capturing coarser sediments, pretreatment
can extend the functional life and increase the pollutant removal
capability of infiltration measures. Therefore, the installation of
pretreatment measures is recommended for all development sites.
Pretreatment measures may include, but are not limited to, the
following:
(a) Vegetative filter strips;
(b) Bioretention systems. Used in conjunction with a bioretention
system, the infiltration basin takes the place of the standard
underdrain;
(c) Sand filters;
(d) Grassed swales; and
§ 176-59 INSURANCE § 176-59
168:523
(e) Detention basins.
(5) Collection and conveyance.
(a) Bicycle-safe inlet grates. Site development plans that
incorporate site design features that help to prevent discharge
of trash and debris from drainage systems shall comply with
the following standard to control passage of solid and floatable
materials through storm drain inlets. For purposes of this
subsection, "solid and floatable materials" means sediment,
debris, trash, and other floating, suspended, or settleable
solids.
[1] Design engineers shall use either of the following grates
whenever they use a grate in pavement or another ground
surface to collect stormwater from that surface into a
storm drain or surface water body under that grate:
[a] The New Jersey Department of Transportation
(NJDOT) bicycle safe grate, which is described in
Chapter 2.4 of the NJDOT Bicycle Compatible
Roadways and Bikeways Planning and Design
Guidelines (April 1996); or
[b] A different grate, if each individual clear space in that
grate has an area of no more than seven square
inches, or is no greater than 0.5 inch across the
smallest dimension. Examples of grates subject to this
standard include grates in grate inlets, the grate
portion (non-curb-opening portion) of combination
inlets, grates on storm sewer manholes, ditch grates,
trench grates, and grates of spacer bars in slotted
drains. Examples of ground surfaces include surfaces
of roads (including bridges), driveways, parking areas,
bikeways, plazas, sidewalks, lawns, fields, open
channels, and stormwater basin floors.
[2] Whenever design engineers use a curb-opening inlet, the
clear space in that curb opening (or each individual clear
space, if the curb opening has two or more clear spaces)
shall have an area of no more than seven square inches, or
be no greater than two inches across the smallest
dimension.
[3] This standard does not apply:
[a] Where the review agency determines that this
standard would cause inadequate hydraulic
performance that could not practicably be overcome
by using additional or larger storm drain inlets that
meet these standards;
§ 176-59 WATERFORD CODE § 176-59
168:524
[b] Where flows from the water quality design storm as
specified in Subsection C are conveyed through any
device (e.g., end-of-pipe netting facility, manufactured
treatment device, or a catch basin hood) that is
designed, at a minimum, to prevent delivery of all
solid and floatable materials that could not pass
through one of the following:
[i] A rectangular space 4 5/8 inches long and 1.5
inches wide (this option does not apply for outfall
netting facilities); or
[ii] A bar screen having a bar spacing of 0.5 inch.
[c] Where flows are conveyed through a trash rack that
has parallel bars with one inch spacing between the
bars, to the elevation of the water quality design storm
as specified in Subsection C of this section; or
[d] Where the NJDEP determines, pursuant to the New
Jersey Register of Historic Places Rules at N.J.A.C.
7:4-7.2(c), that action to meet this standard is an
undertaking that constitutes an encroachment or will
damage or destroy the New Jersey Register listed
historic property.
(b) Catch basins. Catch basins are storm drain inlets with or
without sumps. Catch basins may provide pretreatment for
other stormwater BMPs by capturing large sediments. The
sediment and pollutant removal efficiency of catch basins
depends on the size of the sump and the performance of
routine maintenance to retain the available sediment storage
space in the sump. Where catch basins with sumps are
proposed, the minimum two-foot separation between the
bottom of the sump and seasonally high water table shall be
provided.
(c) Open or perforated conveyance piping. Where adequate
separation to the seasonal high water table exists, stormwater
from the development site may be conveyed to a stormwater
basin via a system of perforated pipes. These pipes may be
made of PVC or corrugated metal and are available with
perforations of varying size and spacing. Perforated pipe
specifications shall be certified by a professional engineer. A
professional engineer shall certify that perforated conveyance
piping will not act to intercept the seasonal high water table
and convey groundwater to the stormwater basin. All open or
perforated stormwater conveyance systems shall be installed
with a minimum separation of two feet from the seasonal high
water table.

A. In order to secure property improvement and maintenance of all
common open space in any proposed housing development, the
landowner shall provide for and establish an organization for the
ownership and maintenance of any common open space not dedicated
to and accepted by the Township. Such organization shall not be
dissolved nor shall it dispose of any common space, by sale or otherwise
(except to an organization conceived and established to own and
maintain the common open space), without first offering to dedicate the
same to the Township or other governmental agency designated by the
Township. The Planning Board shall make findings concerning the
operation of the organization for the ownership and maintenance of any
common open space. It shall consider the following:
(1) Time when organization was created.
(2) Mandatory or automatic nature of membership in the organization
by resident or successor.
(3) Permanence of open space safeguards.
(4) Liability of organization for insurance, taxes and maintenance of all
facilities.
(5) Provision of pro rata sharing of costs and assessments.
(6) Capacity of the organization to administer common facilities and
preserve the benefits of common open space.
B. In the event that the organization established to own and maintain
common open space, or any successor organization, shall, at any time
after establishment of the development, fail to maintain the common
open space in reasonable order and condition in accordance with the
plan, the municipality may serve written notice upon such organization
§ 176-70 WATERFORD CODE § 176-71
168:536
or upon the residents and owners of the development setting forth the
manner in which the organization has failed to maintain the common
open space in reasonable condition and said notice shall include a
demand that such deficiencies of maintenance be cured within 30 days,
and shall state the date and place of a hearing which shall be held
within 14 days of the notice. At such hearing, the municipality may
modify the terms of the original notice of the deficiencies and may give
an extension of time within which they shall be cured. If the deficiencies
set forth in the original notice, or in the modifications thereof, shall not
be cured within said 30 days or an extension thereof, the municipality,
in order to preserve the taxable values of the properties within the
planned development and to prevent the common open space from
becoming a public nuisance, may enter upon said common open space
and maintain the same for a period of one year. Said entry and
maintenance shall not vest in the public any rights to use the common
open space except when the same is voluntarily dedicated to the public
by the residents and owners. Before the expiration of said year, the
municipality shall, upon its initiative or upon the request of the
organization responsible for the maintenance of the common open
space, call a public hearing upon notice to such organization, or to the
residents and owners of the development, to be held by the municipal
authority, at which hearing such organization or the residents and
owners of the development shall show cause why such maintenance
by the municipality should not continue for a succeeding year. If the
Township shall determine that such organization is not ready and able
to maintain said common open space during the next succeeding year
and subject to a similar hearing and determination in each year
thereafter. The decision of the Township in any such case shall
constitute a final administrative decision subject to judicial review.
C. The cost of such maintenance by the municipality shall be assessed
ratably against the properties within the development that have a right
of enjoyment of the common open space and shall become a tax lien on
said properties. The municipality at the time of entering upon said
common open space for the purpose of maintenance, shall file a notice
of such lien in the office of the County Clerk upon the properties
affected by such lien within the development.
D. Membership shall be limited to and mandatory for all property owners,
condominium owners, stockholders under a cooperative development
or other owners of property or interest in the project. Required
membership and the responsibilities of the members shall be in writing
between the organization and each member in the form of a covenant
with each agreeing to liability for his pro-rata share of the
organization's costs. The organization shall be responsible for liability
insurance, taxes, maintenance and any other obligations assumed by
the organization shall not be dissolved nor shall it dispose of any of its
open space or property without offering to dedicate the same to the
Township.

E. The assessment levied by the organization upon each member may
become a lien on each member's property. The organization shall be
allowed to adjust the assessment to meet changing needs.
F. The organization shall clearly describe in its bylaws all the rights and
obligations of each tenant and owner, including a copy of the covenant,
model deeds and articles or incorporation of the organization, and the
fact that every tenant and property owner shall have the right to use all
common property. These shall be set forth as a condition of approval
and shall be submitted to the Township Attorney prior to the granting of
final approval of the development.
G. The articles of incorporation, covenants, bylaws, model deeds and other
legal instruments shall stipulate that control of the organization shall
be transferred to the members based on percentage of the dwelling
units sold and/or occupied. Further, these instruments shall clearly
indicate that in the event such organization shall fail to maintain the
common open space or common property in reasonable order and
condition, the Township may serve written notice upon such
organization and shall follow the procedures set forth in N.J.S.A.
40:55D-43b, and if it becomes necessary for the Township to provide
maintenance, the imposition of a lien, as set forth in N.J.S.A. 40:55D-43,
shall be followed.
A. Conformance.
(1) All development shall conform to the provisions of this section and
all other applicable provisions of this chapter.
(2) Development prohibited in the vicinity of threatened or endangered
plants. No development shall be carried out by any person unless it
is designed to avoid irreversible adverse impacts on the survival of
any local populations of threatened or endangered plants of the
Pinelands designated in N.J.A.C. 7:50-6.27.
B. Street (shade) trees. For all land development devoid of major trees
along arterial and collector streets of a development, and along
proposed roads and street rights-of-way where natural woods are not
present, and where, due to construction, the entire right-of-way is
cleared, the following provisions shall apply:
(1) Trees shall be planted along both sides of all streets as approved by
the Planning Board.
(2) Trees shall be planted at forty-foot intervals, or an equivalent
number shall be planted in an informal arrangement.
(3) Trees shall be planted so that they will not interfere with utilities,
block sight easements, or obscure streetlights. Spacing between
street trees and various objects should be as follows:
§ 176-71 WATERFORD CODE § 176-72
168:538
Object
Distance (from tree)
(feet)
Fire hydrant 8
Light pole 25
Street/stop/directional signs 25
Street corner 40
(4) The caliper of the trees shall be 2 1/2 inches measured 12 inches
above the ground. The standing height shall be a minimum of 10
feet. All trees shall be brought to the site balled and burlapped or
other acceptable means, free of insects and disease and true to
species and variety.
(5) Developers shall use a tree root control barrier a minimum of 18
inches in depth to prevent street, sidewalk and curb hazards. The
barriers shall be installed along the edge of the sidewalk and curb,
against the finished concrete work, slightly below finished grade.
The barriers shall be backfilled with a layer of gravel then
completed with normal fill material.
(6) Stripping trees from a lot or filling around trees on a lot shall not be
permitted unless it can be shown that grading requirements
necessitate removal of trees, in which case, those lots shall be
replanted with trees to reestablish the tone of the area and to
conform with adjacent lots.
(7) All apartments, condominiums and townhouses must provide
adequate landscaping with at least one approved tree per unit that
must be maintained by the owner of the apartment development,
the condominium association, or the individual townhouse owners
if on individual lots.
(8) Wherever medial grass strips or other landscaped areas are
proposed which will be visible to the general public within the
development, the covenants and/or agreements of the maintenance
of such areas by that association shall apply.
C. General landscaping provisions.
(1) Landscaping provided as part of any development plan shall utilize
native Pinelands vegetation, except that 20% of all trees, shrubs,
and ground cover may be of nonnative, nontoxic, species.
Nonnative, nontoxic species may be used only in accordance with
§ 176-72C(4)(d) below. Vegetation represents the most visible
element of the essential character of the Pinelands and constitutes
the fundamental structure of wildlife habitats. The mandatory
utilization of primary Pinelands native vegetation will insure the
continued integrity of the visual and ecological character of the
Pinelands.

168:539
(2) All clearing and soil disturbance activities, whether or not an
application for development is required pursuant to N.J.A.C. 7:50-4
and this chapter, shall be limited to that which is necessary to
accommodate an activity, use or structure which is permitted by
this chapter.
(3) Where practical, all clearing and soil disturbance activities
associated with an activity, use or structure, other than agriculture,
forestry and resource extraction, shall:
(a) Avoid wooded areas, including New Jersey's Record Trees as
published by the NJDEP in 1991 and periodically updated; and
(b) Revegetate or landscape areas temporarily cleared or
disturbed during development activities.
(4) In order to conserve water, conserve natural features and reduce
pollution from the use of fertilizers, pesticides and other soil
supplements, all landscaping or revegetation plans shall
incorporate the following elements:
(a) The limits of clearing shall be identified;
(b) Existing vegetation, including New Jersey's Record Trees as
published by the NJDEP in 1991 and periodically updated, shall
be incorporated into the landscape design where practical;
(c) Permanent lawn or turf areas shall be limited to those
specifically intended for active human use such as play fields,
golf courses and lawns associated with a residence or other
principal nonresidential use. Existing wooded areas shall not
be cleared and converted to lawns except when directly
associated with and adjacent to a proposed structure; and
(d) Shrubs and trees authorized by N.J.A.C. 7:50-6.25 shall be used
for revegetation or landscaping purposes. Other shrubs and
trees may be used in the following circumstances, provided
they do not exceed the twenty-percent maximum nonnative
vegetation permitted in § 176-72C(1):
[1] When the parcel to be developed or its environs contain a
predominance of shrubs and tree species not authorized
by N.J.A.C. 7:50-6.25;
[2] For limited ornamental purposes around buildings and
other structures; or
[3] When limited use of other shrubs or tree species is
required for proper screening or buffering.
(e) When automatic irrigation systems are used they shall be fitted
with a moisture-sensing device.
§ 176-72 WATERFORD CODE § 176-72

(2) Tree and shrub species other than those listed in Subsection D(1)
above may be used, provided that, of the 20% maximum nonnative
vegetation permitted under § 176-72C(1), species of the heath
family (Ericaceae) comprise at least 80% of the plantings.
(3) In cases where 80% of native Pinelands species for landscaping is
limited due to extreme site conditions, the Planning Board may
hear arguments from the applicant with reference to the flexibility
of mandatory Pinelands vegetation requirements. In such cases,
the Board shall consider the following guidelines before granting a
waiver from the vegetation requirements:
(a) The individual site conditions.
(b) The extremity of the stressful nature of the site.
(c) The extent of native vegetation on adjacent sites.
(d) Proximity of the site to sensitive environmental areas.
§ 176-72 INSURANCE § 176-72
168:541
(e) Availability of water and/or maintenance access.
(f) The extent to which proposed plans are compatible with native
species. (The use of exotic varieties shall be avoided.)
(g) The extent to which a native buffer could be utilized between
the developed portions and the natural portions of the tract.
(4) The Board shall not accept the unavailability of native or
indigenous species as adequate grounds for a waiver from this
section.
E. Ground cover and mulch.
(1) All planting beds must be provided with ground cover and the type
to be used must be noted on the site plan. Where mulches are used,
a layer of black, four-mil polyethylene or its equivalent must be
used to reduce weed growth and retain moisture. Minimum
required depth of placement is four inches.
(2) Ground covers are required in place of grass in small and restricted
areas, such as tree and shrub planters.
(3) All ground cover areas and steep banks with slopes greater than a
3:1 gradient must be planted with an approved ground cover.
F. Grasses.
(1) Grasses that are adapted to drought, nutrient poor soils (such as
tall fescue, sheep fescue, chewings fescue, red fescue and
smoothgrass) and those that are native to the Pinelands (such as
little bluestem, deertongue, redtop and switchgrass) shall be
utilized for landscaping purposes. Species used for temporary
cover (such as rye grass and oats) shall be utilized to stabilize soils.
(2) An area not exceeding 2,000 square feet per building may be
planted with grasses not meeting the requirements of Subsection
F(1) above. The requirements of Subsection F(1) shall not apply to
areas which are planted with grass and dedicated for public
recreational uses.
(3) Cover crops shall be used to control erosion during construction or
when cover is needed for a temporary period.
Time Period Options
0 to 6 months Mulch
6 to 12 months Oats, winter rye
1 to 2 years Annual rye, perennial rye, winter rye
2 or more years Fescue with mixture of perennial rye
G. Protection of existing plantings.
§ 176-72 WATERFORD CODE § 176-72
168:542
(1) Sound existing trees, substantial clumps, and fine specimens shall
be carefully protected during construction to avoid disturbance of
the microclimate of the plantings.
(2) Stockpiling of soil shall be done in open areas, and soil shall be left
undisturbed in a ten-foot radius around any tree to be preserved.
(3) Temporary fences, of sturdy material, shall be erected at the drip
line to prevent encroachment, soil compaction, and damage from
equipment. If a tree has a large spread, a triangular fence may be
built instead of a fence at the drip line. These fences shall not be
supported by the plants they are protecting, but shall be self
supporting.
(4) The grade of land located within six feet of a tree shall not be raised
or lowered more than six inches unless compensated by welling or
retaining methods described herein. In situations of specimen trees
with shallow surface rooting, grading shall not occur within a
twelve-foot radius of the tree trunk unless excavated by hand. No
equipment is to be driven over this area, and no building materials
are to be stacked against the trees or within the area of the barrier.
(5) Tree wells are to be constructed around each tree or group of trees
before any grades are increased. Wells are to be constructed of
uncemented stone, block or any other suitable material. This well
should be a minimum of three feet in diameter for four-inch or less
caliper trees. Construction is to be started at the determined
distance, on existing grade so as not to disturb roots with
foundation construction. For trees of more than four inches in
diameter, add one foot to the diameter of each additional inch of
caliper measured 12 inches above natural ground level, to a
maximum of eight feet.
(6) Retaining walls shall be constructed around each tree or group of
trees immediately after grade is lowered. This retaining wall is to
be constructed of pressure-treated timber or any other suitable
material subject to approval by the Township Engineer and the
Planning Board.
(7) No tree is to support any scaffolding, signs, temporary utility or any
other device.
H. Planting procedure. Any vegetation delivered to a site, which is not
planted immediately, shall be heeled-in to prevent desiccation. Trees
and bushes should be planted according to the following recommended
horticultural procedures:
(1) Plantings should be well-formed and healthy nursery grown stock.
The root ball should be inspected to ensure that it is undamaged, of
good quality soil and that it encompasses the entire root system.
§ 176-72 INSURANCE § 176-72
168:543
(2) Planting should take place when trees and bushes are dormant
because transplanting during this period greatly increases the
chances of success.
(3) Planting holes should be dug two times as wide and 1 1/2 times as
deep as the root ball. Topsoil and subsoil should be mixed
thoroughly with sphagnum peat moss or according to the
recommendations of the county agricultural agent and a layer six
inches to seven inches of the mix placed in the bottom of the hole.
Fertilizer should not be added to the soil mix since it can burn new,
tender roots, slowing down the growth of the plant or even killing
it. The soil in the bottom of the hole should be tamped down
without compacting it.
(4) Plantings should be positioned in the planting hole so that trunks
are straight, and the base is at the finished grade of the new
location and at the same depth as it was when it was growing.
Roots should be spread evenly throughout the hole, and soil added
carefully.
(5) The backfilled soil should be tamped in place, and the hole filled to
the top of the root ball. The added soil should be tamped gently, but
not compacted, and a ring of soil two inches to three inches high
should be formed around the edge of the planting hole to aid in
watering.
(6) Plantings should be watered with a fertilizer-water solution, the
amount of fertilizer depending on an analysis. Watering should be
thorough and done slowly and gently to avoid damage to the soil
structure.
(7) Saucers shall be designed to catch and hold the maximum amount
of water, either from natural precipitation or irrigation and shall be
a minimum of four inches higher than the finished grade. The area
within the watering saucer should be filled to a depth of two inches
to three inches with mulch. Saucers placed on slopes shall be level
at the top and perpendicular to the tree trunk.
(8) Tree trunks should be coated with an insecticide to reduce the
chances of attack by borers. The specific insecticide can be
recommended by the county agricultural agent.
(9) All newly planted trees and shrubs should be pruned. Balled and
burlapped and container-grown plants should be shaped lightly and
have broken and damaged branches removed. Bare root plants
require much heavier pruning to reduce the water demand by the
top of the plant in order to compensate for the roots lost when the
plants were dug up. One-third to 1/2 of the leaf area should be
removed by thinning the branches and reducing their length.
Pruning should retain the natural form of the tree or shrub; the
central leader or top of a newly planted tree should never be
removed, since this will destroy its natural growth habit.
§ 176-72 WATERFORD CODE § 176-72
168:544
(10) If properly planted, shrubs will not have to be staked, although
oversized bushes may need some support. Trees should be staked
in accordance with good nursery practice.
(11) Special planting techniques may be necessary when planting in
heavy, poorly drained or sandy soils. Recommendations of the
county agricultural agent should be followed.
(12) After planting, an adequate supply of water and even amount of
moisture shall be maintained. Plant conditions should be carefully
observed, and if the soil is dry three inches to six inches beneath
the surface, water should be added immediately. The water should
be applied slowly, preferably through drip irrigation, so that it
soaks in and does not run off. As a general rule, plantings in welldrained
soils should be watered one inch per week, and those in
lighter sandy soils, two inches per week, except during periods of
heavy rainfall.
(13) Dead or dying trees which have been transplanted by virtue of the
requirements of this section shall be replaced by the developer
during the next recommended planting season.
I. Staking procedures. Trees over six feet in height must be staked in the
following manner:
(1) Two stakes shall be driven a minimum of two feet into undisturbed
soil outside the planting hole.
(2) After placement stakes must be 1/2 to 2/3 the height of the tree
measured from ground level.
(3) Stakes shall be a minimum of two inches by two inches stock at the
thick end.
(4) Stakes shall be placed in line with prevailing winds.
(5) Stakes shall be attached to the tree with twelve-gauge galvanized
wire covered with rubber or plastic hose where wire is likely to
come into contact with the tree trunk. Any of the commercially
available materials designed for staking trees may be used as an
alternative with the approval of the Township Engineer. The loop in
contact with the tree shall be loose enough to permit growth and
prevent girdling for two years but shall be tightly bound to prevent
slippage.
J. Mulching.
(1) A four-inch minimum layer of mulch shall be applied around each
individual or group of trees and shrubs.
(2) Mulch shall be considered any material, organic or inorganic, of a
granular nature that is not readily subject to movement by wind or
water.
§ 176-72 INSURANCE § 176-72
168:545
§ 176-73. Lighting.
(3) Wood chips partially rotted or nitrogen-enriched may be used. New
wood chips are not acceptable because of the bacterial drawings of
available nitrogen from the soil, thus preventing its use by the
plants it is intended to protect.
K. Wrapping. Each deciduous tree shall be wrapped with an expandable
paper or cloth treated to last at least one year to prevent sunscald.
(1) The wrap shall extend from the ground level up the trunk to the
first branches.
(2) The wrap shall be attached or fastened to each end with a material
that will permit tree growth without girdling.
A. General standards.
(1) For minor site plans and, wherever appropriate in the discretion of
the Township Engineer, for developments with insignificant impact
with reference to lighting, the developer may submit a sample of
the actual fixture and lighting proposed for review and approval by
the Township Engineer in lieu of the engineering data required in
this section.
(2) Any proposed outdoor lighting shall be shown on the site plan in
sufficient detail to allow determination of the effects at the
property line, on nearby streets, driveways, residences and
overhead sky glow. The objective of these specifications is to
minimize glare and undesirable off-site effects.
B. Illumination levels. The maintained footcandles of illumination
recommended at ground level are as indicated in the following table:

Low: Local merchant parking, industrial employee parking,
educational facility parking.
C. Luminaries.
(1) Sharp cutoff type luminaries are recommended for the best
approach to lighting parking areas and shall be of the type that can
be provided with sharp cutoff deflectors or retractors where
required to shield light from the luminaire at angles less than the
set cutoff degree angle above nadir (from the vertical). The
shielding angle shall be selected to minimize discomforting glare to
an observer's eyes from the light source at an angle below the set
cutoff. Shielding shall also be employed to prevent spill over of
undesirable light to adjoining property.
(2) LED lighting shall be utilized. [Amended 8-9-2017 by Ord. No.
2017-21]
(3) General illumination of the exterior of buildings, including the roof,
is not permitted unless specifically approved by the Planning
Board. Objectionable spill, to the exterior, of bright and glaring
interior building light shall be avoided by the use of low-brightness
lenses on interior lighting.
(4) The lighting plan shall provide for nonglare lights and recessed
lenses focused downward in parking areas.
D. Light pollution or light intrusion.
(1) Any outdoor lighting, such as sidewalk illumination, driveways with
no adjacent parking, the lighting of signs and permitted
ornamental lighting, shall be shown on the lighting plan in
sufficient detail to allow a determination of the effects upon
adjacent properties and traffic safety. The objectives of these
specifications are to minimize undesirable off-premises effects. No
light shall shine into windows or onto streets and driveways to
interfere with or distract drivers. To achieve these requirements,
the intensity of such light sources, light shielding and similar
characteristics shall be subject to site plan approval.
§ 176-73 WATERFORD CODE § 176-73
168:548
(2) The maximum cutoff angle shall be used to shield light source glare
and unwanted light from adjacent properties and motorists
approaching on bounding roads and highways. Light spillage of
more than 0.2 footcandles onto adjacent properties shall be
prohibited.
(3) Adequate shielding shall be employed to protect properties, streets
and highways from the glare of such illumination, including
luminaries for illuminating entrances and driveways for parking
areas.
(4) Conflict with lighting of adjacent properties parking areas shall be
avoided. For example, if one or more adjacent areas with
established lighting systems are using mercury-vapor lamps, the
submitted area shall conform to the same lamp type, but not
necessarily the same type luminaire. However, other high-intensity
discharge lamps may be considered when there is ample reason for
employing such lamps and ample proof that a suitable method can
be employed to reduce color conflict.
E. Mounting height. The maximum mounting height of pole-mounted
luminaries shall be 25 feet or the height of the building, whichever is
less. In no case shall the standards be less than 12 feet high.
F. Security lighting. All parking areas and walkways thereto and
appurtenant passageways and driveways serving commercial, public,
office, multiple-family or other uses having common off-street parking
and/or loading areas shall be adequately illuminated for safety and
security reasons from sunset to sunrise. Lighting used to illuminate offstreet
parking and loading areas shall be arranged to reflect the light
away from residential premises and public streets.
G. Streetlighting. Plans accompanying all applications for development
shall include the location of all proposed streetlights of a type supplied
by the utility and a type and number approved by the Board and/or
Township Engineer. Streetlights shall be provided at the entrance from
collector roads, at all major changes in direction in roads, at all
intersections and anywhere else deemed necessary for safety reasons.
(1) Streetlighting shall be provided at all street intersections and
otherwise at intervals of 200 feet to 250 feet. Lighting shall be
placed on one side of the street only.
(2) For normal street usage, a thirty-watt light emitting diode (LED)
fixture shall be used. For intersections of minor streets, a forty-fivewatt
LED fixture shall be used. At the intersection of a minor street
and a collector street and an arterial; a ninety-watt LED fixture
shall be used. [Amended 8-9-2017 by Ord. No. 2017-21]
(3) The maximum mounting height for streetlighting shall be 25 feet.
§ 176-73 INSURANCE § 176-73
168:549
§ 176-74. Lot configuration.
(4) The installation of streetlighting shall be coordinated with the local
utility company.
H. Pedestrian lighting. Pedestrian lighting shall be in a height range
between one foot and 12 feet high.
I. Information to be submitted. The following shall be submitted for
review and approval of all lighting systems:
(1) Site plan showing existing and proposed streetlights within 100
feet of the property area to be lighted, location of all poles and
luminaries, illumination levels using photometric curve plotting or
point-by-point grid showing footcandles of illumination at each
point.
(2) Type of luminaries, including manufacturer's data.
(3) Type and wattage of lamp, including manufacturer's data.
(4) Mounting height of luminaire.
(5) Photometric data and isofootcandle curves of the luminaire and
lamp proposed. Photometric data shall be from an independent
testing laboratory. Photometric curves shall be drawn to the same
scale as the site plan scale and shall show maintained foot-candle
levels of illumination. The following shall be included with
photometric and luminaire data:
(a) Light source corrections.
(b) Lamp life lumen depreciation factor.
(c) Coefficient of utilization.
(d) Luminaire dirt depreciation factors.
(e) Maintenance factor correction.
(6) Type of pole and manufacturer's data. Applicants are encouraged
to use wooden or bronze-colored aluminum poles in keeping with
the architecture of the building and surrounding areas.
(7) Pole base and foundation design and details. Anchor bolts shall be
in accordance with those recommended by the manufacturer and
conform with all state requirements. [Amended 2-23-2016 by
Ord. No. 2016-5]
A. General provisions.
(1) Lots shall conform to the requirements of the zoning provisions of
this chapter, and insofar as is practical, side lot lines shall either be
at right angles or radial to street lines. Notwithstanding any other

provisions of this chapter, any deviation from the provisions
specified in this section shall require variance relief in accordance
with N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70c.
(2) Whenever title to two or more contiguous lots is held by the same
owner, regardless of whether or not each of said lots have been
approved as portions of a subdivision or acquired by separate
conveyance or by other operation of law, and one or more of said
individual lots should, by reason of exceptional shallowness,
topographic conditions, substandard area or yard space or similar
measurements, not conform with the minimum lot area and
dimensional requirements for the zone in which it is located, the
contiguous lots of said owner shall be considered as a single lot.
(3) Each lot must front upon an approved public street with frontage at
the right-of-way in accordance with particular zoning district in
which it is located.
(4) Where extra width has been dedicated for widening of existing
streets, lots shall begin at such new street lines, and all setbacks
shall be measured from such lines. Additionally, whenever the
owner of a lot existing at the time of adoption of this chapter has
dedicated or conveyed land to the Township in order to meet the
minimum street width requirements of the Official Map or Master
Plan, the Construction Official shall issue construction and
occupancy permits for lots whose depth and/or areas are rendered
substandard only because of such dedication and where the owner
has no other adjacent lands to provide the minimum requirements.
(5) Except as provided in Subsection A(2) above, any existing lot on
which a building or structure is located and which lot does not meet
the minimum lot size, or a structure which violates any yard
requirements, may construct additions to the principal building
and/or construct an accessory building without an appeal for
variance relief, provided:
(a) The existing use(s) on the lot are conforming to the permitted
use(s) stipulated in this chapter for the lot in question;
(b) The total permitted building coverage is not exceeded;
(c) The accessory building or addition does not violate any other
requirements of this chapter, such as, but not limited to, height
and parking, or aggravate an already existing violation of
setback for yard requirements.
(6) No residential dwelling unit in an R1, R2, R3, R4, OC, OP, NB, TC,
PHB or PI District shall be located on a parcel of less than one acre
unless served by a centralized wastewater treatment plant.
(7) For administrative purposes, any application for a construction
permit under the provisions of Subsection A(4) and (5) above shall
§ 176-74 INSURANCE § 176-74
168:551
be referred to the Department of Planning and Zoning for a
determination as to whether or not the provisions are met. In
the event that a determination cannot be made whether or not
the lot qualifies for a construction permit without the submission
of further application information, or, if the applicant requests
exemptions from the minimum standards of this section, the
application shall be reviewed and acted upon by the Planning
Board as a minor site plan.
(8) Where there is a question as to the suitability of a lot or lots for
their intended use due to factors such as wetlands, flood conditions
or similar circumstances, the Planning Board shall, after adequate
investigation, withhold approval of such lots.
(9) No building to be used as a dwelling shall be constructed or altered
in the rear of a building situated on the same lot; nor shall any
building be constructed in front of or moved to the front of a
dwelling situated on the same lot.
(10) Lots fronting on more than one street must be avoided except in
cases where proximity to major highways warrant it. In such cases,
access for the lot shall be from the minor road and the rear of the
lot shall be screened from the major road by suitable planting as
required by this chapter.
B. Corner lots. Any building on a corner lot or at the intersection of
driveways, access aisles or on-lot circulation drives shall not interfere
with any required site triangle. On all corner lots, the widths of all yards
abutting upon streets shall not be less than the minimum front yard
depth required for the zone, unless otherwise provided for in this
chapter.
C. Flag lots.
(1) Flag lots are prohibited unless they are deemed by the Planning
Board to be in the best interest of the Township and/or for the
purpose of reducing negative impact to the natural environment.
(2) Flag lots shall not be approved for subdivision applications
involving more than three lots inclusive of the original lot from
which the additional lots are being created.
(3) If the Planning Board finds sufficient reason to allow the creation of
flag lots, they shall be a minimum of one acre, not including the
area found in the stem. The entire stem shall have a width of at
least 35 feet on an approved public street. The length of the stem
shall not exceed 250 feet.
D. Yards.

§ 176-75. Natural features.
(1) No area set aside for the purpose of meeting front, side or rear
yards for one building shall be considered as meeting the yard
provisions of another building.
(2) On a lot extending through a block resulting in frontage on two or
more streets, excluding corner lots, the front yard shall be that
portion of the lot which abuts the street of address.
(3) Corner lots shall adhere to the setback requirements of front yards
in their zoning district for both streets.
(4) Front yards shall not contain clotheslines or be used for the storage
of garbage or refuse disposal units.
(5) No uses other than ornamental landscaping, buffer strips and
access drives shall be permitted in front yards.
(6) Basketball poles and nets shall not be placed in the right-of-way of
any public street or in the front yard of any apartment,

(2) All lot corners shall be marked with a plastic or metal alloy pin of
permanent character, or with a drill hole where a lot corner is
covered with a concrete surface.
A. Physical characteristics of the site shall be located on all base plans,
and methods for preservation shall be outlined.
(1) Soil and subsoil conditions must be suitable for excavation and site
preparation.
(2) The topography of the site and its drainage must be suitable for the
proposed development and designed to prevent erosion.
(3) Natural features, such as lakes, streams, topsoil, trees and shrubs,
must be preserved and incorporated into the final landscaping of
the development.
(4) The effects of prevailing winds, seasonal temperatures and hours of
sunlight on the physical layout and form of the proposed land use
and building must be taken into account.
B. The Planning Board shall inquire into the means whereby trees and
other natural features shall be protected during construction. Clearing

A. Recognized nonconforming uses. Preexisting lawful nonconforming
uses, as listed in the Township's Master Plan, shall be permitted to
continue. The owner/operator of any preexisting nonconforming use not
listed in the Township's Master Plan shall apply to the Land Use Board
in accordance with § 176-34C for a certification of preexisting use
within one year of the effective date of the adoption of this chapter.
[Amended 10-11-2017 by Ord. No. 2017-22]
B. Abandonment. A nonconforming use shall be considered abandoned if it
is terminated by the owner or if a nonconforming use involving a
structure is discontinued for 12 consecutive months, or if a
nonconforming use of land ceases for a period of 12 months. The
subsequent use of the abandoned building, structure and/or land shall
be in conformance with this chapter.
C. Restoration. Any nonconforming building, structure or use which has
been condemned or damaged by fire, explosion, flood, windstorm or act
of God shall be examined by the Construction Official. If, in the opinion
of the Construction Official, the cost of repair is greater than 60% of the
value of replacing the entire structure, it shall be considered
completely destroyed and may be rebuilt to the original specifications
only upon approval of a variance. If the cost of repair is less than 60% of
the value of replacing the entire structure, it may be rebuilt and used
for the same purpose as before, provided that it is rebuilt within one
year and does not exceed the height, area and volume of the original
structure. The percent damaged shall be the current replacement costs
of the portion damaged or condemned, computed as a percentage of the
current total replacement cost of the entire structure, neither to include
the cost of the foundation unless the foundation is involved in the
repair.
D. Repairs and maintenance. Repairs and maintenance may be made to a
nonconforming use, structure or lot, provided that the work does not
change the use, expand the building or the functional use of the

apply for issuance of a permanent certificate of occupancy or apply
to the Planning Board after the use has been in operation a
minimum of 18 months for a determination as to whether or not
the initial parking area provided is adequate. If the Planning Board
determines that the parking facility is adequate as originally
constructed, the performance guarantees shall be released and
a permanent certificate of occupancy issued. If, however, the
Planning Board determines that the partial off-street parking area
is not adequate, the applicant shall be required to install the
additional parking facilities in accordance with the terms of the
performance guarantees prior to issuance of a permanent
certificate of occupancy.
(6) Any change of use on a site for which the Planning Board may have
approved a partial paving of off-street parking areas to a use which
requires more parking spaces than are provided on the site shall
require submission of a new site plan.

§ 176-86. Sidewalks.
A. Dry sewer lines. In the event of approval of the use of individual
subsurface disposal systems on lands located within the existing or
proposed sewer service area according to the Waterford Township
Wastewater Facilities Plan, the Planning Board additionally may require
the installation of sewer lines, which must include connections to each
building, for future use when public sewage treatment facilities are
provided to serve the realty improvements to be constructed in the
development. Until such time that the dry sewer lines are made
operational and public sewage treatment facilities are provided to the
site, the density provisions specified within § 176-110 for development
with septic systems shall prevail.
B. Construction of dry sewer lines. The end of all dry sanitary sewer
building connection lines shall have a tamper-proof plug or cap,
temporarily sealed with a material that can be removed to utilize the
fitting when the system is to be activated. The Plumbing Subcode
Official or the Plumbing Inspector shall affix an adhesive-backed disc on
the cap or plug bearing a preprinted message and instructions related
to tampering and future use, that will be sufficient to alert and warn the
original and subsequent occupants of the building. The capping and
plugging shall be performed by the developer at his expense.
C. Additional standards.
(1) All sanitary sewer lines shall be air and mandrel tested.
Additionally, all lines shall be televised, if needed, at the direction
of the Township Engineer, and a videotape of the lines shall be
provided to the Township Engineer immediately prior to the

whichever occurs earlier.
(2) It is the developer's responsibility to expand any on-tract public
sanitary sewers to the limits of the tract boundary line to service
future development and to conform to the Township's Master Plan
and Wastewater Facilities Plan. Moreover, it is the developer's
responsibility to maintain all sanitary sewer improvements for
partially completed developments.
(3) See § 176-53 for additional standards.
A. Sidewalks along all streets are not required, but they shall be installed
at the direction of the approving authority's discretion, depending on
the probable volume of pedestrian traffic, the street classification in
instances where streets are involved, school bus stops, the
development's location in relation to other populated areas and the
general type of improvement intended. Where required, sidewalks shall
be at least four feet wide and located as approved by the approving
authority. Sidewalks shall be at least four inches thick, except at points
of vehicular crossing where they shall be at least six inches thick, of

driveways intersect minor streets.
(5) In all developments, the minimum street right-of-way shall be
measured from lot line to lot line, but in no case shall a new street
that is a continuation of an existing street be continued at a width
less than the existing street. In addition, where any arterial or
collector street intersects another arterial or collector street, the
cartway requirement shall be increased by 10 feet on the right side
of the street(s) approaching the intersection for a distance of 300
feet from the intersection of the center lines.
(6) In the event that a development adjoins or includes existing
Township streets that do not conform to the street width
requirements of this chapter, additional land along both sides of
said street sufficient to conform to the right-of-way requirements
shall be required in the development design. If the development is
along one side only, at least 1/2 of the required extra width shall be
required. Moreover, a portion of the existing street or road
adjoining or included within a development shall be improved,
including excavation, grading, base and surface courses, in
accordance with the road improvement standards of this chapter.

street every 800 feet on the same side of the street within the
boundaries of the tract being subdivided. In the spacing of streets,
consideration shall be given to the location of existing intersections
on both sides of the development.
(2) Intersections shall be rounded at the curbline or edge of pavement
with a curve having a radius not less than 20 feet.
(3) When connecting street lines deflect from each other at any one
point more than 10° and not more than 45°, they shall be connected
by a curve with a radius of not more than 100 feet for minor streets
and 300 feet for arterial and collector streets.
(4) Streets intersecting another street from opposite sides shall not be
offset unless there is a minimum of 125 feet between the rights-ofway.

D. Adult uses.136
(1) Statement of policy. It is recognized there are some uses commonly
known as "adult uses" which, because of their very nature, are
recognized as having serious objectionable operational
characteristics, particularly when such uses are located near
residential areas or in other inappropriate locations or without
sufficient showing that such uses in a specified location will comply
with conditions and standards for location and operation of such
uses. Therefore, special regulations of these objectionable adult
uses is deemed necessary to ensure that adverse effects will not
contribute to the blighting or downgrading of the Township. In no
manner is the fact that the Township regulates any or all of the
adult uses described herein or prohibits or allows them in any
respect to be construed as approval of or condoning such uses.
(2) Definitions. As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have
the meanings indicated:

The Township of Waterford reaffirms the policy of the Township to set
maximum dollar amounts that professional business entities may contribute
politically, beyond which they become ineligible to receive a public
professional service contract from the Township of Waterford, as well as
the Township's policy to prohibit professional business entities which are
performing or being paid under existing contracts with the Township from
making political contributions in amounts that exceed the Township's limits

establishes a policy prohibiting the transfer or "wheeling" of political
contributions by professionals to candidates of municipal political
committees who are not affiliated with the Township of Waterford.

No contribution of money or any other thing of value, including in-kind
contributions, made by a professional business entity to any municipal
candidate for Mayor or Township Committee, or Waterford Township
political party committee or PAC referenced in this article shall be deemed

ARTICLE II
Award of Professional Services Contracts
§ 212-9. Statement of public policy.
It is the purpose of this article that, notwithstanding that professional
services contracts and certain other contracts for goods and services are
exempt from the competitive bidding requirements of the Local Public
Contracts Law, N.J.S.A. 40A:11-1 et seq., the Township Committee deems
it appropriate, and consistent with the provisions of the New Jersey
legislation, now codified at N.J.S.A. 19:44A-20.1 et seq., to award such
contracts through a competitive, quality-based, fair and open process.
§ 212-10. Process for award of professional services contracts.
The Township of Waterford, or any agency or instrumentality thereof, shall
not enter into a contract, including a professional services contract, or such
other contract, which is exempt from public bidding requirements, having
an anticipated value in excess of $10,000 as determined by the municipality,
agency or instrumentality, with a business entity, except a contract that is
awarded pursuant to a fair and open process, if, during the preceding oneyear
period, that business entity has made a contribution that is reportable
by the recipient under N.J.S.A. 19:44A-1 et seq., to any municipal committee
of a political party in that municipality if a member of that political party is
serving in an elected public office of that municipality when the contract is
awarded or to any candidate committee of any person serving in an elected
public office of that municipality when the contract is awarded. The fair and
open process shall be quality-based and shall be as follows:
A. Professional services may be awarded by virtue of a publicly advertised
request for qualification ("RFQ") and/or request for proposal ("RFP"),
which will be issued as one document for those appointments which are
made on an annual basis.
B. For said positions, no contract shall be awarded unless and until the
positions are:
(1) Publicly advertised in newspapers in sufficient time to give notice
in advance of the solicitation for contracts;
(2) Awarded under a process that provides for public solicitation of
proposals and qualifications:
(3) Awarded and disclosed under criteria established in writing by the
Township of Waterford prior to the solicitation of proposals or
qualifications; and
(4) Publicly announced when awarded; and as to those RFQs and RFPs
which prove to be unsuccessful, the Township Clerk shall retain a
copy of same on file for a period of not less than 60 days.
§ 212-9 PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITY § 212-10
195:721
§ 212-11. Emergency exceptions.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Township Committee recognizes that
the New Jersey Legislature has provided for the occurrence of certain
emergencies, and further recognizes that, therefore, the procedure outlined
above might not be capable of being achieved in the event of an emergency
or similar time constraints. Thus, should a situation arise, and time does
not permit resort to this procedure, and the immediate performance of
services is necessary, then an award for same may be made in accordance
with the provisions of the Local Public Contracts Law relating to emergency
contracts, and such rules and regulations as may be promulgated, from
time to time, by the Township Committee with regard to same. No such
emergency contracts, however, may be awarded without submission to the
Township Clerk of a certification establishing a basis for the deviation from
the procedures outlined herein.
C. For contracts which arise on an occasional basis, such as appraisers
needed for acquisition of farmland and/or open space, as well as title
searches, surveying, and similar work associated with same, and
comparable assignments, such as planning services needed for Master
Plan updates, appraisals, special counsel, special project engineer
contracts, etc., professional services contracts may be awarded without
following the foregoing provisions, so long as:
(1) The anticipated value does not exceed the threshold of $10,000 set
forth above; and
(2) The Township Administrator makes every effort to solicit at least
two proposals for said work.

Standards and Administration
[Adopted 2-26-1997 by Ord. No. 97-1158]
§ 220-1. Purpose. [Amended 11-9-2011 by Ord. No. 2011-15;
8-8-2018 by Ord. No. 2018-19]
The purpose of this article is to protect the public health, safety and
welfare of the residents of Waterford Township through the enforcement
of minimum standards of maintenance for residential and nonresidential
buildings and grounds. The provisions of this article shall apply to all
structures which are now, or may become in the future, substandard with
respect to structure, protection against fire hazard, equipment or
maintenance, inadequate provisions for light and air, lack of property
heating, unsanitary conditions and overcrowding or shall otherwise be
deemed to constitute a danger to safety, health and welfare. The existence
of such conditions, factors or characteristics adversely affects public safety,
health and welfare and leads to the continuation, extension and aggravation
of urban blight. Adequate protection of the public, therefore, requires the
establishment and enforcement of these minimum property standards.
Further, this chapter is adopted to exercise the police powers granted
by N.J.S.A. 40:48-2.3 et seq., and the provisions of N.J.S.A. 40:49-5.1 and
N.J.A.C. 5:28-1, the New Jersey State Housing Code. Three copies of the
New Jersey State Housing Code shall be placed on file in the office of the
Township Clerk and are available to all persons desiring to use and examine
the same.
§ 220-2. Administration.
A. The Construction Official and/or Zoning and Code Enforcement Official
of Waterford Township are hereby designated and appointed as the
principal public officers authorized to exercise the powers prescribed in
this article (hereinafter referred to as "officials").
B. Application of the Building Code. Any alterations to buildings, or
changes of use therein, which may be caused directly or indirectly by
the enforcement of this article shall be done in accordance with the
applicable section of the code, as amended from time to time.
C. Existing buildings. This article establishes minimum requirements for
the continued occupancy of all buildings used for human habitation or
use and does not replace or modify requirements otherwise established

Official, in writing, of his intentions with respect to correcting the
condition. In the event that there is no response from the property
owner within the time period set forth on said notice, or should the
response be unsatisfactory to the Official, the Official shall file a
complaint with the Waterford Township Municipal Court and a hearing
shall be held before the Municipal Judge, at which time a penalty may
be assessed for the violation as hereinafter set forth.
C. Whenever a petition is filed with the Construction Official by a public
authority or by at least five residents of the Township charging that any
building or property is unfit for human habitation or occupancy or use
or whenever it appears to the Construction Official that any building is
unfit for human habitation, occupancy or use, he shall, if his preliminary
investigation discloses a basis for such charges, issue and cause to be
served upon the owner of and parties in interest in such building a
complaint stating the charges in that respect and containing a notice
that a hearing will be held before the Construction Official at a place
therein fixed not less than seven days nor more than 30 days after the
serving of said complaint; that the owner and parties in interest shall be
given the right to file an answer to the complaint and to appear in
person or otherwise, and that the rules of evidence prevailing in the

served upon the owners and persons in interest an order: requiring
the repair, alteration or improvement of said building to be made by
the owner within a reasonable time, which time shall be set forth in
the order, or, at the option of the owner, to vacate or have said
building vacated and closed within the time set forth in the order. If
the building is in such condition as to make it dangerous to the
health and safety of persons on or near the premises and the owner
fails to repair, alter or improve said building within the time
specified in the order, then the owner shall be required to remove

repair, alter or improve or, at the option of the owner, to vacate and
close said building, the Construction Official may cause such building to
be repaired, altered or improved or to be vacated and closed; and the
Construction Official shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of
any building so closed a placard with the following words: "This
building is unfit for human habitation or occupancy or use; the use or
occupancy of this building is prohibited and unlawful."
F. If the owner fails to comply with an order to remove or demolish the

removed or demolished or may contract for the removal or demolition
thereof after advertisement for and receipt of bids to complete the
specified work.

inspection fees, expert witness fees, search fees and advertisement

or demolition, if any, or the amount of the balance thereof remaining
after deduction of the sum, if any, realized from the sale of materials
derived from such building, or from any contract for removal or
demolition thereof, shall be a municipal lien against the real property
upon which the cost was incurred. If the building is removed or
demolished by the Construction Official, the materials of such building
shall be sold. There shall be credited against the cost of the removal or
demolition thereof, including the clearance and, if necessary, leveling of
the site, the proceeds of any sale of such materials or any sum derived
from any contract for the removal or demolition of the building. If there
are no such credits or if the sum total of such costs exceeds the total of
such credits, a detailed statement of the aforesaid costs and the amount
so due shall be filed with the Municipal Tax Assessor or other custodian
of the records of tax liens and a copy thereof shall be forthwith
forwarded to the owner by certified mail, return receipt requested. If
the total of the credits exceeds such cost, the balance remaining shall
be deposited in the Superior Court by the Township, shall be secured in
such manner as may be directed by such court and shall be disbursed
according to the order or judgment of the court to the persons found to
be in title thereto by final order or judgment of such court. Any owner
or party in interest may, within 30 days from the date of filing of the lien
certificate, proceed in a summary manner in the Superior Court to

or persons in interest reside outside the Township, then said
complaints, orders and notices shall be either served upon them

unknown and the same cannot be ascertained by the Official in the
exercise of reasonable diligence, the Official shall make an affidavit to
that effect and file it and a copy of the complaint with the Municipal
Clerk. In that event, the serving of such complaint, order or notice upon

year. In those instances where a unit is inspected for a reason other
than the annual inspection under this article, that inspection shall count
as the annual inspection under this article, provided that the same is
permitted by the Administrative Code of the State of New Jersey. The
owner shall be responsible for providing proof to the Township Housing
Inspector that said inspection(s) was made and for obtaining written
confirmation from the Township that said inspection(s) satisfies the
requirements of this article.

B. If any violation of this article occurs subsequent to written notification
being sent to said landlord and/or owner in accordance with the above
provisions, then said landlord and/or owner shall be cited for violation

ARTICLE I
Smoking in Public Buildings and on Public Property
[Adopted 10-12-2011 by Ord. No. 2011-14]
§ 230-1. Purpose.
The Township of Waterford finds and declares that the resolution of the
conflict between the right of the smoker to smoke and the right of the
nonsmoker to breathe clean air involves a determination of when and
where, rather than whether, a smoker may legally smoke. It is not the
public policy of the Township of Waterford to deny anyone the right to
smoke. However, the Township of Waterford finds that, in government
buildings owned or leased by the Township of Waterford and on all public
property owned or leased by the Township of Waterford, the right of the
nonsmoker to breathe clean air supersedes the right of the smoker to
smoke. In addition to the deleterious effects upon smokers, tobacco smoke
is at least an annoyance and a nuisance to a substantial percentage of the
nonsmoking public and a substantial health hazard to a smaller segment of
the nonsmoking public. Furthermore, smoking creates a substantial health
hazard to the youth of the Township who may be participating in activities
in buildings or properties owned or leased by the Township. Therefore, the
purpose of this chapter is to protect the interest of nonsmokers in public
buildings and on public property owned or leased by the Township and to
allow smokers the right to smoke only in designated areas established by
the Township.
§ 230-2. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
PUBLIC BUILDING  Any building or portion of a building owned or leased
by the Township of Waterford.
PUBLIC PROPERTY  Any real property, or portion thereof, owned or
leased by the Township of Waterford, to include parking lots, parks,
playgrounds and other recreation facilities.
SMOKING  The burning of a lighted cigar, cigarette, pipe or any other
matter or substance which contains tobacco or a similar substance.
TOBACCO PRODUCT  Cigarette, cigar, smokeless tobacco to include
snuff, chewing tobacco or any substance that contains tobacco.[Added
2-28-2018 by Ord. No. 2018-3]
§ 230-3. Smoking prohibition.
Smoking is prohibited in all public buildings owned or leased by the
Township of Waterford and on all public property owned or leased by the
Township of Waterford. In public buildings or public property owned or
leased by the Township of Waterford, a designated smoking area may be
§ 230-1 SEX OFFENDERS § 230-3
228:777
established, which shall be clearly identified, and is the only area within a
public building or on any public property where smoking is permitted.
§ 230-4. Notice.
Notice of this chapter shall be provided to all Township employees and to
any employee organization's duly elected representative.
§ 230-5. Signs; posting.
All places affected by this chapter shall be identified by signs posted by
the Township with letters, at least one inch in height, stating "Smoking
Prohibited" or "Smoking Permitted," or the signs shall be designated by
the appropriate "Smoking Prohibited" or "Smoking Permitted" international
symbol. The letters or symbols shall contrast in color with the sign. The sign
shall also indicate that any person violating this chapter shall be subject to
a fine and that a person who smokes in a nonsmoking area may be denied
continued access to that area or to the services offered by the Township
until compliance with this chapter. Every sign required by this chapter shall
be located so as to be clearly visible to both the public and the Township
employees.
§ 230-6. Violations and penalties. [Amended 2-28-2018 by Ord. No.
2018-3]
Any person violating the provisions of this chapter shall, upon conviction
thereof, pay a penalty of $100 for a first offense and a penalty of $200 for

condition and shall apply additional courses of skin patches.
Immediately prior to applying the surface course, the permittee
shall mill out the temporary pavement above the trench and to
sufficient widths on both sides of the trench to assure straight and
uniform surface restoration limits.
E. Restoration standards.
(1) The milling depth shall be two inches. The permittee shall then
apply a tack course followed by two inches of bituminous concrete,
HMA 12.5M64. Alternatively, a thin sand release layer may be
applied beneath the temporary bituminous stabilized base course
so that the course may be replaced with final pavement of other
method subject to prior approval by the Township Public Works
Superintendent. (See Township Detail 16 in Appendix 1.)
(2) The total width of the restored roadway surface shall comply with
the policies stated in Subsection E(3) below. Roadways with a

and CD-405-1.6, and the concrete depth replaced to match the
existing concrete depth but no less than nine inches thick. (See
NJDOT Detail Sheets CD-405-1 and CD-453-1 in Appendix 1.).
(3) Width and location of concrete base of full depth restoration will be
determined depending on the excavation trench's location or
concrete replacement to the nearest concrete joint. The size and
location of concrete base restoration will be determined by the
Township depending on the opening's relation to the nearest seam
and location of wheel loads to both new and old concrete sections.
The time limitations prescribed in § 239-5C also apply to this
section.
(4) All disturbed concrete base shall be doweled and replaced in kind

trench openings. Surface restoration shall extend across the
full width of the paved road.
(d) All seams and joints (including curb to roadway joint) are to be
sealed.
G. All final edges of trench restoration shall be straight: uniform cuts with
no keys or edge realignments. The Township may require a diamond
restoration pattern for cross trenches and intersection crossings
depending upon the amount of traffic on the road and the depth of the
trench. The permittee is responsible for the full restoration of the
roadway surface, including restriping and installing raised pavement
markers.
H. Pipes, trenches, and hook-ups, six inches in diameter or less, used for
making opposite side of the street hook-ups may be driven or bored
under the paved portion of the road or street without disturbing the
surface upon review of the Township.
I. Upon completion of work, the applicant will request a final inspection
by the Township. The Public Works Superintendent may require that
random core samples be taken on the project if in the opinion of the
Township Public Works Superintendent there appears to be a question
regarding either quality of the asphalt or the thickness thereof. These
core samples will be the responsibility of the contractor and shall be
taken and tested by a certified testing laboratory. All cost associated
§ 239-11 SOIL REMOVAL § 239-11

the use of improper material or insufficient thickness, the permittee
shall be required to remove, replace, or take other actions to
satisfactorily complete the restoration work as directed by the
Township Public Works Superintendent. If the work is completed in a
manner satisfactory, the Township Public Works Superintendent will
then issue a certificate of satisfactory completion to the applicant with
a copy to the Township Treasurer and to the Township Committee. The
performance surety will be returned by the Township Counsel upon
receipt of satisfactory maintenance guaranty.

share or profit from any clothing or other donations collected via the
bin, a notice, written in a clear and easily understandable manner,
indicating that the clothing or other donations collected via the bin,

in which the owner anticipates any clothing or other donations
collected via the bin will be used, sold, or disbursed, and the method by
which the proceeds of collected donations will be allocated or spent.

be the person to receive and investigate, within 30 days, any complaints
