Municipality of a permanent and general nature should be recodified, and
   WHEREAS, the City has heretofore entered into a contract with the Walter H.
Drane Company to prepare and publish such recodification, and
 
   WHEREAS, the recodification of such ordinances, together with the new matter

   Section 2.  That the provisions of this Ordinance, including all provisions

affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative
provisions prior to the effective date of such enactment, or an action or
proceeding for the enforcement of such right or liability.  Such enactment
shall not be construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act
committed in violation of any such legislative provision, nor to affect an
indictment or prosecution therefor.  For such purposes, any such legislative
provision shall continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the
purpose of revision and recodification.
   (b)   The repeal provided above shall not affect:
      (1)   The grant or creation of a franchise, license, right, easement or

legally accurate and sufficient.  The publication shall be once a week for two
consecutive weeks.

ordinance or resolution history at the end thereof indicates that the section
contains new material which is hereby enacted by this adopting ordinance.
   Section 5.  That through authentication and approval of this Ordinance the
Mayor and Clerk of Council shall certify that the permanent and general
ordinances of the Municipality as codified therein are correctly set forth and
constitute the Codified Ordinances of City of North Canton, 1993.

EDITOR'S NOTE
     The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification.  Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number.  For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06.  The code
and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding
the first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all
digits left of the decimal.  The section number appears right of the decimal. 
As another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number
is 113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
     This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in
allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion.  Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation.  Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code.  Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections.  For example, newly
created 575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be
placed in their logical position.
 
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section.  The history indicates the derivation by reference to either
its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that
time, or to its inclusion in any prior code.  Sections without histories
indicate that the section contains new matter which was ordained by the
Adopting Ordinance which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
 
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances.  It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections.  Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.
COMPARATIVE SECTION TABLE
   EDITOR'S NOTE:  Source material for the North Canton Codified Ordinances was
either ordinances or resolutions enacted by Council, or new matter ordained by
the Adopting Ordinance.  Sections of the Codified Ordinances without any
history indicate that such sections contain new matter ordained by the Adopting
Ordinance.  In the following table, the disposition of all source material in
the North Canton Codified Ordinances is indicated.

   Section 2.02.  Wards.

of each Councilperson upon the journal.
   All legislative action of Council shall be by resolution or ordinance
introduced in written or printed form, each of which shall contain no more than
one subject, which subject shall be clearly expressed in its title.
   No resolution or ordinance shall be revised or amended unless the resolution
or ordinance superseding it contains the entire resolution or ordinance so
revised or amended, or the section or sections so revised or amended, and,
having been revised or amended, the original resolution or ordinance, or
section or sections, shall be considered to be repealed.
   An affirmative vote of at least four members of Council shall be required

required by the provisions of this Charter.  Every resolution, except those of
strictly ceremonial nature or authorizing the expenditure of funds specifically
appropriated, and every ordinance, shall be fully and distinctly read at three
different, regular Council meetings unless Council votes to suspend this rule. 
Such suspension of the rule shall require the affirmative vote of at least six
members of Council.  If this rule is suspended in accordance with the foregoing
provisions, then the resolution or ordinance shall be read at least once before
passage.  Ordinances and resolutions shall be deemed to have been read if a
written or printed copy of the ordinance or resolution shall have been
furnished to each member of Council prior to its introduction and if the title
thereof is fully read, provided that such ordinance or resolution shall be read
in full if so directed by motion approved by affirmative vote of at least a
majority of the members of Council.
   Each emergency resolution and ordinance shall contain a statement of the
necessity for such emergency action, and its enactment shall require the

for an annual tax levy, or for improvements petitioned for by the owners of a
majority of the adjacent property to be benefited and specially assessed
therefor, and any emergency resolution or ordinance necessary for the immediate
preservation of public peace, health or safety, shall take effect, unless a
later date be specified therein, upon its approval by the Mayor, or upon the
expiration of the time within which it may be vetoed by the Mayor, or upon its
passage after veto by the Mayor, as the case may be.  No other resolution or
ordinance shall become effective until thirty (30) days after its approval by
the Mayor, or upon the expiration of the time within which it may be vetoed by
the Mayor, or upon passage after veto by the Mayor, as the case may be.
   All ordinances and resolutions, except those of a purely ceremonial nature,
passed by Council shall be published once in a newspaper of general circulation
within the municipality.  The manner of publication shall be as follows:

personnel, taxation, assessment, utility rates, zone change, annexation and
charter amendment shall be published in their entirety.
   b.   Those ordinances and resolutions of a temporary nature and enacted for

ballot for voting affirmatively or negatively on such question.  If a majority
of the votes cast at such election shall be voted affirmatively, such officer
shall remain in office.  If a majority of the votes cast shall be voted
negatively, such officer shall be considered as removed, his/her office shall
be declared vacant, and such vacancy shall be filled as provided by this
Charter.  The officer removed by such recall election shall not be eligible for
appointment to the vacancy created thereby.

on the last day of that month.
         (ORC 1.45)
      (3)   The time within which an act is required by law to be done shall be

101.04  REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;
      (4)   Affect any investigation, proceeding or remedy in respect of any
such privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment; and
the investigation, proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or
enforced, and the penalty, forfeiture or punishment imposed, as if the
ordinance had not been repealed or amended.
   (d)   If the penalty, forfeiture or punishment for any offense is reduced by
a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or
punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed according to the ordinance
as amended.
(ORC 1.58)
101.05  CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (a)   A reference to any portion of the Codified Ordinances applies to all
re-enactments or amendments thereof.
(ORC 1.55)
   (b)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
the last numbers or letters are included.
(ORC 1.56)
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)
101.06  CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both.  If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each.  If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails.  The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable.  Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)

States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08  SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99  GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00).  A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

         (Ord.  98-2000.  Passed 11-13-00.)

      (Ord.  98-2000.  Passed 11-13-00.)
107.03 PUBLIC RECORD POLICY.
   (a)   Mission Statement.    The City believes openness and transparency
leads to a better-informed citizenry, which leads to better government, and
better public policy.  Consistent with the premise that government-at all
levels-exists first and foremost to serve the interests of the people, the
City's mission and intent is to fully comply with and abide by both the spirit
and the letter of Ohio's Public Records Act, R.C. 149.43 et seq., as may be
amended from time to time.
   
   (b)   Defining Public Records. 
      (1)   All City records are public unless they are exempt from disclosure
under federal or Ohio law.  All public records shall be organized and
maintained in such a way that they are available for inspection and copying.
      (2)   A record is defined as a document, in any format, that is created,
received, or comes under the City's jurisdiction, and which documents the
City's organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or
activities.
      (3)   A "public record" is a "record" that is being kept by the City at
the time a public records request is made, subject to applicable exemptions
from disclosure under Ohio or federal law. All public records must be organized
and maintained in such a way that they can be made available for inspection and
copying.
   (c)   Response Timeframe.  Public records are available for inspection
during regular business hours, with the exception of published holidays. 
Public records shall be made available for inspection promptly.  Copies of
public records shall be made available within a reasonable period of time.
"Prompt" and "reasonable" take into account the volume of records requested;
staffing levels; the proximity of the location where the records are stored;
the necessity for any legal review and redaction of the records requested; and
other facts and circumstances of the records requested.
   (d)   Responding to Requests. 
      (1)   No specific language is required to make a request for public
records.  The requester must at least, however, identify the records requested
with sufficient clarity to allow the City to identify, retrieve, and review the
records.  If it is not clear what records are requested, the City shall contact
the requester for clarification, and shall assist the requester in revising the
request by informing the requester of the manner in which the office keeps its
public records.
      (2)   A records request need not be in writing, and the requester does
not have to provide the requester's identity or the intended use of the
requested public record.  However, Ohio law permits the City to ask for a
written request, the requester's identity, and/or the intended use of the
information requested, but only (1) if a written request or disclosure of
identity or intended use would benefit the requester by enhancing the City's
ability to identify, locate, or deliver the public records that have been
requested; and (2) after informing the requester that a written request is not
required and that the requester may decline to reveal the requester's identity
or intended use of the requested records.
      (3)   The City must examine each public record request under both state
and federal law, which are subject to constitutional and statutory law
amendments and enactments, and an evolving common law.  Therefore, a City
employee who receives a public record request must advise the Law Director and
Administration office without delay.  The Law Director shall assist the
employee in evaluating and responding to the request.  The Administration
office shall transmit the City's response to the request and track it for
compliance and efficiency by maintaining a log of each public records request
together with a copy of the response, and shall be responsible to deliver the
City's response to the requester.
      (4)   An electronic record is deemed to exist so long as a computer is
already programmed to produce the record through simple sorting, filtering, or
querying.  And although the City is not obligated to create new records or
perform new analysis of existing information to satisfy a public record
request, it may accommodate a requester by generating new records when it is
practical under the circumstances.
      (5)   In processing a request for inspection of a public record, a City
employee must accompany the requester during the inspection to make certain
original records are not removed, altered, or destroyed.  A copy of the most
recent edition of the Ohio Sunshine Laws manual is available via the Attorney
General's internet website (www.ohioattorneygeneral.gov) for the purpose of
keeping employees and the public educated as to the City's obligations under
the Ohio Public Records Act, Open Meetings Act, records retention laws, and
Personal Information Systems Act.
   (e)   Electronic Records.
      (1)   Records in the form of e-mail, text messaging, and instant
messaging, including those sent and received via a hand-held communications
device, are to be treated in the same fashion as records in other formats, such
as paper or audiotape.
      (2)   Public record content transmitted to or from private accounts or
personal devices is subject to disclosure.  All employees or representatives of
this office are required to retain their e-mail records and other electronic
records in accordance with applicable records retention schedules.
   (f)   Denial or Redaction of Records.
      (1)   If a requester makes an ambiguous or overly broad request or has
difficulty in making a request for public records, the request may be denied,
but the City must provide the requester an opportunity to revise the request by
informing the requester of the manner in which the City maintains and accesses
records.
      (2)   A denial of a public records request must include an explanation
and the legal authority.  If the initial request was made in writing, the
explanation shall also be in writing.  If portions of a requested record are
public and portions are exempt, the exempt portions shall be redacted and the
rest released.  The City shall make the redaction plainly visible, and each
redaction must be accompanied by a supporting explanation, including the legal
authority.
      (3)   Ohio's General Assembly has passed a number of laws that protect
certain records by requiring or permitting a public office to withhold them
from public release.  If the City invokes one of these exceptions, it may only
withhold a record or part of a record clearly covered by the exception, and it
must tell the requester the legal authority it is relying on to withhold the
record. 
   (g)   Copying and Mailing Costs.  Those seeking public records may be
charged only the actual cost of making copies, not the labor cost.  Currently,
the established cost to reproduce records is as follows:
      (1)   The cost for black and white photocopies is three cents ($.03) per
single-sided sheet; the cost for two-sided black and white photocopies is six
cents ($.06) per sheet.
      (2)   The cost for color photocopies is 13 cents ($.13) per single-sided
sheet; the cost for two-sided color photocopies is 26 cents ($.26) per sheet. 
      (3)   The cost for a black and white digital scan of a document is one
cent ($.01) per page.  The cost for a color digital scan of a document is nine
cents ($.09) per page. 
      (4)   For discs, video, or cassette tapes, the fee shall be the
replacement cost for the requested medium.  Reproduction costs may only be
charged if a commercial or professional service is contracted to provide the
requested  copies.
      (5)   Persons requesting photographs pursuant to this policy shall be
charged the actual cost incurred by the City for the reproduction of the
photographs.
      (6)   For any other type of media, the fee shall be the replacement or
reproduction cost for that particular media.
      (7)   The cost of copies shall be analyzed and updated from time-to-time
as the cost of reproducing records changes.
      (8)   Established costs and fees under this policy shall be clearly
posted and visible to the public.
   A requester may be required to pay in advance for the actual costs involved
in providing the copy.  A requester may choose whether to have the record
duplicated upon paper, upon the same medium in which the public record is kept,
or upon any other medium on which the City determines that the record can
reasonably be duplicated as an integral part of the City's normal operations. 
   If a requester asks that documents be delivered, the requester may be
charged the actual cost of the postage and mailing supplies, or other actual
costs of delivery. 
   (h)   Delivery Methods.  A requester may personally pick up requested copies
of public records, or may send a designee, after having providing the
applicable record custodian notice of the designation. Based upon the
requester's choice, the City's Administration office shall transmit copies of
public records via the U.S. mail, or by any other reasonable means of delivery
or transmission available to City.  Copies of public records may be transmitted
by e-mail if the City maintains the records electronically, or it determines
that it reasonably can duplicate the requested records into electronic form as
an integral part of its normal operation.   
   (i)   Managing Records.  City records are subject to records retention
schedules.  The City's current schedules are available at City Hall, a location
readily available to the public as required by Ohio Revised Code 149.43(B)(2).
   (j)   Enforcement and Liabilities. There are several options available to a
person who feels that a public office has failed to comply with an obligation
of the Public Records Act.  The requester may contact the City Law Director to
raise an objection.  The requester may engage in elective mediation offered by
the Ohio Attorney General, if said mediation is available.  The requester may
file a mandamus lawsuit.  In this type of lawsuit, the requester will have the
burden of showing that the requester made a proper public records request, and
the public office will have the burden of showing the court that it complied
with the obligation(s) allegedly violated.  If it cannot, the court will order
the public office to provide an improperly withheld record, and the public
office may be subject to a civil penalty and payment of attorney fees.
   (k)   Policy Posting and Distribution.  The City's Administration office
shall create a poster describing the above policy and post it in a conspicuous
place in City Hall, Station 1 - Fire Division, Station 2 - EMS Division, the
Service Center, the Water Treatment Plant, and the Civic Center.  This policy
shall be included in the employee handbook, and the record custodian for each
City department that maintains public records shall acknowledge, in writing,
receipt of this policy.

   (a)   Council has a significant governmental interest to ensure order during

and so that the City's business may be effectively accomplished without
disruption, meetings shall be conducted in an orderly, efficient, and dignified
manner.  Council must therefore insist that all in attendance not disrupt
Council,  committee, or special meetings by physical actions, excessive noise,
or other disruptive or distracting behaviors, as those actions delay-and in
some circumstances-cease the legislative process.
 
   (b)   Council shall designate a portion of its meeting, Recognition of
Visitors, to provide its guests with a venue in which they may be heard in a
fair, impartial, and respectful manner, which is open and welcoming to diverse
viewpoints, and yet free from disruptions, and impertinent behavior. 
Therefore, with the exception of the amount of time permitted to speak, and the
rule that Recognition of Visitor's is the only portion of Council meetings that
a guest may speak, Council shall not limit a guest's message that appears free
of impertinence, slander, profanity, obscenity, intimidation, threats of
violence, or those spoken words or actions likely to invite a beach of the
peace.
 
   (c)   In the interest of its guests, City employees, and Council Members,
and to help prevent the disruption of its meetings that delay or cease the
legislative process, Council rules shall be strictly and equally enforced.  The
President of Council shall promptly issue a warning to those that violate the
Rules of Decorum, Courtesy, and Propriety to cease the disruptive behavior. 
Because a disruptive individual waives his or her right to remain at a meeting,
and to prevent the further delay or cessation of the legislative process, the
President of Council shall expel from the meeting those individuals that
persist despite the President's warning to cease the disruptive behavior.  If
the disruptive individual fails to immediately leave the meeting upon the
President of Council's demand, the President shall have the individual removed
from the Council, Committee of the Whole, or special meeting by a law
enforcement officer in the course of enforcing the laws of the State of Ohio. 
A person who disrupts a Council, Committee of the Whole, or special meeting may
be prosecuted for disturbing a lawful meeting, a fourth degree misdemeanor, and
obstructing official business, a second degree misdemeanor.
(Ord. 33-13.  Passed 5-28-13.)
111.11  RECOGNITION OF VISITORS.
   (a)   Guests of Council meetings are permitted to speak only during the
Recognition of Visitors portion of the Council meeting. Guests shall observe
the Rules of Decorum, Courtesy, and Propriety described above.  See
111.10.  There shall be no shouting or other types of disruptive behavior
during a Council, Committee of the Whole, or special meeting.
 
   (b)   Each speaker should first acknowledge that the speaker has read and
understands Council's Rules of Decorum, Courtesy, and Propriety, and
Recognition of Visitors.  If the speaker does not acknowledge having read and
understanding the aforementioned rules, the Director of Law shall provide the
individual with the necessary information so that the speaker may conduct
itself accordingly during the Recognition of Visitor's portion of the Council
meeting.  The speaker shall begin by first identifying themselves by name, home
address, and stating the subject matter on which he or she intends to speak. 
 
   (c)   Each speaker's comments are limited to a maximum of five minutes and
shall be directed only to the President of Council. There shall be no debate
between the speaker and guests, City employees, or Council Members. Other
guests, City employees, or Council members shall not interrupt or otherwise
engage the speaker during the speaker's five minutes.  Only after the speaker
has completed speaking and returned to her or his seat may a Council member, or
City employee, who is seated at the Council dais, respond to the speaker's
comments.
 
   (d)   When the speaker's five minutes have expired, as indicated by both an
audible alarm and a timer visible to all of those in attendance of the meeting,
the speaker shall promptly cease speaking and shall return to his or her seat
or shall exit the meeting.  Council members and City employees at the dais are
available following the meeting if the speaker wishes to continue the speaker's
comments.  The speaker may also resume at the next Recognition of Visitor
portion of a Council meeting. 
 
   (e)   A speaker that continues beyond the allocated five minutes, and who
continues to speak despite receiving notice that the speaker's time limit has
expired, disrupts the meeting and waives his or her right to remain.  To
prevent the disruptive individual's further delay or cessation of the
legislative process, the President of Council shall expel from that meeting
those that persist despite the President's warning to cease the disruptive
behavior.  If the disruptive individual fails to immediately leave the meeting
upon the President of Council's demand, the President shall have the individual
removed from the Council, Committee of the Whole, or special meeting by a law
enforcement officer in the course of enforcing the laws of the State of Ohio. 
A person who disrupts a Council, Committee of the Whole, or special meeting may
be prosecuted for disturbing a lawful meeting, a fourth degree misdemeanor, and
obstructing official business, a second degree misdemeanor.
 
   (f)   Speakers, and all of those in attendance of Council, Committee of the
Whole, and special meetings, shall strictly follow all Rules of Decorum,
Courtesy, and Propriety, as described above.  (Ord. 33-13.  Passed 5-28-13.)
111.12  SALARIES AND BONDS.
   Salaries and bonds for all elected and appointed officials and City
employees shall be as established by Council and all ordinances pertaining
thereto are hereby saved by reference.

process through which residents can register concerns about traffic issues and
have those concerns systematically addressed.
   (c)   Education and Enforcement.
      (1)   Before requesting the City's neighborhood Traffic Calming Program,
residents should first pursue neighborhood speed-reduction options with the
Police Department.  If such efforts have not been pursued, the City will advise
the requesting applicant as to programs they would need to initiate prior to
proceeding with a traffic-calming evaluation request.  Once these options have
been pursued, and if the City has determined these initiatives to be
ineffective, staff will then advise the residents to proceed with the
neighborhood Traffic-Calming Program.
      (2)   If a neighborhood feels these strategies have been ineffective, the
neighborhood may then choose to proceed to request evaluation for traffic
calming measures.  The neighborhood must deliver the request to the City
Engineering Department, which will evaluate to what extent other actions have
been pursued by the residents of the requesting area and determine whether
these steps have been effective.  If efforts, such as requests for increased
enforcement, the use of a traffic statistics collection device in the
neighborhood, and neighborhood speed watch programs have been used by the
residents and City staff has determined them ineffective in the reduction of
volume, speed, non-local or cut-through traffic, and accidents, then the
request will proceed to the next step.

   There are hereby established guidelines to be followed by the Board of
Control for handling those contracts which exceed specifications or which go
over contract cost as follows:
   (a)   By authority of the Director of Administration, any item which has
been bid, such as a certain type of gravel, may exceed the amount specified in
the contract without being returned to the Board of Control, unless such amount
exceeds ten percent (10%).
   (b)   Any item which has not been bid and which must be added to the
contract, must be brought to the Board of Control as a change order before such
item is added.
   (c)   Any contract which monetarily goes over the contract price by ten
percent (10%) must be brought to the attention of the Board of Control and
Council.
      (Res. 803.  Passed 4-22-74.)
141.02  CHANGE ORDERS.

is determined that a change order is necessary, which change order necessitates
the expenditure of moneys by the City in excess of twenty-five thousand dollars
($25,000), said change order shall not be referred to the Board of Control for
action until such time as said change order has been approved by three members
of Council.
   (b)   In the event there is an emergency in the performance of a contract to
which the City is a party necessitating a change order involving the
expenditure of moneys by the City in excess of twenty-five thousand dollars
($25,000), and such emergency is such that it is impractical to contact three
members of Council for approval, the Board of Control by an approval by three
members may authorize such change order.  (Ord. 18-04.  Passed 2-23-04.)
   (c)   The Director of Finance is hereby directed not to honor or pay for any
change order not issued and approved pursuant to the terms of this section.
(Ord. 53-84.  Passed 6-11-84.)
141.03  LOCAL BIDDER PREFERENCE.

award of contracts, is authorized to award contracts to local bidders as
hereinafter defined, whose bid is not more than ten percent (10%) higher,
subject to a maximum amount of ten thousand dollars ($10,000), then the low

new or existing covered accounts;

      (3)   Respond to risks to determine if fraudulent activity has occurred
and act if fraud has been attempted or committed; and

common shared work areas will be cleared of all documents containing sensitive
information when not in use.

password protected and only to approved recipients. Additionally, a statement
such as this should be included in the e-mail:
      
   "This message may contain confidential and/or proprietary information and is
intended for the person/entity to whom it was originally addressed. Any use by
others is strictly prohibited."

reasonably foreseeable risk to the safety or soundness of the municipality from
identity theft, including financial, operational, compliance, reputation, or
litigation risks.
   (b)   Red flags.
      (1)   The following red flags are potential indicators of fraud. Any time
a red flag, or a situation closely resembling a red flag, is apparent, it
should be investigated for verification.
         A.   Alerts, notifications or warnings from a consumer reporting
agency;
         B.   A fraud or active duty alert included with a consumer report;
         C.   A notice of credit freeze from a consumer reporting agency in
response to a request for a consumer report; or
         D.   A notice of address discrepancy from a consumer reporting agency
as defined in § 334.82(b) of the Fairness and Accuracy in Credit Transactions
Act.
   (c)   Red flags also include consumer reports that indicate a pattern of
activity inconsistent with the history and usual pattern of activity of an
applicant or customer, such as:
      (1)   A recent and significant increase in the volume of inquiries;
      (2)   An unusual number of recently established credit relationships;
      (3)   A material change in the use of credit, especially with respect to
recently established credit relationships; or
      (4)   An account that was closed for cause or identified for abuse of
account privileges by a financial institution or creditor.
   (d)   Suspicious documents.
      (1)   Documents provided for identification that appear to have been
altered or forged.
      (2)   The photograph or physical description on the identification is not
consistent with the appearance of the applicant or customer presenting the
identification.
      (3)   Other information on the identification is not consistent with
information provided by the person opening a new covered account or customer
presenting the identification.
      (4)   Other information on the identification is not consistent with
readily accessible information that is on file with the Municipality, such as a
signature card or a recent check.
      (5)   An application appears to have been altered or forged, or gives the
appearance of having been destroyed and reassembled.
   (e)   Suspicious Personal Identifying Information.
      (1)   Personal identifying information provided is inconsistent when
compared against external information sources used by the Municipality. For
example:
         A.   The address does not match any address in the consumer report;
         B.   The Social Security number (SSN) has not been issued or is listed
on the Social Security Administration's Death Master File; or
         C.   Personal identifying information provided by the customer is not
consistent with other personal identifying information provided by the
customer. For example, there is a lack of correlation between the SSN range and
date of birth.
      (2)   Personal identifying information provided is associated with known
fraudulent activity as indicated by internal or third-party sources used by the
municipality. For example, the address on an application is the same as the
address provided on a fraudulent application.
      (3)   Personal identifying information provided is of a type commonly
associated with fraudulent activity as indicated by internal or third-party
sources used by the Municipality. For example:
         A.   The address on an application is fictitious, a mail drop, or a
prison; or
         B.   The phone number is invalid or is associated with a pager or
answering service.
      (4)   The SSN provided is the same as that submitted by other persons
opening an account or other customers.
      (5)   The address or telephone number provided is the same as or similar
to the address or telephone number submitted by an unusually large number of
other customers or other persons opening accounts.
      (6)   The customer or the person opening the covered account fails to
provide all required personal identifying information on an application or in
response to notification that the application is incomplete.
      (7)   Personal identifying information provided is not consistent with
personal identifying information that is on file with the Municipality.
      (8)   When using security questions (mother's maiden name, pet's name,
etc.), the person opening the covered account or the customer cannot provide
authenticating information beyond that which generally would be available from
a wallet or consumer report.
   (f)   Unusual Use of, or Suspicious Activity Related to, the Covered
Account.
      (1)   Shortly following the notice of a change of address for a covered
account, the municipality receives a request for new, additional, or
replacement goods or services, or for the addition of authorized users on the
account.
      (2)   A new revolving credit account is used in a manner commonly
associated with known patterns of fraud patterns. For example, the customer
fails to make the first payment or makes an initial payment but no subsequent
payments.
      (3)   A covered account is used in a manner that is not consistent with
established patterns of activity on the account. There is, for example:
         A.   Nonpayment when there is no history of late or missed payments;
         B.   A material change in purchasing or usage patterns
      (4)   A covered account that has been inactive for a reasonably lengthy
period of time is used (taking into consideration the type of account, the
expected pattern of usage and other relevant factors).
      (5)   Mail sent to the customer is returned repeatedly as undeliverable
although transactions continue to be conducted in connection with the
customer's covered account.
      (6)   The Municipality is notified that the customer is not receiving
paper account statements.
      (7)   The Municipality is notified of unauthorized charges or
transactions in connection with a customer's covered account.
      (8)   The Municipality receives notice from customers, victims of
identity theft, law enforcement authorities, or other persons regarding
possible identity theft in connection with covered accounts held by the
Municipality.
      (9)   The Municipality is notified by a customer, a victim of identity
theft, a law enforcement authority, or any other person that it has opened a
fraudulent account for a person engaged in identity theft.
         (Res. 97-09.  Passed 10-26-09.)
161.07  RESPONDING TO RED FLAGS.
   (a)   Once potentially fraudulent activity is detected, an employee must act
quickly as a rapid appropriate response can protect customers and the
municipality from damages and loss.
      (1)   Once potentially fraudulent activity is detected, gather all
related documentation and write a description of the situation. Present this
information to the designated authority for determination.
      (2)   The designated authority will complete additional authentication to
determine whether the attempted transaction was fraudulent or authentic.
   (b)   If a transaction is determined to be fraudulent, appropriate actions
must be taken immediately. Actions may include:
      (1)   Canceling the transaction;
      (2)   Notifying and cooperating with appropriate law enforcement;
      (3)   Determining the extent of liability of the Municipality; and
      (4)   Notifying the actual customer that fraud has been attempted.
         (Res. 97-09.  Passed 10-26-09.)
161.08  PERIODIC UPDATES TO PLAN.
   (a)   At periodic intervals established in the program, or as required, the
program will be re-evaluated to determine whether all aspects of the program
are up to date and applicable in the current business environment.
   (b)   Periodic reviews will include an assessment of which accounts are
covered by the program.
   (c)   As part of the review, red flags may be revised, replaced or
eliminated. Defining new red flags may also be appropriate.
   (d)   Actions to take in the event that fraudulent activity is discovered
may also require revision to reduce damage to the Municipality and its
customers.
(Res. 97-09.  Passed 10-26-09.)
161.09  PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION.
   (a)   Involvement of Management.
      (1)   The Identity Theft Prevention Program shall not be operated as an
extension to existing fraud prevention programs, and its importance warrants
the highest level of attention.
      (2)   The Identity Theft Prevention Program is the responsibility of the
governing body. Approval of the initial plan must be appropriately documented
and maintained.
      (3)   Operational responsibility of the program is delegated to the
Director of Administration for Safety Services and the Director of Finance for
Utilities and Income Tax. 
   (b)   Staff training.
      (1)   Staff training shall be conducted for all employees, officials and
contractors for whom it is reasonably foreseeable that they may come into
contact with accounts or personally identifiable information that may
constitute a risk to the municipality or its customers.
      (2)   The Director of Administration for Safety Services and the Director
of Finance for Utilities and Income Tax is responsible for ensuring identity
theft training for all their requisite employees and third party providers.
      (3)   Employees must receive annual training in all elements of this
policy.
      (4)   To ensure maximum effectiveness, employees may continue to receive
additional training as changes to the program are made.
   (c)   Oversight of Service Provider Arrangements.
      (1)   It is the responsibility of the Municipality to ensure that the
activities of all service providers are conducted in accordance with reasonable
policies and procedures designed to detect, prevent, and mitigate the risk of
identity theft.
      (2)   A service provider that maintains its own identity theft prevention
program, consistent with the guidance of the red flag rules and validated by
appropriate due diligence, may be considered to be meeting these requirements.
      (3)   Any specific requirements should be specifically addressed in the
appropriate contract arrangements.
         (Res. 97-09.  Passed 10-26-09.)
TITLE SEVEN - Judicial
Chap. 
171.  Mayor's Court.
CHAPTER 171
Mayor's Court
   EDITOR'S NOTE:  The Mayor has jurisdiction to hear and determine any
prosecution for the violation of a Municipal ordinance, and has jurisdiction in
all criminal causes involving moving traffic violations occurring on State
highways located within the corporate limits, subject to the right of the
defendant to trial by jury and before an impartial magistrate.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Municipal ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00).  Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and
Criminal Rule 23(A) provide that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him and shall be transferred to a court of record in the County if the
defendant:
   (a)   Does not waive his right to trial by jury in a serious offense case
for which the penalty established by laws includes confinement for more than
six months, or
   (b)   Demands a jury trial in a petty offense case in which the penalty
prescribed is a fine greater than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) and/or
imprisonment for not more than six months.  "Such demand must be in writing and
filed with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the date set for
trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice of the date
set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to demand a jury trial as provided
in this subdivision is a complete waiver of the right thereto."
      In Ward v. Village of Monroeville, Ohio, 93 S. Ct. 80 (1972), the United
States Supreme Court held that where the mayor before whom the defendant was
compelled to stand trial was responsible for municipal finances and the mayor's
court provided a substantial portion of municipal revenues, defendant was
denied a trial before a disinterested and impartial magistrate as guaranteed by
the due process clause of the United States Constitution.
   The Supreme Court of Ohio has adopted the "Ohio Traffic Rules" which
prescribe the procedure to be followed in the Mayor's Court in traffic cases. 
Rule 9(A) thereof states the jury demand shall be made pursuant to Criminal
Rule 23 referred to above.  Rule 9(B) sets forth the conditions under which the
Mayor may hear a traffic case incorporating therein the holding in Ward v.
Village of Monroeville as further interpreted in State, ex rel. Brockman v.
Procter, 35 Ohio St. 2d 79 (1973):  "Where, in a mayor's court, a defendant is
entitled to a jury trial and a jury demand is made pursuant to Criminal Rule
23, the Mayor shall transfer the case pursuant to subdivision (C).  If a jury
demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and (or?) the defendant waives
his right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the case if (1) his
compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions, or (2) he is not the chief executive and administrative officer of
the municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition of the
municipality.  Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor including
mayors whose compensation as a judge is directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions and mayors who as chief executive and administrative officer of the
municipality are responsible for the financial condition of the municipality."
   The procedure for transferring a case to a court of record is
set forth in Rule 9(C):  "Where a transfer is required, the mayor's court shall
make a written order directing the defendant to appear at the transferee court,
continuing the same bail, if any, and making appearance before the transferee
court a condition of bail, if any.  Upon transfer, the mayor's court shall
transmit to the clerk of the transferee court the ticket and all other papers
in the case, and any bail taken in the case.  Upon receipt of such papers the
clerk of the transferee court shall set the case for trial and shall notify the
defendant by ordinary mail of his trial date."
   Rule 13 provides that a court shall establish a traffic  violation bureau
and specifies certain restrictions as to the designated offenses and schedule
of fines to be accepted as waiver payment in lieu of court appearance.

         (Ord. 145-04.  Passed 11-15-04.)
191.04  IMPOSITION OF TAX ON RESIDENTS.
   (a)   In the case of residents of the City an annual tax of one and one-half
percent (1.5%) is imposed on all salaries, qualifying wages, commissions, other
compensation, and other income (including earnings deposited by the employee
into deferred compensation or medical coverage plans) earned or received during
the effective period of the Ordinance.  For the purpose of determining the tax
on the income of resident taxpayers, the source of the income and the place or
places in or at which the services were rendered or the income was earned or
received, are immaterial.  All such income wherever earned or received is
taxable.
   (b)   The following are items which are subject to the tax:
      (1)   Gross income, including but not limited to income, salaries,
qualifying wages, bonuses and incentive payments earned by an individual,
whether directly or through an agent, and whether in cash or in property for
services rendered during the tax period as an officer, director or employee of
a corporation (including charitable and other nonprofit organizations), or
association or any other entity or person; an officer or employee (whether
elected, appointed, or commissioned) of the United States Government or any of
its agencies or of the State of Ohio or any of its political subdivisions or
agencies thereof; or any foreign country or dependency.  For clarification,
effective January 1, 2005, "income" includes lottery, gambling and sports
winnings, and games of chance.  No deductions shall be allowed against income
from lottery, gambling and sports winnings, and games of chance unless the
taxpayer is considered a professional gambler for federal income tax purposes,
in which case related deductions as permitted by the Internal Revenue Code
shall be allowed against gambling and sports winnings.
      (2)   Commissions earned or received by a taxpayer, whether directly or
through an agent, and whether in cash or in property for services rendered
during the effective period of the Ordinance, regardless of how computed or by
whom or wheresoever paid.
         A.   If amounts received as a drawing account exceed the commissions
earned and the excess is not subject to the demand of the employer for
repayment, the tax is payable on the amounts received as a drawing account.
         B.   Amounts received from an employer for expenses and used as such
by the individual receiving them are not deemed to be compensation if the
employer deducts such expenses or advances as such from his gross income for
the purpose of determining his net profits taxable under federal law, and the
employee is not required to include such receipts as income on his federal
income tax return.
         C.   If commissions are included in the net earnings of the trade,
business, profession, enterprise or activity, carried on by an unincorporated
entity or association of which the individual receiving such commissions is
owner or part owner and therefore subject to Section
191.06 and/or
191.07, they shall not be subject to Section

benefits, such as pension payments, are exempt from North Canton income tax.
      (7)   Moving expenses, to the extent that they are reimbursed by
employers, are not taxable if deducted on federal return.
      (8)   For taxable years 2004 and later, if any of the items listed in

Code Section 3121(a) withholding, those items shall not be considered taxable
for North Canton.
      (9)   Effective for tax years 2004 and later, the distributive share of
income paid to an S corporation shareholder shall be taxable in the following
manner:

191.09  ALLOCATION OF BUSINESS PROFITS.
   (a)   For taxable years 2004 and later, net profits (i.e., "adjusted federal
taxable income") shall be calculated by adjusting the corporation's federal
taxable income before net operating losses and special deductions in the
following manner:
      (1)   Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal taxable
income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the intangible
income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
      (2)   Deduct income and gain included in federal taxable income to the
extent the income and gain directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other
disposition of an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code, except to the extent the income or gain is income or gain
described in section 1245 or 1250 of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   Add an amount equal to five percent (5%) of intangible income
deducted under division (A)(1) of this section, but excluding that portion of
intangible income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition
of property described in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (4)   Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal
taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other
disposition of an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code.
      (5)   Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction in
the computation of federal taxable income.
      (6)   In the case of a real estate investment trust and regulated
investment company, add all amounts with respect to dividends to, distributions
to, or amounts set aside for or credited to the benefit of investors and
allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal taxable income.
      (7)   If the taxpayer is not a C corporation and is not an individual,
the taxpayer shall compute adjusted federal taxable income as if the taxpayer
were a C corporation, except that guaranteed payments and other similar amounts
paid or accrued to a partner, former partner, member, or former member shall
not be allowed as a deductible expense, and amounts paid or accrued to a
qualified self-employed retirement plan with respect to an owner or
owneremployee of the taxpayer, amounts paid or accrued to or for health
insurance for an owner or owner-employee, and amounts paid or accrued to or for
life insurance for an owner or owner-employee shall not be allowed as a
deduction.
   (b)   Business Allocation Percentage Method:
      (1)   STEP 1: Calculate the percentage allocable to the City of the
average original cost of total real and tangible personal property (including
lease- hold improvements), wherever situated, owned or used in the business
during the period covered by the return.
         A.   The percentage of taxpayer's real and tangible personal property
within the City is determined by dividing the average net book value of such
property within the City (without deduction of any encumbrances) by the average
original cost of all such property within and without the City. In determining
such percentage, property rented to the taxpayer, as well as real and tangible
personal property owned by the taxpayer, must be considered.
            1.   The net book value of real and tangible personal property
rented by the taxpayer shall be determined by multiplying gross annual rents
payable by eight (8).
            2.   Gross rent means the actual sum of money or other
consideration payable, directly or indirectly, by the taxpayer for the use or
possession of property and includes:
               a.   Any amount payable for the use or possession of real and
tangible personal property or any part thereof, whether designated as a fixed
sum of money or as a percentage of sales, profits or otherwise;
               b.   Any amount payable as additional rent or in lieu of rent
such as interest, taxes, insurance, repairs or other amounts required to be
paid by the terms of a lease or other arrangement.
      (2)   STEP 2: Calculate the percentage allocable to the City of the gross
receipts of the taxpayer derived from sales made, work done and services
rendered in the City is of the total gross receipts, wherever derived, during
the period covered by the return.
         A.   The following sales shall be considered North Canton sales:
            1.   All sales made through retail stores located within the City
to purchasers within or without the City except such of said sales to
purchasers outside the City that are directly attributable to regular
solicitations made outside the City personally by the taxpayer or his
employees.
            2.   All sales of tangible personal property delivered to
purchasers within the City if shipped or delivered from an office, store,
warehouse, factory or place of storage located within the City.
            3.   All sales of tangible personal property delivered to
purchasers within the City even though transported from a point outside the
City of the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own employees in the
solicitation or promotion of sales within the City and the sale is directly or
indirectly the result of such solicitation.
            4.   All sales of tangible personal property shipped from an
office, store, warehouse, factory or place of storage within the City to
purchasers outside the City if the taxpayer is not, through its own employees,
regularly engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales at the place of
delivery.
            5.   Charges for work done or services performed incident to a
sale, whether or not included in the price of the property, shall be considered
gross receipts from such sale.
         B.   In the application of the foregoing sub-paragraphs, a carrier
shall be considered the agent of the seller regardless of the FOB point or
other conditions of the sale; and the place at which orders are accepted or
contracts legally consummated shall be immaterial. Solicitation of customers
outside the City by mail, phone, or other electronic means from an office or
place of business within the City shall be considered a solicitation of sales
within the City.
      (3)   STEP 3: Calculate the percentage allocable to the City of the total
wages, salaries, commissions, other compensation and other income of employees,
within and without the City, during the period covered by the return. Wages,
salaries, and other compensation shall be included to the extent that they
represent qualifying wages.
         A.   Salaries and reasonable compensation paid owners or credited to
the account of owners or partners during the period covered by the return are
considered wages for the purpose of this computation.
         B.   Wages, salaries, other compensation and other income shall be
computed on the cash or accrual basis in accordance within the method of
accounting used for Federal income tax purposes.
         C.   In the case of an employee who performs services both within and
without the City the amount treated as compensation for services performed
within the City shall deemed to be:
            1.   In the case of an employee whose compensation depends directly
on the volume of business secured by him, such as a salesman on a commission
basis, the amount received by him for the business attributable to his efforts
within the City;
            2.   In the case of an employee whose compensation depends on other
results achieved, the proportion of the total compensation received which the
value of his services within the City bears to the value of all his services;
and
            3.   In the case of an employee compensated on a time basis, the
proportion of the total amount received by him which his working time within
the City is of his total working time.
      (4)   STEP 4: Add the percentage determined in accordance with Steps 1, 2
and 3, or such of the aforesaid percentages as may be applicable to the
particular taxpayer's business, and divide the total so obtained by the number
of percentages used in computing said total. The result so obtained is the
business allocation percentage. In determining the average percentage, a factor
shall not be excluded from the computation merely because said factor is found
to be allocable entirely outside the City. A factor is excluded only when it
does not exist anywhere.
      (5)   STEP 5: The business allocation percentage determined in Step 4
above shall be applied to the entire taxable net profits of the taxpayer
wherever derived to determine the net profits allocable to the City.
   (c)   Substitute Method:
      (1)   In the event a just and equitable result cannot be obtained under
the formula the Director of Finance, upon application of the taxpayer, may
substitute other factors in the formula or prescribe other methods of
allocating net income calculated to effect a fair and proper allocation.
      (2)   Application to the Director of Finance to substitute other factors
in the formula or to use a different method to allocate net profits must be
made in writing before the end of the taxable year. The application shall state
the specific grounds on which the substitution of factors or use of different
method is requested and the relief sought to be obtained. No specific form need
be followed in making such application. Once a taxpayer has filed under a
substitute method, he must continue to so file until given permission to change
by the Director of Finance.
      (3)   If the substitute method approved is the use of books and records
of the taxpayer, a statement must accompany the return explaining the manner in
which such apportionment is made in sufficient detail to enable the Director of
Finance to determine whether the net profits attributable to the City are
apportioned with reasonable accuracy.
         (Ord. 145-04.  Passed 11-15-04.)
191.10  TREATMENT OF EXPENSES.
   All ordinary and necessary expenses of doing business shall be allowed but
no deduction may be claimed for salary or withdrawal of a proprietor or of the
partners, members, or other owners of an unincorporated business, enterprise,
or association.
   (a)   If not claimed as part of the cost of goods sold or elsewhere in the
return filed, there may be claimed and allowed a reasonable deduction for
depreciation, depletion, obsolescence, losses resulting from theft or casualty
not compensated for by insurance or otherwise, of property used in the trade or
business, but the amount may not exceed that recognized for the purpose of the
Federal income tax. Provided, however, that loss on the sale, exchange or other
disposition of depreciable property or real estate used in the taxpayer's
business shall not be allowed as a deductible expense.
   (b)   Where depreciable property is voluntarily destroyed, only the cost of
such demolition and the undepreciated balance thereof will be allowed as an
expense in the year of such demolition to the extent allowable for Federal
income tax purposes.
   (c)   Bad debts in a reasonable amount may be allowed in the year
ascertained worthless and charged off, or at the discretion of the Director of
Finance (if the reserve method is used), a reasonable addition to the reserve
may be claimed; but in no event shall the amount exceed the amount allowable
for Federal income tax purposes.
   (d)   Only taxes directly connected with the business may be claimed as a
deduction. If, for any reason the income from property is not subject to the
tax, then taxes on, and other expenses of, said property are not deductible. In
any event, the following taxes are not deductible from income; (1) the tax
under the Ordinance; (2) Federal or other taxes based upon income; (3) gift,
estate or inheritance taxes; and (4) taxes for local benefits or improvements
to property which tend to appreciate the value thereof.
   (e)   The Federal Investment Credit" is not deductible. However, if the
investment credit requires the basis of the property to be lowered,
depreciation may be computed on the original basis.
      (Ord. 145-04.  Passed 11-15-04.)
191.11  TREATMENT OF OTHER INCOME OR LOSS.
   (a)   Capital gains and losses (capital or other) from sale, exchange or
other disposition of property used in the trade or business shall not be taken
into consideration in arriving at net profits earned. However, any amount or
value received, realized or recognized on a sale or other disposition of
tangible personal property or real property used in business, in excess of
original book value, shall be treated as taxable income under the Ordinance to
the extent of depreciation previously taken as a deduction. The method of
calculating the depreciation deduction shall not be considered when recovering
the depreciation as a result of the sale, exchange or other disposition of
property. The balance in excess of the amount of depreciation recovered shall
be treated as a capital gain.
      (1)   Definition of Property Used in the Trade or Business. For purposes
of this section, the term "property used in the trade or business" means
property used in the trade or business of a character which is subject to the
allowance for depreciation and real property used in the trade or business,
held for more than 6 months, which is not:
         A.   Property of a kind which would properly be includible in the
inventory of the taxpayer if on hand at the close of the taxable year;
         B.   Property held by the taxpayer primarily for sale to customers in
the ordinary course of his trade or business; or
         C.   A copyright, a literary, musical, or artistic composition, or
similar property held by the taxpayer.
   (b)   In general, non-taxable income (and expense incurred in connection
therewith) is not to be considered in determining net profits. Income from
intangibles, by way of dividends, interest and the like, shall not be included
if such income is subject to taxation under the intangible personal property
laws of the State of Ohio or is specifically exempt from taxation under said
laws.
   (c)   Income derived from the operation of oil and/or gas wells shall be
taxable, and expenses incurred in connection therewith shall be considered in
determining net profits.
   (d)   Five percent (5%) of non-taxable income shall be considered to be
attributable expenses.
   (e)   Income from patents or copyrights is not to be included in net profits
subject to the tax if the income from such patents or copyrights is subject to
taxation under the intangible personal property laws of the State. Income in
the form of royalties is taxable if the taxpayer's activities produced the
publication or other product, the sale of which produces the royalties.
   (f)   In determining income subject to taxation, losses from the operation
of a business or profession cannot be used to reduce wages from employment or
other employment compensation. 
(Ord. 145-04.  Passed 11-15-04.)
191.12  RENTAL PROPERTY.
   Rentals received by the taxpayer are to be included as income only if and to
the extent that the rental, ownership, management or operation of the real
estate from which such rentals are derived (whether so rented, managed or
operated by taxpayer individually or through agents or other representatives)
constitutes a business activity of the taxpayer in whole or in part. Following
are the circumstances under which, in any instance, the rental of any real
property shall or shall not be deemed to be a "Business Activity":
   (a)   Where the gross monthly rental of any and all real properties,
regardless of number and value, aggregates in excess of one hundred dollars
($100.00) per month, it shall be prima facie evidence that the rental,
ownership, management or operation of such properties is a business activity of
such taxpayer, and the net income of such rental property shall be subject to
tax.
      (1)   Provided that in case of commercial property, the owner shall be
considered engaged in a business activity when the rental is based on a fixed
or fluctuating percentage of gross or net sales, receipts or profits of the
lessee, whether or not such rental exceeds one hundred dollars ($100.00) per
month.
      (2)   Provided further that in the case of farm property, the owner shall
be considered engaged in a business activity when he shares in the crops or
when the rental is based on a percentage of the gross or net receipts derived
from the farms, whether or not the gross income exceeds one hundred dollars
($100.00) per month.
      (3)   Provided further that the person who operates a licensed rooming
house shall be considered in business whether or not the gross income exceeds
one hundred dollars ($100.00) per month.

property, periods during which (by reason of vacancy or any other cause)
rentals are not received shall not be taken into consideration by the taxpayer.
   (c)   Rentals received by a taxpayer engaged in the business of buying and
selling real estate shall be considered as part of business income.
   (d)   Real property, as the term is used in this Regulation, shall include
commercial property, residential property, farm property, and any and all other
types of real estate.
   (e)   In determining the taxable net income from rentals, the deductible
expenses shall be of the same nature, extent and amount as are allowed by the
Department of Internal Revenue for Federal Income Tax purposes.
   (f)   Residents of North Canton are subject to taxation upon the net income
from rentals (to the extent above specified), regardless of the location of the
real property owned, provided however, that losses for units located outside
the City can be used only to offset income from units located outside the City
and cannot be used to offset income from units located inside the City or any
other business profits irrespective of source.
   (g)   Non-residents of North Canton are subject to such taxation only if the
real property is situated within the City. Non-residents, in determining
whether gross monthly rentals exceed one hundred dollars ($100.00), shall take
into consideration only real estate situated within North Canton.
   (h)   Duties of owners of rental or leased property.
      (1)   For the purposes of this subsection, "tenant" means:
         A.   If there is a written lease or rental agreement, the person or
persons who signs the written lease or rental agreement with the owner.
         B.   If there is an oral lease or rental agreement, the person or
persons with whom the owner enters into the oral lease or rental agreement.

commercial or industrial premises within the corporation limits of North
Canton.
      (4)   Within thirty days after a tenant vacates a rental or leased
residential, commercial or industrial property located within North Canton, the
property owner of such vacated rental or lease property shall file with the
Director of Finance a report showing the date of vacating from the rental or
leased residential, commercial or industrial property and identifying such
vacating tenant.
      (5)   For failure to comply with subsection (h) hereof there shall be
imposed a penalty of fifty dollars ($50.00) for the first offense, one hundred
dollars ($100.00) for the second offense, and two hundred dollars ($200.00) for
third and subsequent offenses.
      (6)   Subsection (h) hereof is in accordance with Ordinance No. 134-78,
effective March 1, 1979.
         (Ord. 145-04.  Passed 11-15-04.)

191.14  RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (a)   Each taxpayer, except as herein provided, shall, whether or not a tax
be due thereon, make and file a return on or before April 15 of the year
following the effective date of this Ordinance, and on or before April 15 of
each year thereafter. When the return is made for a fiscal year or other period

five (105) days from the end of said fiscal year or other period.
   (b)   The return shall be filed with the Director of Finance on a form or
forms furnished or obtainable upon request from the Director of Finance, or on

   (c)   In all returns filed hereunder there shall be set forth the aggregate

due and payable at the time of filing of the said return.
(Ord. 145-04.  Passed 11-15-04.)
   (f)   Upon written request of the taxpayer made on or before the date for
filing the return, and for good cause shown, for tax years prior to 2004, the
Director of Finance may extend the time for filing the annual return for a
period of not more than six months or not more than thirty days beyond any
extension requested of or granted by the Internal Revenue Service for the
filing of the federal income tax return.  For taxable years 2004 and later, the
extended due date for individuals shall be the last day of the month following
the month to which the federal income tax due date has been extended.  For
businesses, if the extension if filed through the Ohio Business Gateway, the

the federal income tax return has been extended.  If not filed through the Ohio
Business Gateway, the extended due date shall be the last day of the month
following the month to which the due date of the federal income tax return has

accompanied by payment of the amount of tax shown to be due thereon by the date
the return is normally due.  No penalty shall be assessed in those cases in
which the return is filed and the final tax paid within the period extended. 
The Director of Finance may deny the extension if the taxpayer’s income tax
account with the City is delinquent in any way.
(Ord. 137-06. Passed 12-11-06.)
   (g)   Consolidated Returns.
      (1)   Any affiliated group which files a consolidated return for federal
income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the Internal Revenue Code may
file a consolidated return with North Canton. However, once the affiliated
group has elected to file a consolidated return or a separate return with North
Canton, the affiliated group may not change their method of filing in any
subsequent tax year without written approval from North Canton.
      (2)   In the case of a corporation that carried on transactions with its
stockholders or with other corporations related by stock ownership,
interlocking directorates or some other method, or in case any person operates
a division, branch, factory, office, laboratory or activity within North Canton
constituting a portion only of its total business, the Director of Finance
shall require such additional information as he deems necessary to ascertain
whether net profits are properly allocated North Canton. If the Director of
Finance finds that the profits are not properly allocated to North Canton by
reason of transactions with stockholders or other corporations related by stock
ownership, interlocking directorates or transactions with such division,
branch, factory, office, laboratory or activity, or by some other method, he
shall make such allocation as he deems appropriate to produce a fair and proper
allocation of net profits to North Canton.
   (h)   Amended Returns.
      (1)   Where necessary, an amended return must be filed in order to report
additional income and pay any additional tax due, or claim a refund of tax
overpaid. Such amended returns shall be on a form obtainable on request from
the Director of Finance. A taxpayer may not change the method of accounting
(i.e., cash or accrual) or apportionment of net profits after the due date for
filing the original return.
      (2)   Within three (3) months from the final determination (whether by
decision of the appropriate taxing authority or a judicial decision) of any
federal, State, or municipal income tax liability affecting the taxpayer's City
tax liability, such taxpayer shall make and file an amended City return showing
income subject to the City tax based upon such final determination of federal,
State, or municipal income tax liability, and pay any additional tax shown due
thereof or make claim for refund of any overpayment.
   (i)   Any business, profession, association or corporation reporting a net
loss is subject to the filing requirements of this ordinance.
   (j)   Trustees of active trusts are required to file returns and pay the tax
on the taxable income thereof.
   (k)   The fact that a taxpayer is not required to file a federal return does
not relieve him from filing a City return.
   (l)   Persons, resident or non-resident, shall not be permitted to offset
any losses derived from business against any wages or payroll earnings outside
of that business.
(Ord. 145-04.  Passed 11-15-04.)
191.15  RECONCILIATION WITH FEDERAL RETURNS.
   (a)   Where figures of total income, total deductions, and net profits are
included, as shown by a federal return, adjustments shall be made for any items
of income and allowable expenses which are not subject to the City tax shall be
eliminated, and for taxable years prior to 2004, net profit items not subject
to federal tax but subject to the City tax shall be included, in determining
net income subject to the City tax.  These adjustments shall be shown in a form
approved by the Director of Finance.
   (b)   The Director of Finance may require additional information at any time
he deems necessary to verify the accuracy of any return.
(Ord. 155-05.  Passed 9-12-06.)
191.16  COLLECTION OF TAX AT SOURCE.
   (a)   It is the duty of each employer (as hereinbefore defined) who employs
one or more persons on a salary, wage, commission, other compensation or other
income basis, to deduct from compensation paid to any employee subject to the
Ordinance, the tax at its then applicable rate from such salary, qualifying
wage, bonus, incentive payment, commission or other compensation or other
income due by said employer to said employee.  The tax shall be deducted by the
employer from:
      (1)   All compensation paid to employees who are non-residents of the
City for services rendered, work performed, or other activities engaged in
within the City; and 
      (2)   From the gross amount of all income, qualifying wages, bonuses,
incentive payments, commissions or other form of compensation paid to employees
who are residents of the City, regardless of the place where the services are
rendered.
      (3)   For taxable years 2004 and later, tax shall be withheld only from
qualifying wages as defined in Section
 191.01(v), with the following adjustments:
         A.   Deduct any amount included in wages if the amount constitutes
compensation attributable to a plan or program described in Section 125 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
         B.   Add any amount not included in wages solely because the employee
was employed by the employer prior to April 1, 1986, and thereby exempt from
the Medicare tax.  The wages shall be taxed as if they were subject to the
Medicare tax.
         C.   Add any amount not included in wages because the amount arises
from the sale, exchange, or other disposition of a stock option, the exercise
of a stock option, or the sale, exchange, or other disposition of stock
purchased under a stock option and the municipal corporation has not, by
resolution or ordinance, exempted the amount from withholding and tax.  This
subsection applies only to those amounts constituting ordinary income. 
Further, an employer is not required to make any withhold with respect to an
individual's disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the
time of the disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of the
corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued.
         D.   Add any amount not included in wages if the amount is an amount
described in Section 401(k) or 457 of the Internal Revenue Code.  This
subsection applies only to employee contributions and employee deferrals.
         E.   Add any amount that is supplemental unemployment compensation
benefits described in Section 3402(o)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code and not
included in wages.
   (b)   All employers who or which maintain an office or other place of
business in North Canton are required to make the collections and deductions in
this section specified, regardless of the fact that the services on account of
which any particular deduction is required as to residents of the City, were
performed at a place of business of any such employer situated outside the
City.
   (c)   The mere fact that the tax is not withheld will not relieve the
employee of the responsibility of filing a return and paying the tax on the
compensation received.  If the employer has withheld the tax and failed to pay
the tax withheld to the Commissioner, the employee is not liable for the tax so
withheld.
   (d)   Commissions and fees paid to professionals, brokers, and others who
are independent contractors and not employees of the payor, are not subject to
withholding or collection of the tax at the source.  Such taxpayers must in all
instances file returns and pay the tax pursuant to the provisions of Section
 191.14 et seq.
   (e)   Where a non-resident receives compensation for personal services
rendered or performed partly within and partly outside North Canton, the
withholding employer shall deduct, withhold and remit that portion of the
compensation which is earned with North Canton in accordance with the following
rules of apportionment:
      (1)   If the non-resident is a salesman, agent or other employee whose
compensation on the basis of commissions depends directly on the volume of
business transacted or chiefly affected by him, the deducting and withholding
shall attach to the portion of the entire compensation which the volume of
business transacted by the employee within the City bears to the total volume
of business transacted by him, except as clarified in Sections
191.04(d) and
191.05(d).
      (2)   The deducting and withhold of personal service compensation of all
other employees (including officers of corporations) shall attach to the
portion of the personal service compensation of such employee which the number
of working days employed within the City bears to the employee's total number
of working days.
      (3)   If it is impossible to apportion the earnings as provided above
because of the nature of the service or the basis of compensation, the
percentage of time worked in North Canton shall be computed on the basis of a
forty-hour week.
   (f)   An employer shall withhold the tax on the full amount of any advances
made to an employee on account of commissions (whether by way of drawing
account or otherwise).
   (g)   For taxable years prior to 2004, an employer required to withhold the
tax on compensation paid to an employee shall, in determining the amount on
which the tax is to be withheld, ignore any amount allowed and paid by the
employer to the employee for expenses necessarily and actually incurred by the
employee in the actual performance of his services, provided that such expenses
are incurred in earning compensation, including commissions, and are not
deducted as business expense by the employee.
   (h)   All employers that provide any contractual service within the City,
and who employ subcontractors in conjunction with that service, shall provide
the City the names and addresses of the subcontractors.  The subcontractors
shall be responsible for all income tax withhold requirements under this
ordinance.
   (i)   All businesses that issue a Federal Form 1099 to any person or entity,
for any contractual service performed within the City, shall notify the City
Income Tax Department of the name and address of such person or entity and the
amount listed on the Federal Form 1099.
(Ord. 39-11.  Passed 4-11-11.)
191.17  RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX WITHHELD.
   (a)   Each employer within the City who employs one or more persons on a
salary, wage, commission, other compensation or other income basis shall
withhold at the time of the payment of such salary, wage, commission, other
compensation or other income, the tax at its applicable rate from salaries,
wages, commissions, other compensation or other income due by the said employer
to the said employee, and the employer shall make a return and pay to the
Director of Finance the amount of taxes so withheld as follows:
      (1)   If the City's Director of Finance determines that the average
monthly amount withheld by the employer for the previous taxable year was three
hundred dollars ($300.00) per month or more, the employer shall remit the
withheld tax on or before the fifteenth day of the month following the month
for which the taxes were withheld. (See subsection (b) hereof.)
      (2)   If the City's Director of Finance determines that average monthly
amount withheld by the employer for the previous taxable year was less than
three hundred dollars ($300.00) per month, the employer shall remit the
withheld tax on or before the last day of each month following the calendar
quarters ending March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31.
   (b)   Any employer required to file monthly may request permission to file
quarterly from the Director of Finance. Such request must be in writing and
state the name and withholding account number of the employer, the address to
which tax documents should be mailed, the estimated amount of tax to be
withheld each quarter, the name and title of the person responsible for
complying with the withholding requirements of the City, and the reason for
requesting quarterly filing. The Director of Finance will notify the employer,
in writing, of the decision made regarding the request. The Director of Finance
shall have the authority to waive the requirement for a written request if the
Director of Finance has independently determined that monthly filings need not
be mandatory for an employer.
   (c)   If more than the amount of tax required to be deducted by the
Ordinance is withheld from an employee's pay, such excess may be refunded by
the employer or Director of Finance, depending upon the following:
      (1)   If a current employee has been over-withheld, the employer may make
the proper adjustments to subsequent withholdings deposited with the City in
the same tax year.
      (2)   If the over-withholding is discovered in the following year, the
employer must notify the Director of Finance of such over-withholding and the
circumstances thereof. Upon proper verification the Director of Finance shall
refund to the employee the amount of such excess withholding.
      (3)   If an employer discovers that a former employee has been over-
withheld, the employer shall notify the Director Finance of the amount and
circumstances of such over-withholding and the Director of Finance shall then
refund to the employee the amount of such excess withholding.
      (4)   If the error is discovered by the employee, such employee shall
file a claim with the Director of Finance and, upon verification thereof by the
employer, the Director of Finance shall refund to the employee the amount of
such excess withholding;
   (d)   If less than the amount of tax required to be deducted by the
Ordinance is withheld from an employee's pay, such deficiency shall be withheld
from subsequent wages. However, if the employee-employer relationship has
terminated, the employer shall notify the Director of Finance of such
deficiency and the reason therefore.
   (e)   Every employer is deemed to be a trustee for the City in collecting
and holding the tax required under the ordinance to be withheld and the funds
so collected by such withholding are deemed to be trust funds.
   (f)   Every such employer required to deduct and withhold the tax at the
source is liable directly to North Canton for payment of such tax whether
actually collected from such employee or not.
   (g)   On or before the 31st day of January, following any calendar year in
which such deductions have been made by any employer, such employer shall file
with the Director of Finance, in the form prescribed by the Director of
Finance, an information return for each employee from whom North Canton income
tax has been withheld, showing the name, address, social security number of the
employee, Medicare wages, and the amount of North Canton income tax withheld
from such employee.
      (1)   For the convenience of employers, the information return may be
made in one of two ways at the election of each employer, as follows:
         A.   Those employers using Form W-2 furnished commercially may submit
a copy of such commercial Form W-2, providing the copy furnished the City
clearly shows the information required in paragraph immediately preceding.
         B.   Where the furnishing of this information is above indicated will
create a distinct hardship the employer, upon written request to the Director
of Finance, may be permitted to furnish an alphabetized list of all employees
subject to the tax, which list shall show the employee's full name, last known
address, social security number, Medicare wages, and the amount of North Canton
income tax withheld. Such list may be compiled on any mechanical equipment
presently used by the employer, but provision must be made for spacing equal to
at least three lines between each name. The employer's name must be indicated
on each sheet, each sheet must be numbered and the total number of sheets
comprising the complete report indicated on the first page.
      (2)   The gross compensation to be reported for each employee shall be
for the full twelve (12) calendar months of the year or such portion thereof as
the employee reported on was employed.
   (h)   It is the responsibility of each employer to provide copies to the
City of Federal Form 1099, or such other form used to report commissions, fees,
and other compensation paid to nonemployees. 
(Ord. 145-04.  Passed 11-15-04.)

taxpayer who was not domiciled in the City on the first day of January in the
year in which they became subject to estimated payments.
      (2)   No penalties or interest shall be assessed on estimated payments if

twelve-month period, or if ninety percent (90%) of the actual liability has
been received.
   (c)   Those taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a
declaration within 105 days after the beginning of each fiscal year or period.

the tax due. Such authorization shall not be granted until proper returns are
filed by the taxpayer for all amounts owed by him under the ordinance.
      (5)   Failure to make any deferred payment when due shall cause the total

      (1)   Employers and other taxpayers subject to the tax under the
Ordinance are required to keep such records as will enable the filing of true
and accurate returns, whether of taxes withheld at source or of taxes payable
upon income or net profits, or both, and such records are to be preserved to
enable the Director of Finance or any agent or employee of the Director of
Finance to verify the correctness of the returns filed. Such records shall be
kept for a period of six (6) years.
         (Ord. 145-04.  Passed 11-15-04.)
191.22  INTEREST AND PENALTIES.
   (a)   Interest:   All taxes imposed by this chapter and all monies withheld,
or required to be withheld, by employers under the provisions of this ordinance
and remaining unpaid after they have become due shall bear interest, in
addition to the amount of the unpaid tax or withholdings, at the rate of one-
half of one percent (½%) per month.
   (b)   Penalties: In addition to interest as provided in paragraph (a)
hereof, penalties based on the unpaid tax are hereby imposed as follows:
      (1)   For failure to pay taxes due, other than taxes withheld: one-half
percent (½%) per month or fraction of a month.  (No limit).
      (2)   For failure to remit taxes withheld from employees: three percent
(3%) per month or fraction of a month.
      (3)   In case of taxpayer failing to file returns when due and who is not
otherwise exempt from filing requirements: a civil penalty of fifty dollars
($50.00) for the first instance and one hundred dollars ($100.00) for each
subsequent instance, for failure-to-file violation.  Interest on an unpaid
civil penalty shall accrue at the rate of one-half (½%) per month. (No limit)
   (c)   Exceptions:
      (1)   No penalty shall be assessed on additional taxes found on audit to
be due when a return was timely filed in good faith and the tax paid thereon
within the prescribed time.
      (2)   In the absence of fraud neither penalty nor interest shall be
assessed on any additional taxes resulting from a federal audit for federal
income tax purposes provided an amended return is filed and the additional tax
paid within three (3) months after final determination of the federal tax
liability.
      (3)   A taxpayer or employer shall have thirty (30) days after receipt of
notice of any proposed imposition of interest and penalties within which to
file a written protest or explanation with the Director of Finance. If no
protest or explanation is filed within the prescribed time, the proposed
imposition of interest and penalties shall become and be the final assessment.
Upon filing of a written protest or explanation, the Director of Finance shall
determine the assessment which may or may not be the same as the proposed
assessment.  (Ord. 62-13.  Passed 10-14-13.)
191.23  COLLECTION OF UNPAID TAXES AND LIABILITIES; REFUND OF OVERPAYMENT.
   (a)   Unpaid Amounts:
      (1)   All taxes imposed by the Ordinance remaining unpaid when the same
have become due, together with all interest and penalties thereon, become a
debt due the City from the taxpayer, and are recoverable as other debts by suit
instituted by the City Law Director. Employers who or which fail to withhold
and/or remit taxes required to be withheld at the source (Section
191.16), become liable to the City in a civil action to enforce the payment of
the debt created by such failure.
      (2)   Except in the case of fraud, omission of twenty-five percent (25%)
or more of income subject to this tax, or failure to file a return, all
additional assessments shall be made and all civil actions to recover North
Canton income taxes and penalties, interest and non-filing or late fees
thereon, shall be brought within three years after the tax was due or the
return was filed, whichever is later. In the case of fraud, omission of twenty-
five percent (25%) or more of income subject to this tax, or failure to file a
return, all additional assessments shall be made and all prosecutions to
recover North Canton income taxes and penalties and interest thereon shall be
brought within six (6) years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later.
      (3)   Employers who withhold taxes at the source although not obligated
by the terms of this ordinance are obligated to report and remit the taxes so
withheld and become liable to the City in a civil action to enforce payment of
the debt created by the failure to report and remit.
      (4)   The officers or the employees having control or supervision of or
charged with the responsibility of filing the report and making payment are
personally liable for failure to file the report or pay the tax due as
required. The dissolution, bankruptcy, or reorganization of a corporation,
association, or other entity does not discharge an officer's or employee's
liability for a prior failure of the corporation, association, or other entity
to file returns or pay tax due.
      (5)   When in the opinion of the Director of Finance, an income tax
account, which is at least seven years delinquent from the date said tax was
due, and cannot reasonably be anticipated to be collected, the said Director of
Finance may thereafter write off that account, and remove that delinquent
account from the ledger of the city's accounts receivable.
   (b)   Refunds and Overpayments:
      (1)   Taxes erroneously paid shall not be refunded unless a claim for
refund is made within three (3) years from the date on which such payment was
made, or the return was due, or three (3) months after the determination of the
Federal income tax liability, whichever is later. However, the following shall
apply regarding refunds of tax withheld from nonqualified deferred compensation
plans (NDCP):
         A.   A taxpayer may be eligible for a refund if the taxpayer has
suffered a loss from a NDCP. The loss will be considered sustained only in the
taxable year in which the  taxpayer receives the final distribution of money
and property pursuant to the NDCP. Full loss is sustained if no distribution of
money and property will be made by the NDCP.
         B.   A taxpayer who receives income as a result of payments from a
NDCP, and that income is less than the amount of income deferred to the NDCP
and upon which municipal tax was withheld, then a refund will be issued on the
amount representing the difference between the deferred income that was taxed
and the income received from the NDCP. If different tax rates applied to the
tax years in which deferrals, a weighted average of the different tax rates
will be used to compute the refund amount.
         C.   Refunds shall be allowed only if the. loss is attributable to the
bankruptcy of the employer who had established the NDCP, or the employee's
failure or inability to satisfy all of the employer's terms and conditions
necessary to receive the nonqualified compensation.
      (2)   No refund shall be made to any taxpayer until he has complied with
all provisions of the Ordinance and has furnished all information required by
the Director of Finance.
      (3)   Overpayments will be either refunded, or credited to the taxpayer's
current year's liability, at his option. Where no election has been made,
overpayments of any year's taxes shall be applied as follows:
         A.   To unpaid penalty and interest assessments.
         B.   To the taxes owed for any previous year in the order in which
such taxes became due.
         C.   To his current estimated tax liability.
      (4)   Refunds for days worked out of North Canton are available only to
non- residents, and refunds shall be computed by dividing total wages by total
days worked in order to determine an average daily wage. The work year shall be
considered two hundred sixty (260) days. Saturdays and Sundays shall not
normally be considered work days. Wage continuation plans of any type
(including, but not limited to, vacation days, holidays, personal days, and
sick days) are deemed to be days spent in North Canton for purposes of the
refund calculation. Additions, deletions, or other changes to the method for
calculating refunds shall be at the discretion of the Director of Finance.
      (5)   Amounts of less than two dollars ($2.00) shall not be refunded or
assessed.
      (6)   Income tax that has been deposited with North Canton, but should
have been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by North Canton as
a refund but is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds: Income tax
that should have been deposited with North Canton, but was deposited with
another municipality, shall be subject to recovery by North Canton. North
Canton will allow a non-refundable credit for any amount owed North Canton that
is in excess of the amount to be refunded by the other municipality, as long as
the tax rate of the other municipality is the same or higher than North
Canton's tax rate. If North Canton's tax rate is higher, the tax representing
the net difference of the rates is also subject to collection by North Canton.

collection, administration and enforcement of the entire tax imposed by this
Ordinance.

   The income tax levied by North Canton at a rate of one and one-half percent
(1.5%) is levied on the Municipal Taxable Income of every person residing in
and/or earning and/or receiving income in North Canton. 
Individuals.
   (A)    For residents of North Canton, the income tax levied herein shall be
on all income, salaries, qualifying wages, commissions, and other compensation
from whatever source earned or received by the resident, including the
resident's distributive share of the net profit of pass-through entities owned
directly or indirectly by the resident and any net profit of the resident. 
This is further detailed in the definition of income (Section
192.02 (C)(16)).
   (B)     For nonresidents, all income, salaries, qualifying wages,
commissions, and other compensation from whatever source earned or received by
the nonresident for work done, services performed or rendered, or activities
conducted in the municipal corporation, including any net profit of the
nonresident, but excluding the nonresident's distributive share of the net
profit or loss of only pass-through entities owned directly or indirectly by
the nonresident.
     (C)    For residents and nonresidents, income can be reduced to "Municipal
Taxable Income" as defined in Section
192.02 (C)(21).  Exemptions which may apply are specified in Section

Code.
                 (b)    "Qualifying loss" means the amount of compensation
attributable to a taxpayer's nonqualified deferred compensation plan, less the
receipt of money and property attributable to distributions from the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.  Full loss is sustained if no
distribution of money and property is made by the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan. The taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable
year in which the taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and
property pursuant to that nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
               (c)   (i)    "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate
for the taxable year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to North Canton
with respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of
which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
                      (ii)    If different tax rates applied for different

different tax rates. The weighted average shall be based upon the tax paid to
North Canton each year with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
               (d)    "Refundable credit" means the amount of North Canton
income tax that was paid on the non-distributed portion, if any, of a

compensation plan, the amount of the credit that a taxpayer may claim from each
municipal corporation shall be calculated on the basis of each municipal
corporation's proportionate share of the total municipal corporation income tax
paid by the taxpayer to all municipal corporations with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
          (3)    In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to North
Canton for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
          (4)    The credit allowed under this division is allowed only to the

established the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
                  (b)   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of
the employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified
deferred compensation.
Domicile.
   (E)   (1)   (a)    An individual is presumed to be domiciled in North Canton
for all or part of a taxable year if the individual was domiciled in North

described in division (E)(1)(a) of this section if the individual establishes
by a preponderance of the evidence that the individual was not domiciled in
North Canton for all or part of the taxable year.

claimed a property tax exemption or reduction allowed on the basis of the
individual's residence or domicile;
                   (e)    The location and value of abodes owned or leased by
the individual;
                   (f)    Declarations, written or oral, made by the individual

on the residency of the individual or the individual's spouse in the municipal
corporation where the educational institution is located;
                   (i)    The number of contact periods the individual has with
North Canton. For the purposes of this division, an individual has one "contact
period" with North Canton if the individual is away overnight from the
individual's abode located outside of North Canton and while away overnight
from that abode spends at least some portion, however minimal, of each of two
consecutive days in North Canton. 
          (3)     All additional applicable factors are provided in the Rules
and Regulations. 
Businesses.
   (F)    This division applies to any taxpayer engaged in a business or
profession in North Canton, unless the taxpayer is an individual who resides in

          (1)    Except as otherwise provided in division (F)(2) of this
section, net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of North Canton shall be considered as having a taxable
situs in North Canton for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same
proportion as the average ratio of the following:
           (a)    The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in North Canton during the taxable period to the average original cost of all
of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
                 (b)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the
taxable period to individuals employed in the business or profession for
services performed in North Canton to wages, salaries, and other compensation
paid during the same period to individuals employed in the business or
profession, wherever the individual's services are performed, excluding
compensation from which taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
192.04 (C);
                 (c)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from
sales and rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in
North Canton to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
          (2)   (a)    If the apportionment factors described in division (F)
(1) of this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business
activity in North Canton, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of
North Canton may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
            (i)    Separate accounting;
            (ii)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
            (iii)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
            (iv)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
         (b)    A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section
192.12 (A).
                 (c)    The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (F)(2)(a) of this
section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period
prescribed by Section
192.12 (A).
                 (d)    Nothing in division (F)(2) of this section nullifies or
otherwise affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by the Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
      (3)    As used in division (F)(1)(b) of this section, "wages, salaries,
and other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation
paid to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
                 (a)    A location that is owned, controlled, or used by,
rented to, or under the possession of one of the following:

            (ii)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or
a related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
            (iii)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person
described in (F)(3)(a)(ii) of this section, or a related member of such a
vendor, customer, client, or patient.
                 (b)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing,
investigation, inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative,
judicial, or legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that
the compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the
employer or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly
benefits the employer;
                 (c)    Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines
that the employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other
location in lieu of a location described in division (F) (3)(a) or (b) of this
section solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax
liability. If the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer
may dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the
evidence, that the Tax Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
          (4)    For the purposes of division (F)(1)(c) of this section,
receipts from sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to
a municipal corporation as follows:
                 (a)    Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation only if, regardless of

            (i)    The property is shipped to or delivered within North Canton
from a stock of goods located within North Canton.
            (ii)   The property is delivered within North Canton from a
location outside North Canton, provided the taxpayer is regularly engaged
through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within
North Canton and the sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
         (b)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to
North Canton to the extent that such services are performed in North Canton.

which the tangible personal property is used in North Canton.
          (5)    The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the
rental of real estate owned directly by the individual, or by a disregarded
entity owned by the individual, shall be subject to North Canton's tax only if
the property generating the net profit is located in North Canton or if the
individual taxpayer that receives the net profit is a resident of North
Canton.  North Canton shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate
accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this
division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
          (6)   (a)    Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker
relating to the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported
by the real estate agent or broker shall be allocated to North Canton, if
applicable, based upon the ratio of the commissions the agent or broker
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate located in North
Canton to the commissions received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real
estate everywhere in the taxable year.
                 (b)    An individual who is a resident of North Canton shall

income tax ordinance.

this section for the purposes of that division or division (F)(2) of this
section, the owner of a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios

   (A)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or doing
business in North Canton shall withhold an income tax from the qualifying wages
earned and/or received by each employee in North Canton.  Except for qualifying
wages for which withholding is not required under Section
192.03 or division (B)(4) or (6) of this section, the tax shall be withheld at
the rate, specified in Section
192.01 (B)(1) of this ordinance, of 1.5%.  An employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from qualifying wages on the
date that the employer, agent, or other payer directly, indirectly, or
constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the qualifying wages to
the benefit of, the employee.
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (B)(2) of this section, an
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to the Tax
Administrator of North Canton the greater of the income taxes deducted and
withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld by the
employer, agent, or other payer according to the following schedule:
         (a)    Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of North Canton in the preceding calendar year exceeded $2,399, or if
the total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and
withheld on behalf of North Canton in any month of the preceding calendar
quarter exceeded $200.
Payment under division (B)(1)(a) of this section shall be made to the Tax
Administrator not later than 15 days after the last day of each month for which
the tax was withheld.
         (b)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (B)(1)(a) of this section of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the last day of the month following the last day of each
calendar quarter.
                   (c)     Intentionally left blank.
          (2)    If the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is
required to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal
taxes withheld on payments to employees under Section 6302 of the Internal
Revenue Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation,
the payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator
of all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of North Canton. The payment of
tax by electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect an
employer's, agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as required
under this section.
        (3)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by  Tax Administrator and North Canton as the return
required of an non-resident employee whose sole income subject to the tax under
this ordinance is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer.
          (4)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not
required to withhold North Canton income tax with respect to an individual's
disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the
disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the
corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such
corporation's successor entity.
          (5)   (a)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by
the failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold
the tax as required under this ordinance or by the employer's, agent's, or
other payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         (b)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer to remit to North Canton the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
          (6)     Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to
North Canton income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent the
deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the
deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
          (7)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required
to withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for North Canton until such time as the withheld
amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
          (8)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an
employer shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax
Administrator listing:
                 (a)    The names, addresses, and social security numbers of
all employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for North Canton during the preceding calendar year;

employee, the total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the
preceding calendar year;
                 (c)    The name of every other municipal corporation for which
tax was withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the
preceding calendar year;
                 (d)    Any other information required for federal income tax
reporting purposes on Internal Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form
with respect to such employee;
                 (e)    Other information as may be required by the Tax
Administrator.
          (9)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an
employer, or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with
the responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
          (10)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold North Canton
income tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and
constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and
gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this division,
a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is
paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee,
or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or
other electronic means.
          (11)    The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this ordinance, to be tax required to be withheld and
remitted for the purposes of this section

ordinary basis. If the employee is not required to report for employment duties
on a regular and ordinary basis to a fixed location, "principal place of work"
means the worksite location in this state to which the employee is required to

If there is not a single municipal corporation in which the employee spent the
"greatest number of days in a calendar year" performing services for or on
behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (C)(2)(a)(i) of this section among those two or more
municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends a
particular day shall be determined in accordance with division (C)(2)(b) of
this section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal
corporation" wherever "municipal corporation" appears in that division.

                 (g)    "Worksite location" means a construction site or other
temporary worksite in this state at which the employer provides services for
more than 20 days during the calendar year. "Worksite location" does not
include the home of an employee.
          (2)   (a)    Subject to divisions (C)(3), (5), (6), and (7) of this
section, an employer is not required to withhold North Canton income tax on
qualifying wages paid to an employee for the performance of personal services
in North Canton if the employee performed such services in North Canton on 20
or fewer days in a calendar year, unless one of the following conditions
applies:
            (i)    The employee's principal place of work is located in North
Canton.
            (ii)    The employee performed services at one or more presumed
worksite locations in North Canton. For the purposes of this division,
"presumed worksite location" means a construction site or other temporary
worksite in North Canton at which the employer provides or provided services
that can reasonably be, or would have been, expected by the employer to last
more than 20 days in a calendar year. Services can "reasonably be expected by

the time the services commence:
               (a)    The nature of the services are such that it will require
more than 20 days of the services to complete the services;
                     (b)    The agreement between the employer and its customer

            (iv)    The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure.
                 (b)    For the purposes of division (C)(2)(a) of this section,
an employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in
North Canton only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in North Canton than in any other municipal corporation
on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount of time an employee

            (v)    Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the

          (3)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in
another Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception
from withholding requirements described in division (C)(2)(a) of this section

wages to that municipal corporation.
          (4)   (a)    Except as provided in division (C)(4)(b) of this

to the employee for personal services performed in North Canton.
          (5)    If an employer's fixed location is North Canton and the
employer qualifies as a small employer as defined in Section
192.02, the employer shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the
employee's qualifying wages for a taxable year and remit that tax only to North

          (6)    Divisions (C)(2)(a) and (4) of this section shall not apply to
the extent that the Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section

192.05  ANNUAL RETURN; FILING.
   (A)    An annual North Canton income tax return shall be completed and filed
by every individual taxpayer eighteen (18) years of age or older and any
taxpayer that is not an individual for each taxable year for which
          (1)     The Tax Administrator may accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer under Section
192.04 of this Ordinance when the nonresident individual taxpayer's sole income
subject to the tax is the qualifying wages reported by the employer, agent of
an employer, or other payer, and no additional tax is due North Canton.
          (2)     Individual taxpayers having no Municipal Taxable Income for
North Canton income tax purposes may file with the Tax Administrator an
exemption from these filing requirements by a method prescribed by the Tax
Administrator.  The exemption shall indicate the reason the income should be
considered exempt, and the date by which the exemption should be effective. 
The exemption shall be in effect until such time as the individual taxpayer
receives Municipal Taxable Income taxable to the North Canton, at which time
the individual taxpayer shall be required to comply with all applicable
provisions of this ordinance.
   (B)    If an individual is deceased, any return or notice required of that
individual shall be completed and filed by that decedent's executor,
administrator, or other person charged with the property of that decedent.
   (C)    If an individual is unable to complete and file a return or notice
required by North Canton, the return or notice required of that individual

include the taxpayer's social security number or taxpayer identification
number. Each return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of
perjury.
            (2)    The Tax Administrator shall require a taxpayer who is an
individual to include, with each annual return, and amended return, copies of
the following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form W-
2, "Wage and Tax Statements," including all information reported on the
taxpayer's federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or withheld for any
municipal corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1040; and,
with respect to an amended tax return, any other documentation necessary to
support the adjustments made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer who
files the annual return required by this section electronically is not required
to provide paper copies of any of the foregoing to the Tax Administrator unless
the Tax Administrator requests such copies after the return has been filed.
      (3)    The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer that is not an
individual to include, with each annual net profit return, amended net profit
return, or request for refund required under this section, copies of only the
following documents: the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form

to an amended tax return or refund request, any other documentation necessary
to support the refund request or the adjustments made in the amended return.
A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net profit return
electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in some other manner shall
either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax Administrator
at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available, submit the
documents electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway.
            (4)    After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator
may request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by North Canton to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
   (G)   (1)   (a)    Except as otherwise provided in this ordinance, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under division
(G) of Section 5747.08 of the ORC. The taxpayer shall complete and file the

forms, together with remittance made payable to North Canton. No remittance is
required if the net amount due is ten dollars or less.
                (b)     Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
annual net profit return required to be filed under this section by a taxpayer
that is not an individual shall be completed and filed as required by the Tax
Administrator on or before the fifteenth day (15th) of the fourth month
following the end of the taxpayer's taxable year.  The taxpayer shall complete
and file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or

          (2)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of North Canton's income tax
return. The extended due date of North Canton's income tax return shall be the
15th day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to which the
return relates. An extension of time to file under this division is not an
extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an
extension of that date.
                 (a)    A copy of the federal extension request shall be
included with the filing of North Canton's income tax return.
                 (b)     A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-
month extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may submit
a written request that the Tax Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month
extension of the date for filing the taxpayer's North Canton income tax
return.  If the request is received by the Tax Administrator on or before the
date the North Canton income tax return is due, the Tax Administrator shall
grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
          (3)    If the tax commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of Section 5747.08 of the
ORC, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a
North Canton's income tax return. The extended due date of North Canton's
income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state
income tax return.
          (4)    If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to
ensure the payment of the tax imposed by North Canton, the Tax Administrator
may require taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as
provided in this division, including taxpayers not otherwise required to file
annual returns.
          (5)    To the extent that any provision in this division (G) of this
section conflicts with any provision in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) of this
section, the provisions in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) prevail.
   (H)   (1)    For taxable years beginning after 2015, North Canton shall not
require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the net amount
due is ten dollars or less.
            (2)    Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to North Canton for a
taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with North
Canton an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) of this section.
   (I)    If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer, the
payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. This division shall not
apply to payments required to be made under division (B)(1)(a) of Section
192.04 or provisions for semi-monthly withholding.
   (J)    Taxes withheld for the North Canton by an employer, the agent of an
employer, or other payer as described in Section
192.04 shall be allowed to the taxpayer as credits against payment of the tax
imposed on the taxpayer by North Canton, unless the amounts withheld were not
remitted to North Canton and the recipient colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by North Canton to be filed in accordance with
this division shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of any
income tax return, report, or document required by North Canton, provided that
the generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the information
required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted by North
Canton or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return
preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this
ordinance and of North Canton's ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations
governing the filing of returns, reports, or documents.
Filing via Ohio Business Gateway.
   (M)   (1)    Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect
to the taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file North
Canton's income tax return, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension
for filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown
to be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
            (2)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may
report the amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and
may make remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
          (3)    Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing
employer withholding tax returns.
Extension for service in or for the armed forces.
   (N)    Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the president of the United
States or an act of the congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of North Canton
for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an extension of time
for payment of taxes required by North Canton during the period of the member's
or civilian's duty service, and for 180 days thereafter. The application shall
be filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after the member's or
civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax
Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (O)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the 181st day after the applicant's active duty or
service terminates. The Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms as
the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.  However, taxes pursuant to a
contract entered into under this division are not delinquent, and the Tax
Administrator shall not require any payments of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. 
      (2)    If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the North Canton before the 181st day after the applicant's
active duty or service terminates.
          (3)     Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under (O)(1)
of this division are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require
any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period. 
   (P)   (1)    Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (N) and (O) of this section.
          (2)   (a)    A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension
under the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in
which to file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of
time in which to make any payment of taxes required by North Canton in
accordance with this ordinance. The length of any extension granted under
division (P)(2)(a) of this section shall be equal to the length of the
corresponding extension that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue
Code. As used in this division, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the
national guard or a member of a reserve component of the armed forces of the
United States called to active duty pursuant to either an executive order
issued by the president of the United States or an act of the congress of the
United States, or a civilian serving as support personnel in a combat zone or
contingency operation in support of the armed forces.
                 (b)    Taxes whose payment is extended in accordance with
division (P)(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension
period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (Q)    For each taxable year to which division (N), (O), or (P) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (O)(2) and (3) of
this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the filing
status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that year.

   (R)    As used in this section:
          (1)    "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group
as defined in Section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a

carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
          (2)    "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated

(1) of this section.
            (4)    "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as
in Section 4927.01 of the ORC.
          (5)    "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
Section 5727.01 of the ORC.
   (S)   (1)    For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to North Canton's
income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with the first
taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting method is
required under federal law. The election continues to be binding for each
subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing
consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (S)(2) of this section
or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The Tax
Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown. 
          (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal
income tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following
the last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (S)(1) of this section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a
five-year period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
          (3)    An election made under division (S)(1) or (2) of this section
is binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
          (4)   When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under section 718.80
of the Revised Code, a valid election made by a taxpayer under division (S)(1)
or (2) of this section is binding upon the tax commissioner for the remainder
of the five-year period.
      (5)    When an election is made under section 718.80 of the Revised Code
is terminated, a valid election made under section 718.86 of the Revised Code
is binding upon the tax administrator for the remainder of the five-year
period.
   (T)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated North Canton income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to North Canton. A taxpayer that is required to file
a consolidated North Canton income tax return  for a taxable year shall file a
consolidated North Canton income tax return for all subsequent taxable years,
unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from the Tax
Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a change
in circumstances.

return in the same manner as is required under the United States department of

consolidated federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (V)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (V)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
192.02,  by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income" for "federal
taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
          (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated North Canton income tax
return shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section
192.02 (C)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
          (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at
least eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated North Canton income tax
return shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's
net profit or loss for that taxable year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
192.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to North
Canton. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the entity shall be
subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net
profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
192.05, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to North
Canton. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the entity shall not
be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net
profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the
affiliated group.
          (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
192.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to North
Canton;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to North Canton income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this ordinance on the basis
of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (W)    Corporations filing a consolidated North Canton income tax return
shall make the computations required under divisions (R) through (Y) of Section
192.05 by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (X)    Each corporation filing a consolidated North Canton income tax return
is jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines,
charges, or other amounts imposed by North Canton in accordance with this
ordinance on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (Y)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with North Canton before January 1, 2016, to file a
consolidated or combined tax return with North Canton may continue to file
consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such election or
agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

   (A)    Every individual taxpayer domiciled in North Canton who is required
to and does pay, or has acknowledged liability for, a municipal tax to another
municipality on or measured by the same income, qualifying wages, commissions,
net profits or other compensation taxable under this ordinance may claim a
nonrefundable credit upon satisfactory evidence of the tax paid to the other
municipality.  Subject to division (C) of this section, the credit shall not
exceed the tax due North Canton under this ordinance. 
   (B)     North Canton shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a
resident of North Canton who works in a joint economic development zone created
under Section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
Section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the ORC to the same extent that it grants
a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in another
municipal corporation.
   (C)     If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other
municipality, then for purposes of division (A) of this section, "the income,
qualifying wages, commissions, net profits or other compensation" subject to
tax in the other municipality shall be limited to the amount computed by
dividing the tax withheld or paid to the other municipality by the tax rate for
that municipality.

   (B)   (1)    Every taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for
the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least $200. For the purposes of
this section:
         (a)    Taxes withheld for North Canton from qualifying wages shall be
considered as paid to the North Canton in equal amounts on each payment date
unless the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all amounts were actually
withheld, in which case they shall be considered as paid on the dates on which
the amounts were actually withheld.

          (4)    Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a
declaration on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after the
beginning of each fiscal year or period.
          (5)    The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
   (C)   (1)    The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to North Canton,
including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and withholding on
or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half (22.5) percent of
the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the sixth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, forty-five (45) percent of the tax liability
for the taxable year;
         (c)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the ninth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half (67.5) percent of
the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (d)    For an individual, on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the
first month of the following taxable year, ninety percent (90%) of the tax
liability for the taxable year.  For a person other than an individual, on or
before the fifteenth (15th) day of the twelfth month of the taxable year,
ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the taxable year.
          (2)    When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid balance
shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal installments on or
before the remaining payment dates.
          (3)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month of
the year following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was
filed, an annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall
be paid with the return in accordance with Section
192.05.
   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
192.18 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (E) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent (22.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
percent (45%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;

percent (90%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date

          (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
          (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
          (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
one hundred percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer
for the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
North Canton under Section
192.05 for that year.
          (3)    The taxpayer is an individual who resides in North Canton but
was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.
         (Ord. 101-2017.  Passed 12-4-17.)
192.08  ROUNDING OF AMOUNTS.
   A person may round to the nearest whole dollar all amounts the person is
required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document required
under this ordinance. Any fractional part of a dollar that equals or exceeds
fifty cents shall be rounded to the next whole dollar, and any fractional part
of a dollar that is less than fifty cents shall be dropped. If a person chooses
to round amounts entered on a document, the person shall round all amounts
entered on the document. 
(Ord. 62-2015.  Passed 11-9-15.)
192.09  REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS.
   (A)    As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in
Section
192.18.
   (B)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator, in
accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax
levied by North Canton:
      (1)    Overpayments of ten dollars or more;
      (2)    Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested is ten dollars or
more.
   (C)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this ordinance, requests for
refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator within three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever
is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file with the
request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for a
refund.
      (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount for payment. Except
as provided in division (C)(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator shall
issue an assessment to any taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or
partially denied. The assessment shall state the amount of the refund that was
denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for appealing the
assessment.
      (3)    If the Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund
request included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax
return, the Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the
amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and
instructions for requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
192.21.
   (D)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (C) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)    The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)    The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)    The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (E)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in Section
192.18 (A)(4). 
(Ord. 62-2015.  Passed 11-9-15.)
192.10  SECOND MUNICIPALITY IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR REFUND.
   (A)    Income tax that has been deposited with North Canton, but should have
been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by North Canton as a
refund but is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds.
   (B)    Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with North Canton is subject to recovery by North Canton. 
If North Canton's tax on that income is imposed after the time period allowed
for a refund of the tax or withholding paid to the other municipality, North
Canton shall allow a nonrefundable credit against the tax or withholding North
Canton claims is due with respect to such income or wages, equal to the tax or
withholding paid to the first municipality with respect to such income or
wages. 
   (C)    If North Canton's tax rate is less than the tax rate in the other
municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using North
Canton's tax rate.  However, if North Canton's tax rate is greater than the tax
rate in the other municipality, the tax due in excess of the nonrefundable
credit is to be paid to North Canton, along with any penalty and interest that
accrued during the period of nonpayment.
   (D)    Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.
(Ord. 62-2015.  Passed 11-9-15.)
192.11  AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   (1)    If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return
for North Canton changes as a result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's federal
or state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with
North Canton. The amended return shall be filed on a form required by the Tax
Administrator.
      (2)    If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed return
that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:
         (i)    to determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,
         (ii)    if the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
192.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)    The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (C)   (1)    In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (D) of this
section for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is in accordance with the dollars,
no refund need be paid by North Canton. A request filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in Section
192.09.
      (2)    The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.  All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.
   (D)    Within 60 days after the final determination of any federal or state
tax liability affecting the taxpayer's North Canton's tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended North Canton return showing income
subject to North Canton income tax based upon such final determination of
federal or state tax liability. The taxpayer shall pay any additional North
Canton income tax shown due thereon or make a claim for refund of any
overpayment, unless the tax or overpayment is less than ten dollars.
(Ord. 62-2015.  Passed 11-9-15.)
192.12  LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)    Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
later of:
            (i)    Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)    One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)    The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)    As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)    Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
192.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)    Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which
the final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Board of Tax Review, the sixtieth
day after the date on which the final determination of the Board of Tax Review
is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately reversed and no
further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part, or that
reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
192.09.
   (D)   (1)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by North Canton does not prejudice any
claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)    If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio board
of tax appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio board of tax
appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section
192.09, with interest on that amount as provided by division (E) of Section
192.09.
   (E)    No civil action to recover North Canton income tax or related
penalties or interest shall be brought during either of the following time
periods:
      (1)    The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)    The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of
that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 62-2015.  Passed 11-9-15.)
192.13  AUDITS.
   (A)    At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator
shall provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (B)    Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)    At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (D)    A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)    The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)    If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest. 
(Ord. 62-2015.  Passed 11-9-15.)
192.14  SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator has
at the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC.
      (2)    "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC is
not able to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the
reason for non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept
the assessment.
   (B)    Subject to division (C) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC.  With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
   (C)   (1)   (a)    If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a
new last known address, including the use of a change of address service
offered by the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Section
5703.056 of the ORC. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last
known address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered
served. If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an
undeliverable address, the assessment remains appealable within 60 days after
the assessment's postmark.
         (b)    Once the Tax Administrator or other North Canton official, or
the designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the
assessment is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by
filing an appeal with the local board of tax review within 60 days after the
receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator
under division (C)(1)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence that delivery
is complete and that the assessment is served.
      (2)    If mailing of an assessment by the Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
"This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable law
ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator as
shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the mailing
of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the assessment was
completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the assessment by ordinary
mail and that the assessment was served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)(1)(a) of this
section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under
this division in accordance with division (D) of this section.
   (D)   (1)    A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service
under division (C) of this section bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent
by certified mail was not an address with which the person was associated at
the time the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the
purposes of this section, a person is associated with an address at the time
the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the
person was residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the
address; or if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the
address and, when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's
affiliate was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this
section, a person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the
assessment was mailed, owned or controlled at least 20 percent, as determined
by voting rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (D)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within  60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other North Canton
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the local board of tax review.
   (E)    Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by personal service.
   (F)    Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (G)    Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 62-2015.  Passed 11-9-15.)
192.15  ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (A)    As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to North Canton that arises pursuant to North Canton's income tax imposed in
accordance with this ordinance.
   (B)    Nothing in this ordinance prohibits the Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of North
Canton:
      (1)    Compromise a claim;
      (2)    Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due. 
(Ord. 62-2015.  Passed 11-9-15.)
192.16  TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this ordinance is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of North Canton as
authorized by this ordinance. The Tax Administrator or a designee thereof may
furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this ordinance and
other related tax information to the internal revenue service, the tax
commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit North Canton from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 62-2015.  Passed 11-9-15.)
192.17  FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by North Canton ordinance or state
law to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure, counsel, or
advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return, schedule,
statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend, or
knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment of
the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud North Canton or the Tax Administrator.

          (5)    "Return" includes any tax return, report, reconciliation,

taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016;
         (b)    Income tax, estimated income tax, and withholding tax required

to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or

this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee

195.01  INVESTMENT POLICY.
   (a)   The achievement of good fiscal management for the City requires
effective cash  management of non-immediate funds which in turn depends on
effective bank  management practices with respect to the investment and deposit
of these funds.
   (b)   The following investment and deposit objectives shall be applied in
the  management of the City's funds:
      (1)   The primary objective of the City's investment activities is the
preservation of capital and the protection of investment principal.
      (2)   Those responsible for investing the City's public funds shall
strive to maximize the return on the portfolio, but shall avoid assuming
unreasonable investment risks.
      (3)   The City's investment portfolio shall remain sufficiently liquid to
enable the City to meet operating requirements which might reasonably be
anticipated.
      (4)   The City’s investments shall be diversified to avoid the assumption
of unreasonable and avoidable risks associated with specific types of
securities or individual financial institutions.
      (5)   Investments shall be made with the exercise of that degree of
judgment and care, under circumstances then prevailing, which persons of
prudence, discretion and intelligence exercise in the management of their own
affairs, not for speculation, but for investment, considering the probable
safety of their capital as well as the probable income to be derived.
      (6)   A factor in determining which depository should hold the City's
public funds shall be the City's desire to obtain the best possible banking
services at the least possible cost.
   (c)   All active City deposits shall be concentrated in one central
depository in order to provide the City with greater leverage in obtaining
banking services. The  request for proposals referred to in subsection (p)
hereof shall indicate the City's  intent to contract with one central
depository.
   (d)   Securities shall be purchased only through financial institutions
located within the State of Ohio or through "primary securities dealers" as
designated by the Federal  Reserve Bank. A list of these institutions shall be
maintained by the Director of  Finance. The Director of Finance:

deposit policy requirements are met;
      (2)   Shall make deletions from the list:
         A.   If and as directed by ordinance of City Council,
         B.   Upon failure of the financial institution to meet the foregoing
investment and deposit policy requirements, or
         C.   Upon request of the financial institution or dealer; and
      (3)   May make deletions from the list if the Director of Finance
determines that:
         A.   The financial institution or dealer is experiencing financial
difficulties;
         B.   There is a consistent lack of competitiveness by the financial
institution or dealer;
         C.   The account representative handling the City's account lacks
experience or familiarity in providing service to large institutional accounts;
or
         D.   It is in the best interest of the City.
   All financial institutions, primary securities dealers and consultants which
desire to conduct investment business with the City must sign a Certificate of
Reading, Understanding and Acceptance, certifying they have read, understand
and agree to abide by the contents of this section, which sets forth and
regulates the City's investment policies.

deposit insurance, plus any accrued interest due on the deposits; in any event,
the value of such securities shall not exceed the City's proportional interest
in the market value of the pool as of the date of the depository's failure to
pay over the deposits. The Director of Finance shall have the option to sell
the securities in such manner as determined by the Director of Finance. Any
surplus remaining after deducting the amount due the City and expenses of the
sale shall be paid to the depository.

depository shall provide a detailed statement setting forth the face and market
values of all securities pledged to the pool and the total of all public funds

depository shall immediately add securities to the pool sufficient to bring the
market value of the pool to at least one hundred ten percent (110%) of all
public funds on deposit with the depository.

pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under
Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle.  However,
if the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation
has established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give the owner
or operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator may pay not

charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in
rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the personal items
after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails to provide the
notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if applicable.  The

         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the

303.09  LEAVING JUNK AND OTHER VEHICLES ON PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PROPERTY WITHOUT
PERMISSION OR NOTIFICATION.
   (a)   No person shall willfully leave any vehicle or an "abandoned junk
motor vehicle" on private property for more than seventy-two consecutive hours
without the permission of the person having the right to the possession of the
property or on a public street or other property open to the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the right of way of
any road or highway, for forty-eight consecutive hours or longer, without
notification to the Police Chief of the reasons for leaving the vehicle in such
place.
   An "abandoned junk motor vehicle" means any motor vehicle meeting either of
the following requirements:
      (1)   Extensively damaged, such damage including but not limited to any
of the following:  missing wheels, tires, motor or transmission; or
      (2)   Apparently inoperable.
   For purposes of this section, the fact that a vehicle has been so left
without permission or notification is prima-facie evidence of abandonment.
Nothing contained in this section shall invalidate the provisions of other
ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor vehicles on
streets, highways, public property or private property within the Municipality.
(Ord. 21-84.  Passed 4-23-84.)
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor, and
shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the Municipality in disposing of
such junk motor vehicle, less any money accruing to the Municipality from such
disposal.
303.10  LEAVING JUNK VEHICLES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY WITH PERMISSION OF OWNER.
   (a)   For the purposes of this section, "junk motor vehicle" means any motor
vehicle which is:
      (1)   Extensively damaged, such damage including but not limiited to any
of the following:  missing wheels, tires, motor or transmission; or
      (2)   Apparently inoperable, a nd that is left uncovered in the open on
private property for more than seventy-two hours with the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property, except if the person
is operating a junk yard or scrap metal processing facility licensed under
authority of Ohio R.C. 4737.05 to 4737.12; or regulated under authority of the
Municipality; or if the property on which the motor vehicle is left is not
subject to licensure or regulation by any governmental authority, unless the
person having the right to the possession of the property can establish that
the motor vehicle is part of a bona fide commercial operation.
   Council, the Chief of Police or the Municipal Zoning Authority, may send
notice by certified mail with return receipt requested, to the person having
the right to the possession of the property on which a junk motor vehicle is
left, that within ten days of receipt of the notice, the junk motor vehicle
either shall be covered by being housed in a garage or other suitable structure
or shall be removed from the property.
   No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in the open
for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this section. 
The fact that a junk motor vehicle is so left is prima-facie evidence of
willful failure to comply with the notice.  Each subsequent period of thirty
days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a separate
offense.

         A.   “Utility” means an entity specified in division (A), (C), (D),
(E) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 4905.03.
         B.   “Utility service vehicle” means a vehicle owned or operated by a

violation, the offender is subject to the applicable penalty for the violation
and, notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 2929.28, is subject to an additional fine of not
more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) as follows:
      (1)   Subject to Traffic Rule 13, if a law enforcement officer issues an
offender a ticket, citation or summons for a violation of any section of the
Traffic Code that indicates that the offender was distracted while committing
the violation and that the distracting activity was a contributing factor to
the commission of the violation, the offender may enter a written plea of
guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
         In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars
($100.00), the offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety
course, the duration and contents of which shall be established by the Ohio
Director of Public Safety.  If the offender attends and successfully completes
the course, the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender
successfully completed the course.  The offender shall be required to pay the
total amount of the fine established for the violation, but shall not be
required to pay the additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long

or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is convicted of the
violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may
impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may impose the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the violation
and an additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the
court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section.  If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course.  The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence.

313.01  OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer. 
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person.  Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place. 
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.  If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree.  If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.

activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense, the
offender is subject to the additional fine established under Section
303.991 of the Traffic Code.  (ORC 4511.12)
313.02  THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section.  Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations.  When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction.  Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of
that proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing
or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways.  For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway
or portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical
terminus of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at
which vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or
yield to traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence
districts the Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway,
or portion thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected
residence district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. 
Where two or more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b)
intersect and no traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield
signs shall be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department
of Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop.  Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the
operator of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic

313.03  TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device.  Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time.  Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or
left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. 
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time  that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection.  The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated.  The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street.  The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street.  The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow, and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making
a stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.

has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices.  Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of- way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to

opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time.  Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection.  The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified

thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable. 
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application.  Any stop required shall be made at a
sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in
the absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception.  This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. 
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62.  (ORC 4511.13)

conflict with turning vehicles.  The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.

to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days. 
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the

community control on the offender that it considers necessary.

      (1)   A.   Twenty miles per hour in school zones during school recess and
while children are going to or leaving school during the opening or closing
hours, and when twenty miles per hour school speed limit signs are erected;
except, that on controlled-access highways and expressways, if the right-of-way
line fence has been erected without pedestrian opening, the speed shall be

fence has been erected without pedestrian opening, the speed shall be governed
by subsection (b)(7) hereof.  The end of every school zone may be marked by a

the speed which subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or
established pursuant to this section declares is prima-facie lawful at the time
and place of such alleged violation, except that in affidavits where a person
is alleged to have driven at a greater speed than will permit the person to
bring the vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead the
affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven.
   (f)   When a speed in excess of both a prima-facie limitation and a
limitation in subsection (d) hereof is alleged, the defendant shall be charged
in a single affidavit, alleging a single act, with a violation indicated of
both subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or of a limit declared or
established pursuant to this section by the Director or local authorities, and
of the limitation in subsection (d) hereof.  If the court finds a violation of
subsection (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or established
pursuant to this section has occurred, it shall enter a judgment of conviction
under such subsection and dismiss the charge under subsection (d) hereof.  If
it finds no violation of subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof or a limit

offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor.  If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.

three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for

person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.

this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor.  When the offense is an

the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has

suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section.  The
person charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may

operating the vehicle has safely and appropriately restrained the child in
accordance with any recommendations of the physician or chiropractor as noted
on the affidavit.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the

be punished as follows, provided that the failure of an operator of a motor
vehicle to secure more than one child in a child restraint system, booster
seat, or occupant restraining device as required by this section that occurred
at the same time, on the same day, and at the same location is deemed to be a
single violation of this section:

and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that represents noneconomic
loss, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011 in a tort action that could have been
recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of the available elements
of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device.  Evidence of that failure

of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:

commission of, or conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as

punishment in this Municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and
for any resulting offense that is committed or completed in the other

commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.
      (4)   While out of this Municipality, the person omits to perform a legal

      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.

not himself a party to the offense.

expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the

         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant

         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a

         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
 
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs.  In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
 
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first.  A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or

and execute process on the same.  A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.

delicti remains undiscovered.

against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
 
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect

to run until either of the following occurs:

      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred.  (ORC 2901.13)
 
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07  REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
 
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense.  Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense.  Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug. 
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08  CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature.  A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. 
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature.  A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature.  A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element.  When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element.  When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element. 
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09  ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense.  An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt.  An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted.  In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor.  An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section. 
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.  (ORC 2923.02)
501.10  COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender.  A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11  ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
his office or employment, except that if the section defining the offense
designates the officers, agents or employees for whose conduct the organization
is accountable or the circumstances under which it is accountable, such
provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
his office or employment, except that if the section defining the offense
designates the officers, agents or employees for whose conduct the organization
is accountable or the circumstances under which it is accountable, such
provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of his office or employment.
   (b)   When strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission.  This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated association, estate, trust or other commercial or legal entity. 
"Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a governmental
agency for the execution of a governmental program.  (ORC 2901.23)
501.12  PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf.  (ORC
2901.24)
501.13  CONSPIRACY.
   (a)   No person, with purpose to commit or to promote or facilitate the
commission of aggravated murder, murder, kidnapping, abduction, compelling
prostitution, promoting prostitution, trafficking in persons, aggravated arson,
arson, aggravated robbery, robbery, aggravated burglary, burglary, engaging in
a pattern of corrupt activity, corrupting another with drugs, a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, theft of drugs,
or illegal processing of drug documents, the commission of a felony offense of
unauthorized use of a vehicle, illegally transmitting multiple commercial
electronic mail messages or unauthorized access of a computer in violation of
Ohio R.C. 2923.421 or the commission of a violation of any provision of Ohio
R.C. Chapter 3734, other than Ohio R.C. 3734.18, that relates to hazardous
wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy.  For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators.  In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section.  In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.
   (m)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession
offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;
         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.
      (2)   “Minor drug possession offense” has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 2925.01.  (ORC 2923.01)
501.99  PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions.  In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section.  If the court in its
discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to,
the following:
      (1)   Restitution.  Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor
or could be disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court
under Traffic Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the
offender’s crime or any survivor of the victim, in an amount based on the
victim’s economic loss.  The court may not impose restitution as a sanction
pursuant to this section if the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13.  If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
   If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine the amount of
restitution to be paid by the offender.  If the court imposes restitution, the
court may base the amount of restitution it orders on an amount recommended by
the victim, the offender, a presentence investigation report, estimates or
receipts indicating the cost of repairing or replacing property, and other
information, provided that the amount the court orders as restitution shall not
exceed the amount of the economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and
proximate result of the commission of the offense.  If the court decides to
impose restitution, the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution
if the offender, victim or survivor disputes the amount of restitution.  If the
court holds an evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the victim or survivor has
the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the amount of
restitution sought from the offender.
All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery of economic
loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any survivor of the victim
against the offender.  No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the offender pay a
surcharge, of not more than five per cent of the amount of the restitution
otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and processing
restitution payments.
The victim or survivor may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered.  If the court grants the motion, it may
modify the payment terms as it determines appropriate.
      (2)   Fines.  A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions.  The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection.  If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37.  In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms. 
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B).  The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case.  The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
      2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program.  During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations.  Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections
(a) and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section.  The court shall fix
the fine as follows:
 
Type of Misdemeanor                           Maximum Fine
First degree                                  $5000.00
Second degree                                   4000.00
Third degree                                    3000.00
Fourth degree                                   2000.00
Minor                                           1000.00
Misdemeanor not specifically classified         2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified   1000.00
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).

provided by the Director of Administration, thereby releasing the City from
liability for damage to property or personal injury in connection with the
removal.

property upon which the Graffiti is located by the fastest method of service
available under the circumstances, as determined by the Director of
Administration.

determined that Graffiti exists in violation of this ordinance and is of such a
nature that immediate action is necessary to protect the public health, safety,
and welfare of the City. The  Order shall describe the Graffiti that shall be
removed, and it shall inform the Owner of the actions that he/she/it shall take
and the amount of time that he/she/it has to act. The Order shall also inform

Court shall review the validity of the Order. In addition, the Order shall
inform the Owner that he/she/it may notify the Director of Administration, in
writing, that he/she/it wishes to contest the Order at the abovementioned
Mayor's Court hearing.
            1.   If the Owner chooses to inform the Director of Administration,

notification to the Director of Administration shall be accompanied by a

costs associated with the hearing. 
            2.   The Owner's decision to inform the Director of Administration,
in writing, that he/she/it wishes to contest the Order at the abovementioned

comply with that Order.

cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and

its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal

545.02  DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,

545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense.  When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense.  The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving

course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,

545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving

service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense.  If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series. 
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section.  While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services.  As used in this section, "fair
market value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.  (ORC 2913.61)
545.03  PROPERTY EXCEPTIONS AS FELONY OFFENSE.
   Regardless of the value of the property involved, and regardless of whether
the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions

(Ord. 50-12.  passed 6-25-12.)
557.02  INSPECTION; WRITTEN REPORT.
   Upon receipt of information that a building or other structure constitutes a
public nuisance, the Superintendent of Permits and Inspections, shall cause to
be made an inspection thereof.  If after said inspection it is found that said
building or structure constitutes a public nuisance, he or she shall cause to
be filed a detailed written report of the condition in the office of the Mayor
which shall be a matter of public record and he or she shall cause a written
notice thereof to be served as hereinafter provided.
(Ord. 50-12.  Passed 6-25-12.)
557.03  NOTICE ORDERING ABATEMENT; CONTENT OF NOTICE; SERVICE  OF NOTICE.

premises. The notice shall be written and specifically state the defects that
cause the building to be a public nuisance and shall require the owner within a
stated time to either complete the specified repairs or improvements or to

premises in a clean, safe and sanitary condition being subject to the approval
of the Superintendent of Permits and Inspections.
   (b)   Proper service of the notice set forth in subsection (a) hereof shall
be made by personal service, residence service or by certified mail; provided,
however, that such notice shall be deemed to be properly served if a copy
thereof is sent by certified mail to the owner's last known address.  If a
party cannot be located, nor his address ascertained, this notice shall be
deemed to be properly served if a copy thereof is placed in a conspicuous place
in or about the building or structure affected by such notice and further, a
copy of this notice shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in
this county for a period of three consecutive days.  If such notice is by
certified mail, the time period within which the owner is required to comply
with the notice of the Superintendent of Permits and Inspections shall begin as

of Permits and Inspections shall request the Director of Law to file an
appropriate action in a court of competent jurisdiction wherein the Director of
Law shall seek an Order from said court declaring a public nuisance and
permitting the City to remedy the public nuisance through demolition or other
appropriate means.  The building or structure owner shall be liable for all
costs of repair or demolition as well as all administrative costs, court costs

is not reimbursed for such costs, fees and expenses within thirty days after
written notice to the building or structure owner the amount thereof shall be
certified to the County Treasurer and levied as a special assessment against
the property on which the building or structure is located and shall be

   A property owner may petition the City of North Canton to replace the
property owner’s substandard sidewalks and driveway approaches with costs being
shared equally by the property owner(s) and the City when subsections (a) or
(b) below are met:
   (a)   At least fifty percent (50%) of the property owners living in a city
block, as defined by the City Engineer, petition the City to repair substandard
sidewalks; or
   (b)   At least forty percent (40%) of the property owners living within a
three (3) block radius, as defined by the City Engineer, petition the City to
repair substandard sidewalks. 
      (Ord. 36-09.  Passed 5-11-09.)
902.03  NEW SIDEWALKS.
   A property owner may petition the City of North Canton for the installation
of new sidewalks and driveway approaches with costs being shared equally by the
property owner(s) and the City when 100% of the property owners on one side of
the street within a city block, as defined by the City Engineer, petition the
City to install new sidewalks.
(Ord. 36-09.  Passed 5-11-09.)
902.04  PARTICIPATION VOLUNTARY; REQUIREMENTS TO QUALIFY.
   (a)   Participation in Section
902.02 and Section
902.03 is voluntary and is limited to residential properties.  The property
must be located on an improved street (i.e., must have curbs) and the total
lineage of the improvements must exceed a minimum of 500 lineal feet for all
participating property owners combined.
   (b)   To qualify, a residential property owner living within the area
designated in Sections
902.02 or Section
902.03  must sign an agreement to pay for an equal share of the costs,
excluding engineering and survey expenses.  When the participatory minimums
have been met, the City may construct the necessary improvements. 
   (c)   Property owners must contact the Director of Administration to request
a participation agreement.  A City representative, as determined by the
Administration, will visit the site, speak with the property owner(s), if
available, and determine which items of work are needed.  The estimate may
provide for replacement or installation of the sidewalk, driveway apron, the
curb adjacent to the apron, retaining wall (along right of way), roof drain
pipe, and tree removal.  The City will cause the property to be staked so the
property owners would be aware of the exact placement of the sidewalks.
   (d)   Any tree on private property that must be removed to accomplish the
work will be removed at the owner’s expense.  These costs will be provided in
the estimate with the petition.  Sidewalk slabs that are lifted by tree roots
but are otherwise undamaged are considered defective, and need to be replaced. 
If it is determined that cutting the roots will kill the tree, the tree will be
removed at the time of construction.
   (e)   The property owner(s) must accept the City’s work order in its
entirety. The City will provide the property owner(s) with a preliminary cost
estimate. If the property owner chooses to have the City do the work, the owner
(s) must sign the agreement and return it to the City. When sufficient numbers
of signed agreements have been accepted by the City, the City will invoice the
participating property owners. Before construction begins, the property owner
(s) shall remit funds in full to the City.  Improvements will only be made on
those properties for which payment has been received.  Construction will begin
as soon as practicable.

   (b)   Backfill.
      (1)   Under pavements or traveled alleys.  After installation or repair
of the structure, which necessitated the excavation, select earth shall be
tamped in six-inch layers around the structure and to a depth of six inches
above it.  The remainder of the backfill shall be a granular material known as
crusher run stone, grits, bank-run gravel or another granular material approved
by the Excavation Inspector.  The granular material shall be tamped in six-inch
layers.  The granular backfill shall terminate eight inches from the top of the
existing pavement.  The final eight inches shall consist of six inches of
concrete base and two inches of asphalt concrete.
         (Ord. 3133.  Passed 8-28-72.)
      (2)   Under sidewalks and driveway approach slabs.  Excavations under
sidewalks and drives shall be backfilled exactly as for that under pavements

over the sidewalk area and shall be checked and maintained for a period of
thirty days.
      (3)   Under areas between the pavement and the sidewalk.  Excavations
between the sidewalk and the pavement shall be backfilled with select earth,
tamped in six inch layers and terminated in a neat mound six inches above the
surrounding surface.  Should the excavation impair the strength of the adjacent
pavement or sidewalk, granular backfill shall be placed in the six-inch
compacted layers, to a depth of eighteen inches below the existing surface. 
The remainder of the backfill shall then be select earth placed as described
above.  The agency making the excavation shall be responsible for replacing all
pavement or sidewalk, existing or new, damaged by careless excavation or
improper backfilling.
         (Ord. 2535.  Passed 2-27-67.)

(Ord. 73-08.  Passed 7-14-08.)
921.06  SPECIFICATIONS AND LAYING OF BUILDING SEWERS.
   (a)   Old building sewers may be used in connection with new buildings only
when they are found, on examination and test by the Permit and Inspection
Division, to meet all requirements of this chapter.
   (b)   All building sewers shall be constructed, laid and connected according
to the following standards:
      (1)   The building sewer shall be of extra heavy cast iron soil pipe, or
equal; vitrified clay sewer pipe, ASTM specification (C-425) or equal; or other
suitable material approved by the Permit and Inspection Division.  Joints shall
be tight and waterproof.  No building sewer shall be laid in the same
excavation with a water service pipe.  Any part of the building sewer that is
located within six feet of the water service pipe shall be constructed of cast
iron soil pipe with leaded joints or vitrified sewer pipe with approved rubber
joints.  Cast iron pipe with leaded joints may be required by the Division
where the building sewer is exposed to damage by tree roots.  If installed in
filled or unstable ground, the building sewer shall be of cast iron soil pipe,
except that nonmetallic material may be accepted if laid on a suitable bed as
approved by the Division.
      (2)   The size and slope of the building sewer shall be suitable to the
approval of the Division, but in no event shall the diameter be less than four
inches.  The slope of such four-inch pipe shall be not less than one-eighth
inch per foot.
      (3)   Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the
building at an elevation below the basement floor.  No building sewer shall be
laid parallel to or within three feet of any bearing wall, which might thereby
be weakened.  The depth shall be sufficient to afford protection from frost. 
The building sewer shall be laid at uniform grade and in straight alignment
insofar as possible.  Changes in direction shall be made only with properly
curved pipe and fittings.
      (4)   In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit
gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such drain shall
be lifted by approved artificial means and discharged to the building sewer.
      (5)   All excavations required for the installation of a building sewer
shall be open trench work unless otherwise approved by the Division.  Pipe
laying and backfill shall be performed in accordance with ASTM specification
(C12-19), except that no backfill shall be placed until the work has been
inspected.
      (6)   All joints and connection shall be made gastight and watertight. 
Cast iron pipe joints shall be firmly packed with oakum or hemp and filled with
molten lead, Federal specification (QQ-L-156), not less than one inch deep. 
Lead shall be run in one pouring and caulked tight.  No paint, varnish or other
coating shall be permitted on the jointing material until after the joint has
been tested and approved.  All joints in vitrified clay pipe or between such
pipe and metal pipe shall be made with premolded synthetic rubber or
polychloride joints firmly attached to the bell and spigot ends of the sewer
pipe at the place of manufacture, or by an approved hot-poured jointing
material as specified below.  Material for hot-poured joints shall not soften
sufficiently to destroy the effectiveness of the joint when subjected to a
temperature of 160 degrees F., and shall not be soluble in any of the wastes
carried by the drainage system.  The joint shall be first caulked with dry
square braided untarred hemp, to a depth equal to one-fourth of the depth of
the bell, or similar approved material and filled with hot-poured compound to
full depth.  Other jointing materials and methods may be used only by approval
of the Division.
      (7)   The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall be
made by the wye branch, if such branch is available at a suitable location.  If
the public sewer is twelve inches in diameter or less, and no properly located
wye branch is available, the owner shall at his expense install a wye branch in
the public sewer at the location specified by the Division.  Where the public
sewer is greater than twelve inches in diameter, and no properly located wye
branch is available, a neat hole may be cut into the public sewer to receive
the building sewer with entry in the downstream direction  at an angle of about
forty-five degrees.  A forty-five degree ell may be used to make such
connection, with the spigot end cut so as not to extend past the inner surface
of the public sewer.  The invert of the building sewer at the point of
connection shall be at the same or at a higher elevation than the invert of the
public sewer.  A smooth, neat joint shall be made, and the connection made
secure and water tight by encasement in concrete.  Special fittings may be used
for the connection only when approved by the Division.
   (c)   The applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify the Division
when the building sewer is ready for inspection and connection to the public
sewer.  The connection shall be made under the supervision of the Division.
   (d)   All excavations for building sewer installations shall be adequately
guarded with barricades and lights so as to protect the public from hazard. 
Streets, sidewalks, parkways and other public property disturbed in the course
of the work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the City Engineer.

drainage shall be discharged to such sewers as are specifically designated as
combined sewers or storm sewers, or to a natural outlet approved by the Permit
and Inspection Division.  Industrial cooling water or unpolluted process waters
may be discharged, upon approval of the Division, to a storm sewer, combined
sewer or natural outlet.
   (c)   Sewage in Storm Sewers.  No person shall discharge or cause to be
discharged any sewage into any storm sewer.

If the concentration of any industrial waste exceeds the limits stipulated
above, as received at the Municipal sewage treatment plant, the largest
contributor of such waste(s) followed in order by the next largest contributors
shall reduce, by acceptable pretreatment and/or flow regulation or both, the
amounts wasted to the public sewer until the aggregate of any such waste
concentration at the treatment works does not exceed the above prescribed
limits.
      (12)   Any wastes which have excessive volume, B.O.D., color, chlorine
requirements, concentration of settleable solids, or have unusual conditions
such as suspended solids of an inert nature, or total dissolved solids which

necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing grease in
excessive amounts, or any inflammable wastes, sand and other harmful
ingredients, except that such interceptors shall not be required for private
living quarters or dwelling units.  All interceptors shall be of a type and
capacity approved by the Division, and shall be located as to be readily and
easily accessible for cleaning and inspection.
   Grease and oil interceptors shall be constructed of impervious materials
capable of withstanding abrupt and extreme changes in temperature.  They shall
be of substantial construction, watertight and equipped with easily removable
covers, which when bolted in place shall be gastight and watertight.
   (f)   Maintenance of Interceptors.  Where installed, all grease, oil and
sand interceptors shall be maintained by the owner, at his expense, in
continuously efficient operation at all times.
   (g)   Pretreatment of Industrial Wastes.  The admission into the public
sewers of any waters or wastes having a five-day B.O.D. greater than 300 parts
per million by weight; containing more than 350 parts per million by weight of
suspended solids; containing any quantity of substances having the
characteristics described in subsection (d) hereof; or having an average daily
flow greater than two percent (2%) of the average daily sewage flow of the
City, shall be subject to the review and approval of the Permit and Inspection
Division.  Where necessary in the opinion of the Division, the owner shall
provide at his expense, such preliminary treatment as may be necessary to:
      (1)   Reduce the B.O.D. to 300 parts per million and the suspended solids
to 350 parts per million by weight;
      (2)   Reduce objectionable characteristics or constituents to within the

maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation, by the owner
of such treatment facilities at  his expense.
   (i)   Control Manholes.  The owner of any property served by a building
sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control manhole in
the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling and measurement of the
wastes.  Such manhole shall be accessibly and safely located, and shall be
constructed in accordance with plans approved by the Permit and Inspection
Division.  The manhole shall be installed by the owner at his expense, and
shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible at all times.
   (j)   Tests of Industrial Wastes.  All measurements, tests and analyses of
the characteristics of water and wastes to which reference is made in
subsections (d) and (g) hereof shall be determined in accordance with "Standard
Methods for the Examination of Water and Sewage", upon the waste discharging
through the control manhole provided for in subsection (i) hereof, or upon
suitable samples taken at the control manhole.
   (k)   Exception to Industrial Waste Provisions.  No statement contained in
subsections (a) to (j) hereof will be construed as preventing any special
agreement or arrangement between the City and any industrial concern whereby an
industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by the City
for treatment, subject to payment therefor by the industrial concern.

payment of the fee at that time being exacted from owners and occupants of
property within the City limits, together with any unpaid assessments and
interest which may be properly chargeable to such outlying property, as
contained in the City's assessment records, and carried by the City due to the
fact that the property is beyond the corporate limits and therefore not subject
to assessment, even though abutting upon a City sewer.
   (b)   No permit shall be granted to an occupant of an outlying property
until the owner of the property files with the Superintendent of Permits and
Inspection his written consent to all the terms and conditions hereof.  All

or may hereafter be made effective concerning the use of the City's sanitary
sewers, shall, at the option of the City, terminate the right to continue such
connection and to make use of the City's sanitary sewers for disposal of sewage
and waste.  Upon notice in writing from the City, through its Superintendent of
Sewers, or other duly authorized officer or employee, the owner and occupant of
the property specified in the notice shall discontinue the use of sanitary
sewers of the City and shall sever, at his own cost and expense, the physical
connection from the property to the sanitary sewers.
   Upon failure to do so the City shall have the right, through its duly
authorized officers and employees to sever the connection into the sanitary
sewers of the City from the property in question, and such connection shall not
thereafter be re-established, except in accordance with the terms of this and
all rules and regulations then in effect, and upon payment of all fees and
charges, both present and delinquent, including any disconnecting costs.
   (b)   Any property owner and the occupant, present or future, of any
property heretofore or hereafter connected to the sanitary sewers of the City
and making use thereof by making connection to or by using or continuing to use
the City's sanitary sewers to dispose of sewage and waste from outlying
property of such property owner or occupant, does, for himself, his heirs,
executors, successors and assigns, hereby waive, release and forever discharge
the City and its successors from any and all liability and damages and any and
all claims therefor by reason of any defect in such sewers, whether now in
existence, or hereafter constructed  from any failure of any such sewer or
sewers, any obstruction or overflowing thereof or by reason of severance of

925.06  CONDITIONS OF CONNECTING PRIVILEGES.
   (a)   Every property owner and occupant who has heretofore or may hereafter
connect to and make use of the sanitary sewers of the Municipality, has a
revocable license and privilege to make and continue such connection and use,
subject to termination by the City at any time, with or without cause, and this
license and privilege is expressly subject to the reserved right of the
Municipality from time to time to amend, change or repeal any and all rules and
regulations which are now or may hereafter, from time to time, be in effect. 
Such property owners and occupants shall conform to such changes and
amendments.

(Ord. 2544.  Passed 2-17-67.)
927.04  WHEN RENTAL CHARGES APPLY.
   When a sewer is available, it will be presumed that the waste from the
premises is discharged either directly or indirectly into the sewerage system,
and the property shall be subject to a sewer rental charge.  When new sanitary
sewers are constructed, premises which can or should be connected to the new
sewer shall be subject to a sewer rental charge as soon as connections are made
to the new sewer, or ninety days after the new sewer is accepted by the City,
whichever date is earlier.

measure the amount of waste discharged, supplementary meters utilized to
measure the volume of water supplied from private water supplies or for other
purposes in connection with the determination of the sewer rental charge, shall
be installed and maintained by the property owner or other interested party at
his expense, but such meters must be acceptable to the City Engineer.
   (c)   In any event that the City Engineer finds it is not practical to
measure such waste by meters, the City Engineer may measure such waste in such
other manner or method as he may find practical in the light of the particular
conditions and attendant circumstances.  In the event it is found by the City
Engineer that such water or wastes so metered, or otherwise measured, are not
actually the true measure of the volume of waste water being discharged into
the sewerage system, the City Engineer may modify and adjust such volume in
accordance with the facts and with justice and equity.
(Ord. 113-80.  Passed 12-29-80.)

      (1)   Within a period of ten years from date of construction, such
remuneration shall be paid to the person, persons or corporation responsible
for the initial construction of the water line.
      (2)   Such remuneration shall be based on one-half of the actual cost per

pipes, or smaller.
      (3)   Evidence, in writing, must be furnished to the City that
satisfactory remuneration has been made before a permit shall be issued.

of remuneration, the Board of Control shall have the authority to determine the
amount of remuneration which must be paid before a permit shall be issued.
      (5)   If the person or corporation responsible for the initial
installation of the water line is deceased, or if the corporation is dissolved,
their rights for remuneration shall cease to exist and shall not vest to their
heirs, successors and assigns.
      (6)   When the conditions or circumstances exist, as set forth in
subsection (f)(5) above, and when the ten year period has passed, the property
owner desiring to connect to water lines which he did not pay for shall be
required to remunerate the City at the rate of four dollars ($4.00) per front
foot before a permit shall be issued.
      (7)   The remuneration as set forth in subsections (f)(1) and (f)(6)
hereof, shall apply only on lines installed after December 31, 1955, by private

standards of the City.  When it is necessary to install a fire hydrant within
the Municipality by an owner or developer of an allotment or lot, the City
shall furnish the fire hydrant at its cost and the owner shall pay the cost of
installing the fire hydrant.

to topography, to proposed uses of land abutting the streets and to the pattern
of surrounding streets and land use.
      (2)   Existing or projected major streets in adjoining areas shall be

subdivided, the other half of the street shall be platted within such tract.
         B.   Half-streets shall not be less than one-half the standard width
for the appropriate street classification.
      (15)   Any plat dedicating a temporary dead-end or a half-street shall

   (b)   Blocks.
      (1)   Block lengths shall not exceed 1,400 feet.
      (2)   In blocks longer than 900 feet, easements shall be provided for
pedestrian walks in order to give substantially more direct access to a school,
playground, public transportation, shopping center, church or other community
facilities.  Such easements shall be located in or near the center of the block
or as extensions of sidewalks or walks in adjacent blocks.  Crosswalk easements
when provided shall be at least ten feet wide and shall be dedicated as public
rights of way for sidewalk purposes.
      (3)   Blocks that abut a major thoroughfare may be required by the City
Planning Commission and may be designed to:
         A.   Align blocks with their greater dimension parallel to and
adjoining the major thoroughfares, and

adjoining the major thoroughfares, or
         C.   Abut the major thoroughfares with lot lines across which
vehicular access is prohibited by plat restriction.
      (4)   Irregular shaped blocks (including super-blocks) and, indented cul-

corporate limits.
      (3)   Side lot lines shall be at right angles or radial to street lines
as nearly as practicable.
      (4)   Double-frontage or reversed-frontage lots shall be prohibited
except where they are deemed necessary by the Commission to provide separation
of residential development from traffic arteries or to overcome unusual
topographic conditions.
      (5)   The numbering of lots shall conform to the City's adopted lot
numbering system if the subdivision is located within the corporate limits of
the City, or to the County's numbering system if located outside the corporate
limits of the City.

center line or right-of- way lines of highways, such lines shall be construed
to be such district boundaries.
   (b)   Where Boundaries Parallel Street Lines, Alley Lines or Highway Right-
of-Way Lines. Where district boundaries are so indicated that they are
approximately parallel to the center line or street line of streets, the center
line or alley line of alleys, or the center line or right-of-way lines of
highways, such district boundaries shall be construed as being parallel thereto
and at such distance therefrom as indicated on the Map.  If no distance is
given, such dimensions shall be determined by the use of the scale shown on the
Zoning Map.
   (c)   Where Boundaries Approximately Follow Lot Lines.  Where district
boundaries are indicated as approximately following lot lines, such lot lines
shall be construed to be such boundaries.
   (d)   Vacation of Public Ways.  Whenever any street, alley or other public
way is vacated in a manner authorized by law, the zoning district adjoining
each side of such street, alley or public way shall be automatically extended
to the center of such vacation and all areas included in the vacation shall
then and henceforth be subject to all regulations of the extended district.
   (e)   Resolving Disputes.  All uncertainties and disputes concerning the
exact location of zoning district boundaries shall be resolved by the Board of

the minimum lot size and building setback requirements, existing at the time of
annexation shall continue to govern the former township land until an amendment
to the City of North Canton Zoning Map is adopted in conformance with the

1133.09  REGULATIONS FOR HOME OCCUPATIONS.
   The purpose of this section is to set forth regulations that control the
establishment and operation of home occupations by regulating such as a
conditional use subject to the requirements of this Section, the general
criteria for conditional uses set forth in Section
1145.02 and the review procedures for conditional uses set forth in Chapter
1177.  The intent of these regulations is to control the nonresidential use of
a residential dwelling unit so that the nonresidential use is limited to an
accessory use, and does not in any manner whatsoever disrupt or alter the
residential character of the neighborhood in which it is located.  Compliance
with these regulations should result in all home occupations being located and
conducted in such a manner that their existence is not detectable in any manner
from the outside of the dwelling unit.
   (a)   A home occupation shall occupy no more than 20% of the floor area of
the dwelling and shall be clearly incidental and secondary in importance to the
use of the dwelling for dwelling purposes.
   (b)   Any merchandise that is sold from the premise shall be produced on the
premises.
   (c)   The business activity, including the storage of equipment, supplies or
any apparatus used in the home occupation shall be conducted entirely within
the dwelling unit and no use of a garage, an accessory building or an outdoor
area shall be permitted, except that storage of equipment and supplies may be
conducted in a garage to the extent that at all times the number of vehicles
for which the garage was designed to accommodate shall be able to be parked in
such garage.
   (d)   There shall not be any change in the outside appearance of the
building or premises, or other visible exterior change related to the home
occupation.
   (e)   Any on-site business related in any manner to the home occupation
shall be conducted only by occupants of the dwelling unit.
   (f)   No equipment or process shall be permitted or used in such home
occupation that creates a nuisance by reason of generating any noise,
vibration, glare, fumes, odors, or electrical interference, or which is
determined unsafe.
   (g)   No traffic shall be generated by such home occupation in greater
volume than can be parked on the premises or than would normally be expected in
the neighborhood.  Parking shall be prohibited in the front yard except in the
driveway serving the premises which driveway must be no larger than that
reasonably necessary to service the garage or carport on the premises.
   (h)   Delivery vehicles used to deliver goods to the home occupation shall
be limited to passenger vehicles, mail carriers, and express carriers such as
UPS. Deliveries shall be permitted between 8:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m.
1133.10  FAMILY DAY CARE HOME, TYPE "B".
   This Zoning Ordinance recognizes that the availability of safe and
affordable, good-quality child day care is important to the well being of
parents and children.  Furthermore, it is the purpose of this section to
regulate the operation of child day care in a manner that preserves the
residential character of neighborhoods.  According to ORC 5104.054, any type B
family day-care home, whether certified or not certified by the county director
of human services, shall be considered to be a residential use of property for
purposes of municipal, county, and City zoning and shall be a permitted use in
all zoning districts in which residential uses are permitted.  A type “B”
family day-care home is a permanent residence of the provider where child care
is provided for 1 to 6 children and where no more than three children are under
two years of age.  For the purposes of this definition, any children under six
years of age who are related to the provider and who are on the premises of the
day-care home shall be counted.  Type “B” family day-care homes are a permitted
accessory use in residential districts, and do not require a zoning
certificate.

accommodate all types of offices and limited business service activities.
   (e)   To provide a Main Street Business District (MSB) that maintains and

   Mixed-Use Overlay District ("MUO") and its regulations are established in
order to permit and encourage intensity of development that will result in the
creation and maintenance of a "town center" area. In order to accomplish this
purpose, it is the intention in establishing this Overlay District to
conditionally permit specific uses in a manner that:
   (a)   Encourages a pedestrian oriented mixture of uses including but not
limited to: offices, limited retail, and higher density residential to create a
unique place in the center of the community.
   (b)   Provides for various economic development options while strengthening
the diversity of uses found in the community.
   (c)    Establishes design guidelines for new development or redevelopment to
ensure that an aesthetically pleasing, and pedestrian friendly environment is
created. Specifically, the design guidelines are intended to:
      (1)   Protect and preserve the appearance and character of the community;
      (2)   Reduce the impact between zoning districts; and
      (3)   Provide interest along the streetscape.
   (d)   Ensures that new development and/or redevelopment will occur in a
unified manner.
   (e)   Ensures that such mixed uses comply with these objectives by requiring
a development plan and establishing a review process to ensure that all phases
of a development are consistent with regulations.

1155;
      (2)   Off-street parking as regulated in this district, see also Chapter
1153;and
      (3)   Signs, as regulated in Chapter
1151.
   (g)   Agricultural Uses in Mixed Use Overlay Districts: The intent of
agricultural uses in a MUO is to allow for the growing of farm products such as
vegetables, fruits, grains, and horticulture and their storage on the area
intended for such agriculture.
      (1)   Permitted Accessory Structures. In addition to fences, as regulated
in accessory uses of (a) of this Section, a permitted agricultural use may be
served by the following accessory structures: sheds, greenhouses, cold frames,
barns, rain barrels, com posting, and farm stands.
         A.   Fences. Fences for agricultural uses shall be permitted in
accordance with the regulations for Accessory Uses.
         B.   Sale of Produce: Upon prior, written approval from the Planning
Commission, the sale of agricultural products, and plants, is permitted on a
property within the mixed use district.  Foods prepared on site or off site may
be sold within the mixed use district so long as their principal ingredients
are grown or produced on the same mixed use district. No sales shall be made
before 8 a.m. or after dusk. Food sales shall be licensed by the Stark County
Board of Health if such licensing is required.
         C.   Farm Stands. A farm stand which has received the proper permit
and the Planning Commission's prior written approval for construction or
installation, and which is located in a required front yard area in a MUO
District, shall be removed from the front yard or stored inside a building on
the premises during the time of the year when the garden or farm is not open
for public use. Farm stands shall not occupy more than two percent of the
subject property's land area.
      (2)   Composting. Composting may be conducted on the premises of an
agricultural use if limited to use on the subject property and if stored in a
manner that controls odor, prevents infestation, and minimizes run-off into
waterways and onto adjacent properties.
         A.   Composting must be only of materials generated on the MUO.
         B.   A maximum area of 200 square feet may be used for com posting.
         C.   Compost material must be enclosed in a screen fence or structure.
         D.   Compost enclosures must be located:
            1.    A minimum distance of three feet from rear and side lot
lines;
            2.    A maximum distance of 25 feet from the rear lot line; and
            3.    A minimum distance of 10 feet from the front lot line.
         E.   In the case of corner lots, compost enclosures must be located:
            1.    A minimum distance of three feet from the rear and interior
side lot lines;
            2.    A maximum distance of 25 feet from the rear lot line; and
            3.    A minimum distance of 10 feet from the street side lot line
and front lot line.
         F.   Compost enclosures must be located to prevent the runoff of
water, which has come in contact with the compost, from flowing onto adjacent
property, into natural or human-made storm channels, and the public right-of-
way.
         G.   Compost enclosures must be maintained in a manner that protects
adjacent properties from adverse environmental, health and safety impacts such
as noise, odors and attraction of rodents or other pests.
      (3)   Planning Commission Approval. No agricultural produce or related
products may be sold from the property of an agricultural use and no farm stand
for the sale of such products may be located on the property unless the
Planning Commission has determined that the farm may be located on the property
and sales there from will meet a community need without adversely affecting the
local neighborhood.  In making this determination, the Planning Commission
shall consider, amongst other things, the following factors:
         A.   The nature of nearby uses of land with respect to their
sensitivity to the activity associated with farm stand sales;
         B.   The proximity of the farm stand to one and two-family houses;
         C.   Traffic volume on the street on which the subject property is
located;
         D.   The availability of off and/or on-street parking to serve the
farm stand's use; and
         E.   The maintenance of a substantially unobstructed view in the
setback area, which shall include a clear view through the farm stand above a
height of three feet.
      (4)   Signs. Where an agricultural use is the principal use in a MUO
District, one sign shall be permitted on each street frontage identifying the
agricultural use and listing hours of operations for market sales and contract
information. Such sign shall not exceed four square feet in area and, if
freestanding, shall not exceed three feet in height, and shall be setback at
least five feet from all property lines unless the sign is placed on a
permitted farm stand.
      (5)   Maintenance. Any land developed to agricultural use shall be
wellmaintained and shall be free of excessively tall weeds or grass. All
accessory structures to an agricultural use shall also be well maintained.
      (6)   Building Permits. Neither a building peqnit nor a certificate of
occupancy shall be required to establish an agricultural use. A building permit
shall be required, however, prior to the installation of a fence, construction
of a barn or other structure routinely requiring such permit, and for the
construction or placement of a farm stand. The permit application shall include
the name, address, and phone number of the farm stand's operator; the length,
width, and height of the farm stand; a description of the type of produce to be
sold from the farm stand; and the name of the property owner. If the applicant
is not the property owner, the applicant shall include with the permit
application a signed, written statement from the property owner authorizing the
applicant to install and operate the farm stand.
         (Ord. 49-13.  Passed 9-16-13.)

setbacks set forth in this section.
   (a)   Setback from Rights of Way.  The mandatory setback of all buildings
from a street right-of-way shall be 10 feet.
   (b)   Setback from "R" District. The minimum setback of all buildings from a
lot line that abuts a lot in an R-70, R-50 or R-2F district shall be 40 feet or
a distance equal to the height of the building, whichever is greater.
   (c)   Side and Rear Yard Setbacks. No setback shall be required from the MSB
District or other mixed-use development within the overlay district.
   (d)   Minimum Distance between Residential Buildings.  In order to ensure
reasonable privacy and separation, residential dwelling units including
terraces, decks and patios shall be separated by at least 20 feet, except that
when the windows of living areas and patios, decks, and terraces face each
other, they shall be separated by at least 50 feet. This distance may be

CHAPTER 1145
Conditional Use Regulations
1145.01   Purpose.
1145.02   General criteria for all conditional uses.
1145.03   Specific standards for conditional uses.
1145.04   Schedule of minimum lot and yard dimensions for conditional uses in
Park and Institutional District.
1145.05   Schedule of minimum lot and yard dimensions for conditional uses in
residential districts.
1145.06   Schedule of minimum lot and yard dimensions for conditional uses in
commercial and industrial districts.
1145.07   Supplemental regulations for certain uses.
 
1145.01  PURPOSE.
   (a)   Conditional uses are a classification of uses that are determined to
generally be compatible in the district in which they are listed as a
conditional use.  However, this category of uses is so classified because of
the need to adequately monitor the proposed use in order to ensure that the use
and its operational aspects are indeed appropriate in the specific location in
which the use is proposed.  Such monitoring is necessary because the external
impacts of a particular use are either sufficiently varied or indeterminable in
advance and therefore may vary from site to site, making it possible that,
without the Planning Commission’s review, a particular use could be
inappropriate in a certain location within the district.
   (b)   These regulations are intended to ensure that conditional uses are
reviewed in a reasonable and equitable manner, while safeguarding the property
rights of all individuals and the health, safety, and general welfare of the
community.  Toward these ends, it is recognized that this Ordinance should
provide for more detailed evaluation of each use listed as a conditional use in
a specific district with respect to such considerations as location, design,
size, method(s) of operation, intensity of use, requirements for public
facilities and traffic generation.  In considering a proposed conditional use,
the Planning Commission may assign reasonable requirements to ensure that the
proposed development is appropriate in the location in which it is proposed.
Accordingly, conditional use permits shall conform to the procedures and
requirements of Chapter
1177.
1145.02  GENERAL CRITERIA FOR ALL CONDITIONAL USES.
   A conditional use, and uses accessory to such conditional use, shall be
permitted in a district only when specified as a conditional use in such
district, and only if such use conforms to the following general criteria,
which are in addition to specific conditions, standards and regulations set
forth in Sections
1145.03 through
1145.06.  The Planning Commission shall review the particular facts and
circumstances of each proposed use in terms of the following criteria and shall
find adequate evidence that the use as proposed:
   (a)   Will be designed, constructed, operated and maintained so as to be
harmonious and appropriate in appearance with the existing or intended
character of the general vicinity, and that such use will not essentially
change the character of the same area;
   (b)   Will not be detrimental to property values in the immediate vicinity.
   (c)   Will not restrict or adversely affect the existing use of the adjacent
property owners.
   (d)   Will be designed and constructed so that all access drives, access
points to public streets, driveways, parking and service areas shall be in
compliance with the regulations set forth in Chapter
1153.
   (e)   Will meet the requirements of EPA for stormwater runoff, when
applicable.
   (f)   Will be properly landscaped in accordance with Chapter
1155.
   (g)   The establishment, maintenance or operation of the conditional use
will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety or general
welfare;
   (h)   The hours of operation of the proposed use are similar to a use
permitted in the district.
   (i)   The establishment of the conditional use in the proposed location will
not impede the normal and orderly development and improvement of the
surrounding property for uses permitted in the district;
   (j)   Adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and/or necessary facilities
have been or are being provided;
   (k)   Adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress and
egress designed to minimize traffic congestion on the surrounding public
streets;
   (l)   The establishment of the conditional use should not be detrimental to
the economic welfare of the community by creating excessive additional
requirements at public cost for public facilities such as police, fire and
schools;
   (m)   There is minimal potential for future hardship on the conditional use
that could result from the proposed use being surrounded by uses permitted by
right that may be incompatible.
1145.03  SPECIFIC STANDARDS FOR CONDITIONAL USES.
   In addition to the general criteria established in Section
1145.02, the following specific conditions pertaining to each use or group of
uses shall apply.
   (a)   Supplementary Conditions and Safeguards.  Nothing in these regulations
shall prohibit the Planning Commission from prescribing supplementary
conditions and safeguards in addition to these requirements in order to ensure
compliance with the criteria set forth in Section
1145.02.
   (b)   Conformance with District Regulations.  A conditional use shall
conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located and to other
substantive requirements of this Zoning Ordinance, as well as satisfy the
conditions, standards and requirements of this Chapter.  Whenever there is a
difference between the provisions of the conditional use regulations and the
district regulations, the most restrictive provision shall prevail, unless
clearly indicated differently in the regulations.
   (c)   Specific Development Standards. 
      (1)   The Planning Commission may limit the hours of operation to ensure
that the conditional use is compatible with the surrounding uses.
      (2)   No lighting shall constitute a nuisance and in no way shall impair
safe movement of traffic on any street or highway.  All outside lighting shall
comply with the requirements specified in Section
1155.11.
      (3)   Floodlights, loudspeakers or similar structures shall not be
erected or used in any manner that will cause hazards or annoyance to the
public generally or to the occupants of adjacent property.
      (4)   All trash receptacles shall be adequately screened in compliance
with the regulations set forth in Chapter
1155.
      (5)   Grading and surface drainage provisions shall be prepared by a
registered engineer and reviewed or approved by the City Engineer.
      (6)   In a residential district, on lots of one acre or more, all points
of entrance or exit should be no closer than 50 feet from an intersection.
      (7)   A building permitted to exceed the maximum height set forth for the
district in which the building is located shall have adequate building setbacks
to ensure that the surrounding area is not negatively impacted by the
additional building height.
1145.04  SCHEDULE OF MINIMUM LOT AND YARD DIMENSIONS FOR CONDITIONAL USES IN
PARK AND INSTITUTIONAL DISTRICT.
   Schedule
1145.04 sets forth regulations governing minimum lot area, minimum lot width
and minimum yard requirements for principal and accessory buildings and parking
areas for conditional uses in a Park and Institutional district.  Supplemental
requirements pertaining to such uses are set forth in Section

have been known to cause undesirable secondary effects on residential and
institutional uses, particularly those where children are present, as well as
adjacent non-adult use oriented retail uses.  Therefore, in order to prevent
potential deterioration in North Canton’s retail areas; and to avoid potential
adverse impacts on residential and institutional uses particularly those where
children are present, and thereby protecting the public health, safety and
welfare, adult uses, as defined in this Section, shall be permitted only in the

that meets any of the following tests:
            1.   The establishment offers for sale items from any two of the
following categories: (a) adult media; (b) lingerie, or (c) leather goods
marketed or presented in a context to suggest their use for sadomasochistic
practices; and the combination of such items constitutes more than 10 percent
of its stock in trade or occupies more than 10 percent of its floor area.
            2.   More than five (5) percent of its stock-in-trade consists of

   1151.01  PURPOSES.
   In the interest of promoting the general health, safety and welfare of the
residents of the City, these regulations are herein established to provide for
the use, location and size of signs in a manner that ensures that signs are in
harmony with the character of the associated use and surrounding area.  More
specifically, the purpose of these regulations is to:
   (a)   Ensure that signs are consistent with the community’s development
objectives, thereby maintaining the community’s heritage.
   (b)   Promote and maintain attractive, high value residential, retail,
institutional, commercial and industrial districts, and preserve the scenic and
natural beauty of designated areas.
   (c)   Provide reasonable, yet appropriate, conditions for identifying
institutions, businesses, and commercial and industrial establishments.
   (d)   Ensure that signs are located and designed to maintain a safe and
orderly pedestrian and vehicular environment.
   (e)   Provide review procedures that enable the City to comprehensively
evaluate the appropriateness of a sign to the site, building and surroundings.
   (f)   Eliminate any confusion or hazardous conflict between identification
signs and traffic control signs and devices.
   (g)   Recognize the commercial communication requirements of all sectors of
the business community.
   (h)   Guarantee equal treatment under the law through accurate record
keeping and consistent enforcement.
   (i)   Provide the businesses and institutions with equitable sign standards,
based on the values of fair competition and aesthetic standards acceptable to
the community.
   (j)   Prohibit all signs not expressly permitted by this Chapter.
   In establishing these purposes, the City has determined no sign shall be
permitted as a main or accessory use except in accordance with the provisions
of this ordinance.  Any sign that does not conform to the regulations of this
Resolution, or any subsequent amendment thereto, is a public nuisance and, as
such, must be abated.  Nonconforming signs are unduly distracting to motorists
and pedestrians, and thereby create a traffic hazard and reduce the
effectiveness of signs needed to direct the public.  The regulations contained
in this Chapter are the minimum regulations necessary to abate the nuisance and
to achieve the stated purpose of this Chapter.

1151.03  COMPUTATIONS.
   The following principals shall control the computation of sign area and sign
height:
   (a)   Determining Sign Area or Dimension.
      (1)   For a sign that is framed, outlined, painted or otherwise prepared
and intended to provide a background for a sign display, the area or dimensions
shall include the entire portion within such background or frame.
      (2)   For a sign comprised of individual letters, figures or elements on
a wall or similar surface of the building or structure, or an irregular shaped
freestanding sign, the area of the sign shall encompass a regular, or a
combination of regular geometric shapes which form or approximate the perimeter
of all the elements in the display.  When separate elements are organized to
form a single sign, but the elements are separated by open space, the area
shall be calculated by determining the geometric form, or combination of forms,
which comprise all the display areas, including the space between the
elements. 
      (3)   The sign area shall include the frame but shall not include the
pole or other structural support unless such pole or structural support is
illuminated or otherwise so designated to constitute a display device.
      (4)   The area for a sign with more than one face shall be computed by
adding together the area of all sign faces visible from any one point.  When
two identical sign faces are placed back to back so that both faces cannot be
viewed from any point at the same time, and when such sign faces are part of
the same sign structure and are not more than 72 inches apart at their
narrowest, the sign area shall be computed by the measurement of one of the
faces.
      (5)   In the event there is a dispute in determining the sign area or any
sign dimension, the Superintendent of Permits and Inspections shall have the
final responsibility for making such determination.
   (b)   Determining Sign Height.  The height of a sign shall be measured from
the base of the sign or supportive structure at its point of attachment to the
ground to the top most element of the sign.  A freestanding sign on a man-made
base, including a graded earth mound, shall be measured from the grade of the
nearest street, drive or parking area.
   (c)   Determining Clearance of a Sign:  The smallest vertical distance
between the grade of the adjacent street or street curb and the lowest point of
any sign, including framework and embellishments, extending over that grade.
   (d)   Determining Building Frontage and Building Unit.  The length of the
building that faces the principal street or the length of the wall of the
building that contains the main entrance to the uses therein shall be
considered the building frontage.
      (1)   The building frontage shall be measured along the front wall
between the exterior faces of the exterior sidewalls.   
      (2)   In the case of an irregular wall surface, a straight line extended
along such wall surface shall be used to measure the length.
      (3)   For lots fronting on two or more streets, or where the building has
its main entrance on a wall other than the wall that faces the street, the
building frontage shall be calculated separately for each building wall facing
a street or having a main entrance.  The sign area that is located on a
particular building wall shall not exceed the area permitted for such building
wall.
      (4)   For multi-tenant buildings, the portion of a building that is owned
or leased by a single tenant shall be considered a building unit.  The building
frontage for a building unit shall be measured from the centerline of the party
walls defining the building unit.  (Ord. 50-03.  Passed 5-12-03; Ord. 58-18. 
Passed 10-29-18.)
1151.04  MAXIMUM SIGN AREA PERMITTED.
   Signs as permitted in the respective zoning districts shall conform to the
maximum area limitations set forth in Schedule
1151.05, in compliance with the regulations set forth below.
   (a)   Business/Institution Identification Signs.  The area of business
identification signs shall comply with the following:

            1.   This maximum area shall be the sum of the areas of all
identification signs attached to the building including projecting signs,
marquee signs, awning signs, and canopy signs, except as otherwise specified,
and shall include the area of instructional signs unless the Superintendent of
Permits determines that such instructional signs are exempt pursuant to
subsection (b) below. 
            2.   Notwithstanding the above standard, each building shall be
permitted a minimum of 30 square feet of identification signs attached to the
building.
         B.   Certain types of signs shall be further limited in size according
to Schedule
1151.05.

1151.07 and
1151.08.
      (3)   Window Signs. The maximum area for permanent identification signs
placed in or painted on a window shall be the percentage of the window area
specified in Schedule
1151.05.
   (b)   Instructional Signs.  The area of instructional signs that are clearly
intended for instructional purposes, as determined by the Superintendent of
Permits, shall not be included in the sum of the area of identification signs,
provided such signs comply with the following: 
      (1)   The sign is not larger than necessary to serve the intended
instructional purpose; and
      (2)   The sign is not in a location and does not possess design
characteristics that constitute or serve the purposes of an identification
sign.
   (c)   Architectural Features.  Architectural features that are either part
of the building or part of a freestanding structure are not considered signs
and are thus exempt from these regulations.  An architectural feature is any
construction attending to, but not an integral part of the sign, and which may
consist of landscape or building or structural forms complementing the site in
general.

movement of vehicular traffic;
   (b)   To promote the safety and convenience of pedestrians and shoppers by
separating parking areas and extensive car movements in the vicinity of
pedestrian ways;
   (c)   To protect adjoining residential neighborhoods from on-street parking;
and
   (d)   To promote the general convenience, welfare and prosperity of
residential, business, service and manufacturing developments which depend on
off-street parking facilities.
1153.02  PARKING FACILITIES REQUIRED.
   (a)   Accessory off-street parking facilities, including access driveways,
shall be provided prior to the occupancy of such building or use.  Facilities
shall be provided for the entire building or use in accordance with the
regulations contained in this Chapter whenever:
      (1)   A building is constructed or a new use established.
      (2)   The use of an existing building is changed to a use requiring more
parking facilities.

and shall not be reduced below the required size as long as the principal use
remains, unless an equivalent number of spaces are provided for said use in
another approved location.
1153.03  UNITS OF MEASURE.
   In computing the number of parking spaces required by this Ordinance, the
following rules shall apply:
   (a)   Floor Area.  Where floor area is designated as the standard for
determining parking space requirements, gross floor area shall be used for all
land uses.
   (b)   Seats.  The number of seating units installed or indicated, or each 24
lineal inches of benches, pews, or space for loose chairs or similar seating
facilities.

space requirements, employees shall mean the sum of all employees on any two
successive shifts.
   (d)   Fractional Numbers.  Where the computation results in a fractional
unit, one additional off-street parking space shall be provided.
   (e)   Parking for Mixed Uses.  A building or group of buildings containing 2
or more uses, operating normally during the same hours, and which have
different off-street parking requirements, may jointly provide spaces for not
less than the sum of the spaces required for each use.
1153.04  OFF-STREET PARKING STANDARDS.
   The number of off-street parking spaces for each facility or use shall be
determined by application of the standards noted in Schedule
1153.04.  For a use not specified in this Schedule, the Planning Commission
shall apply the standard for a specified use that the Commission determines to
be most similar to the proposed use.

Notes to Schedule
1153.04:
(a)  A minimum of five (5) spaces is required for each facility other than a
single-family detached, single-family attached or two-family dwelling.
(b)  For the purposes of this Section, a shopping center shall include one or
more multi- tenant building(s) and or group of buildings where the required
parking spaces are provided in a shared parking lot.
1153.05  ALLOWANCE FOR SHARED PARKING.
   The Planning Commission may approve a development plan with a reduction in
the number of parking spaces required if it can be shown that the lesser number
of spaces is appropriate and consistent with these regulations when it is
determined that:
   (a)   In a mixed-use project or a single-use project for which the different
components of the use have different parking requirements, because of varying
peak demands, the uses can be adequately accommodated with a lesser number of
parking spaces than that which is required based on the sum of the various uses
computed separately.
   (b)   The required parking spaces for a proposed use can be accommodated on
an adjacent or nearby site and binding arrangements are made between the
businesses and other property owners that are not normally open, used or
operated during the same hours to share parking facilities in order to meet
their parking requirements.  In such case not more than 50 percent of the
required parking spaces shall be shared.
1153.06  REDUCED STANDARDS FOR MSB, MAIN STREET BUSINESS DISTRICT.
   In recognition of the historic, compact character of buildings in the Main
Street Business District, as well as the less efficient use of the floor area
of those buildings, the Planning Commission may approve a development plan with
a reduction in the requirements of Schedule
1153.04, Required Off Street Parking Spaces.  In making a determination, the
Planning Commission shall consider the following criteria. 
   (a)   The character of the proposed use, the design of the building and the
ability of the proposed use to reinforce the main street environment. 
   (b)   The availability and accessibility of public parking spaces, both on-
street and within public parking lots. 
   (c)   The availability of parking areas on adjacent sites, considering the
hours of operation of the proposed use compared to adjacent uses. 
   (d)   The potential negative impact to the character of the main street
district if the requisite number of parking spaces are provided.
1153.07  DEFERRED CONSTRUCTION OF REQUIRED SPACES.
   If the number of parking spaces required in Schedule
1153.04 for a nonresidential use is substantially larger than the number
anticipated by the applicant and the applicant provides sufficient evidence
that supports the reduced parking needs, a development plan may be approved
with an allowance for the construction of a lesser number of parking spaces
provided that:
   (a)   The total number of spaces initially constructed shall not be less
than 70 percent of the spaces required by Schedule
1153.04.
   (b)   Suitable area(s) are reserved for the construction of the balance of
the total number of spaces otherwise required by Schedule
1153.04.  Such suitable areas shall be illustrated on the development plan in
locations and with landscaping in full compliance with this Zoning Ordinance.
   (c)   The Planning Commission, upon reevaluation of the project's parking
needs, may at any time direct that some or all of the parking spaces identified
in subsection (b) be constructed.
   (d)   Any additional parking shall be provided according to the approved
development plan.
1153.08  LOCATION OF PARKING SPACES.
   In addition to specific requirements contained in each district regulation,
the location of off-street parking facilities shall further be regulated
according to the following provisions:
   (a)   Multi-Family Dwellings. All required off-street parking spaces shall
be located on the same lot.  All dimensions of the required off-street parking
spaces shall be located within 400 feet walking distance of the front entrance
to the dwelling(s) or dwelling unit(s), whichever is closer, for which the
parking spaces are intended to serve.
   (b)   Non-Residential Uses.  All required off-street parking spaces shall be
located on the same lot as the use served.  Where land is not available on the
same lot or adjoining lot, the Commission may approve nearby off-site parking
spaces in accordance with the provisions of this section:
      (1)   For the purposes of these regulations, off-site parking spaces
shall be referred to as satellite spaces.
      (2)   All such satellite spaces, except spaces intended for employee
spaces, shall be located within 400 feet walking distance of a public entrance
of a principal building housing the use for which the parking spaces are
intended to serve. 
      (3)   Satellite parking spaces intended for employee use may be located
within any reasonable distance.
      (4)   All shared parking spaces shall comply with Section
1153.05.
   (c)   Location from Right-of-Way.  No parking of a motor vehicle shall be
permitted nor shall any person park a motor vehicle on a lot within 5 feet of a
public right-of- way.
1153.09  OFF-STREET WAITING SPACES FOR DRIVE-THRU FACILITIES.
   Drive-thru establishments and other establishments which, by their nature,
create lines of customers waiting to be served within automobiles shall provide
off-street waiting areas, on the same lot as the use, in addition to the
required number of parking spaces specified in Schedule
1153.04, in accordance with the following:
   (a)   Minimum Number of Waiting Spaces:
 
(1)     Establishments serving and/or selling food and/or drinks:             8 waiting

CHAPTER 1159
Nonconforming Uses, Buildings, Lots and Structures
1159.01   Purpose.
1159.02   Maintenance and repair of structures.
1159.03   Nonconforming use of buildings and land.
1159.04   Nonconforming buildings or structures.
1159.05   Nonconforming parking facilities.
1159.06   Nonconforming signs.
1159.07   Nonconforming lots.
1159.08   Nonconforming use due to reclassification.
1159.09   Change from nonconforming use.
1159.10   Determination of nonconforming status.
1159.11   Existing use deemed conditional use; permit required for change.
1159.12   Completion of construction with zoning certificate.
 
1159.01  PURPOSE.
   (a)   The purpose of this Chapter is to recognize the existence of uses,
buildings, lots and structures that lawfully existed at the time of this
Ordinance’s enactment, or amendment thereto, but which now do not conform with
one or more of the regulations contained in this Ordinance.  Nonconforming
status is considered to be incompatible with permitted uses in the zoning
district in which it exists.  Therefore, nonconforming uses, buildings, lots,
and structures are subject to regulations limiting their use, restoration,
reconstruction, extension, and substitution.  Such nonconforming status shall
be continued only in conformance with this Chapter.
   (b)   A nonconforming lot, use, building or structure does not include
nonconformity with regulations pursuant to a legally granted variance from a
zoning regulation.
1159.02  MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR OF STRUCTURES.
   Ordinary repairs, or repair or replacement of non-bearing walls, fixtures,
wiring, or plumbing may be performed on a nonconforming structure or on any
portion of a structure that contains a nonconforming use provided that the
cubic content shall not be increased and no structural parts shall be replaced
except when required by law to restore such building or structure to a safe
condition or to make the building or structure conform to the regulations of
the district in which it is located.
1159.03  NONCONFORMING USE OF BUILDINGS AND LAND.
   A nonconforming use may continue so long as it remains otherwise lawful and
does not constitute a public nuisance, subject to the following provisions:
   (a)   Alteration or Reconstruction of a Building Occupied by a Nonconforming
Use.  No building or structure occupied by a nonconforming use shall be
altered, improved or reconstructed except when the cumulative cost of the
alteration, improvement or reconstruction does not exceed 50% of the building’s
replacement value.
   (b)   Expansion or Relocation of Nonconforming Use of Land.  A nonconforming
use of land shall not be physically enlarged, increased, extended, or relocated
to a part of the lot that was not occupied by the use at the time it became
nonconforming.  No additional structures shall be constructed in connection
with such nonconforming use.
   (c)   Expansion or Relocation of Nonconforming Use of Structures.  A
nonconforming use of an existing structure may be extended throughout any parts
of a building that were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the
time of adoption or amendment to this Ordinance.  However, no such use shall be
extended to occupy any land outside such building not previously occupied by
such nonconforming use, and no such building shall be enlarged or expanded to
increase the nonconforming use.
   (d)   Change or Substitution of Use.  A nonconforming use of a building,
structure or land shall not be changed or substituted to another nonconforming
use unless the Zoning Board of Appeals, on appeal, finds that the use proposed
is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the existing
nonconforming use, and that the use proposed is in less conflict with the
character of uses permitted in the applicable zoning district than the existing
nonconforming use.  In permitting such change, the Zoning Board of Appeals may
require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accordance with other
provisions of this Ordinance. Whenever a nonconforming use is changed to a less
intensive use, such use shall not thereafter be changed to a more intensive
nonconforming use.
   (e)   Discontinuance of Use.  Discontinuance of the nonconforming use of a
building, part of a building, lot or part of a lot for a continuous period of
two (2) years or longer shall constitute voluntary abandonment of such use and
thereafter any use of the premises shall conform to the use regulations of the
district in which the building or lot is located.
1159.04  NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS OR STRUCTURES.
   A nonconforming building or structure may continue to be used or occupied by
a use permitted in the district in which it is located so long as it remains
otherwise lawful and does not constitute a public nuisance, subject to the
following provisions:
   (a)   Additions and Moving.  A nonconforming building or structure shall not
be added to, enlarged or moved unless the addition(s) or part(s) moved is made
to conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located.
   (b)   Restoration of Damaged Building or Structure.  If a nonconforming
building or structure is damaged or destroyed by any cause, those portions so
destroyed or damaged may be restored to the original footprint and floor area
of the building or structure provided the cumulative replacement costs do not
exceed 50% of the replacement cost of the building or structure at the time of
such damage.  Any restoration that exceeds the original footprint and/or floor
area shall be constructed in a manner that conforms to the regulations of the
district in which the structure is located.  All repairs and restorations shall
be in compliance with the following conditions:
      (1)   A zoning certificate authorizing such restoration shall be
obtained.
      (2)   Such restoration shall be completed within a period of one year
from the date of damage or destruction.
      (3)   Such restoration shall not cause a new nonconformity, nor shall it
increase the degree of nonconformity or noncompliance existing prior to such
damage or destruction.
1159.05  NONCONFORMING PARKING FACILITIES.
   A building or use existing lawfully at the time this Zoning Ordinance or an
amendment thereto became or becomes effective that does not comply with the
off-street parking regulations for the use may continue without such parking
facilities.  In the event an existing building is altered or a use is changed
or substituted in accordance with these regulations, then additional off-
street parking spaces shall be provided so that the nonconforming parking
condition is not increased.
1159.06  NONCONFORMING SIGNS.
   A sign, lawfully existing at the time this Zoning Ordinance, or any
amendment thereto, became or becomes effective, but which fails to conform to
the sign regulations of the district in which it is located is a nonconforming
sign.  Nonconforming signs shall comply with the regulations set forth in
Section
1151.16.
1159.07  NONCONFORMING LOTS.
   A lot of record that does not comply on the effective date of this Zoning
Ordinance or any amendment thereto with the lot area or lot width regulations
of the district in which the lot is located may be used as follows:
   (a)   Existing Buildings on Lots of Record.
      (1)   Existing Dwelling on a Residential Lot.  If the lot is occupied by
a dwelling, such dwelling shall be maintained and may be repaired, modernized
or altered, provided that the building shall not be enlarged in floor area
unless the enlarged section(s) complies with all regulations of this Zoning
Ordinance, except the lot area and lot width regulations of the district in
which the lot is located.  The number of dwelling units shall not be increased
unless all regulations, including lot area, are complied with.
      (2)   Existing Building on a Nonresidential Lot.  If the lot is occupied
by a building, such building shall be maintained and may be repaired,
modernized or altered, provided that the building shall not be enlarged in
floor area unless the enlarged section(s) complies with all regulations of this
Zoning Ordinance, except the lot area and lot width regulations of the district
in which the lot is located.
   (b)   Vacant Single Nonconforming Lot of Record. 
      (1)   A vacant non-conforming lot in a “R” district that is in separate
ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership
shall be permitted to be developed as a site for a single-family dwelling
provided that the dwelling and its accessory uses comply with all regulations
of this Zoning Ordinance, except for the lot area and lot width regulations of
the district in which the lot is located. Review and approval of development on
such lots of record shall be conducted according to the procedures set forth in
Chapter
1173.
      (2)   A vacant nonconforming lot in an “RMF” or non-residential district
may be used for any use permitted in the district in which it is located when
the development of such lot meets all requirements of the district in which it
is located, including the maximum lot coverage and minimum yard requirements,
except for the minimum lot area and lot width requirements.  No use that
requires a greater lot size than the established minimum lot size for a
particular district shall be permitted on a nonconforming lot.  Review and
approval of development on such lots of record shall be conducted according to
the development plan review requirements set forth in Chapter
1175.
   (c)   Lots in Combination.  If a vacant nonconforming lot adjoins one or
more lots in common ownership on the effective date of this Ordinance or
applicable amendment thereto, such lot shall be replatted to create conforming
lots as a prerequisite for development.
1159.08  NONCONFORMING USE DUE TO RECLASSIFICATION.
   The provisions of this chapter shall also apply to any building, structure,
land or other use hereafter becoming nonconforming as a result of amendments
made to this Zoning Ordinance or Zoning Map.
1159.09  CHANGE FROM NONCONFORMING USE.
   A nonconforming building or use shall cease to be considered as such
whenever it first comes into compliance with the regulations of the district in
which it is located.  Upon such compliance, no nonconforming use shall be made,
resumed or reinstated.
1159.10  DETERMINATION OF NONCONFORMING STATUS.
   At the time of application for a zoning certificate or request for variance,
or upon the request of the Superintendent of Permits and Inspection regarding a
nonconforming lot, building, structure or use, the property owner shall submit
sufficient evidence to verify that such lot, building, structure, or use was
lawfully created or established in accordance with the zoning regulations in
existence at that time.  If the evidence submitted indicates the lot, building,
structure or use was legally established and has since become nonconforming
because of the establishment of or amendment to this Ordinance, the
Superintendent of Permits and Inspection shall issue a Certificate of
Nonconforming Use.  This certificate shall specify the reason why the use,
building, structure or lot is nonconforming, and for nonconforming uses shall
also include a description of the extent and kind of use made of the property
in question, the portion of the structure or land used for the nonconforming
use, and the extent that dimensional requirements are nonconforming.
1159.11  EXISTING USE DEEMED CONDITIONAL USE; PERMIT REQUIRED FOR CHANGE.
   Any lawfully existing use that, at the time of its establishment, was not
classified as a conditional use, but which now, because of the passage of this
Zoning Ordinance or amendment thereto, is listed as a conditional use in the
district in which it is located, shall be deemed without further action to be a
conforming conditional use.  Any change, modification, enlargement or
alteration of such use, site development conditions or signs shall only be
permitted upon review and approval by the Planning Commission according to the
procedures for conditional uses set forth in Chapter
1177.
1159.12  COMPLETION OF CONSTRUCTION WITH ZONING CERTIFICATE.
   Nothing in this Zoning Ordinance shall prohibit the completion of the
construction and use of buildings for which a zoning certificate has been
issued prior to the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance, or amendments
thereto, provided that construction is commenced within 90 days after the
issuance of such certificate, that construction is carried on diligently and
without interruption and the entire building is completed within two years
after the issuance of the zoning certificate.  Actual construction is hereby
defined to include the placing of construction materials in permanent position
and fastened in a permanent manner.  Where demolition or removal of an existing
building has begun preparatory to rebuilding, such demolition or removal shall
be deemed to be actual construction.

Zoning Ordinance. 
   (a)   The Planning Commission may consider elements of a final development
plan to be equivalent to a requirement if:
      (1)   The proposed final development plan substantially complies with all
specific requirements and with the purposes, intent and basic objectives of the
zoning district;
      (2)   Through imaginative and skillful design in the arrangement of
buildings, open space, streets, access drives and other features, as disclosed
by the application, the proposal results in a development of equivalent or
higher quality than that which could be achieved through strict application of
such standards and requirements; and
      (3)   The development, as proposed, shall have no adverse impact upon the
surrounding properties or upon the health, safety or general welfare of the
community.

When evaluating the application with respect to this Section, the Planning
Commission shall make any finding of equivalency in writing which explains how
and why the proposal has satisfied the above criteria.  When making such
finding, the Commission may approve the proposed application, including waivers
from the numerical standards herein, as if the application were in strict
compliance with the standards and requirements in this Zoning Ordinance.
1175.14  SIGNIFICANCE OF AN APPROVED PLAN; PLAN REVISIONS.
   An approved final development plan shall become for the proposed development
a binding commitment of the specific elements approved for development.  The
approved development plan may be transferred to another person, corporation, or
group of individuals or corporations prior to the issuance of a building
permit.  A request for such a transfer or change of ownership shall be
presented to the Superintendent of Permits and Inspection and granted only if
the new ownership entity satisfies the administrative, financial, legal and all
other performance guarantees approved with the original development plan.  All
construction and development under any building permit shall be in accordance
with the approved plan. 
   Any departure from such plan shall be cause for revocation of the Zoning
Certificate.  Any changes in an approved plan shall be resubmitted for approval
in accordance with this Chapter.
1175.15  EXPIRATION OF DEVELOPMENT PLAN APPROVAL.
   An approved development plan shall remain valid for a period of 12 months
following the date of its approval or as otherwise specifically approved by the
Planning Commission.
   (a)   General Development Plan.  If, at the end of that time, a final
development plan has not been submitted to the Superintendent of Permits and
Inspection, then approval of the general development plan shall expire and
shall be of no effect unless resubmitted and reapproved in accordance with this
Chapter.
   (b)   Final Development Plan.  If, at the end of that time, construction of
the development has not begun, then approval of such final development plan
shall expire and shall be of no effect unless resubmitted and reapproved in
accordance with the procedures set forth in this Chapter.  Construction is
deemed to have begun when all necessary excavation and piers or footings of one
or more principal buildings included in the plan have been completed.
1175.16  BONDING.
   A performance bond or other financial guarantee shall be placed with the
Director of Finance to insure that all landscaping, fences, walls, lighting,
outdoor storage areas, sanitary sewer lines, water lines, including fire
hydrants, drainage and storm water management as shown on the Final Development
Plan, as approved, be installed in conformance with said Plan as approved. 
Said bond or financial guarantee shall be equal to 125% of the estimated cost,
when larger than $5,000.00 as determined by the City Engineer.
1175.17  APPEALS TO THE COURT OF COMMON PLEAS.
   Decisions by the Planning Commission granting or denying approval of
development plans shall be final.  Appeals shall be subject to judicial review
by the Court of Common Pleas of Stark County, Ohio, in accordance with the laws

not the proposed use is appropriate and in keeping with the purpose and intent
of this Zoning Ordinance.
   (a)       The Planning Commission shall review the development plan for the
proposed conditional use according to the development plan review procedures
and criteria set forth in Chapter
1175, as applicable;
   (b)     The Planning Commission shall review the application to determine if
the establishment and operation of the proposed use complies with the general
criteria established for all conditional uses and the specific requirements
established for that particular use, as set forth in Chapter
1145 of this Zoning Ordinance; and
   (c)       The Planning Commission may require the applicant to submit such
additional information as deemed necessary including the carrying out of
special studies and the provisions of expert advice.
      (Ord. 34-13.  Passed 6-10-13.)
1177.05  PUBLIC HEARING AND NOTICE BY PLANNING COMMISSION.
   The Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing on the proposed
conditional use.  Notice of such public hearing shall be given by first class
mail to the applicant and to the property owners within 200 feet of the
property on which the use is proposed.  Further notice shall be given in one or
more newspapers of general circulation in the city.  All notices shall be made
at least seven days before the date of said public hearing.  All notices shall
set forth the time and place of the public hearing and the nature of the
proposed conditional use.  Failure of delivery of such notice shall not
invalidate action taken on such application.
(Ord. 34-13.  Passed 6-10-13.)
1177.06  ACTION BY PLANNING COMMISSION.
   (a)       The Planning Commission shall take one of the following actions:
      (1)       If the proposed conditional use is determined by the Planning
Commission to be appropriate and in conformance with the review criteria
outlined in Section
1175.08, the Planning Commission shall:
         A.   Approve the conditional use application as submitted.
         B.   Approve the conditional use application subject to specific
conditions not included in the application as submitted.  The Planning
Commission may prescribe appropriate conditions, stipulations, safeguards and
limitations on the duration of the use as it may deem necessary and in
conformance with the intent and purposes of Chapter
1145.  The Planning Commission may require the applicant to revise and resubmit
the application and/or the development plan to respond to the Planning
Commission's condition(s) prior to the Planning Commission's final action.
      (2)   If the proposed conditional use is found not to be in compliance
with the specifications of this Zoning Ordinance, the Planning Commission shall
deny the application.
   (b)       If the Planning Commission fails to act within 60 days from the

agreed upon, then the applicant may deem the development denied.
(Ord. 34-13.  Passed 6-10-13.)
1177.07  TERMS AND DURATION OF CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT.
   A conditional use permit shall authorize a particular conditional use on a
specific parcel for which it was approved.  The conditional use permit shall
expire one year from the date of enactment, unless substantial progress is
accomplished or as otherwise specifically approved by the Planning Commission. 
A conditional use permit issued pursuant to this Chapter shall be valid only
for the use and the operation of such use as specified on the certificate.  The
breach of any condition, safeguard or requirement shall constitute a violation
of this Zoning Ordinance.
(Ord. 34-13.  Passed 6-10-13.)
1177.08  REAPPLICATION.
   No re-application for a conditional use permit shall be accepted by the
Superintendent of Permits and Inspection until the expiration of one year after
the denial, unless the re-application reflects changes to the operation,
design, layout, or other aspect of the proposed conditional use in response to
the reasons for the denial of the previous application or the re-application is
based on a change in circumstances from the time of the previous public hearing
that is sufficient to justify another hearing as determined by the Planning
Commission.  A re-application shall comply with all the requirements of this
Chapter, including payment of the required fee.
(Ord. 34-13.  Passed 6-10-13.)
1177.09  SIMILAR USES.
   Within each zoning district established by the Zoning Ordinance and
amendments thereto, uses of land or structures that are compatible with each
other are permitted in the district.  To the extent that new types of uses are
created and are not addressed by this Zoning Ordinance, this section provides
the procedure by which the Planning Commission may make a determination that a
new use is similar to a use permitted in a district.
   (a)   Determination. A proposed use may be permitted as a similar use when
the Planning Commission determines that such proposed use is in compliance with
the following provisions:
      (1)   The proposed use is not prohibited in any other district;
      (2)   The proposed use is not listed as a permitted building or use in
any other district;
      (3)   The proposed use conforms to and is consistent with the purpose
statement of the proposed district more appropriately than in any other
district;

uses in the district to which it is proposed or is similar to a specific use
permitted in that district.
   (b)   Procedure. The Planning Commission shall review the proposed use
according to the conditional use procedures set forth in Sections
1177.02  through
1177.08,  including the requirement for a public hearing. 
   (c)   Action by Planning Commission. The Planning Commission shall, within
10 days after its hearing, forward a recommendation to City Council.  The
Planning Commission shall recommend that Council approve, approve with
modifications or deny the application for a similar use determination and
provide the reasons for their decision.  (Ord. 34-13.  Passed 6-10-13.)
1177.10  ACTION BY CITY COUNCIL.
   Council shall, at a regular meeting, take action on the Planning
Commission's recommendation.

1179.10  VARIANCES.
   Any request for a variance shall be considered an appeal.  The Zoning Board

   (a)   Application Requirements.  An application for a variance shall be
filed with the Superintendent of Permits and Inspection for review by the
Zoning Board of Appeals upon the forms provided, and shall be accompanied by
the following requirements necessary to convey the reason(s) for the requested
variance:
      (1)   Name, address and phone number of applicant(s);
      (2)   Proof of ownership, legal interest or written authority;
      (3)   Description of property or portion thereof;
      (4)   Description or nature of variance requested;
      (5)   Narrative statements establishing and substantiating the
justification for the variance pursuant to subsection (c) below;
      (6)   Site plans, floor plans, elevations and other drawings at a
reasonable scale to convey the need for the variance;
      (7)   Payment of the application fee as established by Council;
      (8)   For an Area Variance: A list of all owners of property adjoining or
across the street from the property on which the variance is proposed,
including their addresses and permanent parcel numbers;
      (9)   For a Use Variance:  A list of all owners of property lying within

including their addresses and permanent parcel numbers;
      (10)   Any other documents deemed necessary by the Superintendent of
Permits and Inspection.
   (b)   Review for Completeness.  Upon receipt of a written request for
variance, the Superintendent of Permits and Inspection shall make a preliminary
determination whether such application provides the information necessary for
review and evaluation.  If it is determined that such application does not
provide the information necessary for such review and evaluation, the
Superintendent of Permits and Inspection shall within seven (7) days so advise
the applicant of the deficiencies and shall not further process the application
until the deficiencies are corrected.
   (c)   Review by the Board.  According to the procedures established for
appeals in Sections
1179.03 and
1179.04, the Board shall hold a public hearing and give notice of the same. 
The Board shall review each application for a variance to determine if it
complies with the purpose and intent of this Ordinance and evidence
demonstrates that the literal enforcement of this Ordinance will result in
practical difficulty for an area variance or unnecessary hardship for a use
variance. 
      (1)   Area Variance. The following factors shall be considered and
weighed by the Board to determine practical difficulty:
         A.   Whether special conditions and circumstances exist which are
peculiar to the land or structure involved and which are not applicable
generally to other lands or structures in the same zoning district.  Examples
of such special conditions or circumstances are exceptional irregularity,
narrowness, shallowness or steepness of the lot, or adjacency to non-conforming
and inharmonious uses, structures or conditions;
         B.   Whether the property in question will yield a reasonable return
or whether there can be any beneficial use of the property without the
variance;
         C.   Whether the variance is substantial and is the minimum necessary
to make possible the reasonable use of the land or structures;
         D.   Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be
substantially altered or whether adjoining properties would suffer substantial
detriment as a result of the variance;
         E.   Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of
governmental services such as water, sewer, trash pickup;
         F.   Whether the property owner purchased the property with knowledge
of the zoning restrictions;
         G.   Whether special conditions or circumstances exist as a result of
actions of the owner;
         H.   Whether the property owner's predicament feasibly can be obviated
through some method other than a variance;
         I.   Whether the spirit and intent behind the zoning requirement would
be observed and substantial justice done by granting a variance; and
         J.   Whether the granting of the variance requested will confer on the
applicant any special privilege that is denied by this regulation to other
lands, structures, or buildings in the same district.
      (2)   Use Variance.  In order to grant a use variance, the Zoning Board
of Appeals shall determine that strict compliance with the terms of this
Ordinance will result in unnecessary hardship to the applicant.  The applicant
must demonstrate such hardship by clear and convincing evidence that all of the
following criteria are satisfied:
         A.   The property cannot be put to any economically viable use under
any of the permitted uses in the zoning district in which the property is
located;
         B.   The variance requested stems from a condition which is unique to
the property at issue and not ordinarily found in the same zone or district;
         C.   The hardship condition is not created by actions of the
applicant;
         D.   The granting of the variance will not adversely affect the rights
of adjacent property owners or residents;
         E.   The granting of the variance will not adversely affect the public
health, safety or general welfare;
         F.   The variance will be consistent with the general spirit and
intent of the Ordinance; and
         G.   The variance sought is the minimum that will afford relief to the
applicant.
   (d)   Requests for Additional Information.    The Zoning Board of Appeals
may request that the applicant supply additional information that the Board
deems necessary to review and evaluate the request for a variance.

1307.01  GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization.  Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens. Therefore, the Council the City of North Canton, State of Ohio, does
ordain as follows:
   (b)   Findings of Fact.  The City of North Canton has special flood hazard
areas that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life
and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection
and relief, and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are
inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such
damages and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations
are adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose.  It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)    Protect human life and health;
      (2)    Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)    Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)    Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)    Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)    Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use an
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)    Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)    Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and 
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program. 
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss.  In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other  areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply.  These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of
North Canton as identified in subsection (f) hereof, including any  additional
areas of special flood hazard annexed by the City of North Canton. 
   (f)        Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard.  For
the purposes of these regulations, the following studies and / or maps are
adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study Stark County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas and
Flood Insurance Rate Map of Stark County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas, both
effective September 29, 2011.
      (2)     Other studies and / or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
      (3)     Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City of North Canton as required by Section
1307.04(c) Subdivisions and Large Scale Developments.
      (4)   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps
and/or studies are on file at 220 West Maple Street, North Canton, Ohio.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.  These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances (resolutions) including Subdivision
Regulations, Zoning or Building Codes. In the event of a conflict between these
regulations and any other ordinance (resolution), the more restrictive shall be
followed. These regulations shall not impair any deed restriction covenant or
easement but the land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the
regulations. 
   (h)   Interpretation.  In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state  statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.  The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the City of North Canton, any officer or employee thereof, or the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from
reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.
   (j)   Severability.  Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid."  (Ord. 67-
11.  Passed 6-27-11.)
1307.02  DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
      (1)   “Accessory Structure” means a structure on the same lot with, and
of a nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
      (2)   “Appeal” means a request for review of the Floodplain
Administrator's interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a
request for a variance.
      (3)   “Base  Flood” means the flood having a one percent chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year. The base flood may also be referred to
as the 1% chance annual flood or one-hundred (100) year flood.
      (4)   “Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation” (BFE) means the water surface
elevation of the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the
National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum
of 1988, and usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In Zone AO areas,
the base flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number
(from 1 to 3 feet).
      (5)   “Basement” means any area of the building having its floor subgrade
(below ground level) on all sides.
      (6)   “Development” means any manmade change to improved or unimproved
real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures,
mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations
or storage of equipment or materials.
      (7)   “Enclosure Below the Lowest Floor”.  See "Lowest Floor."
      (8)   “Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management).”  Issued by
President Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted
activities be conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special
flood hazard areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
      (9)   “Federal Emergency Management Agency” (FEMA) means the agency with
the overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance
Program.
      (10)   “Fill” means a deposit of earth material placed by artificial
means.
      (11)   “Flood” or “Flooding” means a general and temporary condition of
partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
         A.   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
         B.   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters
from any source.
      (12)   “Flood Hazard Boundary Map” (FHBM) usually means the initial map,
produced by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special
flood hazard areas.
      (13)   “Flood Insurance Rate Map” (FIRM) means an official map on which
the Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
      (14)   “Flood Insurance Risk Zones.” Zone designations on FHBMs and FlRMs
that indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a
community. Following are the zone definitions:
         A.   Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; base flood elevations are not determined.
         B.   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
         C.   Zone AO: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
         D.   Zone AH: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
         E.   Zone A99:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
         F.   Zone B and Zone X (shaded): Areas of 500-year flood; areas
subject to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with
contributing drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
         G.   Zone  C and Zone X (unshaded): Areas determined to be outside the
500-year floodplain. 
      (15)   “Flood Insurance Study” (FIS) means the official report in which
the Federal Emergency  Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes
shown on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of
the base flood.
      (16)   “Flood Protection Elevation.”  The Flood Protection Elevation, or
FPE, is the base flood elevation plus one foot of freeboard. In areas where no
base flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection
elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood elevations
determined and/or approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (17)   “Floodway” is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
      The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized
by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces. 
      (18)   “Freeboard” means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet
above a flood level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends
to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood
heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and
floodway conditions, such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris
and ice jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
      (19)   “Historic structure” means any structure that is:
         A.   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places
(a listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
         B.   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
         C.   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      (20)   “Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis” means an analysis
performed by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in
accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to
determine flood elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
      (21)   “Letter of Map Change (LOMC).” A Letter of Map Change is an
official FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood
Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance
Studies. LOMC's are broken down into the following categories:
         A.   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA). A revision based on technical
data showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special
flood hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map
and establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood
hazard area.
         B.   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR). A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
         C.   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR).  A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
      (22)   “Lowest floor” means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure
below the lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area
other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance
with the applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for
enclosures below the lowest floor.
      (23)   “Manufactured home” means a structure, transportable in one or
more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use
with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required
utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational
vehicle". For the purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes
manufactured homes and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio
Revised Code.
      (24)   “Manufactured home park” as specified in the Ohio Administrative
Code 3701-27-01, means any tract of land upon which three or more manufactured
homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of charge or for revenue
purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure, vehicle, or enclosure
used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the park. A tract of land
that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for rent or rented, but are
for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of manufactured homes on the
lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though three or more manufactured
homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are dedicated to the local government
authority.
      (25)   “National Flood Insurance Program” (NFIP) means a Federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
      (26)   “New construction” means structures for which the "start of
construction" commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of
North Canton Flood Insurance Rate Map, November 3, 1982, and includes any
subsequent improvements to such structures.
      (27)   “Person” includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and
local governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in Ohio R.C.
111.15 as any governmental entity of the State and includes, but is not limited
to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council,
institution, state college or university, community college district, technical
college district, or state community college. "Agency" does not include the
General Assembly, the Controlling Board, the Adjutant General's Department, or
any court.
      (28)   “Recreational vehicle” means a vehicle which is:
         A.   Built on a single chassis,
         B.   400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection,
         C.   Designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck, and
         D.   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
      (29)   “Registered Professional Architect” means a person registered to
engage in the practice of architecture under the provisions of Ohio R.C.
4703.01 to 4703.19.
      (30)   “Registered Professional Engineer” means a person registered as a
professional engineer under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4733.
      (31)   “Registered Professional Surveyor” means a person registered as a
professional surveyor under Ohio R.C. 4733.
      (32)   “Special Flood Hazard Area.”  Also known as "Areas of Special
Flood Hazard", it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or
greater chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are
designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate
Maps, Flood Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood
Hazard Boundary Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. Special flood
hazard areas may also refer to areas that are floodprone and designated from
other federal state or local sources of data including but not limited to
historical flood information reflecting high water marks, previous flood
inundation areas, and floodprone soils associated with a watercourse.
      (33)   “Start of construction” means the date the building permit was
issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
      (34)   “Structure” means a walled and roofed building, manufactured home,
or gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
      (35)   “Substantial Damage” means damage of any origin sustained by a
structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged
condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure
before the damage occurred.
      (36)   “Substantial Improvement” means any reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of
which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before
the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures
which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The term does not, however, include:
         A.   Any improvement to a structure which is considered "new
construction;"
         B.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
         C.   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
      (37)   “Variance” means a grant of relief from the standards of these
regulations consistent with the variance conditions herein.
      (38)   “Violation” means the failure of a structure or other development
to be fully compliant with these regulations.
         (Ord. 87-04.  Passed 6-28-04.)
1307.03  ADMINISTRATION.
   (a)   Designation of the Floodplain Administrator.  The City Engineer is

by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations
but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to subsection (j)(1)A.
hereof.
      (2)   Right to submit new technical data.  The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of the City
of North Canton and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/detachment.  Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the City
of North Canton have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed
authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the City
of North Canton's Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represents the City of
North Canton boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of
the City of North Canton suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new
corporate limits or the new area for which the City of North Canton has assumed

   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation.  The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and / or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceeds the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1307.05, Appeals and Variances.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations.  Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including tornado, wind, heavy snow, flood, fire, etc.
After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to 
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process.
These measures include issuing press releases, public service announcements,
and other public information materials related to the floodplain development
permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal,
state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations;
providing owners of damaged structures materials and other information related
to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and
assist owners of substantially damaged structures with Increased Cost of
Compliance insurance claims.

            11.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
         B.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
            1.    A showing of good and sufficient cause.
            2.    A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the
property. Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
            3.    A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these
regulations; additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense,
nuisances, fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing
local laws.
            4.    A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
            5.    A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
         C.   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of 
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations. 
      (3)   Other conditions for variances.
         A.    Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.    Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in subsection (d)(2)A.1. to 11.
hereof have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half
acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
         C.    Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The Administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court.  Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Stark Court of Common Pleas, as provided
in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.
(Ord. 87-04.  Passed 6-28-04.)
1307.06  ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   Compliance Required.
      (1)   No structure or land shall hereafter be located, erected,
constructed, reconstructed, repaired, extended, converted, enlarged or altered
without full compliance with the terms of these regulations and all other
applicable regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of these
regulations, unless specifically exempted from filing for a development permit
as stated in Section
1307.03(i).
      (2)   Failure to obtain a floodplain development permit shall be a
violation of these regulations and shall be punishable in accordance with
subsection (c) hereof.
      (3)    Floodplain development permits issued on the basis of plans and
applications approved by the Floodplain Administrator authorize only the use,
and arrangement, set forth in such approved plans and applications or
amendments thereto. Use, arrangement, or construction contrary to that
authorized shall be deemed a violation of these regulations and punishable in
accordance with subsection (c) hereof.
   (b)   Notice of Violation.  Whenever the Floodplain Administrator determines
that there has been a violation of any provision of these regulations, he shall
give notice of such violation to the person responsible therefor and order

order shall:
      (1)   Be put in writing on an appropriate form;
      (2)   Include a list of violations, referring to the section or sections
of these regulations that have been violated, and order remedial action which,
if taken, will effect compliance with the provisions of these regulations;
      (3)   Specify a reasonable time for performance;
      (4)   Advise the owner, operator, or occupant of the right to appeal;
      (5)   Be served on the owner, occupant, or agent in person. However, this
notice and order shall be deemed to be properly served upon the owner,
occupant, or agent if a copy thereof is sent by registered or certified mail to
the person's last known mailing address, residence, or place of business, and/
or a copy is posted in a conspicuous place in or on the dwelling affected.
      
   (c)   Violations and Penalties.  Violation of the provisions of these
regulations or failure to comply with any of its requirements shall be deemed
to be a strict liability offense, and shall constitute a fourth degree
misdemeanor. Any person who violates these regulations or fails to comply with
any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined or imprisoned as
provided by the laws of the City of North Canton. Each day such violation
continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained
shall prevent the City of North Canton from taking such other lawful action as
is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. The City of North Canton shall
prosecute any violation of these regulations in accordance with the penalties
stated herein.

1311.01  PAYMENT OF CLAIMS.
   No insurance company doing business in the State shall pay a claim of a
named insured for fire damage to a structure located within the City where the
amount recoverable for the fire loss to the structure under all insurance
policies exceeds five thousand dollars ($5,000)  and is greater than or equal
to sixty (60%) percent of all fire insurance policy monetary limitations unless
there is compliance with the following procedures:
   (a)   When the loss agreed to between the named insured(s) and the insurance
company(ies) equals or exceeds sixty (60%) percent of the aggregate limits of
the liability on all fire policies covering the building or structure, the
insurance company(ies) in accordance with Ohio R.C. 715.26(F) shall transfer
from the insurance proceeds to the Director of Finance of the City of North
Canton in the aggregate amount of two thousand dollars ($2,000) for each
fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000), and each fraction of that amount, of a
claim, or if at the time of a proof of loss agreed to between the named insured
(s) and the insurance company(ies) the named insured(s) have submitted a
contractor's signed estimate of the costs of removing, repairing, or securing
the building or other structure, shall transfer from the insurance proceeds the
amount specified in the estimate.
      (1)   Such transfer of proceeds shall be on a pro rata basis by all
companies insuring the building or structure.  Policy proceeds remaining after
the transfer to the City may be disbursed in accord with the policy terms.
      (2)   The named insured(s) may submit a contractor's signed estimate of
the costs of removing, repairing, or securing the building or other structure
after the transfer, and the Director of Finance, after notifying the
Superintendent of Permits and  Inspection, shall return the amount of the fund
in excess of the estimate to the named insured(s), provided that the City has
not commenced to remove, repair, or secure the building or other structure.
   (b)   Upon receipt of proceeds by the City as authorized by this section,
the Director of Finance shall place the proceeds in a separate fund to be used
solely as security against the total cost of removing, repairing, or securing
incurred by the City pursuant to Ohio R.C. 715.261.
      (1)   When transferring the fund as required in subsection (a)(1) of this
section, an insurance company shall provide the City with the name and address
of the named insured(s), certify that the proceeds have been received by the
City and notify them that the following procedures will be followed:
         A.   The fund shall be returned by the Director of Finance to the
named insured(s) when repairs or removal, or securing the building or other
structure have been completed and the required proof is received by the
Superintendent of Permits and Inspection, provided that, the city has not
incurred any costs for such repairs, removal, or securing of the building or
other structure, such costs shall be paid from the fund and if excess funds
remain, the City shall transfer the remaining funds to the named insured(s)
after repair, rebuilding, or removal has been completed.  Nothing in this
Section shall be construed to limit the ability of the City to recover any
deficiency under Ohio R.C. 715.261.
