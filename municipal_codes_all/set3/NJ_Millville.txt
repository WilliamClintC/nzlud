that part of the cost of the services rendered. The payment may be
made by a single payment or in installments in such amount as the

failure to make payments shall affect or reduce the rendering of
services.

defendant is set forth in Subsections 13 through 16 of the applicable
state statute. The municipal attorney is authorized to compromise and
settle any claim for services performed pursuant to this act whenever

and settlement.

public defender or court-approved counsel shall pay an application fee
of not more than $200. The Municipal Court may waive the application
fee, in whole or in part, only if the court determines upon a clear and

an unreasonable burden on the person seeking representation. The

specific period of time not to exceed four months.

Public Access to Government Records4
§ 2-48. Policy. [Amended 8-20-2019 by Ord. No. 40-2019]
The City presently provides public records to citizens, residents and other
applicable individuals on an as-needed basis as such requests come to
individual departments. The City recognizes the need to provide these
individuals with good customer service while still upholding the laws which
pertain to proper dissemination of government records. The City now
wishes to create a centralized policy as to determining whether records are
public in nature; the viability and consequences of the Open Public Records
Act N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1.1 et seq., and Common Law Right of Access, and to
determine how, when and if the public can obtain such records.
§ 2-49. Requests for public records. [Added 8-20-2019 by Ord. No.
40-20195]
Public officials need to examine both statute and common law in making
a determination whether a request from the public for documents is valid.
Even if the document would be exempt under statute, and in particular the
Open Public Records Act (N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1.1 et seq.), it may well be that
the public has a right to the document based on the Common Law Right of
Access. All records requests can be made during regular business hours. If
a request for records is made via electronic mail or facsimile after regular
business hours, the request is considered received the following business
day.
A. Requests for government records made under the Open Public Records
Act N.J.S.A. 47:1-1.1 et seq., must be done so in writing to the City Clerk
who is the Records Custodian for the City. A response in writing is
required within seven business days. All other Open Public Records Act
requirements listed under N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1.1 et seq., must be followed
in accordance with state law for these requests. These types of requests
put the burden on the Records Custodian of justifying withholding the
documents requested. It defines records broadly and imposes time
limits for making the records available.
(1) All departments are to respond to the City Clerk by the fifth
business day for responses to requests made under the Open Public
Records Act (OPRA) to ensure enough time for proper review,
redactions, if necessary, or denial of record(s).
(2) Department heads shall notify the City Clerk, in writing, as soon as
it is determined that an extension of time is necessary to produce
requested documents under OPRA. A reason for same shall be
provided to the City Clerk, also in writing.
4. Editor's Note: See also Art. XVIII, Retention and Destruction of Public Records.
5. Editor's Note: This ordinance also repealed former § 2-49, Custodian of records and
records request form.
§ 2-48 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 2-49
1:53
B. Requests for government records made under Common Law Right of
Access require the requester to have a legally recognized interest in the
subject matter contained in the material; then the material must be
disclosed if the individual's right of access outweighs the City's interest
in preventing disclosure.
(1) Requests under common law can be made to the respective
department which houses the record. If there are questions
concerning the possible need to withhold or redact the record, the
department head shall first seek the guidance of the City Clerk.
(2) Every effort should be made to provide records requested under
Common Law Right of Access in a timely manner. The requester
shall be provided a tentative date for when the records can be
expected to be produced. This tentative date shall factor in whether
records will need to be retrieved from off-site storage.
C. All requests for records shall be as specific as possible to the City.
D. All requests for records, except for requests by City employees/officials,
or records requests made under the Open Public Records Act (N.J.S.A.
47:1A-1.1) shall be subject to the City's policy as to copying costs.
E. The following records, or types of records, which are not public and
shall not be made available to the public include but are not limited to
the following:
(1) All records exempted by state and/or federal statutes, rules and/or
regulations;
(2) All records exempted by presidential and/or gubernatorial
executive order;
(3) All records which are not included in the definition of "public
record" pursuant to the Open Public Records Act pursuant to
N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1.1 et seq.
(4) City Commission open session minutes shall not be considered
public records until such time as they are approved by the City
Commission. City Commission closed session minutes shall not be
considered public records until such time as they are approved by
the City Commission and the matter(s) in question have been
concluded pursuant to the provisions of N.J.S.A. 10:4-6 et seq.
(5) Not all request for records do, in fact, lead to the copying, review
and/or release of such records. A record may be a public record
under common law but may not be a public record under the Open
Public Records Act (N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1.1 et seq.) or it may be or may
not be a public record under any other legal statute, rules,
regulations and/or court decision. The City Clerk shall seek the
opinion of the City Attorney as to whether or not a record is public

calendar days after assuming ownership of the vacant property,
whichever is later; or within 10 calendar days of receipt of notice of the
registration requirements of this ordinance by the City, file a
registration application for such vacant property with the public officer
on forms provided by the City for such purposes. Failure to receive
notice by the City shall not constitute grounds for failing to register the
property.
(1) For purposes of this section, "vacant property" shall include any
residential or nonresidential building or structure other than
sheds, barns and other structures accessory to a principal
structure which is not currently legally occupied or at which
substantially all lawful construction operations or occupancy has

working order, where the building and grounds are maintained in
good order or where the building is in habitable condition, and
where the building is being actively marketed by its owner for sale
or rental, or reserved for the owner's seasonal or temporary use,
shall not be deemed a vacant property for purposes of this article.
B. Each property having a separate block and lot number as designated in
official records of the City shall be registered separately.
C. The registration application shall be on the form provided by the City

and the name, street address, telephone number, and email address (if
applicable) of the firm and the actual name(s) of the firm's individual

each vacant property registered, except as provided in Subsections E
and F below.

granted, shall be exempt from payment of the registration fee, but shall
comply with all other provisions of this article. If the property has not
received a certificate of occupancy at the end of the twelve-month
period, the owner shall be liable for any fee waived. The public officer
may extend the waiver of the registration fee for not more than one
additional year in response to a written request by the property owner
where the owner has received all necessary building permits and
commenced restoration of the property and the public officer finds that
compelling conditions outside of the owner's control made it impossible
for the owner to complete restoration of the property within the initial
twelve-month period. If the property receives a certificate of occupancy
and is restored to productive use and occupancy within the term of the
waiver granted by the public officer, the fee shall be forgiven in its
entirety.
F. Where the owner is an entity experienced in rehabilitation or
redevelopment of vacant properties, and where the property subject to
this article is being held for a project of rehabilitation or redevelopment
consistent with municipal plans and ordinance, and where by virtue of
financing, market or other conditions that project may require more
than one year for realization, the public officer may extend the waiver
of the registration fee on an annual basis without limitation upon
written request by the owner as long as the municipal officer finds that
the owner is making reasonable progress toward completion of the

building to determine compliance with municipal codes, upon reasonable
notice to the property owner, agent or representative during normal
business hours, or such other time as may be mutually agreed upon between

application on a form provided by the Bureau for such purpose.

statements therein contained in any administrative enforcement
proceeding or court proceeding instituted by the City against the owner
or owners of the building.
A. An owner who meets the requirements of this article with respect to the
location of his or her residence or workplace in the State of New Jersey
may designate himself or herself as agent or as the individual
responsible for maintaining the property.
B. By designating an authorized agent under the provisions of this article,
the owner consents to receive by service of the notice or process on the
authorized agent any and all notices of code violations concerning the
registered vacant property and all process in any court proceeding or
administrative enforcement proceeding brought to enforce code
provisions concerning the registered building. Any owner who has
designated an authorized agent under the provisions of this article shall
be deemed to consent to the continuation of the agent's designation for
the purposes of this article until the owner notifies the City of Millville
in writing of a change of authorized agent or until the owner files a new
annual registration statement.

of this article shall further be deemed to consent to receive, by posting
on the building, in plain view, and by service of notice at the last known
address of the owner of the property on record with the City of Millville

property. The notice shall contain the name and contact information for
the representative of the creditor who is responsible for receiving
complaints of property maintenance and code violations. The notice

municipal clerk. The notice shall also include the street address, lot and
block number of the property and the full name and contact information
of an individual located within the state who is authorized to accept

C. N.J.S.A. 46:10B-51(b) provides in relevant part that if the owner of a
residential property vacates or abandons any property on which a
foreclosure proceeding has been initiated or if a residential property
becomes vacant at any point subsequent to the creditor's filing the
summons and complaint in an action to foreclose on a mortgage against
the subject property, but prior to vesting of title in the creditor or any
other third party, and the exterior of the property is found to be a
nuisance or in violation of any applicable state or local code, the
appropriate local municipal official shall notify the creditor of the
nuisance or violation. The creditor shall have the responsibility to abate
the nuisance or correct the violation in the same manner and to the
same extent as the title owner of the property, to such standard or
specification as may be required by state law or municipal ordinance.
D. N.J.S.A. 46:10B-51(c) provides in relevant part that if the municipality
expends public funds in order to abate a nuisance or correct a violation
on a residential property in situations where the creditor was given
notice pursuant to the aforesaid statute but failed to abate the nuisance
or correct the violation as directed, the municipality shall have the
same recourse against the creditor as it would have against the title
owner of the property including, but not limited to, the recourse
provided under N.J.S.A. 55:19-100.
§ 11-34 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 11-34
1:131
§ 11-35. Findings and purpose.
E. N.J.S.A. 46:10B-51.1 provides in relevant part that the owner of any
non-owner-occupied residential property who takes title to the property
as the result of a sheriff's sale or deed in lieu of foreclosure, other than
an owner who has previously provided notice to the municipality
pursuant to N.J.S.A. 46:10B-51, shall provide notice, within 10 business
days, to the municipal clerk of the municipality wherein the property is
located providing the name and address of the owner. If the owner is
not located within New Jersey, then the owner shall designate an agent
within New Jersey, including the agent's address, who is authorized to
accept service of process on behalf of the property owner.
F. N.J.S.A. 55:19-100 provides in relevant part that with respect to any lien

property if an individual, against any asset of any partner if a
partnership, and against any asset of any owner of a 10% interest or
greater if the owner is any other business organization or entity
recognized pursuant to law.
A. The governing body of the municipality finds and declares that
residential properties with pending foreclosure proceedings often
become vacant. These vacant properties if not maintained rapidly
become eyesores with unkempt lawns and overgrown vegetation,
broken doors and windows, and deteriorating structures. These
properties create a wide range of negative secondary effects in the
neighborhoods where they are located in that they foster criminal
activity, create public health problems, and otherwise diminish the
quality of life for residents and business operators located in those
areas.
B. The governing body of the municipality finds and declares that
residential properties with pending foreclosure proceedings which have
become vacant are often not maintained by the creditor who has filed
the foreclosure proceedings. These vacant properties deteriorate by
neglect and diminish property values of neighboring properties,
increase the risk of property damage through arson and vandalism, and
discourage neighborhood stability and revitalization.
C. The governing body of the municipality finds and declares that there
are vacant residential properties located within the community that
constitute a nuisance which require the abatement or removal of the
nuisance by summary proceedings. Where a creditor has filed a
summons and complaint for the foreclosure of a mortgage on a
residential property that is vacant, the creditor is responsible for the
abatement or removal of the nuisance.

the good government, order and protection of persons and property,
and for the preservation of the public health, safety and welfare of the
municipality and its inhabitants.
B. N.J.S.A. 40:48-2.12a provides in relevant part that the governing body
of any municipality may make, amend, repeal and enforce ordinances to
regulate buildings and structures and their use and occupation to
prevent and abate conditions therein harmful to the health and safety of
the occupants of said building and structures and the general public in
the municipality.
C. N.J.S.A. 40:48-2.12c provides in relevant part that any ordinance

and management of every building and structure in the municipality
which is occupied by two or more families as tenants of the owner or
lessor.
D. N.J.S.A. 40:48-2.12f provides in relevant part that any ordinance
adopted pursuant to this act may also provide that the municipality may
abate a nuisance, correct a defect, or put the premises in proper
condition so as to comply with the requirements of any municipal
ordinance or state law applicable thereto, at the cost of the owner or
lessor, and expend municipal funds for such purpose and charge the
same against the premises, and the amount thereof as determined by
the governing body of the municipality shall be a lien against the
premises.
E. N.J.S.A. 40:48-2.12m authorizes a municipality to adopt an ordinance
requiring a landlord to obtain a certificate of occupancy or inspection
before re-renting an apartment to a new occupant. After an apartment
is inspected by a municipal inspector, the municipality would issue a
certificate of inspection or occupancy if the apartment meets the
standards required by law. The municipality may charge a fee to fund
the costs of the inspections and the issuance of the certificates.
F. N.J.S.A. 40:48-2.12n sets forth the findings of the Legislature that
municipal residents have experienced disturbances, damage and public
expense resulting from carelessly granted and inadequately supervised
rentals to irresponsible tenants by inept or indifferent landlords; that to
preserve their peace and tranquility it is necessary and desirable that
those communities have adequate means to curb and discourage those
occasional excesses arising from irresponsible rentals; and that
municipal governing bodies may take effective action to assure that

reinstate any measures previously reduced or eliminated for the

FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION
GENERAL REFERENCES
Land use and development regulations  See
Ch. 30.
§ 20-1. Statutory authority.
Pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:48-1 et seq., the Legislature of the State of New
Jersey has delegated the responsibility to local government to adopt
regulations designed to promote the public health, safety and general
welfare of its citizenry.
§ 20-2. Findings.
§ 20-3. Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
A. The flood hazard areas of the City of Millville are subject to periodic
inundation which results in health and safety hazards, loss of property,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of
services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and
relief and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the
public health, safety and general welfare.
B. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in
areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and velocities
and, when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses
that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected
from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss.
A. Protect human life and health.
B. Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects.
C. Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding
and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public.
D. Minimize prolonged business interruptions.
E. Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as sewer and
water mains, electric, gas and telephone lines, bridges and streets
located in the areas of special flood hazard.
§ 17-98 MILLVILLE CODE § 20-3
1:228
§ 20-4. Methods of reducing flood losses.
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and
provisions for:
§ 20-5. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the following
meanings unless the context clearly indicates that a different meaning is
intended:
APPEAL  A request for a review of the Construction Official's
interpretation of any provision of this chapter or a request for a variance.
AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD  The land in the floodplain within
a community subject to a one-percent-or-greater chance of flooding in any
given year. It is shown on the FIRM as Zone A or AE.
BASE FLOOD  The flood having a one-percent chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year (one-hundred-year flood).
F. Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future
flood blight areas.
G. Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of
special flood hazard.
H. Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions.
I. To maintain eligibility and good standing in the National Flood
Insurance Program enabling residents to purchase flood insurance,
which would otherwise be unavailable.
A. Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety
and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in
damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities.
B. Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve
such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction.
C. Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel
floodwaters.
D. Controlling dredging, filling, grading and other development which may
increase flood damage.
E. Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
§ 20-3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 20-5
1:229
BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE)  The flood elevation shown on a
published Flood Insurance Study (FIS) including the Flood Insurance Rate

being equaled or exceeded in any given year.
BASEMENT  Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all sides.
BREAKAWAY WALL  A wall that is not part of the structural support of
the building and is intended through its design and construction to collapse
under specific lateral loading forces without causing damage to the elevated
portion of the building or supporting foundation system.
COASTAL A ZONE  The portion of the Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA)
starting from a Velocity (V) Zone and extending up to the landward Limit
of the Moderate Wave Action delineation. Where no V Zone is mapped the
Coastal A Zone is the portion between the open coast and the landward
Limit of the Moderate Wave Action delineation. Coastal A Zones may be
subject to wave effects, velocity flows, erosion, scour, or a combination of
these forces. Construction and development in Coastal A Zones is to be
regulated the same as V Zones/coastal high hazard areas.
DEVELOPMENT  Any made-made change to improved or unimproved real
estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining,
dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or
storage of equipment or materials located within the area of special flood
hazard.
DIGITAL FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (DFIRM)  The official map on
which the Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas
of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the
community.
ELEVATED BUILDING  A nonbasement building which is built, in the
case of a building in an area of special flood hazard, to have the top of
the elevated floor or, in the case of a building in a Coastal A Zone, to
have the bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the elevated
floor, elevated above the base flood elevation plus freeboard by means of
pilings, columns (posts and piers) or shear walls parallel to the flow of the
water, and which is adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural
integrity of the building during a flood up to the magnitude of the base
flood. In an area of special flood hazard, "elevated building" also includes a
building elevated by means of fill or solid foundation perimeter walls with
openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of floodwaters.
In Areas of Coastal A Zones, "elevated buildings" also includes a building
otherwise meeting the definition of "elevated building" even though the
lower area is enclosed by means of breakaway walls.
EROSION  The process of the gradual wearing away of land masses.
EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION  A
manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of
facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to
§ 20-5 MILLVILLE CODE § 20-5
1:230
be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the
construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of
concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the floodplain
management regulations adopted by a community.
FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM)  The official map on which the
Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special
flood hazard and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.

the Federal Insurance Administration has provided flood profiles, as well as
the Flood Boundary/Floodway Map and the water surface elevation of the
base flood.
FLOOD or FLOODING  A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS  Zoning ordinances,
subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose
ordinances (such as a floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance and erosion
control ordinance) and other applications of police power. The term
describes such state or local regulations, in any combination thereof, which
provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and
reduction.
FLOODPROOFING  Any combination of structural and nonstructural
additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate
flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary
facilities, structures and their contents.
FLOODWAY  The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent
land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood
without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than 0.2
foot.
FREEBOARD  A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for purposes of floodplain management. "Freeboard" tends to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood
heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and
floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the
hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed.
HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE  The highest natural elevation of the ground
surface prior to construction next to the proposed or existing walls of a
structure.
HISTORIC STRUCTURE  Any structure that is:
A. The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and/or

conditions between the V Zone and the LiMWA will be similar to, but less
severe than, those in the V Zone.
LOWEST FLOOR  The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, usable solely for the
parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a
basement, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such
enclosure is not built so to render the structure in violation of other
applicable nonelevation design requirements of 44 CFR 60.3.
MANUFACTURED HOME  A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with
or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities.

 A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more
manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
NEW CONSTRUCTION  Structures for which the start of construction
commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain regulation adopted
by a community, and includes any subsequent improvements to such
structures.
NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION  A manufactured
home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for
servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed

purposes of this chapter, the Appeals Board may attach such
conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to
further the purposes of this chapter.
(6) The Construction Official shall maintain the records of all appeal
actions, including technical information, and report any variances
to the Federal Insurance Administration upon request.
B. Conditions for variances.
(1) Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of 1/2 acre or less
in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing
structures constructed below the base flood level, provided that the
items in Subsection A(4)(a) through (k) above have been fully
considered. As the lot size increases beyond the 1/2 acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
(2) Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued
designation as an historic structure and the variance is the
minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design
of the structure.
(3) Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would
result.
(4) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard,
to afford relief.
(5) Variance shall only be issued upon:
(a) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
(b) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
(c) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety or
extraordinary public expense or create nuisances or cause

1:242
§ 20-18. Floodways.
Located within areas of special flood hazard established in § 20-7 are areas
designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area
due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles
and erosion potential, the following provisions apply:
§ 20-19. Coastal A Zone.
Coastal A Zones are located within the areas of special flood hazard
established in § 20-7. These areas may be subject to wave effects, velocity
flows, erosion, scour, or a combination of these forces; therefore, the
following provisions shall apply:
A. Encroachment, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements and other development, shall be prohibited unless a
technical evaluation demonstrates that encroachment shall not result in
any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood
discharge.
B. If § 20-18A is satisfied, all new construction and substantial
improvements shall meet the flood hazard reduction provisions of
§§ 20-16 through 20-19.
C. In all areas of special flood hazard in which base flood elevation data
has been provided and no floodway has been designated, the
cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with
all other existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the
water surface elevation of the base flood more than 0.2 of a foot at any
point.
A. Location of structures.
(1) All buildings or structures shall be located landward of the reach of
the mean high tide.
(2) The placement of manufactured homes shall be prohibited, except
in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision.
B. Construction methods.
(1) Elevation. All new construction and substantial improvements shall
be elevated on piling or columns so that:
(a) The bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the
lowest floor (excluding the piling or columns) is elevated to or
above the base flood elevation plus one foot or as required by
ASCE/SEI 24-14, Table 4-1, whichever is more restrictive; and
(b) With all space below the lowest floor's supporting member
open so as not to impede the flow of water, except for
breakaway walls as provided or in § 20-19B(4).
§ 20-18 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 20-19
1:243
(2) Structural support.
(a) All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
securely anchored on piling or columns.
(b) The pile or column foundation and structure attached thereto
shall be anchored to resist flotation, collapse or lateral
movement due to the effects of wind and water loading values
each of which shall have a 1% chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year (one-hundred-year mean
recurrence interval).
(c) Prohibit the use of fill for structural support of buildings within
Coastal A Zones on the community's FIRM.
(3) Certification. A registered professional engineer or architect shall
develop or review the structural design specifications and plans for
the construction and shall certify that the design and methods of
construction to be used are in accordance with accepted standards
of practice for compliance with the provisions of § 20-19B(1) and
B(2)(a) and (b).
(4) Space below the lowest floor.
(a) Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a
structure started after the enactment of this chapter shall not
enclose the space below the lowest floor unless breakaway
walls, open-wood latticework or insect screening are used as
provided for in this section.
(b) Breakaway walls, open-wood latticework or insect screening
shall be allowed below the base flood elevation provided that
they are intended to collapse under wind and water loads
without causing collapse, displacement or other structural
damage to the elevated portion of the building or supporting
foundation system. Breakaway walls shall be designed for a
safe loading resistance of not less than 10 and no more than 20
pounds per square foot. Use of breakaway walls which exceed
a design safe loading of 20 pounds per square foot (either by
design or when so required by local or state codes) may be
permitted only if a registered professional engineer or
architect certifies that the designs proposed meet the following
conditions:
[1] Breakaway wall collapse shall result from a water load less
than that which would occur during the base flood; and
[2] The elevated portion of the building and supporting
foundation system shall not be subject to collapse,
displacement or other structural damage due to the effects
of wind and water load acting simultaneously on all
building components (structural and nonstructural). Water

made a recommendation regarding a matter referred to it by the
governing body of the City, such recommendation may be rejected by a
municipal body only by a vote of a majority of its full authorized
membership. Failure of the Planning Board to make a recommendation
within 35 days after the referral shall relieve the other municipal body

the Planning Board and the Board of Adjustment an index of the natural
resources of the City. The Planning Board or the Board of Adjustment shall

every application for development submitted to either Board. Failure of the
Planning Board or Board of Adjustment to make such informational copy
available to the Environmental Commission shall not invalidate any hearing
or proceeding.
A. Whenever the proposed development requires approval pursuant to
this chapter of a subdivision, site plan or conditional use, but not a
variance pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70d, the Planning Board shall
have the power to grant to the same extent and subject to the same

during the course of the conference shall be binding on either party
with respect to any general development plan or application
subsequently submitted.
A. Any developer of a parcel of land greater than 100 acres in size for
which the developer is seeking approval of a planned development may
submit a general development plan to the Planning Board prior to the
granting of preliminary approval of that development by the Planning
Board pursuant to this chapter.
B. The Planning Board shall grant or deny general development plan
approval within 95 days of submission of a complete application to the
administrative officer or within such further time as may be consented
to by the applicant. Failure of the Planning Board to act within the
period prescribed shall constitute general development plan approval
of the planned development.
C. The term of the effect of the general development plan approval shall be
determined by the Planning Board using the guidelines set forth below,
except that the term of the effect of the approval shall not exceed 20
years from the date upon which the developer receives final approval of
the first section of the planned development.
D. In making its determination regarding the duration of the effect of
approval of the development plan, the Planning Board shall consider
the number of dwelling units or amount of nonresidential floor area to
be constructed; prevailing economic conditions; the timing schedule to
be followed in completing the development and the likelihood of its
fulfillment; the developer's capability of completing the proposed
development; and the contents of the general development plan,
together with any conditions which the Planning Board attaches to the
approval thereof.
A. In the event that the developer desires to modify the proposed timing
schedule, the modification shall require the approval of the Planning
Board. In deciding whether or not to grant approval of the modification,
the Planning Board shall take into consideration prevailing economic
and market conditions, actual and anticipated needs for residential unit
and nonresidential space within the City and the region and the
availability and capacity of public facilities to accommodate the
proposed development.
B. In the event that the developer desires to make any variation in the
location of land uses within the planned development or to increase the
density of residential development or the floor area ratio of
§ 30-67 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 30-69

§ 30-70. Findings for planned developments.
Prior to the approval of a planned development, the Planning Board shall
find the following facts and conclusions which shall be incorporated in the
resolution approving the planned development:
nonresidential development in any section of the planned development
after the approval of the general development plan, such modifications
shall require the approval of the Planning Board prior to any action
taken by the developer in connection with those modifications.
C. Any variation in the location of land uses or increase in density or floor
area ratio proposed by the developer in reaction to a negative decision
made or condition imposed by the Pinelands Commission or the
Department of Environmental Protection shall be approved by the
Planning Board if the developer can demonstrate to the satisfaction of
the Planning Board that the variation being proposed is a direct result
of the determination made by the state agency.
D. In undertaking any section of the planned development, a developer
may reduce the number of residential units or amounts of
nonresidential floor space by no more than 15% or reduce the
residential density or nonresidential floor area ratio by no more than
15% without applying for and obtaining the approval of the Planning
Board. However, the developer may not reduce the number of
residential units to be provided pursuant to N.J.S.A. 52:27D-301 without
prior approval.
A. That departures by the proposed development from zoning regulations
otherwise applicable to the subject property conform to the Zoning
Ordinance standards pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-65.
B. That the proposals for maintenance and conservation of the common
open space are reliable and the amount, location and purpose of the
common open space are adequate.
C. That provision through the physical design of the proposed
development for public services, control over vehicular and pedestrian
traffic and the amenities of light and air, recreation and visual
enjoyment are adequate.
D. That the proposed planned development will not have an unreasonably
adverse impact upon the area in which it is proposed to be established.
E. In the case of a proposed development which contemplates
construction over a period of years, that the terms and conditions
intended to protect the interests of the public and of the residents,
occupants and owners of the proposed development in the total
completion of the development are adequate.

A. Upon completion of each section of the planned development as set
forth in the approved general development plan, the developer shall
notify the administrative officer, by certified mail, as evidence that the
developer is fulfilling his obligations under the approved plan. If the
City does not receive such notification at the completion of any section
of the development, the administrative officer shall notify the developer,
by certified mail, in order to determine whether or not the terms of the
approved plan are being complied with.
B. If a developer does not complete any section of the planned
development within eight months of the date provided for its

cause to believe that the developer is not fulfilling his obligations under
the approved development plan, the administrative officer shall notify
the developer, by certified mail, that the developer shall have 10 days
within which to give evidence that he is fulfilling his obligations under
the approved plan. Thereafter, the City shall conduct a hearing to
determine whether or not the developer is in violation of the approved
plan. If the City at such hearing finds good cause to terminate the
approval, it shall provide written notice of same to the developer and
the approval shall be terminated 30 days thereafter.
C. In the event that a developer who has general development plan
approval does not apply for preliminary approval for the planned
development which is the subject of the approved general development
plan within five years of the date upon which the plan was approved by
the Planning Board, the City shall have cause to terminate the approval.
D. In the event that a planned development which is the subject of an
approved general development plan is completed before the end of the

the last section of the planned development in accordance with the
timing schedule set forth in the approved general development plan
and the developer has fulfilled all of his obligations pursuant to the
approval.

structures thereon. Such ordinance shall be adopted after the Planning
Board has adopted the land use plan element and the housing plan
element of a Master Plan, and all of the provisions of the Zoning
Ordinance or any amendment or revision thereto shall either be
substantially consistent with the land use plan element and the housing
plan element of the Master Plan or designed to effectuate those plan
elements. However, the governing body of the City may adopt a Zoning
Ordinance or amendment or revision thereof which in whole or in part
is inconsistent with or not designed to effectuate the land use plan

reasons of the governing body for so acting set forth in a resolution and
recorded in its minutes when adopting the Zoning Ordinance.
B. The Zoning Ordinance shall be drawn with reasonable consideration to

uses and to encourage the most appropriate use of land. The
regulations in the Zoning Ordinance shall be uniform throughout each
district for each class or kind of buildings or other structures or uses of
land, including planned unit development, planned unit residential
development and residential cluster, but the regulations in one district
may differ from those in other districts.

§ 30-78 MILLVILLE CODE § 30-81
1:346
§ 30-82. Conditional uses.
A "conditional use" is a use which is suitable to a zoning district but not
to every location within that district. A Zoning Ordinance may provide
for conditional uses to be granted by the Planning Board according to
standards which shall be clearly set forth with sufficient certainty to guide
the Planning Board and developers in determining whether the proposed
conditional use is suitable for the particular site.
§ 30-83. Nonconforming uses and structures.
"Nonconforming uses and structures" are uses or structures which do not
conform with current zoning regulations, but whose continued existence is
statutorily protected by virtue of having been lawful when first established.
This statutory protection includes the right to repair or rebuild in the
event of partial destruction, but does not include the right to enlarge a
nonconforming structure or expand or intensify a nonconforming use.
B. A Zoning Ordinance or amendment or revision thereto which in whole
or in part is inconsistent with or not designed to effectuate the land use
plan element of the Master Plan shall not take effect until a copy of the
resolution required by N.J.S.A. 40:55D-62 shall be filed with the County
Planning Board.
A. Definitions.
NONCONFORMING STRUCTURE  A structure the size, dimension
or location of which was lawful prior to the adoption, revision or
amendment of a Zoning Ordinance, but which fails to conform to the
requirements of the zoning district in which it is located by reasons of
such adoption, revision or amendment.
NONCONFORMING USE  A use or activity which was lawful prior to
the adoption, revision or amendment of a Zoning Ordinance, but which
fails to conform to the requirements of the zoning district in which it is
located by reasons of such adoption, revision or amendment.
B. Variances required if nonconforming use is changed or enlarged. An
existing nonconforming use will be permitted to continue only if it is a
continuance of substantially the same kind of use as that to which the
premises were devoted at the time of the passage of the Zoning
Ordinance. In that regard, nonconforming uses may not be changed or
enlarged except where the change or enlargement is so negligible that
it does not warrant administrative review. An owner desiring to change
or expand a nonconforming use shall seek a variance pursuant to
N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70(d)(2) of the Municipal Land Use Law.
C. Destruction of nonconforming uses and structures. The statutory
protection of nonconforming uses and structures includes the right to
repair or rebuild a nonconforming use or structure in the event of the
partial destruction thereof. The case law interpreting the statutory
§ 30-81 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 30-83
1:347
§ 30-84. Request for rezoning. [Amended 9-6-2005 by Ord. No.
34-2005]
reference to "partial destruction" does not allow rebuilding in every
situation where the structure has not been destroyed.
D. Abandonment of use. The protection of the nonconforming use status
shall be lost by abandonment of the nonconforming use. However, the
mere cessation of the nonconforming use, in and of itself, does not
result in the loss of the protected nonconforming use status. A cessation
of use and an overt act or failure to act shall evidence an intent by the
owner to abandon the use.
(1) An example of a cessation of use and an overt act evidencing an
intent to abandon occur when the owner of a structure changes a
nonconforming use to a conforming use. Once that occurs, the
owner has no right to resume the prior nonconforming use.
(2) An example of a cessation of use and a failure to act evidencing an
intent to abandon occurs when the owner of a structure ceases to
use it and fails to maintain the structure allowing it to fall into a
state of disrepair.
A. Requests for rezoning may originate with, or be submitted by, the
governing body of the City, the Planning Board or the Planning Director.
B. Requests for rezoning made by private applicants shall be submitted in
writing to the City Clerk, who shall refer the request to the Planning
Board within 10 days of its receipt. All such requests shall be in writing
in a form prescribed by the Zoning Officer and include the following
information:
(1) An application signed by the applicant or the attorney for the
applicant which sets forth the block and lot numbers for the
property in question and a brief description of the property
location.
(2) Documentation which verifies property ownership.
(3) Fifteen copies of a detailed site plan with an engineer's seal which
sets forth the property lines for the subject property and a
delineation of any natural features, including wetlands. Dimensions
for all buildings, property lines and setbacks must be shown.
(4) A map which shows the existing boundaries for the zoning district,
together with a map which shows the proposed new boundaries for
the zoning district.
(5) A statement why the rezoning of the lots, or a portion thereof, is
substantially consistent with the land use plan element and the
housing plan element of the Master Plan. Additionally, the applicant
shall submit a statement as to why the rezoning of the lots in
§ 30-83 MILLVILLE CODE § 30-84
1:348
question is consistent with the character of the zoning district, and
why the lots are suitable for the particular uses permitted in that
zoning district.
(6) An application fee, if required by this chapter.
(7) The Planning Board or professional staff may require an impact
evaluation analysis as set forth under Article VI.
C. All requests for rezoning made by private applicants shall be reviewed
by the professional staff for completeness.
D. All requests for rezoning shall be reviewed by the Planning Board
before a zoning ordinance is adopted by the governing body of the City.
The Planning Board shall adopt a resolution which sets forth its
recommendation. A report also may be provided by the Planning
Director or the Planning Board in accordance with N.J.S.A. 40:55D-26.

two years. In a municipality where more than two alternates have been
appointed, the terms of not more than two alternate members shall
expire in any one year.

member may vote instead of an alternate member. In the event that a
choice must be made as to which alternate member is to vote, alternate

regulation would result in peculiar and exceptional practical
difficulties or exceptional or undue hardship for the developer of
the property.
(2) Where the purposes of the Municipal Land Use Law would be
advanced by a deviation from the zoning or land use regulations
and the benefits of the deviation would substantially outweigh any
detriment resulting from the grant of a variance to allow departure
from the regulations.
(3) No variance from those departures enumerated in Subsection D of
this section shall be granted under this subsection.
D. Upon an application or appeal for a variance relating to a specific piece

§ 30-103. Zoning Map.41 [Amended 9-6-2005 by Ord. No. 34-2005]
The boundaries of all zoning districts shall be shown on a map known as the
"Zoning Map of the City of Millville," dated July 31, 2005, or as amended by
law. This Map is attached hereto and is incorporated herein and declared
to be part of this chapter, including all notations and references contained
on the Map. The original of the Map shall be maintained in the office of the
City Engineer, and all changes made to the zoning districts shall be entered
upon the Map at the time of adoption of any ordinance amending the Map.
§ 30-104. Zone boundaries.
Where uncertainty exists as to any of the zone boundaries as shown on the
Zoning Map, the following rules shall apply:
§ 30-105. Overlay zones.
All lots or properties within the City of Millville lie within a particular
base zoning district as shown on the Zoning Map. Additionally, certain lots
or properties also fall within an overlay zone. In instances where the lot
or property falls within an overlay zone, the regulations and standards of
both the base zoning district and the overlay zone shall control the land
use and development of the property. Unless otherwise indicated, where
the regulations and standards conflict the more restrictive regulation or
standard shall govern.
A. A zone boundary line is intended to follow the center line of the streets,
the edges of lot lines, the edges of railroad rights-of-way and streams as
they exist on plats of record at the time of the adoption of this chapter,
unless the zone boundary line is fixed by dimensions shown on the
Zoning Map.
B. Where a zone boundary line approximately follows lot lines and does
not scale more than ten feet therefrom, the lot lines shall be construed
to be the zone boundary line, unless the zone boundary line is fixed by
dimensions shown on the Zoning Map.
C. Where a zone boundary line divides a lot which is not subdivided, the
location of the zone boundary line shall be determined by the use of the
scale appearing thereon, unless the zone boundary line is fixed by
dimensions shown on the Zoning Map.

Zoning District Regulations
§ 30-106. Schedule of district regulations.
§ 30-107. Airport Hazard Overlay District.
A. The schedules of regulations entitled, "City of Millville Schedule of
District Regulations," attached hereto, related to the districts
appearing on the Zoning Map made a part hereof this chapter, applying
to the uses of land and buildings, the yard and other open spaces to be
provided contiguous thereto, and all other matter contained therein, as
indicated for the various zones established by this chapter, is hereby
declared to be a part of this chapter.
B. The regulations listed for each zone are designated, reading from left to
right across the schedule, are hereby prescribed for such zones, subject
to the other provisions contained in this chapter and shall be deemed to
be the minimum requirements in every instance of their application,
unless otherwise stated. Supplementary regulations relating to special
cases and conditional uses are contained in Articles XIV, XVIII, XXII,
XXIII and XXIV of this chapter. The Board of Adjustment shall decide
questions of interpretation of the use lists as set forth on the schedule
above referenced.
A. Purpose. An Airport Hazard Overlay District is established in
accordance with the requirements of the Air Safety and Hazardous
Zoning Act of 1983, N.J.A.C. 16:62-1 et seq. The City shall not grant site
plan or subdivision plat approval, or variances for land use or
development activity within the Airport Hazard Area which would be
contrary to the standards of this chapter. The purpose of the overlay
district is to establish minimum standards for the control of airport and
land use adjacent to airports to prevent the creation of airport hazards.
No person shall build, rebuild, create or cause to be built, rebuilt or
created any object or structure, or plant, or cause to be planted or
permit to grow, any tree or vegetation which will interfere with,
diminish, change, or obstruct the airspace, landing, and takeoff area
available for the landing and take off of aircraft at the Millville
Municipal Airport.
B. Applicability. All lands located within the Airport Hazard Area, as
delineated in the Millville Zoning Map, shall be governed by the
standards and procedures specified in this chapter. Applicants seeking
development approval for lands within the Airport Hazard Area should
consult with the City development review staff for further guidance and
interpretation of these requirements.
C. Delineation of the Airport Hazard Area. The Airport Hazard Area shall
consist of a runway subzone, two runway end subzones, and two clear
zones, as defined below. The outermost boundaries of the runway
§ 30-106 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 30-107
1:361
subzone and runway end subzones shall comprise the full extent of the
Airport Hazard Area. (Refer to Figure 3.)42
D. Delineation of runway subzone. The runway subzone consists of a
rectangle having the same center line and length of each runway and a
width of 2,350 feet. (Refer to Figure 1.)43
E. Delineation of runway end subzones. The runway end subzones consist
of trapezoids located at either end of the runway subzone along the
flight approach and departure path. Each runway end subzone shall
extend 3,000 feet from the end of the runway subzone, as measured
along the extended center line of the runway. The base of the runway
end subzone coincides with the end of the runway subzone, and has a
width of 2,350 feet. The width of the runway end subzone narrows as
the distance from the end of the runway subzone increases. Its final
width is 850 feet. (Refer to Figure 2.)44
F. Delineation of the clear zones.
(1) The clear zones consist of trapezoids located within the runway end
subzone along the flight approach and departure path.
(2) Each clear zone extends 1,000 feet from the end of the runway
subzone, as measured along the extended center line of the runway.
(3) The base of the clear zone is collocated with the end of the runway
subzone, and has a width of 250 feet. The width of the clear zone
increases as the distance from the end of the runway safety zone
increases. Its final width is 450 feet. (Refer to Figure 7.)45
G. Permitted uses. Uses permitted within the Airport Hazard Overlay Zone
shall include those permitted in the underlying base zoning district, as
limited or restricted by the following standards prescribed by the Air
Safety and Hazardous Zoning Act (N.J.S.A. 6:1-81 et seq.):
(1) Prohibited uses within the Airport Hazard Area shall include:
(a) Residential single-family dwelling units on lots less than three
acres in size;
(b) Planned unit developments;
(c) Multifamily dwellings;
(d) Hospitals;
(e) Schools;

1:362
(f) Aboveground, bulk tank storage of compressed flammable or
compressed toxic gases and liquids;
(g) Any use that may attract masses of birds;
(h) Above grade major utility transmission lines and/or mains; and
(i) Within the runway end subzones only, the aboveground, bulk
tank storage of flammable or toxic gases and liquids.
(2) Permitted uses within the Airport Hazard Area shall include:
(a) Residential, single-family dwelling units on a minimum lot size
of three acres and not located in the clear zone. All residential
dwellings must be physically located outside the clear zone;
(b) Open space;
(c) Agricultural uses;
(d) Roads, highways, rail rights-of-way;
(e) Airports;
(f) Commercial uses, if not located in the clear zone; and
(g) Industrial uses, if not located in the clear zone.
(h) Minimum obstruction height standards.
H. Vertical standards. The following shall define vertical standards for the
development of structures or growth of trees within the Airport Hazard
Area:
(1) For purposes of determining vertical standards, the horizontal
plane of the runway elevations at the Millville Airport shall be 87
feet above sea level.
(2) Within the runway subzone, for a distance of 125 feet
perpendicular to the runway center line, no development shall be
permitted above the natural grade of the soil except for runway and
flight safety equipment.
(3) Within the remainder of the runway subzone maximum height
standards shall be determined by establishing a plane which slopes
upward and outward, from the edge of the area defined in
Subsection H(2) above, at a rate of seven feet horizontally to one
foot vertically, or 7:1. This upward plane ceases when it reaches the
outer longitudinal borders of the runway subzone, at an elevation
of 150 feet. (Refer to Figure 5.)46
(4) The height standards within the runway end subzone are
determined by first establishing a plane with a rising slope of one
46.Editor's Note: Figure 5 is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 30-107 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 30-107
1:363
§ 30-108. Arts District Overlay Zone.
foot upward to 20 feet outward from the end of the runway subzone
to the outermost end of the runway end subzone. This plane is
bisected by the extended runway center line and is 250 feet in total
width at its innermost dimension and widens uniformly along its
three-thousand-foot length so as to have a total width of 850 feet
at its outermost dimension where it intersects with the outermost
portion of the runway end subzone at the elevation of 150 feet
above its starting point.
(5) The vertical standards within the remainder of the runway end
subzone are determined by establishing sloping planes from the
outermost longitudinal edges of the plane established in
Subsection H(4) above. These planes rise upward at a rate of one
foot upward to seven feet outward from the plane established in
Subsection H(4) above, to where they meet the outermost
longitudinal boundaries of the runway end subzone at the elevation
of 150 feet. (Refer to Figure 6.)47
I. Variance procedures. Any variance or other relief from the standards of
this chapter granted by the City of Millville shall be conditioned upon
the issuance of a permit by the New Jersey Commissioner of
Transportation allowing the variance or relief. Provision for the
issuance of a permit by the Commissioner shall be in accordance with
N.J.A.C. 16:62-6.
J. Airport master plan. In the event that any condition or standard as
prescribed or set forth in the Schedules of District Regulations in
relation to an I-3 Air Park Industry District are inconsistent with the
requirements of the Millville Municipal Airport Master Plan, the
requirements of the Master Plan shall be followed to the exclusion of
the requirements set forth in this chapter.
A. Purpose. The purpose of the Artists Overlay District is to create and
sustain an environment that encourages the settlement of artists and
craftspeople as a form of economic development and downtown
revitalization. For that reason, special zoning is enacted that will permit
art related uses within specific sections of the downtown core area to
create an artists-in-residence land use category.
B. Applicability. The Art Overlay District shall apply to the downtown areas
designated on the amended Zoning Map as B-3 and attached as part of
this section. This zoning district shall apply as an overlay, meaning that
it applies as an alternative zoning pattern, when and if chosen by the
property owner. Within the Art Overlay District the existing B-3 zoning
or redevelopment plan regulations continue unrestricted. The
application of the Arts District provides for a series of new permitted
47.Editor's Note: Figure 6 is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 30-107 MILLVILLE CODE § 30-108
1:364
land uses which are in addition to those provided in the standard zoning
or redevelopment plans.
C. Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms shall have the
meanings indicated:
ARTIST  A person or persons regularly engaged in the arts as a
career and not as a hobby. This does not mean that the creation of art
generates the person's primary source of income, but rather that the
artist has a body of work that demonstrates the development of the art
and intends to pursue that work for the foreseeable future. As used
herein, the arts shall include but not be limited to painting, sculpture,
pottery, beadmaking, glass blowing or other forms of glass art; music;
theater; choreography; textiles; and jewelry making.
WORK/LIVE ARTIST STUDIO  A single, enclosed private living and
work space of not less than 1,000 square feet where at least 50% of
the total space is devoted to work space for the creation, display and
sale of art and the remaining is used for living purposes. A minimum of
500 square feet of living space on the upper levels of a building shall be
required.
D. Permitted uses. The principal permitted uses in the Art Overlay District
shall be as follows:
(1) All uses permitted as principal uses in the B-3 Zone.
(2) Studios for arts and crafts.
(3) Art galleries.
(4) Live/work studios. [Amended 8-3-2010 by Ord. No. 14-2010]
(5) Retail sales of goods and services related strictly to the arts,
including but not limited to art supply stores, framing shops,
bookstores.
(6) Art performance space, including but not limited to theater, poetry,
dance performance or recitals for live music. Such performance
space shall not exceed 5,000 square feet of permanent installation.
Temporary installations may exceed this maximum but may not be
used for more than 30 consecutive days. All uses must abide by
noise regulations contained within the development regulations.
Mixed use of any of the above, with living space restricted to the
upper levels of a building.
E. Prohibited uses in the Art Overlay District.
(1) First floor living space.
F. Parking requirements. No off-street parking shall be required for any
principal or accessory uses permitted by the Arts Overlay District. The
requirement is based upon the existing B-3 zoning regulations, the
unique character of the downtown and existing public parking areas.
§ 30-108 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 30-108
1:365
§ 30-109. Environmental Overlay Zone.
G. Signage. All signs permitted in the B-3 Zoning District shall be
permitted in the Overlay District.
A. Purpose. An Environmental Overlay District is hereby established to
assure protection of wetlands, floodplains, and floodways. Owners or
applicants with lands in the Environmental Overlay District, seeking
development approval, shall be required, as part of their preliminary
application, to verify the coverage or extent of each particular
environmental feature.
B. Applicability.
(1) Each applicant should verify from the Millville Zoning Map whether
their property falls within the Environmental Overlay District and,
if so, consult the maps and data on file with the Planning Board. It
shall be the applicant's responsibility, as part of the preliminary
application submission, to verify the precise location on their
property of wetlands, floodplains and floodways.
(2) Development within the Environmental Overlay District also shall
be subject to the separate review and permitting authority of the
United States Army Corps of Engineers (wetlands) and the New
Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) [wetlands,
floodplains, and floodways]. All applications submitted to the
Planning Board for lands mapped within the Environmental
Overlay District, and verified as within the district must receive
approval from the appropriate federal or state agency before final
approval can be granted by the City.
(3) Development adjacent to the Environmental Overlay District may
be subject to additional restrictions resulting from transition areas
adjacent to wetlands of exceptional resource value and or
intermediate resource value, as regulated by the New Jersey
Freshwater Wetlands Protection Act (N.J.S.A. 13:9B-1 et seq.).
C. Permitted uses. Uses permitted within the Environmental Overlay
District shall be those permitted in the underlying base zoning district,
subject to all restrictions as to use, area and bulk required by federal or
state regulations governing the environmental features.
D. Wetlands.
(1) Initial municipal review.
(a) The Construction Official, or development review officer, shall,
upon receipt of an application for development, initially
determine whether or not all or part of each application falls
within a wetlands area as defined by the New Jersey
Freshwater Wetlands Act. If an affirmative determination is
made, the applicant shall be instructed in writing to submit to
§ 30-108 MILLVILLE CODE § 30-109
1:366
the NJDEP a request for the freshwater wetlands letter of
determination pursuant to N.J.A.C. 7:7A-7 et seq. No such
application for development shall be deemed complete unless
and until a response from the NJDEP is received.
(b) In lieu of the above, any applicant who acknowledges the need
for a NJDEP freshwater wetlands permit may waive the initial
municipal determination and NJDEP letter of determination
and submit a direct application to NJDEP for a freshwater
wetlands permit.
(c) If NJDEP determines a permit is necessary, no application for
development shall be considered complete, for the purpose of
the City's review, until such time as said permit is obtained.
Nothing contained herein shall limit the authority of the
Planning Board to conduct a conceptual review of any
development application while the NJDEP review is underway.
(d) If the NJDEP determines that a freshwater wetlands permit is
not necessary, then the applicant shall be subject to the
provisions of Subsection D(3) below.
(2) Transition area standards. Strict adherence to transition area
requirements established by the freshwater wetlands protection
regulations shall be enforced. Transition areas are required around
exceptional resource value and intermediate resource value
freshwater wetlands to protect them from adverse impacts.
(a) Applications must include a letter of interpretation for a
classification determination from the NJDEP or a letter of
exemption for transition areas.
(b) Development must be avoided within 150 feet of the property
line if the adjacent wetlands are of exceptional resource value
or within 50 feet of the property line if the adjacent wetlands
are of intermediate value.
(c) Transition area widths may be reduced by the NJDEP by
applying for a transition area waiver. A copy of all information
sent to and received from NJDEP must be filed with the City.
(3) Use standards for non-state-regulated wetlands. For wetland areas
not within NJDEP jurisdiction, notwithstanding any other provision
of this chapter, no building, on-lot sewage disposal facility or
parking lot shall be erected or constructed, either above or below
ground level, within any wetlands area in the City of Millville.
Nothing herein, however, shall be construed as to prohibit the use
of any wetlands area for farming, grazing, plant nurseries,
horticulture, truck farming, forestry, wild crop harvesting or open
recreation areas, such as parks, playgrounds, picnic areas,
hunting, fishing or the like provided the same is permitted in the
zone in which the premises are located.
§ 30-109 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 30-109
1:367
§ 30-110. Seasonal High Water Table Overlay Zone.
E. Floodplains. Any development proposed in or adjacent to floodplains
and/or floodways shall be subject to the regulations contained in
Chapter 20 of the Code of the City of Millville.
A. Purpose.
(1) A Seasonal High Water Table/Critical Areas Overlay District is
hereby established to avoid development within areas exhibiting or
prone to exhibit poor environmental conditions, specifically low
depth to seasonal high water table (SHWT) and/or soils with poor
drainage characteristics, and to incorporate such areas into larger
lot areas. It is recognized that the development of any parcel of
land is impacted by existing environmental conditions, and
negative impacts on site development can be exacerbated by
existing dense development and small lot sizes. The City of Millville
adopts the following standards governing the modification of
development density in all R-10 Zones where municipal sanitary
sewer connection is not available.
(2) These standards have been developed based on a special study of
affected areas, adopted as part of the 1990 Master Plan, entitled
"Land Use, Environmental Conditions and Alternative Solutions for
the community of Laurel Lake, Millville, New Jersey." Based on the
conclusions and recommendations of the aforementioned report
the minimum lot size standards contained herein shall be strictly
enforced.
B. Applicability. Land falling within the following classification shall be
subject to the standards contained in this chapter:
(1) Critical areas. Nonsewered land located within an R-10 Zoning
District as shown on the City of Millville Zoning Map.
(2) Seasonal high water table. All areas within the R-10 where the
seasonal high water table is encountered within 10 feet of the
surface as indicated by mottling or other physical evidence. Such
areas will include those soil classifications as contained in the "Soil
Survey of Cumberland County." For purposes of this chapter,
seasonal high water table is defined as the upper limit of the
shallowest zone of saturation which occurs in the soil.
Measurement of the seasonal high water table is more fully
described in § 30-110C of this chapter.
C. Regulation for Critical Areas/Seasonal High Water Table District.
(1) Minimum parcel size; SHWT factor.
(a) Any use which is permitted in the R-10 Zone shall be permitted
in the Critical Area/Seasonal High Water Table District,
provided that the minimum size parcel permitted for
§ 30-109 MILLVILLE CODE § 30-110
1:368
development is determined in accordance with the following
table:
Depth to SHWT
(feet)
Minimum Lot Size
(square feet)
2 or less 40,000
3 to 4 30,000
5 to 7 20,000
8 to 9 16,000
10 or more 10,000
(b) The SHWT factor shall be determined based on the average
depth to SHWT within the parcel being considered for
development, and must be established and certified by a
licensed professional engineer. In determining the SHWT
factor, the depth to SHWT shall be rounded off to the nearest
even foot.
(c) In establishing the average depth to SHWT, the engineer shall
provide a minimum of one soil boring to a depth of 10 feet at a
location being at the average elevation between the upslope
and downslope sides and as near to the center as possible of
the parcel being considered for development. The soil log shall
describe in detail all profiles and characteristics of the soils
encountered. Additional soil borings, topography and other
site specific information may be required on parcels exhibiting
extreme variations in site conditions, and shall be provided as
necessary to support the establishment of the average depth to
SHWT within the said parcel.
(2) Any of the following uses are permitted uses in the overlay zone
area without regard to SHWT, provided that no building or
structure, including swimming pools, driveways and parking areas,
on-lot sewage disposal facilities, shall be constructed within the
critical area as herein defined.
(a) Woodland preserves and open spaces.
(b) Reforestation in accordance with recognized conservation
practices.
(c) Recreation uses.
In such case where there is a conflict between the minimum
lot size required based on depth to seasonal high water table
and the minimum permitted by the R-10 Schedule of District
Regulations the more stringent requirement shall apply.
§ 30-110 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 30-110
1:369
(3) In considering a development application for subdivision within a
critical area, the Planning Board shall place such conditions on the
development as may be necessary to ensure that the development
is designed in such a way as to minimize the impact of the
development on the critical area and on the public health, safety
and welfare of the City. Such conditions include, but are not limited
to:
(a) Prohibiting development in all or parts of the critical area;
(b) Requiring deed restrictions governing uses of the critical areas
of the property;
(c) Limiting tree or vegetation removal in the critical areas;
(d) Limiting the size of the structure or the amount of disturbed
area;
(e) Requiring specific erosion or stormwater quantity or quality
controls;
(f) Acquisition of any other local, state, county or federal permits.
D. Submission requirements.
(1) Subdivision (major or minor). Any development application for
subdivision approval for lands within the areas regulated by this
chapter must submit to the Planning Board the following:
(a) All materials and documents required by § 30-45 of this
chapter;
(b) Results of soil boring test conducted and certified by a
licensed, professional civil engineer as specified in § 30-110C
of this chapter and any additional information as required by
§ 30-110C;
(c) Calculations for minimum lot size based on the formula
contained in § 30-110C.
(2) Single-family dwellings. Any person constructing a single-family
dwelling within the areas regulated by this chapter must submit to
the Zoning Officer the following:
(a) Zoning permit application;
(b) Results of a soil boring test conducted and certified by a
licensed, professional civil engineer as specified in § 30-110C
of this section;
(c) A calculation for minimum lot size based on the formula
contained in § 30-110C.
E. Exceptions and variances for critical areas.
§ 30-110 MILLVILLE CODE § 30-110
1:370
§ 30-111. Agricultural Conservation District.
(1) Variances to the critical area regulations shall be heard as "C"
variances. The Zoning Board of Adjustment may grant a variance to
any provisions of these critical area regulations in accordance with
the procedures for a "C" variance. The Zoning Board may request
detailed plans, sketches, and the preparation of an environmental
impact study or modified form thereof. In considering such
requests for exceptions, the Zoning Board may refer the request for
exception to the City Engineer, Planner and County Board of Health
for recommendations. Such recommendations shall be made within
30 days after receipt of referral. Where applicable, in accordance
with the New Jersey Municipal Land Use Law, the Planning Board
may act in place of the Zoning Board of Adjustment.
(2) Where actual site work demonstrates that the seasonal high water
table estimate resulting from the soil boring as required in
§ 30-110C is incorrect, the zoning permit is no longer valid.
(3) If a septic system design has been approved and permit issued by
the Cumberland County Department of Health for an affected
parcel prior to the effective date of this chapter, the minimum
requirements established by the R-10 Zoning District shall be
enforced for purposes of obtaining a zoning permit.
A. Purpose. This zone serves the following purposes, otherwise set forth in
the Master Plan's description of the agricultural conservation section of

and other environmentally sensitive areas within the river corridor;
(5) To delineate specific development and site design standards
regulating land use within the river corridor;
(6) To conserve the water quality of the river and prevent degradation
of its quality, purity, clarity and free-flowing condition;
(7) To ensure that any development which may occur shall be done in
an orderly manner consistent with the natural environment and
aesthetic qualities of the river and its tributaries;
(8) To encourage the identification, preservation and interpretation of
historical and archaeological sites along Maurice River and its
tributaries;
(9) To prohibit the siting of landfills, dumps, waste storage and
incineration facilities, sludge farming, radioactive waste facilities
and/or any other uses that pose a direct threat to the outstandingly
remarkable resources and attributes of the Maurice River and its
tributaries.
B. Intent. It is the general intent of these rules to define terms used and to
regulate and restrict lot coverage and use, density, and the size and
location of all structures by the delineation of permitted uses and
development standards so as to promote the purposes identified in this
section. It is not the intent of these rules to revoke, annul, cancel, or in
any way impair or interfere with existing provisions of law, ordinances,
or any rules, regulations or with any private restrictions placed upon
property by covenant or deed.
C. River Conservation District boundaries. This zoning district established
a definable area within which local zoning shall guide future
development and use. The boundaries of the Maurice River
Conservation District shall be described and attached to this section
and depicted on the City of Millville Zoning Map. It is noted that the
§ 30-116 MILLVILLE CODE § 30-116
1:386
R-10 Zone known as Laurel Lake, was included in the study area
boundaries of the River Conservation Zone because it is part of the
Maurice River Watershed. However, this particular area shall be
governed by the standards imposed by the Seasonal High Water/Critical
Areas Overlay Zone Ordinance (27-1990) adopted October 16, 1990. It
is recognized by this ordinance that pre-existing development patterns
in the Laurel Lake area preclude the application of the specific
standards contained herein. It is further recognized that Ordinance
27-1990, Seasonal High Water/Critical Areas Overlay Zone, achieves
the goals and purposes listed in § 30-116A. Therefore, while the unique
historical settlement pattern of Laurel Lake mandates the development
regulations contained in Ordinance 27-1990, the purposes of this
section and Ordinance 27-1990 are consistent.53
D. Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms shall have the
meanings indicated:
BLUFF  The top of a steep bank rising from the river's edge on a lot
or parcel.
DEVELOPABLE AREA  The portion of the tract or parcel upon which
development may occur and from which lot size and open space can be
calculated after subtracting any state-claimed tidal land.
ORDINARY HIGH-WATER MARK  The line between upland and
bottomland, which persists through successive changes in water level
below which the presence and action of the water is so common or
recurrent that the character of the land is marked distinctly from the
upland and is apparent in the soil itself, the configuration of the surface
of the soil and the vegetation. Within areas of tidal influence, the
ordinary high-water mark may be interpreted as being the mean highwater
line as designated by the NJDEP.
RIVERFRONT SETBACK LINE  The minimum required distance for a
principal structure to be set back from the river's edge.
REFORESTATION  The renewal of vegetative cover by seeding,
planting or transplanting.
E. Permitted uses. The following uses are permitted, provided they are in
conformance with the standards contained in § 30-116J and K herein:

river. If any lot, existing at the time of the adoption of this chapter,
does not contain sufficient depth, measured landward from the
ordinary high-water mark or wetland delineation as appropriate, to
provide a fifty-foot buffer strip, this requirement may be reduced
50%. For the purposes of normal pedestrian access to the
waterfront, an opening of not more than 10 feet may be excluded
from the buffer requirements.
(2) The removal of natural vegetation shall be controlled in accordance
with the following criteria:
(a) Clear-cutting shall be prohibited, except as necessary for
constructing public facilities, roadways, utilities and parking
areas.

approval, be permitted to be used as a nonconforming lot of record.
N. Hardships, exceptions and variances. To avoid undue hardship, nothing
in this section shall be deemed to require a change in design,
construction, or intended use of any structure for which a building
permit was legally issued prior to the effective date of this chapter.
Such construction shall be completed within two years from the
effective date of this chapter, or such construction shall conform to the
standards contained herein.
O. Pesticides, herbicides and fertilizers. Because of the potentially severe
adverse effects on riverfront vegetation, fish, wildlife, and water quality
from improper use of even small amounts of pesticides, herbicides and
fertilizers, their use on lands within the River Conservation District is
strongly discouraged except when utilized in accordance with the
advice and supervision of qualified professionals.

A. Purpose. The purpose of these regulations is to authorize development
and redevelopment of land within the Traditional Neighborhood
Overlay District (TNO) consistent with the design principles of
traditional neighborhoods or neotraditional design. This type of
development is consistent with the principles of smart growth, and it
encourages the efficient use of urban land and delivery of services
through flexible design standards. This type of development also
recognizes site-sensitive design in that each site plan must be shaped
by the context of that site, using the existing neighborhood fabric of
buildings and streets as a template for new development. A traditional
neighborhood development has the following design elements:
(1) Compact, using neighborhoods as basic building blocks for
development;
(2) Designed for the human scale;
(3) Provides a mix of uses, including residential, commercial, civic and
open space, in close proximity to one another within the
neighborhood;
(4) Provides a mix of housing styles, types and sizes to accommodate
households of all ages, sizes and incomes;
§ 30-117 MILLVILLE CODE § 30-117.1
1:394
(5) Incorporates a system or grid pattern of relatively narrow,
interconnected streets with sidewalks, bikeways and transit that
offer multiple routes for motorists, pedestrians, bicyclists and
alternative modes of transportation and provides for the
connections of those streets to existing and future developments.
(6) Retains existing buildings with historical features or architectural
features that enhance the visual character of the community;
(7) Integrates natural features and undisturbed areas in the open
space plan;
(8) Utilizes public buildings, parks and other visual features as
landmarks, symbols and focal points for community identity or as a
town center; and
(9) Consistent with the latest municipal Master Plan, Center City
Redevelopment Plan and the Maurice Riverfront Redevelopment
Plan.
B. Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms shall have the
meanings indicated:
PARK  An open space, available for recreation, its landscape
consisting of paved paths and trails, some open lawn, trees, plantings,
site furnishings, open shelters, or active recreational facilities.
TRADITIONAL NEIGHBORHOOD DEVELOPMENT  A development
strategy or concept that is comprised of three or more significant
revenue-producing uses (such as retail, entertainment, office,
residential, hotel and/or civic, cultural, recreation) or may be
exclusively residential. Uses must be well-planned and mutually
supporting with significant physical and functional integration of
project components to develop a sense of community and promote
community interaction. Traditional neighborhood development shall
promote a relatively close-knit and intensive use of land that maximizes
space in accordance with a coherent plan that clearly defines the types
and scale of uses, densities, amenities, and related elements. Plans for
traditional neighborhood development shall demonstrate architectural
expression and detail, and shall be pedestrian-oriented so as to mitigate
traffic and sprawl. Architectural styles shall promote compatible design
features to create a harmonious visual character to the neighborhood
that reflects vernacular styles and maintains a human scale.
TRADITIONAL NEIGHBORHOOD RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT 
A traditional neighborhood residential development is exclusively
residential and is a development strategy or concept that is comprised
of a diversity of housing types and a compatible mix of housing styles,
types, and sizes to accommodate households of various ages, sizes
and incomes. Traditional neighborhood residential development shall
promote a relatively close-knit and intensive use of land that maximizes
space in accordance with a coherent plan that clearly defines the types
and scale of housing, densities, amenities, and related elements. Plans
§ 30-117.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 30-117.1
1:395
for traditional neighborhood residential development shall demonstrate
architectural expression and detail, and shall be pedestrian-oriented
so as to mitigate traffic and sprawl. Architectural styles shall promote
compatible design features to create a harmonious visual character to
the neighborhood that reflects vernacular styles and maintains a human
scale.

standards for development and redevelopment within the Center
City Redevelopment Area excluding the Arts District Overlay Zone
for new and infill development as well as the redevelopment of
existing parcels.
(2) The Traditional Neighborhood Overlay District shall apply as an
overlay, meaning that it applies as an alternative zoning pattern,
when and if chosen by the applicant. Within the overlay, the
existing zoning regulations or redevelopment plans shall continue
unrestricted should this overlay not be applied. The application of
the overlay provides for a series of new permitted land uses which
are in addition to those provided in the standard zoning or
redevelopment plans.

F. Bulk, coverage and density standards.
(1) Bulk standards. In order to provide full flexibility in the design and
layout of residential and nonresidential lots and structures and to
insure a compatible relationship between all residential uses and
residual land uses, an application for development shall not be
required to meet the minimum lot size, minimum depth and
minimum yard dimensions of the underlying zones within the TNO
District. The TNO District commands reduced front setbacks,
smaller lot sizes and rear accessed alleys.
(2) Coverage.
(a) Nonresidential uses. Building coverage shall not exceed 70%
and impervious coverage shall not exceed 90% of the total
nonresidential development area. Parks and public rights-ofway
shall be excluded from this calculation.

G. General design standards.
§ 30-117.1 MILLVILLE CODE § 30-117.1
1:398
(1) Pedestrian circulation. Convenient pedestrian circulation systems
should minimize pedestrian-motor vehicle conflicts. All streets,
except for alleys, shall be bordered by sidewalks on both sides in
accordance with the specifications of § 30-181. Traffic-calming
features such as queuing, curb extensions, traffic circles and
medians may be used to encourage streets with a designated speed
of 25 miles per hour or less;
(2) Street layout. The traditional neighborhood development should
maintain or extend the existing street grid, and restore any
disrupted street grid where feasible;
(3) Parking. Parking areas for shared or community use are
encouraged. Adjacent on-street parking may apply toward the
minimum parking requirements. All off-street parking should be
located at the rear of the lot or, if necessary, to the side of the lot,
accessed by alleys or driveways and shall be screened from view,
mitigating visual impacts;
(4) Paving. Reduction of impervious surfaces through the use of
interlocking pavers, porous pavement or other impervious surface
technology is strongly encouraged;
(5) Street trees. Street trees shall be installed on both sides of all
streets in accordance with an approved landscape plan. Trees shall
be evenly spaced along the street between the curb and the
sidewalk as existing site conditions permit. Location and spacing
shall be predicated upon adequate soil volume for root growth and
adequate space and sunlight for tree canopy expansion. In
commercial areas with wider sidewalks that extend to the curb,
trees shall be placed in tree wells with ornamental devices and/or
construction methods that protect the trunk from damage and
prevent compaction of exposed soil around the base of the tree.
(a) Such tree wells shall have sufficient soil volume to support tree
growth as follows:
Tree Size at Maturity
(height in feet)
Soil Volume
(in cubic feet)
Large trees (45 or more) 200
Medium-sized trees (30 to 45) 150
Small trees (up to 30) 100
(b) A maximum depth of 24 inches shall be used for the purpose of
computing soil volumes. Lengths and widths may vary but shall
not overlap with adjacent tree areas.
(c) Areas under sidewalks may be used to meet the soil volume
requirement, provided no more than 50% of the volume is
located under such hard paving.
§ 30-117.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 30-117.1
1:399
(d) When required soil volumes cannot be obtained, alternate
construction and planting methods shall be required such as
structural soils or modular suspended pavement systems.
(e) When trees are planted at predetermined intervals along
streets, spacing shall depend on the tree size.
Tree Size at Maturity
(height in feet)
Planting Interval
(in feet)
Large trees (45 or more) 40
Medium-sized trees (30 to 45) 30
Small trees (up to 30) 20
(f) Trees may be planted closer together in order to avoid
interference with utilities, roadways, sidewalks, sight

making deliveries or pickups on a daily basis which may require delays
in order to make such delivery or pickup shall, in addition to any
required loading space, provide a truck waiting or standing area in
order to avoid undue interference with the public use of streets or
alleys.
A. Purpose. This section sets minimum standards for off-street
requirements for new construction and expansion of or changes to
existing uses. The purpose of this section is to ensure that uses have a
minimum level of off-street parking to avoid congestions on
surrounding streets while avoiding excessive parking which dries up
the cost of development, invites excessive levels of traffic congestion
and creates increases in flooding and nonpoint source pollution. The
parking ratios contained herein reflect the City's commitment to reduce
its impact on the environmental and natural resources as outlined in the
Environmental Sustainability Element of the Master Plan. The parking
standards advance the goal of reducing runoff volume and providing
water quality benefits.
B. General applicability. The minimum parking ratio standards apply to all
zoning districts except the B-3 Central Business District. The Zoning
Officer shall determine the parking requirement for uses that do not
correspond to the categories listed in the Parking Standards Table.57 In
such instances the applicant shall provide adequate information as
requested by the Zoning Officer in order to make a determination.
C. Multiple uses. Where the application identifies accessory or multiple
uses within a structure or multiple structures, the minimum standards
shall apply to each use or structure. This does not apply to shared
parking.
57.Editor's Note: See § 30-137F.
§ 30-136 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 30-137
1:415

provided cooperatively for two or more uses in a development or for two
or more individual uses, subject to the requirements of this section and
the following conditions:
(1) The off-site, off-street parking facilities are within 300 feet of the
property.
(2) The parking demands of the individual uses, based upon the
minimum parking requirements of this section, are such that the
total parking demand of all the uses at any one time is less than the
total parking stalls required.
(3) A written agreement between the owners and lessees is executed
for a minimum of five years and a copy of said agreement is
maintained in the Planning office. The Planning Board shall be
notified when any agreement is canceled or expires. Should the
lease terminate, the lessee must return to the Planning Board with
a revised parking plan.
E. Bicycle parking. Bicycle parking spaces shall be required for all
nonresidential uses and structures. One bicycle parking space shall be
required for each 20 parking spaces. Such spaces may be provided
through bicycle storage racks or other fixtures securely affixed to the
ground.
F. Parking ratios. The following table establishes the minimum number of
parking spaces required for the uses indicated:

ARTICLE XV
Specially Protected Uses
§ 30-141. Airports and heliports.
Under the Air Safety and Zoning Act of 1983, the State Commissioner of
Transportation has mapped areas around licensed public airports which
are considered to be airport hazard areas. The Municipal Land Use Law
requires that these airport hazard areas be shown on the land use plan
element of the Master Plan. Additionally, the standards adopted by the
New Jersey Department of Transportation governing permitted uses and
heights of structures within designated airport hazard areas is incorporated
by reference. The state regulations allow for a variance procedure after
municipal approvals have been obtained. See N.J.A.C. 16:61-6.1 et seq.
§ 30-142. Cemeteries.
Cemeteries must conform with both municipal and state standards pursuant
to N.J.S.A. 8A:3-1. Additionally, state law requires that the governing body
of the City consent to a new cemetery or the enlargement of an existing one.
Thus, approval by the governing body and the Planning Board or Board of
Adjustment will be necessary.
§ 30-143. Child-care centers and family day-care homes.
§ 30-144. Community residences for developmentally disabled and
similar homes.
Community residences for the developmentally disabled are licensed
facilities which provide services to no more than 15 developmentally
disabled or mentally ill persons. Community shelters for victims of domestic
violence and residences for persons with head injuries are also covered by
A. Under the Child Care Center Licensing Act, N.J.S.A. 30:5B-1 et seq.,
child-care centers are facilities for six or more children and must be
licensed by the State Department of Human Services. The Municipal
Land Use Law requires that child-care centers be permitted in all
nonresidential zones. The state adopted mandatory standards for the
general location of child-care centers, as well as minimum standards for
the physical plant and facilities, food staff, sanitation and outdoor
recreational space. See N.J.A.C. 10:122-1 et seq. The Municipal Land
Use Law requires that child-care centers be exempt from parking and
density standards which otherwise apply to nonresidential uses.
B. Family day-care homes are residences approved by the Division of
Youth and Family Services. These homes provide day-care services to
between three and five children on a weekly basis. The Municipal Land
Use Law requires that family day-care homes be permitted in all
residential zones and be subject to the same standards which apply to
single-family dwellings.
§ 30-141 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 30-144
1:423
the Municipal Land Use Law. All of these facilities are permitted uses in all
residential zones, provided the occupancy does not exceed 15 persons.
§ 30-145. Condominiums and cooperatives.
The Municipal Land Use Law requires that buildings to be occupied in the
condominium or cooperative form of ownership be subject to the same site
plan, subdivision and design standards applicable to similar buildings in
other forms of ownership.
§ 30-146. Farms.
The Right to Farm Act, N.J.S.A. 4:1C-1 et seq. preempts municipal land
use authority over commercial farms where agriculture is a permitted use
under the municipal Zoning Ordinance as of December 31, 1997. Primary
jurisdiction to regulate agricultural management practices rests with the
County Agricultural Board (CAB) or the State Agricultural Development
Committee (SADC). Those entities must consider the limitations imposed by
local land use and Zoning Ordinances adopted pursuant to the Municipal
Land Use Law in connection with issues related to public health and safety.
§ 30-147. Groundwater remediation facilities.
Structures and equipment needed to remove or treat groundwater pollution
are mandatory accessory uses in all zoning districts pursuant to the
Municipal Land Use Law. Although site plan review may not be required,
municipalities may adopt reasonable siting standards.
§ 30-148. Manufactured housing.
Manufactured housing is housing built in sections which are transported
to the site, installed on a permanent foundation and are manufactured in
accordance with federal and state codes. The Municipal Land Use Law
requires that manufactured housing be subject to the same standards as
similar uses, provided that the home is a minimum of 22 feet in width,
installed on a permanent foundation and the same person owns the home
and the lot on which the home is located.
§ 30-149. Schools.
Municipalities have the right to determine through zoning where schools
will be permitted. However, once that decision is made, a school board
is not required to conform with municipal site plan or design standards.
Rather, the new school must comply with standards adopted by the State
Board of Education. Where public schools are permitted by zoning, the
Municipal Land Use Law requires that private nonprofit schools also shall
be permitted.
§ 30-150. Utilities and cable television.
§ 30-144 MILLVILLE CODE § 30-150
1:424
A. Public utilities are not exempt from local zoning and land use
requirements. However, utilities have a special right of appeal to the
state Board of Public Utilities who can override local zoning if it finds
that the proposed use is necessary for the service, convenience or
welfare of the public.
B. Cable television companies are not exempt from local zoning and land
use requirements. However, cable television companies have a special
right of appeal to the Office of Cable Television.

General Site Improvement Standards
§ 30-151. Applicability.
The provisions and performance standards set forth in this article shall
apply to all development within the City as provided in the Schedules of
District Regulations and this chapter.
§ 30-152. Satisfaction of standards required.
The following provisions and standards shall be addressed and satisfied in
connection with development review and approval.
§ 30-153. Air quality.
No use governed by state and federal air quality regulations shall emit heat,
odor, vibrations, noise or any other pollutant into the air which exceeds
the most stringent requirements of the applicable state or federal
requirements.
§ 30-154. Blocks.
§ 30-155. Buffers and screening.
Whenever buffers or screening are required as provided by this chapter
or as a condition imposed by the Planning Board or Zoning Board of
Adjustment, it shall be installed in accordance with the following standards
and requirements:
A. The length, width and acreage of street blocks shall be sufficient to
accommodate the size lot required in the zone district in which it is to
be located and to provide for convenient access, circulation control, and
traffic study.
B. Blocks over 1,000 feet in length within residential areas shall be
discouraged, but where they are used, pedestrian crosswalks or
bikeways between lots may be required in locations deemed necessary
by the Planning Beard. No block within a residential area shall exceed
1,500 feet in length.
C. Within commercial and industrial areas, block lengths shall be
sufficient to meet area and yard requirements for such uses and to
provide proper street access and circulation.
A. Buffer areas shall require site plan review and are required along all lot
lines and street lines which separate a nonresidential use from either
an existing residential use or residential zoning district. Buffer areas
shall be developed in an aesthetic manner for the primary purpose of
screening views and reducing noise perception beyond the lot. No
structure, use, activity, storage of materials, stormwater management
facility or parking of vehicles shall be permitted within a buffer area,
§ 30-151 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 30-155
1:427
except as may be permitted within an individual zoning district. This
provision shall not be construed to prevent driveways and walkways
between the street and the use within the site or utilities providing
service to such use. [Amended 1-16-2007 by Ord. No. 1-2007]
B. The standards for the location and design of buffer areas are intended
to provide flexibility in order to provide effective buffers. The location
and design of buffers shall consider the use of the portion of the
property being screened, the distance between the use and the
adjoining property line, differences in elevations, the type of buffer such
as dense planting, existing woods, a wall or fence, buffer height, buffer
width, and other combinations of man-made and natural features. The
buffer shall be designed, planted, graded, landscaped and developed
with the general guideline that the closer a use or activity is to a
property line, or the more intense the activity is to a property line, or
the more intense the use, then the more effective the buffer area must
be in obscuring light and vision and reducing noise beyond the edges of
the lot. [Amended 1-16-2007 by Ord. No. 1-2007]
C. All buffer areas shall be planted and maintained with either grass or
ground cover together with a screen of live shrubs or scattered
plantings of live trees, shrubs, or other plant material meeting the
following standards:
(1) The preservation of all natural wooded tracts shall be an integral
part of all site plans and may be calculated as part of the buffer

ensure that the stopping or maneuvering space is at least 10 feet removed
from the right-of-way line of the road.
§ 30-159. Development name.
The proposed name of any development shall not duplicate, or too closely
approximate, the name of any other development or locality in or in close
proximity to the City. The Planning Board shall have final authority to
designate the name of the development which shall be determined at the
preliminary stage of development review.
§ 30-160. Energy conservation.
A. Whenever and wherever feasible, buildings shall be sited so as to make
maximum use of sunlight or winds in connection with energy
generation and/or conservation. All buildings and structures
hereinafter erected or constructed, altered or added onto shall use
renewable energy sources, with the limits of practicability and
feasibility dependent on the proposed use of the structure and its
location. Where an applicant can demonstrate that literal enforcement
of the provisions of this chapter will prevent or substantially impair or
reduce energy conservation methods or technologies, the approval
authority may waive or adjust the standards, including, through
variance procedures as set forth in § 30-94, maximum and minimum
yard dimensions as shown on the Schedules of District Regulations. In
so doing, the approval authority shall determine that the intent and
purpose of this chapter and the adopted Master Plan are met, and that
adjoining properties and/or their environment will not be adversely
affected by the waiver, adjustment or variance.
B. In the case of new developments, the majority of all structures in the
development shall have their long axis located within 30º of true South.
C. Wherever plantings are proposed or required as provided under the
provisions of this chapter, no plantings of trees, shrubs or any object
shall be permitted which will result in shading or interfering with solar
access to the south wall of any proposed or existing building. When
reviewing proposed landscaping for any proposed development, the
approving authority shall not require or permit, where reasonably able
to do so, any planting or the placement of an object or structure which
will substantially interfere with solar access to adjacent buildings or
existing solar devices or structures.

A homeowners' association may, or in some cases, be required to be
established for the purpose of owning and assuming maintenance
responsibilities for the common open space and common lands or property
designed within a development, provided that the Planning Board is
satisfied that the organization will have a sufficient number of members to
reasonably expect a perpetuation of the organization in a manner enabling
it to meet its obligations and responsibilities in owning and maintaining
A. All dead-end roads will terminate in an area adequate to provide
ingress and egress for fire-fighting equipment.
B. The rights-of-way of all roads will be maintained so that they provide an
effective fire break.
C. All proposed developments of 25 units or more will have two
accessways to public rights-of-way and the accessways shall be of such
width and surface composition sufficient to accommodate and support
fire-fighting equipment.

any property for the benefit of owners or residents of the development. If
established, the organization shall incorporate the following provisions:
A. Membership by all property owners, condominium owners,
stockholders under a cooperative development and other owners of
property or interests in the project shall be mandatory. Required
membership and the responsibilities upon the members shall be in
writing between the organization and each member in the form of a
convenant with each agreeing to liability for his/her pro rata share of
the organization's costs.
B. The organization shall be responsible for liability insurance, taxes,
maintenance and any other obligations assumed by the organization,
and shall hold the municipality harmless from any liability. The
organization shall not be dissolved and shall not dispose of any open
space or property by sale or otherwise, except to an organization
conceived and established to own and maintain the open space or
property for the benefit of such development, and thereafter such
organization shall not be dissolved or dispose of any of its open space or
property without first offering to dedicate the same to the municipality
or municipalities wherein the land is located.
C. The assessment levied by the organization upon each member may
become a lien on each member's property. The organization shall be
allowed to adjust the assessment to meet changing needs.
D. The organization shall clearly describe in its bylaws all the rights and
obligations of each tenant and owner, including a copy of the covenant,
model deeds and Articles of Incorporation of the organization and the
fact that every tenant and property owner shall have the right to use all
common properties. These shall be set forth as a condition of approval
and shall be submitted prior to the granting of final approval by the
Planning Board.
E. The Articles of Incorporation, covenants, bylaws, model deeds, and
other legal instruments shall ensure that control of the organization
shall be transferred to the members based on a percentage of the
dwelling units sold and/or occupied and shall clearly indicate that in the
event such organization shall fail to maintain the common open space
or common property or lands in reasonable order and condition, the
City may serve written notice upon such organization or upon the
owners of the development setting forth the manner in which the
organization has failed to maintain the common open space or common
property or lands in reasonable condition, and the notice shall include a
demand that such deficiencies of maintenance be cured within 15 days
thereof, and shall state the date and place of a hearing thereon which
shall be held within 15 days of the notice. At such hearing, the
designated municipal body or officer, as the case may be, may modify
the terms of the original notice as to deficiencies and may give a
reasonable extension of time, not to exceed 65 days within which they
shall be cured.
§ 30-164 MILLVILLE CODE § 30-164
1:434
§ 30-165. Landscaping and shade trees.
F. If the deficiencies set forth in the original notice or in the modification
thereof shall not be cured within 15 days, or any permitted extension
thereof, the City, in order to preserve the common open space and
common property or land and maintain the same for a period of one
year, may enter upon and maintain such land. The entry and
maintenance shall not vest in the public any rights to use the common
open space and common property and land, except when the same is
voluntarily dedicated to the public by the owners. Before the expiration
of the year, the City shall, upon its initiative or upon the request of the
organization theretofore responsible for the maintenance of the
common open space and common property of land, call a public hearing
upon 15 days written notice to such organization and to the owners of
the development, to be held by the City at which hearing such
organization and the owners of the development shall show cause why
such maintenance by the municipality shall not, at the election of the
City, continue for a succeeding year.
G. If the municipality shall determine that such organization is ready and
able to maintain the open space and property or land in reasonable
condition, the municipality shall cease to maintain the open space and
property or lands at the end of the year. If the City shall determine such
organization is not ready and able to maintain the open space and
property or land in reasonable condition, the City may, in its discretion,
continue to maintain the open space and property or land during the
next succeeding year, subject to a similar hearing and determination in
each year thereafter. The decision of the City in any such case shall
constitute a final administrative decision subject to judicial review.
H. The cost of such maintenance by the City shall be assessed pro rata
against the properties within the development that have a right of
enjoyment of the common open space and property of land in
accordance with assessed values at the time of imposition of the lien,
and shall be a lien and tax on the properties and be added to and be part
of the taxes to be levied and assessed thereon, and enforced and
collected with interest by the same officers and in the same manner as
other taxes.
A. All shade trees shall have a minimum diameter of 2 1/2 inches
measured three feet above the ground and shall be of a species
approved by the approval authority or City Shade Tree Commission.
Trees shall be planted 40 feet to 60 feet apart and parallel to but not
more than 20 feet from the curbline and shall be balled and burlapped,
nursery grown, free from insects and disease and true to species and
variety. Stripping trees from a lot or filling around trees on a lot shall
not be permitted unless it can be shown that grading requirements
necessitate removal of trees, in which case those lots shall be replanted
with trees to reestablish the tone of the area to conform with adjacent
§ 30-164 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 30-165
1:435
lots. Dead or dying trees shall be replaced by the developer during the
next recommended planting season.
B. Off-street parking areas located in commercial or industrial zones
which comprise parking for 25 or more vehicles shall be provided with
living shade trees of a type or types as approved by the City Shade Tree
Commission or Planning Board. The shade trees shall be located in a
carefully planned manner within the parking lot area and in quantity
equal to not less than one shade tree for every eight parking spaces,
and they shall be so spaced and planted as to ensure their proper
maintenance and full protection for health and continued growth.
C. At least 20% of the land area within the perimeter of the parking
surface in commercial or industrial zones where 100 or more parking
spaces are provided shall be developed as a landscaped divider strip.
All such areas shall be planted with grass, shrubs, bushes and shade
trees in order to alleviate an otherwise barren expanse of open area and
unsightly appearance and as an aid to stormwater disposal. Adequate
provisions shall be made to ensure that such landscaping shall be
maintained in good condition.
D. Where parking islands or dividers are to be planted, they shall be a
minimum of 7 1/2 feet wide when planted between rows of parking
spaces. Where parking islands at the ends of parking bays are to be
planted and landscaped, said islands shall be a minimum of 15 feet
wide, and such planting shall be maintained at all times so that proper
sight distances are maintained for the safe movement of traffic. All such
parking islands shall be protected from intrusion and injury which could
result from the movement of vehicles by the use of curbs or other
equally effective means as approved by the City Engineer.
E. Planting strips shall be provided between adjoining parking lots in
commercial zones to achieve safety and better control of vehicular
movement from one parking lot to another. In such instances, no
parking shall be allowed within five feet of the property line, on either
side, thereby providing a total strip or island 10 feet wide sufficient for
landscaping and/or screening, consistent with all applicable safety
standards as approved by the City Engineer as set forth in this chapter.
F. Open space adjacent to buildings not surfaced, such as walkways,
driveways, parking areas, utility areas or other required improvements
in any apartment or multifamily dwelling project, shall be graded and
seeded to provide a thick strand of grass or other ground cover
material. Two suitable specimen trees and four evergreen shrubs,
exclusive of those used in connection with parking or other open areas,
shall be provided and properly planted for each building. All such
landscaping shall be subject to the approval of any City Shade Tree
Commission or, in the absence of a Commission, the Planning Board.
G. In connection with the demolition or removal of a structure from a site,
any hole or excavation remaining or resulting from such demolition or
§ 30-165 MILLVILLE CODE § 30-165
1:436
§ 30-166. Lots.
In accordance with good design practice, extreme deviations from
rectangular lots shapes and straight lot lines shall not be allowed unless
made necessary by special topographical conditions or other special
conditions acceptable to the approving authority. All lots shall conform to
the following requirements:
removal shall be filled only with clean fill dirt. The dumping of masonry,
concrete, wood, debris or rock shall be prohibited. The site of such
demolition or removal shall have a layer of topsoil provided for the
entire site in sufficient depth and quality to permit the planting, healthy
growth and maintenance of a thick strand of grass which shall be
planted by the person or firm responsible for the said demolition or
removal. The City Engineer shall determine the suitability of the topsoil
and seeding to be provided.
H. Where deemed appropriate and necessary to maintain the character of
the street or neighborhood, the planting of shade trees shall be
required. Such trees shall be approved by the City Shade Tree
Commission or the Planning Board.
A. Lot dimensions and area shall not be less than the requirements of the
minimum and maximum standards set forth on the Schedules of District
Regulations which are a part of this chapter.
B. Insofar as is practical, side lot lines shall be either at right angles or
radial to street lines.
C. Each lot must front upon an approved, paved street.
D. Through lots with frontage on two streets will be permitted only under
the following conditions:
(1) Where the length of the lots between both streets is such that
future division of the lot into two lots is improbable; and
(2) Access shall be to the street with the lower traffic function, and the
portion of the lot abutting the other street shall be clearly labeled
on the plat, and in any deed, that street access is prohibited.
E. Where extra width has either been dedicated or anticipated for
widening of existing streets, zoning consideration shall begin at such
new street line, and all setbacks shall be measured from such line.
F. Whenever land has been dedicated or conveyed to the City by the owner
of a lot in order to meet the minimum street width requirement or to
implement the Official Map or Master Plan, which lot existed at the
effective date of this chapter, the Construction Official shall not
withhold a building and/or occupancy permit when the lot depth and/or
area was rendered substandard due to such dedication and where the
owner has no adjacent lands to meet the minimum requirements.
§ 30-165 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 30-167
1:437
§ 30-167. Manholes, inlets and catch basins.
Whenever manholes, inlets or catch basins are proposed and/or required
to be constructed, all materials used in said construction shall meet the
latest testing standards for the materials involved and shall be subject to
the approval of the City Engineer. All such structures shall be designed and
constructed in accordance with the approval of the City Engineer.
§ 30-168. Monuments.
Monuments shall be the size and shape required by N.J.S.A. 46:23-9.12 of
the Map Filing Law, as amended, and shall be placed in accordance with
said statute and indicated on the final plat. All lot corners shall be marked
with a metal alloy pin of permanent character.
§ 30-169. Natural features.
In connection with the clearing of any site for a proposed development or
in the construction of any proposed development, natural features of the
site, such as trees (particularly those trees with a diameter of eight inches
at breast height), brooks, streams, wetlands, hilltops and scenic vista or
views, shall be preserved whenever possible. On individual lots, care shall
be taken to preserve individual trees, to enhance soil stability and landscape
treatment of the area.
§ 30-170. Off-site and off-tract improvements.
As a condition of preliminary approval and prior to any construction or the
filing of an application for final approval of a subdivision or a site plan, the
applicant shall have made case payments, or, with the consent of the City,
installed, in the manner provided below with respect to the immediate and
ultimate installation of any required off-site and/or off-tract improvements.
A. Allocations of costs, criteria in determining allocation. The allocation of
costs for off-site and/or off-tract improvements as between the
applicant, other property owners and the City, or any one or more of the
foregoing, shall be determined by the Planning Board, with the
assistance of the appropriate City agencies, on the basis of the total
cost of the off-site or off-tract improvements, the increase in market
value of the property affected and any other benefits conferred. The
needs created by the application, population and land use projections
for the general area of the applicant's property and other areas to be
served by the off-site or off-tract improvement, the estimated time of
construction of the off-site or off-tract improvements and the condition
and periods of usefulness, which periods may be based upon the criteria
of N.J.S.A. 40A:2-22. Requirements for off-site or off-tract improvements
shall be consistent with Section 30 of P.L. 1975, Chapter 291. In
addition, the following criteria may also be considered, as well as any
other reasonable criteria the Planning Board feels is necessary to
protect the health, safety and general welfare of the City.
§ 30-167 MILLVILLE CODE § 30-170
1:438
(1) Street, curb, sidewalk, shade trees, streetlights, street signs and
traffic light improvements may also be based upon the anticipated
increase of traffic generated by the application. In determining
such traffic increase, the Planning Board may consider traffic
counts, existing and projected traffic patterns, quality of roads and
sidewalks in the area and other factors related to the need created
by the application and the anticipated benefit thereto.
(2) Drainage facilities may also be based upon or be determined by the
drainage created by or affected by a particular land use,
considering:
(a) The percentage relationship between the acreage of the
application and the acreage of the total drainage basin;
(b) The use of a particular site and the amount of area to be
covered by impervious surfaces on the site itself;
(c) The use, condition or status of the remaining area in the
drainage basin.
(3) Water supply and distribution facilities may be also based upon the
added facilities required by the total anticipated water use
requirements of the property of the applicant and other properties
in the general area benefiting therefrom.
(4) Sewerage facilities may be based upon the proportion that the total
anticipated volume of sewage effluent of the applicant's property
and other properties connected to the new facility bears to the
existing capacity of existing sewerage facilities, including but not
limited to, lines and other appurtenances leading to and servicing
the applicant's property. Consideration may also be given to the
types of effluent and particular problems requiring special
equipment or added costs for treatment. In the event the
applicant's property shall be permitted to be connected to existing
sewer facilities, the applicant shall pay a charge or be assessed in
accordance with the law.
B. Determination of cost of improvements. The cost of installation of the
required off-site and/or off-tract improvements shall be determined by
the Planning Board with the advice of the Planning Board and/or City
Engineer and appropriate City agencies.
C. Manner of construction. When those estimates are received, the City
Commission shall then decide whether the off-tract improvement(s) is
to be constructed:
(1) By the City as a general improvement, or
(2) By the City as a local improvement, or
§ 30-170 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 30-170
1:439
(3) By the applicant under a formula providing for partial
reimbursements by the City for benefits to properties other than
the subdivision or site plan subject property.
D. Amount of contribution. When the manner of construction has been
determined, the applicant may be required to provide a cash deposit to
the City of one of the following amounts:
(1) If the improvement is to be constructed by the City as a general
improvement, an amount equal to the difference between the
estimated cost of the improvement and the estimated total amount,
if less, by which all properties to be serviced thereby, including the
subject property, will be specifically benefited by the off-tract
improvement;
(2) If the improvement is to be constructed by the City as a local
improvement, then in addition to the amount referred to in
Subsection D(1) above, the estimated amount by which the subject
property will be specifically benefited by the off-tract improvement;
or
(3) If the improvement is to be constructed by the applicant, an
amount equal to the estimated cost of the off-tract improvement,
less an offset for benefits to properties other than the subject
property.
E. Payment of allocated cost.
(1) The estimated costs of the off-tract improvement allocated to the
applicant if deposited in case shall be paid by the applicant to the
City Treasurer, who shall provide a suitable depository therefor,
and such funds shall be used only for the off-tract improvements for
which they are deposited or improvements serving the same
purpose, unless such improvements are not initiated by the City
within a period of 10 years from the date of payment, after which
time the funds so deposited shall be returned together with
accumulated interest or other income thereof, if any.
(2) In the event the payment by the applicant to the City Treasurer
provided for herein is less than its share of the actual cost of the offtract
improvements then it shall be required to pay its appropriate
share of the cost thereof.
(3) In the event the payment by the applicant to the City Treasurer
provided for above is more than its appropriate share of the actual
cost of installation of the off-tract improvements, it or its
successors or assigns shall be repaid an amount equal to the
difference between the deposit and its share of the actual cost.
(4) If the applicant shall deem that any of the amounts so estimated by
the Planning Board are unreasonable, it may challenge them and
§ 30-170 MILLVILLE CODE § 30-170
1:440
seek to have them revised in appropriate proceedings brought to
compel subdivision or site plan approval.
(5) If the applicant and the Planning Board cannot agree with respect
to the applicant's appropriate share of the actual cost of the off-site
improvement, or the determination made by the officer or Board
charged with the duty of making assessments as to specific
benefits, if the off-tract improvement is to be constructed as a local
improvement, no approval shall be granted; provided, however,
that the applicant may challenge such determination and seek to
have it revised in appropriate judicial proceedings in order to
compel subdivision or site plan approval.
F. Assessment of properties. Upon receipt from the applicant of its
allocated share of the costs of the off-tract improvements, the City may
adopt a local improvements assessment ordinance for the purpose of
construction and installation of the off-tract improvements based upon
the actual cost thereof. Any portion of the cost of the improvements not
defrayed by a deposit by the applicant may be assessed against
benefiting property owners by the City. Any assessment for benefits
conferred made against the applicant or his successors in interest shall
be first offset by a pro rata share credit of the allocated costs previously
deposited with the City Treasurer pertaining thereto. The applicant or
his successors in interest shall not be liable for any part of an
assessment for such improvements unless the assessment exceeds the
pro rata share credit for the deposit, and then only to the extent of the
deficiency.
G. Credit for work performed. In the event the applicant, with the City's
consent, decides to install and construct the off-tract improvement, or
any portion thereof, the certified cost shall be treated as a credit
against any future assessment for that particular off-tract improvement,
or portion thereof, constructed by the City in the same manner as if the
developer had deposited its apportioned cost with the City Treasurer, as
provided herein.
H. Installation of improvement by applicant.
(1) At the discretion and option of the City and with the consent of the
applicant, the City may enter into a contract with the applicant,
providing for the installation and construction of off-tract
improvements by the applicant upon contribution by the City of the
remaining unallocated portion of the cost of the off-tract
improvement.
(2) In the event the City so elects to contribute to the cost and expense
of installation of the off-site improvements by the applicant, the
portion contributed by the City shall be subject to the possible
certification and assessment as a local improvement against
benefiting property owners in the manner provided by law, if
applicable.

developer will be required to stabilize the gravel base course in a
manner satisfactory to the City Engineer.
C. The method of construction of the bituminous-stabilized base course
shall conform to the same State of New Jersey specifications referred to
above for base course material. Upon completion, uniformly selected
core samples intact for full thickness of base course shall be provided,
at the rate of one sample for every 1,000 square yards of base course, at
the expense of the developer.
D. Where deficiencies in required thickness are noted, at least two
additional cores will be required to determine the extent of the
deficiency.
E. The average thickness of the bituminous-stabilized base course as
determined from the core samples shall be not less than the thickness
specified in Diagrams 1 through 3, Typical Roadway Sections and
Details, which are a part of this chapter. When the thickness of the
pavement as indicated by any core sample shall show a deficiency of 1/4
inch or more from the required thickness, the City Engineer, at his

Specifications, which shall be placed over a properly installed and,
where needed, repaired base course, a track coat as specified in
Section 3.10 of the aforementioned New Jersey Department of
Transportation's Standard Specifications shall be applied.
A. Sanitary sewer facilities shall be provided and installed in accordance
with the specifications as set forth in this section and as required by the
City Engineer. Sanitary sewer facilities shall be designed and installed
for either immediate or future connection with a public or on-site
community sanitary sewer system approved by the New Jersey
Department of Environmental Protection and the City Commission of
§ 30-173 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 30-175
1:445
the City of Millville. In areas where a public sanitary sewer system does
not exist or is not expected to be provided within a reasonable period
of time in the opinion of the Planning Board, the Board may waive the
requirement that sanitary sewer facilities be installed and connected to
public sewer systems.
B. In those cases where a public sanitary sewer system is not presently
available and the site of the proposed development is unsuitable for
individual on-site septic systems as determined by the New Jersey
Department of Environmental Protection or other county or local
agency, an on-site community sanitary sewer system approved by the
New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and the City
Commission shall be installed. On-site septic systems shall be provided
in addition to the required installation of sanitary sewer systems
(collection lines and other related facilities) for those areas expected to
be provided with public sanitary sewers within a reasonable period of
time. All individual on-site septic systems shall be installed within the
front yard of the lots or in any area approved by the Construction
Official in order to facilitate the eventual connection of the system to
public facilities.
C. The approval authority may also as a condition of preliminary approval
require the installation of sanitary sewer facilities necessary to permit
connection to a public sanitary sewer system as provided for in
connection with § 30-170.
D. All sanitary sewer systems shall comply with the rules and regulations
established by the Department of Health, State of New Jersey, as
amended. Sanitary sewer pipe shall be sized for full flow from the tract.
The City may require larger pipe sizes to accommodate future
extensions. Minimum grades for sanitary sewer lines shall be 4/10 of
1% for asbestos-cement pipe and 5/10 of 1% for vitrified clay pipe.
E. Cast-iron pipe, when used for sanitary sewers, shall be centrifugally
cast and shall be provided with mechanical joints, with both pipe and
joints conforming to applicable American Standards Association

In each land development requiring project approval, the area between the
edge of the existing pavement and the proposed or existing curbing along
pipe diameters of 14 inches or more. All asbestos-cement pipe and
fittings shall be furnished with sleeve-and-gasket-type couplings
designed for use with the size and class of pipe specified.
G. Vitrified clay pipe and fittings shall conform to the applicable
requirements of the American Society for Testing and Materials
specifications, as amended. Except where required for special
conditions, such as excessive depth, vitrified clay pipe fittings shall be
standard strength. All vitrified clay pipe and fittings shall have factoryfabricated
gasket-type couplings which conform to the American
Society for Testing and Materials specifications therefor.
H. Excavation and backfill shall conform to the requirements set forth for
subsurface structure excavations. Applicable requirements for
protecting excavations from cave-ins and water accumulations set forth
under § 30-179, Stormwater management, shall apply. Pipes shall be
laid in straight lines between manholes except where otherwise
specifically provided by the City Engineer. When deviation from a
straight line is permitted, the deflection of each joint shall not exceed
the manufacturer's recommended maximum for the type, joint and size
of pipe being installed. All pipes shall be laid to uniform grades between
manholes. Each section of pipe shall be solidly bedded in the trench
bottom and shall be supported for its full length except where
excavation has been made for joints. Before making each joint, the ends
of the pipes and all joint members shall be thoroughly cleaned. All
jointing shall be done in strict accordance with the manufacturer's
recommendations and the directions of the City Engineer. All visible
leakage of any description and no matter where located shall be
corrected by the contractor in a manner satisfactory to the City
Engineer, whether or not the total leakage into the sewer is within the
allowable maximum as determined by infiltration tests. Such infiltration
tests shall be made when and as directed by the City Engineer, and no
connections to flowing lines shall be made until the testing is complete
and satisfactory results have been obtained. The contractor shall
furnish all labor, material and equipment necessary for the infiltration
tests. No section of sanitary sewer between adjacent manholes will be
considered satisfactory or acceptable when the rate of infiltration
exceeds 1/2 of the above-specified rate. Leakage in excess of the above
shall be located and corrected by the contractor. Y-branch and service
laterals which are not to be immediately connected to flowing lines
shall be securely plugged so as to provide a permanently watertight
seal, and the contractor shall accurately record the station and
direction of each such stub. These shall also be located on the
contractor's copy of the plans and permanently marked with a crosscut
on the curb or a hub stake driven at the curbline.
§ 30-175 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 30-176
1:447
the entire property frontage of the road shall be paved in accordance with
the standards and specifications set forth in this chapter and by the City
Engineer.
§ 30-177. Solid waste disposal.
All multifamily, commercial, industrial, recreational and public uses shall
provide for centralized collection of solid wastes. Such solid waste disposal
areas and facilities shall be sufficient in size to handle anticipated waste
generation of the site and use, and be at convenient locations, screened
from view. All such areas and facilities, including provisions for source
separation and resource recovery, shall conform to any adopted solid waste
disposal plan or ordinance applicable to the area involved.
§ 30-178. Streetlighting.
Streetlighting standards and fixtures of a type and number approved by the
Planning Board and City Engineer shall be installed at street intersections
and elsewhere as deemed necessary by the approving authority to provide
light for public safety and welfare along public streets. The developer shall
provide for the installation of connection of streetlighting standards and
fixtures wherever underground utility service is provided.
§ 30-179. Stormwater management.
A. Surface drainage systems adequately designed to accommodate all
surface runoff coming to or accumulating on the tract shall be
constructed. The determination of pipe sizes and box culverts shall be
based on hydraulic computations using the rational method in which
the actual watershed area tributary to the structure is measured and a
minimum runoff coefficient is used which is based on Table 1 shown
below. In cases where dense residential and business development is
anticipated by the Planning Board, this coefficient should be increased
as conditions require, to be determined by the City Engineer.
TABLE 1
Runoff Coefficients for Drainage Design
Classification Runoff Factor C
Parklands, golf courses, etc. 0.15 to 0.30
Open residential 0.30 to 0.50
Dense residential and business 0.50 to 0.70
Commercial and industrial 0.70 to 0.90
B. In general, it will be the objective of these standards to encourage the
retention and disposal of all surface runoff on-site to the greatest extent
practical given existing site conditions and the ability of downstream
facilities to handle additional runoff to be generated by the site.
§ 30-176 MILLVILLE CODE § 30-179
1:448
C. In general, where pipe sizes would be four feet in diameter or larger,
open channels will be permitted. Such channels shall be properly
cleared and graded, with side slopes not to exceed three feet
horizontally to one foot vertically. Maximum design velocities for
channels in feet per second shall not exceed three for fine sand to firm
loam, five for stiff clay to hardpan and 15 for concrete-lined ditch.
Velocity shall be controlled by the use of check dams or ditch banks,
which shall be protected by the use of sod, riprap or paving, as design
velocity dictates.
D. No storm drainage pipes of less than 12 inches in diameter or, if the run
exceeds 50 feet, of less than 15 inches in diameter, shall be installed.
Inlets shall be spaced so that the run of water in gutters does not
exceed 1,000 feet or one block, whichever is less. Manholes or inlets
shall be located where a change in grade or alignment or a storm drain
occurs, but in any case not more than 500 feet apart. Where pipe sizes
are increased, the invert of the larger pipe shall be dropped so the tops
of the pipes will be at the same elevation. Outlet pipes shall extend to
the edge of existing streams and must be provided with concrete
headwalls or suitable end sections. Underdrains with minimum pipe
size of six inches must be constructed where groundwater interferes
with the stability of the road base or with development construction.
E. Where pipe drains a low point from which there can be no surface
runoff without flooding curbs and sidewalk areas, the design shall be
based on the municipal standard rainfall curves shown in Figure 1 and
shall be based on a ten-year storm. In other cases, the pipe size may be
based on a two-year storm. Box culverts shall be designed on the basis
of a fifteen-year storm. Pipe grades shall be so designed that a minimum
velocity of 2 1/2 feet per second will be obtained when the pipe is
flowing 1/4 full. All drainage calculations must be preliminary reviewed
and approved by the City Engineer.
F. Subsurface structure excavations shall be carried out by the contractor
and, only where considered necessary by the City Engineer, shall be
carried below the required facility installation level to remove and
replace unstable soils with thoroughly tamped gravel, crushed stone or
crushed slag. Adequate bracing, shoring and sheeting shall be installed
to protect workmen, members of the public, public and private property
and the work underway. Where deemed necessary by the City Engineer,
the contractor shall provide, install and operate an adequate well-point
system for dewatering to stabilize excavation bottoms and banks.
G. Unless otherwise specified in specific situations by the City Engineer,
reinforced concrete pipe, when used, shall be Class III, Wall B. All
reinforced concrete pipe shall have flexible rubber-type gasket joints,
with both pipe and gasket conforming to the American Society for
Testing and Materials specifications therefor, as amended and revised
to date. When used, corrugated metal pipe and pipe arch shall conform
to the requirements of the American Association of State Highway
Officials (AASHO) specifications therefor, as amended and revised to
§ 30-179 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 30-179
1:449
date. All corrugated metal pipe and pipe arch shall be fully bituminous
coated in accordance with current New Jersey Department of
Transportation specifications therefor.
H. When used, corrugated aluminum pipe and pipe arch shall conform to
the requirements of AASHO designation M-196-62 or AASHO
designation M-211-65. The aluminum alloy sheets shall conform to the
requirements of ASTM B209 Alloy Alclad 3004-H34.
I. Where used, cast-iron pipe, together with mechanical joints, shall
conform to the American Standards Association specifications therefor,
and unless otherwise specified by the City Engineer, cast-iron pipe shall
be Class 22 for pipe diameter of 12 inches or less and thickness Class
21 for a pipe diameter of 14 inches or more.
J. All drainage pipe shall be laid in straight lines between drainage
structures except when otherwise specifically provided. When deviation
from a straight line is permitted, the deflection of each joint shall not
exceed the manufacturer's recommended maximum for the pipe, joint
and size of pipe being installed. All pipe shall conform to specified lines,
grades and dimensions.
K. No deflective or leaking pipes, joints, connections, manholes, inlets or
other parts of the work will be acceptable. All visible leakage of any
description, no matter where located, shall be corrected by the
contractor in a manner satisfactory to the City Engineer.
L. All developments may incorporate on-site stormwater detention or
impoundment facilities as indicated earlier, in the following manner:
(1) Swales may be constructed in which there need be no outlet
facilities and which will impound water draining only from other
landscaped areas. The water impounded in these areas will be left
to evaporate and percolate, the swales shall otherwise be seeded
and maintained in lawn area.
(2) Impoundment/detention basins along any stream that maintains a
steady flow of water throughout the year may be constructed,
provided that any improvements designed to provide such
impoundment/detention facilities shall meet the standards of, and if
required have the approval of, the New Jersey Department of
Environmental Protection, and shall have the proper amount of
sustained water flow downstream, proper depth of water to control
vegetation, and proper design to prevent water stagnation in any
part of the pond.
(3) Detention of stormwater on roof surfaces may be designed by
means of essentially flat but slightly pitched roofs to the edges.
Facilities for control of the water runoff from the roof shall be
provided in the form of vertical leaders with detention rings around
the intake to provide the control of water flow. The spacing and
capacity of the vertical leaders and the detention rings shall be
§ 30-179 MILLVILLE CODE § 30-179
1:450
§ 30-180. Top soil conservation.
Topsoil moved during the course of construction shall be redistributed so as
to provide at least three inches of cover to all areas of the development not
covered and shall be stabilized by seeding, planting or sodding. In the event
that the site does not contain sufficient amounts of topsoil to provide three
inches of topsoil to all uncovered areas of the development, the developer
shall supply sufficient amounts to meet this requirement. Unless specifically
permitted by the Planning Board, no topsoil shall be removed from the site.
§ 30-181. Traffic and circulation.
The following standards shall apply in connection with all developments
in connection with the design and construction of driveways, bikeways,
sidewalks or pedestrianways, streets and similar items concerned with
traffic and circulation:
approved by the City Engineer and Construction Official,
depending on the areas to be drained, the pitch of the roof, the
capacity of the impoundment/detention facilities to which the water
will eventually drain and the structural strength of the roof. It is
recommended that the intakes be protected by a device that will
accept the full amount of water passed on to it from the detention
rings, but which will act as a strainer for any foreign matter such
as leaves, twigs and seedlings. The leader from a roof with water
detention design shall direct the stormwater into a detention basin
constructed in a manner as outlined above.
M. If the drainage characteristics of the soils permit, vegetation can be
used as an effective way to reduce stormwater runoff. Bioretention of
stormwater integrated into landscaped infiltration areas, swales, or
rain gardens can provide temporary storage of runoff as well as on-site
infiltration. Such design will be permitted if soil tests indicate a
capacity for this design and if drainage calculations demonstrate the
capacity of such facilities to accommodate the anticipated stormwater
runoff. Indigenous species must be utilized for bioretention strategies.
A maintenance plan must also be provided to ensure irrigation and
weeding of site. [Added 8-3-2010 by Ord. No. 14-2010]

Engineer.
(7) All entrance and exit driveways to a road shall be located to afford
maximum safety to traffic on the road.
§ 30-181 MILLVILLE CODE § 30-181
1:452
(8) Any exit driveway or driveway lane shall be so designed in profile
and grading and shall be so located as to permit the following
maximum sight distance measured in each direction along any
abutting road; the measurement shall be from the driver's seat of a
vehicle standing on the portion of the exit driveway that is
immediately outside the edge of the road traveled or shoulder:

(9) Where a site occupies a corner of two intersecting roads, no
driveway entrance or exit may be located within a minimum of 30
feet of tangent of the existing or proposed curb radius of that site.
(10)No entrance or exit driveway shall be located on the following
portions of any collector or arterial road: on a traffic circle, on a
ramp of an interchange, within 30 feet of the beginning of any ramp
or other portion of an interchange, nor on any portion of such road
where the grade has been changed to incorporate an interchange.
(11) Where two or more driveways connect a single site to any one road,
a minimum clear distance of 100 feet measured along the right-ofway
line shall separate the closest edges of any two such
driveways.
(12) Driveways used for two-way operation shall intersect any collector
or arterial road at an angle as near 90º as site conditions will
permit and in no case less than 60º.
(13) Driveways used by vehicles in one direction of travel (right turn
only) shall not form an angle smaller than 60º with a collector or
arterial road unless acceleration and deceleration lanes are
provided.
(14) The dimensions of driveways shall be designed to adequately
accommodate the volume and character of vehicles anticipated to
be attracted daily onto the land development for which the site plan
is prepared. The required maximum and minimum dimensions for
driveways are indicated on the accompanying table. Driveways
serving large volumes of daily traffic or traffic over 25% of which is
truck traffic shall be permitted to use low-to-minimum dimensions.
(See Table 2.)
§ 30-181 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 30-181
1:453
(15) The surface of any driveway subject to City site plan approval shall
be constructed with a permanent pavement of a type specified by
standards set by the City Engineer. Such pavement shall extend to
the paved traveled way or pave shoulder of the road; required
driveway dimensions specified in Table 2.

(16) Any vertical curve on a driveway shall be flat enough to prevent the
dragging of any vehicle undercarriage. Any driveway profiles and
grades shall be submitted to and approved by the City Engineer.
Should a sidewalk be so located with respect to the curb at a
depressed-curb driveway that is likely to cause undercarriage drag,
the sidewalk should be appropriately lowered to provide a suitable
ramp gradient.
C. Bikeways.
(1) Bikeways shall be required when in the Planning Board's opinion,
depending on the probable volume of bicycle traffic, the
development's location in relation to other populated areas, or its
location with respect to any overall bikeway route or trail adopted
by the Planning Board or other applicable agency, provision of the
bikeway(s) would be needed and used. Bicycle traffic shall be
separated from motor vehicle and pedestrian traffic as much as
possible.
(2) Bikeways shall generally not exceed a grade of 3%, except for short
distances, and they should be a minimum of five feet wide for oneway
and eight feet wide for two-way travel. Bikeways shall be
designed and constructed in accordance with the specifications and
standards of the City Engineer.
D. Sidewalks.
§ 30-181 MILLVILLE CODE § 30-181
1:454
(1) Sidewalks shall be required along all streets. In reviewing a
request for a waiver of this requirement, the Planning Board shall
be guided by the probable volume of pedestrian traffic, the street
classification in instances where streets are involved, school bus
stops, the development's location in relation to other populated
areas or pedestrian traffic generators, and the general type of
improvement intended. The Planning Board shall further only grant
waivers which are in accordance with the provisions of the Master
Plan.
(2) When required and unless reduced or altered by the Planning
Board, all sidewalks shall conform to the following standards:
(a) Sidewalks shall be at least four feet wide and located as
approved by the Planning Board. Sidewalks shall be at least
four inches thick, except at the point of vehicular crossing
where they shall be at least six inches thick, of Class C
concrete, having a twenty-eight-day compression strength of
4,000 psi, and shall be air-entrained.
(b) Finished sidewalks shall be true to specified lines, grades, and
curvatures. Completed work shall be adequately protected
from traffic and the elements.
E. Sight triangles.
(1) Sight triangles shall be required at each quadrant of an
intersection of streets, and streets and driveways. The area within
sight triangles shall be either dedicated as part of the street rightof-
way or maintained as part of the lot adjoining the street and set
aside on any subdivision or site plan as a sight triangle easement.
Within a sight triangle, no grading, planting or structure shall be
erected or maintained more than 30 inches above the street center
line or lower then eight feet above the street center line except for
street name signs and official traffic regulation signs. Where any
street or driveway intersection involves earth banks or vegetation,
including trees, the developer shall trim such vegetation and trees
as well as establish proper excavation and grading to provide the
sight triangle.
(2) The sight triangle is that area bounded by the intersection of street
lines and a straight line which connects "sight" points located on
each of two intersecting street lines the following distances away
from the intersection of street lines: arterial streets at 130 feet;
collector streets at 60 feet; and local streets at 35 feet. Where the
intersecting streets are both arterial, both collectors, or one
arterial and one collector, two overlapping sight triangles shall be
required formed by connecting the sight points noted above with a
sight point 35 feet on the intersecting street. Any proposed
development requiring site plan approval shall provide sight
triangle easements at each driveway with the driveway classified as
§ 30-181 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 30-181
1:455
a local street for purposes of establishing distances. The
classification of existing and proposed streets shall be those as
defined in the adopted Master Plan or as designated by the
Planning Board at the time of the application for approval of the
new street, not included in the Master Plan. Portions of a lot set
aside for the sight triangle may be calculated in determining the
lot area and may be included in establishing the minimum setback
required by the zoning provisions.
F. Streets.
(1) All development shall be served by improved streets with an allweather
base and pavement with an adequate crown. The
arrangement of streets now shown on the Master Plan or Official
Map shall be such as to provide for the appropriate extension of
existing streets, conform with the topography as far as practical,
and allow for continued extension into adjoining undeveloped
tracts.
(2) When a development adjoins land capable of being developed or
subdivided further, suitable provision shall be made for optimum
access from the adjoining tract to existing or proposed streets.
(3) Local streets shall be designed to discourage through traffic.
(4) To conserve energy and permit the greatest potential for buildings
to have a southern exposure, all new streets shall have an east/west
orientation whenever possible considering topographic features
and existing land use patterns.
(5) Development bounded by arterial or collector streets.
(a) In all residential districts, development bounded by an arterial
or collector street shall control access to streets by having all
driveways intersect minor streets. Where the size, shape,
location, or some other unique circumstance may dictate no
other alternative than to have a driveway enter an arterial or
collector street, the lot shall provide on-site turnaround
facilities so it is not necessary to back any vehicle onto an
arterial or collector road and abutting lots may be required to
use abutting driveways with one curb cut. All lots requiring
reverse frontage shall have an additional 25 feet of depth to
allow for the establishment of the buffers outlined below unless
such buffers are established in a reserve strip controlled by the
City or county.
(b) That portion of the development abutting an arterial or
collector street right-of-way shall either be planted with
nursery grown trees to a depth of not more than 25 feet as a
buffer strip along the right-of-way line and for the full length of
the development so that in a reasonable period of time a buffer
area will exist between the development and the highway, or,
§ 30-181 MILLVILLE CODE § 30-181
1:456
where topography permits, earthen berms may be created at a
sufficient height to establish a buffer between the development
and the highway. Berms shall not be less than five feet in
height; they shall be planted with evergreens and deciduous
trees according to a landscaping plan so as to be designed to
have no adverse effect on nearby properties. All trees shall be
of nursery stock having a caliper of not less than 2 1/2 inches
measured three feet above ground level and be of an approved
species as determined by the City Shade Tree Commission or
Planning Board. They shall be of symmetrical growth, free of
insect pests and disease, suitable for street use, and durable
under the maintenance contemplated.
(6) In all developments the minimum street right-of-way shall be
measured from lot line to lot line and shall be in accordance with
Diagrams 1 through 3, Typical Roadway Sections and Details,
which is part of this chapter; but in no case shall a new street that
is a continuation of an existing street be continued at a width less
than the existing street although a greater width may be required
in accordance with the diagram details above referenced. Where an
arterial or collector street intersects another arterial or collector
street, the right-of-way and cartway requirements shall be
increased by 10 feet on the right side of the street(s) approaching
intersection of the center lines.
(7) No development showing reserve strips controlling access to
streets or another area, either developed or undeveloped, shall be
approved except where the control and disposal of land comprising
such strips has been given to the City Commission under conditions
imposed by the Planning Board.
(8) In the event that a development adjoins or includes existing City
streets that do not conform to widths as shown on the City Master
Plan or Official Map or the street width requirements of this
chapter, additional land along both sides of the street sufficient to
conform to the right-of-way requirements shall be anticipated in
the subdivision design of creating over-sized lots to accommodate
the widening at some future date. The additional widening may be
offered to the City for the location, installation, repair and
maintenance of streets, drainage facilities, utilities and other
facilities customarily located on street right-of-way and shall be
expressed on the plat or plan as follows: "Street right-of-way
easement granted to the City of Millville permitting the City to
enter upon these lands for the purposes provided for and expressed
in the Development Regulations Chapter of the City of Millville."
This statement on an approved plat or plan shall in no way reduce
the developer's responsibility to provide, install, repair or maintain
any facilities installed in this area dedicated by ordinance or as
shown on the plat or plan, or as provided for by any maintenance or
§ 30-181 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 30-181
1:457
performance guaranty. If a development is along one side only, 1/2
of the required extra width shall be anticipated.
(9) The actual design and construction of all streets or roads within the
City shall be subject to review and approval by the City Engineer in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter, any adopted Master
Plan or Official Map and any other applicable ordinances of the City
of Millville or acceptable engineering standards.
(10) Where dead-end (cul-de-sac) streets are utilized, they shall
conform to the following standards:
(a) Dead-end streets of a permanent nature (where provisions for
future extension of the street to the boundary of the adjoining
property is impractical or impossible) or of a temporary nature
(where provision is made for the future extension of the street
to the boundary line of adjoining property) shall provide a
turnaround at the end with a right-of-way radius sufficient to
permit the maneuvering and turning of emergency vehicles
including fire trucks.
(b) If a dead-end street is of temporary nature, provisions shall be
made for removal of the turnaround and reversion of excess
right-of-way to the adjoining properties as off-tract
responsibility of the developer creating the street extension
when the street is extended.
(c) A dead-end street shall serve no more than 14 lots.
(11)No street shall have a name which will duplicate or so nearly
duplicate in spelling or phonetic sound the names of existing
streets so as to be confusing therewith. The continuation of an
existing street shall have the same name. The names of new streets
must be approved by the Planning Board. This subsection shall
apply to any street within the City of Millville or surrounding
municipalities.
(12) Streets shall be constructed in accordance with the standards as
shown on Diagrams 1 through 3, Typical Roadway Sections and
Details, which are a part of this chapter and the standards
contained in this section.
(13) Longitudinal grades on all local streets shall not exceed 10%, nor
4% on arterial or collector streets. No street shall have a
longitudinal grade of less than 1/2 of 1%. Maximum grades within
intersections shall be 4% percent. The cross section of the cartway
from the center line to the curbline or edge of the paving shall be
parabolic and shall not exceed a slope of 2%. Where the cartway on
a collector or arterial street is banked to facilitate a curve in the
street alignment, the slope toward the curbline or shoulder shall
conform to accepted engineering practice.
§ 30-181 MILLVILLE CODE § 30-181
1:458
(14) Local streets should not be part of a four-way intersection.
Intersecting street center lines shall be as nearly at right angles as
possible, and in no case shall they be less than 75º at the point of
the intersection. The curblines shall be parallel to the center line.
Approaches to all intersections shall follow a straight line for at
least 100 feet measured from the curbline of the intersecting street
to the beginning of the curve. No more than two street center lines
shall meet or intersect another point. Collector and arterial streets
intersecting another street from opposite sides shall not be offset
unless, measuring from the point of intersection of the street
center line, the two intersections shall be spaced a sufficient
distance to permit a minimum two lot depths between two street
rights-of-way, but not less than 250 feet between rights-of-way. Any
development abutting an existing street which is classified as an
arterial or collector street shall be permitted not more than one
new street every 800 feet on the same side of the street within the
boundaries of the tract being subdivided. In the spacing of streets,
consideration will be given to the location of existing intersections
on both sides of the development. Intersections shall be rounded on
the curbline, with the street having the highest radius requirement
as outlined below determining the minimum standard for all street
lines:
(a) Arterial street at 40 feet.
(b) Collector street at 30 feet.
(c) Local street at 20 feet.
(15) The right-of-way for internal roads and alleys in commercial and
industrial development shall be determined on an individual basis
by the Planning Board and shall in all cases be sufficient in width
and design to safely accommodate parking and loading needs of
adjoining uses.
(16) A tangent at least 200 feet long shall be introduced between
reverse curves on arterial and collector streets. When connecting
street lines deflect in any direction they shall be connected by a
curve with a radius conforming to standard engineering practice so
that the minimum sight distance within the curbline shall be 160
feet for a local street, 300 feet for a collector street, and 500 feet
for an arterial street.
(17) All changes in grade where the difference in grade is 1% or greater
shall be connected by a vertical curve having a length of at least 50
feet for each 2% difference in grade, or portion thereof, and
providing minimum sight distances of 160 feet for a local street,
300 feet for a collector street and 500 feet for an arterial street.
Intersections shall be designed with as flat a grade as practical
with the advice of the City Engineer.
§ 30-181 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 30-181
1:459
§ 30-182. Traffic and directional signs.
Each development requiring off-street loading or parking areas, or where
roadways are not dedicated and accepted by the City, shall install and
maintain all appropriate traffic and directional signs, markers or pavement
markings as approved by the appropriate approval authority. In the case of
parking and loading facilities, parking stalls and loading areas, traffic flow
directions and areas where is for limited period of time or prohibited shall
be clearly marked. In the case of developments where access is provided by
driveways or streets not dedicated and accepted by the City, county or state,
all traffic signs, directional signs and similar markings shall be installed
and maintained in accordance with the requirements of the appropriate
approval authority.
§ 30-183. Utilities.
New utility distribution lines and telephone or other communication facility
lines to locations not presently served by such utilities shall be placed
underground, except in those cases where the Planning Board finds that
such placement underground would be detrimental to existing land uses
such as, but not limited to, active agricultural operations.
(18) In the case of local streets within a development where the City
Commission determines that the length of the street and the nature
of adjacent uses warrant such reduction in the width of the paved
surface, the width required in Subsection F(6) of this section may
be reduced, but in no case shall the paved width of a local street be
less than 26 feet.
(19) Street signs shall be installed by the developer in a manner and of a
material and design to be approved by the Planning Board as
recommended by the City Engineer. All such signs shall be installed
so as not to create any visual obstruction and to be free of visual
obstruction.
(20) The developer of any subdivision or development shall provide for
the installation of the underground service for all poles and fixtures
for streetlighting. Streetlighting standards of a type and number
approved by the Planning Board and the City Engineer shall be
installed by all street intersections and elsewhere as deemed
necessary by the Planning Board.
(21) Whenever a development abuts or crosses municipal boundaries,
access to those lots within the City shall be from within the City as
the general rule. Wherever access to a development is required
across land in an adjoining municipality as the exception, the
Planning Board may require documentation that such access is
legally established, and that the access road is adequately
improved.
§ 30-181 MILLVILLE CODE § 30-184
1:460
§ 30-184. Vegetation.
No development, site clearing or demolition activity shall be carried out
unless it is designed to avoid irreversible adverse impacts on the survival of
existing vegetation. The removal of vegetation shall be permitted when such
removal is necessary to accommodate the development or maintenance
of a permitted structure or to otherwise conduct a permitted use of the
property; to eliminate a pedestrian or vehicular safety hazard to a structure;
specimen trees will not be cleared or removed; and the area cleared shall
be landscaped in accordance with § 30-165 of this article.
§ 30-185. Visual obstruction.
In any district, nothing shall be erected, placed, or allowed to grow in such
a manner as to materially impede vision between a height of 2 1/2 feet and
10 feet above the center line grade of an abutting street or streets within 30
feet of an intersection of street lines involving a state or county road, within
20 feet of an intersection of street lines involving two municipal streets or
within 15 feet of an intersection involving boundary lines of a driveway and
a street.
§ 30-186. Water supply.
A. Where water is accessible from a servicing utility, the developer shall
arrange for the construction of water mains in such a manner as to
make adequate water service available to each lot, dwelling unit or use
within the development. The entire system shall be designed in
accordance with the requirements and standards of the City, county
and/or state agency having approval authority and shall be subject to its
approval. The system shall also be designed with adequate capacity and
sustained pressure for present and probable future development.
Minimum City specifications shall be as follows:
(1) Water supply facilities and systems shall be provided and installed
in accordance with the specifications of this section and as required
by the City Engineer. Water supply facilities and systems shall be
designed and installed for either immediate or future connection
with a public or on-site community water supply facility or system
approved by the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection and the City Commission of the City of Millville. In areas
where public water supply does not exist or is not expected to be
provided within a reasonable period of time in the opinion of the
Planning Board, the Board may waive the requirement that water
supply facilities be installed to connect with public water supply
facilities or systems.
(2) In those cases where the public water supply facility or system is
not presently available and the site of the proposed development is
unsuitable and unsafe in terms of public health for individual onsite
water supply facilities as determined by the New Jersey
Department of Environmental Protection or Health, or other
§ 30-184 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 30-186
1:461
appropriate local agency, an on-site community water supply
system approved by the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection and the City Commission of the City of Millville shall be
installed. On-site water supply system shall be provided in addition
to the required installation of water supply facilities for those
areas expected to be provided with public water supply facilities or
systems within a reasonable period of time.
(3) All water supply and treatment facilities shall comply with the rules
and regulations established by the New Jersey Department of
Health, as amended and supplemented. Water mains shall be sized
for adequate delivery of pressure and volume. In general, the size
of water mains shall conform to the following: Lines whose primary
function is and will be to serve adjacent property shall be six
inches, and lines that serve as feeder lines to several other streets
in addition to the one in which they are located shall be eight
inches and shall be laid out to provide loops with other lines eight
inches or larger which enclose areas of not more than 1/4 square
mile. Lines that provide the main feed from present or larger lines
shall be laid out so as to form loops with other similar lines which
enclose not more than one square mile. The system shall be
designed so that not more than one hydrant is affected by shutting
off any one section, so that hydrants are located within 600 feet
along street lines of any property development, so that not more
than four valves are necessary to shut off any one section and so
that the number of dwelling units affected by shutting off any one
section shall be limited to approximately 25.
(4) Cast-iron pipe and fittings shall conform to applicable
requirements of the American Standards Association's
specifications, as amended. Cast-iron pipe shall be thickness Class
22, and flanges shall be Class 125. Mechanical joints conforming to
the American Standards Association (ASA) Specifications A-21.11,
as amended, or gasket-type joints of Tyton or approved equal, shall
be used. Other fittings shall conform to the requirements of the
American Standards Association Specifications A-21.10, as
amended, and all cast-iron pipe or fittings shall be cement-lined in
accordance with ASA A-21.4, as amended. Valves shall conform to
the current American Waterworks Association standard for ironbody-
disk gate valves with parallel seats. Unless otherwise
specified by the City Engineer, valves shall be operated by a twoinch-
square operating nut of cast-iron and shall open in a
counterclockwise direction. The direction of opening shall be
marked by an arrow and the word, "open." All cast-iron surfaces of
valves and valve boxes shall be complete with covers, and both
valve box and cover shall be of ample strength and dimension to
fully sustain the shocks of vehicular traffic and to maintain the
upper section and cover to proper grade under heavy traffic
conditions. Fire hydrants shall be as required by City
specifications. Operating cap nuts shall be one-and-one-half-inch
§ 30-186 MILLVILLE CODE § 30-186
1:462
pentagons. They shall be equipped with two hose nozzles and one
steamer nozzle, size and treads to be in accordance with local fire
company requirements. They shall have a provision for a six-inch
connection to the main. Valve opening for the hydrant shall be four
inches. Valves shall be installed between all fire hydrants and the
supply main.
(5) Excavations and backfill shall conform to the requirements for
subsurface structure excavations. Requirements relating to
protection of the work from cave-ins and accumulation of water
shall be as specified under § 30-179, Stormwater management.
(6) Water mains shall be laid in straight lines except when otherwise
specifically directed by the City Engineer. When deviation from a
straight line is permitted, the deflection of each joint shall not
exceed the manufacturer's recommended maximum for the type of
joint and size of pipe being installed. Water pipes shall be laid with
at least 3 1/2 feet of cover over the top of the pipe to the existing or
proposed finished grade or to the future finished grade when such
is lower. Special care shall be exercised to removal all earth, stones
and other materials from each pipe as it is laid and to prevent any
such materials from entering the pipelines. The contractor is
responsible for the lines being maintained in an absolutely clean
condition on the inside and for seeing that all valves and hydrants
are clean and in good working order when installed. Open pipe
ends shall at all times be adequately protected and shall be
securely sealed with dirt-proof plugs whenever work is stopped for
any reason. After removing a plug, the interior of the pipeline shall
be inspected before resuming pipe laying operations.
(7) All fittings and valves shall be set accurately, true to and square
with pipelines. Valve stems shall be accurately plumbed. Fittings
and valves shall be supported by approved blocking so as to ensure
their remaining accurately in position during jointly and in such a
manner that their weight will not place undue strain on connection
pipe or joints. Pipelines shall be thrust-blocked at all bends greater
than 10º and at all T's, plugs, valves and hydrants so as to prevent
movement of the lines under pressure.
(8) Before new waterlines are put into service, the contractor shall
provide necessary equipment for and shall perform a two-hour
pressure test, during which time pressure will be maintained at 125
pounds per square inch, and the amount of water that must be
added to maintain this pressure will be measured. The maximum
leakage which will be permitted for sections of the system up to
and including 500 linear feet will be 0.01 gallon per inch of
diameter per 24 hours per foot of pipe. Where the length of pipe to
be tested exceeds 500 lineal feet, the total amount of leakage
allowed for any such section of pipe shall be the amount which
would be allowed for 500 feet. In general, every section of pipe
which can be isolated by existing or proposed valves shall be
§ 30-186 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 30-186
1:463
§ 30-187. Waivers or adjustments.
§ 30-188. Inspection and approval.
All improvements to be installed as set forth in this article, when required
of a developer, shall be subject to inspection by the approval authority
engineer or the City Engineer, who shall be notified by the developer at least
seven days prior to the start of construction. No underground installation
shall be covered until inspected and approved by the appropriate engineer.
individually pressure-tested except where such sections are less
than 200 feet in length, in which case they may be tested as part of
another section.
(9) Before a new waterline is put into service or when any section of a
pipeline is drained or emptied of water at any time, it shall be
completely sterilized with chlorine according to the directions of
the City Engineer.
B. Where public water is not available, potable water supply shall be
provided to each lot on an individual well basis. Such wells shall be
designed in accordance with the requirements and standards of the
City and/or state agency having jurisdiction thereof.
A. Where, due to natural features or special conditions, a literal
enforcement or the provisions of this article will result in unnecessary
hardship or be detrimental to the stated goals and objectives of the
City's development policy as expressed in the adopted City Master Plan,
the Planning Board may, by resolution, grant such waiver from or
adjustment to the requirements thereof as will not be contrary to the
public interest and will not subvert the objectives of the City Master
Plan and this chapter. Financial hardship or disadvantage shall not be
sufficient cause or proof of hardship.
B. All requests for waivers or adjustments to the design standards
contained herein shall be submitted in writing to the approval authority
and shall clearly set forth the reason why literal enforcement would
cause hardship or be contrary to stated planning objectives or goals.
C. In reviewing such requests, the approving authority shall give
consideration to the development size, anticipated or recognizable
adverse impacts to be created or increased by it, natural and existing
conditions at the development or adjacent thereto, the purpose or
reason of the development, and reasonable feasibility of design
standards to the development proposed.

A. Purpose. The continued vitality of the City's Central Business District
and the Glasstown Arts District is dependent upon its uniqueness and
specialty market niche as well as the distinctive architecture and
historic significance of buildings. Preservation of the existing character
and scale of the City's downtown is important to maintain the
distinctive small town charm and character valued by residents and
visitors. The preservation of the existing character and scale of the
City's downtown is also vital to the continuation of the downtown's
attractiveness to visitors and tourism. Development of retail and
commercial establishments that conflict with the character of the City's
historic buildings and arts district and that are out of scale in relation to
the current pattern of development creates a threat to the public
health, safety, general welfare and aesthetics by threatening the
continued economic vitality of the district and the historic relevance of
the buildings.
B. Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms shall have the
following meanings unless the context clearly indicates that a different

ARTICLE XIX
Planned Unit Development
§ 30-221. Purpose.
Article VI of the Municipal Land Use Law authorizes municipalities to
adopt an ordinance providing for planned developments in the form of
planned unit developments. This form of planned development encourages
and promotes flexibility and economy in layout and design while preserving
substantial open space, including agricultural lands and environmentally
sensitive lands. The general purposes of planned unit development are as
follows:
§ 30-222. Applicability. [Amended 7-7-2009 by Ord. No. 21-2009]
Planned unit development shall be permitted in various forms in accordance
with the provisions of this article. This form of planned development is
authorized as a permitted use in the following zoning districts:
A. To encourage the assemblage of tracts of land into development units
which can be planned overall for long-term development;
B. To promote flexibility in layout and design through clustering, thereby
waiving strict adherence to individual lot and area zoning
requirements;
C. To require that any common open space resulting from the application
of standards for the intensity of land use be set aside for the benefit and
use of the owners and residents in the development;
D. To encourage the protection of the natural resources on the land and to
provide more usable open space for active and passive recreational
uses;
E. To ensure that the amount, location and purpose of the common open
space is adequate and that the proposed conservation and maintenance
of it is reliable;
F. To promote economy in the layout and design of lots and structures to
reduce site preparation costs and thereby reduce product costs to the
consumer;
G. To require the developer to adequately design the circulation system,
public services system, and the amenities of air, light, recreation and
visual enjoyment for the residents of the entire development;
H. To encourage development of affordable housing for low- and moderateincome
households through the provision of inclusionary housing set
asides; and
I. To provide for a flexible approval process which allows for revisions
that are responsive to changes in the marketplace without rezoning the
property.

§ 30-223. General criteria for eligibility.
One of the prime objectives of a planned unit development of land is the
availability and quality of open space made possible by deviation from
usual zoning requirements. The following general criteria shall govern the
eligibility of an application for development for this type of planned
development:
A. A minimum land area shall be met for the form of planned unit
development authorized within the specific zoning district in
accordance with the following sections of this article.
B. One person or one legal entity shall own or control by deed, contract,
option or other legal instrument the land area at the time that the
application is filed for a planned unit development.
C. (Reserved)65
D. Municipal sewage shall be available to the project site at the time that
the application is filed or planned to be online at the time of project
occupancy.
E. Municipal water shall be available to the project site at the time that the
application is filed or planned to be online at the time of project
occupancy.
F. Planned unit developments shall comply with all impact evaluation
requirements applicable to conventional developments contained in
this chapter.
G. Except as otherwise provided in this article, planned unit developments
shall comply with the design and performance standards applicable to
conventional developments contained in this chapter.
H. Planned unit developments may be built in stages, provided the
applicant can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Planning Board the
following:
(1) The plans submitted for preliminary approval shall delineate each
phase and include an expected construction schedule.
65.Editor's Note: Former Subsection C, which made certain noncontiguous parcels of land
owned by a single owner eligible for a planned unit development, was repealed 8-3-2010
by Ord. No. 14-2010.

§ 30-224. General design standards.
The general development plan shall set forth the permitted number of
dwelling units, the amount of nonresidential floor space, the residential
density and the nonresidential floor area ratio for the planned development,
in its entirety, according to a schedule which sets forth the timing of the
various sections of the development. The general development plan and the
site plan shall conform to the following general design standards:
(2) The planned unit development may provide for a greater or lesser
concentration of density within a section than the overall project
density, provided that it is offset by a lesser or greater density in
subsequent stages.
(3) Each stage of development shall be substantially self-functioning
and self-sustaining with regard to traffic circulation and access,
utility services, off-street parking and loading and open space.
(4) Each stage shall be properly related to every other stage of
development and the neighborhood and community as a whole and
to all necessary community services needed in the future to
accommodate the proposed development.
I. All planned unit developments of 200 dwelling units or greater are
responsible for obtaining water allocation for the project from the New
Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. Such water allocation
must include the addition of source of supply capacity, such as the
addition of one or more new wells, such that it increases the City's firm
source capacity by three times the average daily flow of the entire
project as determined by the Residential Site Improvement Standards,
N.J.A.C. 5:21-5 et seq. and the New Jersey Department of
Environmental Protection Safe Drinking Water Act Regulations, N.J.A.C.
7:10-12 et seq. The applicant also shall obtain an increased monthly
allocation of 1.5 times the average monthly flow for the entire project
and an increased annual flow equal to the average annual flow
projected for the entire project. The City must be the applicant for any
modification in its water allocation permit. The developer for the
project, however, is financially responsible for all aspects of obtaining
additional water allocation, including all application fees and
engineering costs. [Added 3-7-2006 by Ord. No. 8-2006]

(1) Bulk standards. Area yard and lot coverage standards shall be as
required under the planned village development section of the
Schedule of District Limitations. An applicant may propose an
alternate set of area, yard and lot coverage standards pursuant to
N.J.S.A. 40:55D-45a as part of a general development plan
application that may be approved by the board of jurisdiction,
provided that the density and use standards conform to the
requirements of this section.
(2) Density and floor area ratio.
(a) Residential development shall not exceed 0.50 units per gross
acre of contiguous or noncontiguous land within the City of
Millville, except as permitted below. Assisted living facilities,
comprehensive personal care homes, community residences
for the developmentally disabled, community shelters for
victims of domestic violence, community residences for the
terminally ill, community residences for persons with head
injuries and congregate care housing shall be exempted from
the calculation of the number of permitted housing units based
on gross density, provided such uses are located within the
land area devoted to nonresidential or mixed nonresidential
and residential buildings and shall not exceed more than 10%
of the total number of units allowed under the gross density
calculation plus any bonus density.
(b) Bonus density. Additional density may be added to the
underlying base density of the PVD, as provided for in
Subsection D(2)(a) above, but in no event shall exceed two
dwelling units per gross acre of land, by utilizing any of the
following provisions:
[1] Age-restricted. The number of age-restricted dwellings
shall be a minimum of 35% of the total number of dwelling
units. Additional density may be obtained by providing a

Board of Education for its intended purpose.
(3) Open space and civic uses.
(a) (Reserved)
(b) The common open space shall include a community center with
a minimum interior space of 10 square feet per dwelling unit
located within the development. The center shall include a
swimming pool, tennis courts or similar recreational uses
sufficient to satisfy the active recreational needs of the
residential community.
(c) The active and passive recreational needs of the residents shall
be met through the community center and a network of small
parks or nature trails designed for bicycle and pedestrian
travel.
(d) An application for development may include any vacant parcel
of land toward the calculation of the required open space,
provided the land is contiguous with the subject parcel and is
located within the City of Millville. [Amended 10-17-2006 by
Ord. No. 33-2006]
(e) The disposition of land for open space and agricultural use
shall be as required under Subsection F and any other
applicable open space standards.
E. Design standards.
(1) The overall goal of the design for a planned village development is
to have substantial variation in the design of single-family detached
residential dwelling units, while maintaining uniform setbacks
along the building line for each block. The development should
have variation in the exteriors' design and materials, interior basic
dimensions of the floor plans, height, design, and appearance of the
roofs, and size, location and types of windows.
(2) As part of the overall planned unit development review process, the
applicant shall submit a narrative and design guidebook illustrating
the types and variation of architectural design that will be utilized
for both the residential and nonresidential buildings in the project.
A pattern book shall be part of this submission that would illustrate
variety in the type of dwelling units to be constructed. This
submission may be subsequent to a general development plan
approval but precedent to a grant of preliminary subdivision or site
plan approval.
(3) An architectural review board shall be established as part of the
master deed of the planned village development and shall apply to
the entire project as a whole. The architectural review board shall
§ 30-228 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 30-228
1:537
be established no later than the issuance of a certificate of
occupancy for a residential dwelling that represents 75% of the
total number of approved residential units. The architectural
review board shall constitute no less than five members or more
than nine members and shall be an odd number. The master deed
shall establish bylaws for the term, membership, procedures and
actions of the board. Such master deed shall be reviewed and
approved as to form by the City Attorney prior to filing with the
New Jersey Department of Community Affairs. The architectural
review board shall utilize the pattern book in Subsection E(2) above
in its review of additions and alterations of residential buildings,
except the board shall not review assisted living, congregate care,
and similar facilities.
F. Site planning principles.
(1) Facades shall be parallel to the street lines and exterior building
walls shall typically be either parallel or at right angles to each
other. A lot with multiple buildings should be organized around a
feature such as a courtyard, green, or quadrangle that encourages
pedestrian activity and incidental social interaction among users.
Buildings shall be located to allow for adequate fire and emergency
access.
(2) Civic, institutional, and commercial buildings shall be located to
front toward and relate to public streets, both functionally and
visually. Buildings shall not be oriented to front toward a parking
lot. Buildings shall be oriented to address the geometry of the
abutting street pattern and shall acknowledge prominent design
features in the regular street pattern (i.e., circles, crescents, etc.).
(3) Nonresidential buildings on corner lots shall be considered
significant structures, since they have at least two facades visibly
exposed to the street. Such buildings should be designed with
architectural features to emphasize their location.
(4) Nonresidential buildings located at entrances from collector and
arterial roads into and out of neighborhoods and village parks shall
mark the transition in a distinctive fashion using massing,
additional height, contrasting materials, and/or architectural
detailing to obtain this effect.
(5) Each market-rate dwelling unit shall have a garage. Dwelling units
intended for low- and moderate-income occupancy are exempt from
this requirement but shall have adequate off-street parking.
Garages may be either attached or detached from the principal
dwelling unit. In either case, the garage shall be aligned either
parallel with or perpendicular to the alignment of the principal
building. The architectural design of the garage, including the
proportions, roof pitch, exterior materials, doors, color, etc. shall be
coordinated and compatible with that of the dwelling unit.
§ 30-228 MILLVILLE CODE § 30-228
1:538
(6) Lots and structures shall be laid out to the greatest extent feasible
in such a manner that the common boundary between the
residential lots and any preserved farmland shall be minimized in
length to reduce potential conflicts.
(7) A buffer zone of at least 75 feet in width shall be required between
residential and agricultural uses and shall be thickly planted with
fast growing native shrubs and trees to create an effective barrier
separating residential uses from fields and pastures.
G. Performance standards.
(1) The land proposed to be set aside for common open space may be
dedicated by the developer to the City for public use. The City
reserves the right to accept or reject the proposed dedication.
(2) If the common open space is not dedicated to the City and accepted
by the City, the developer shall provide for an organization to own
and maintain the common open space for the benefit of the
residents of the development. These lands shall be owned by one of
the following legal entities: owned jointly or in common by the
owners of the building lots or owned by a land conservation trust.
The agreement of the management organization shall guarantee
continued ownership and maintenance of all of the common open
space.
(3) All lands preserved as farm land shall be subject to a permanent
deed restriction or conservation easement. The preserved farm
land shall be mowed or plowed at least once annually.
(4) As part of the agreement of the management organization,
residents shall be informed of the private right to farm covenants
established in the agreement, and the residents shall acknowledge
that they live in a predominantly agricultural district which
includes customary farming practices such as the use of farm
equipment and machinery, the application of chemicals, fertilizers,
insecticides, manures and other organic and inorganic farm
materials on the land. The covenants contained in the agreement
shall specify the hours of farm operation and climactic conditions
for limiting the practice of cultivation and the application of
chemicals, fertilizers, insecticides and manures.
(5) The applicant shall provide copies of the articles of incorporation,
bylaws, deeds with covenants, deeds with easements, deeds of
trust and the management agreement which provides for the
ownership and maintenance of the common open space.
H. Required condition of approval. The use of credits transferred shall only
be upon the approval of a preliminary site plan or subdivision that
includes lands within both the Agricultural Conservation District and a
village node.

required lot frontage.
(2) Density. The permitted number of dwelling units within the planned
lakeshore community optional standards shall be determined as
follows:
(a) Base density. Development shall be permitted at a density of
1.6 dwellings to the base acre. Gross tract acreage shall first
be determined by a boundary survey indicating the total
acreage of the tract. From this figure, existing rights-of-way
and easements to be retained and riparian waters and state
open waters (excluding intermittent or permanent streams)
shall be subtracted. The resulting sum shall then be multiplied
by the minimum open space percentage of 40% to determine
the base acreage. The permitted number of dwellings shall be
equal to 1.6 times the base acreage, rounded.
(b) Bonus densities. Additional density may be added to the
underlying base density of the planned lakeshore community
development, as provided for in Subsection D(2)(a) above, but
in no event shall it exceed an additional 0.65 dwelling unit per

single-family homes (A, B, C, D) throughout the development. Each
type of single-family home (A, B, C, D) must be part of the overall
project layout. The location of each type of housing shall be in
conformance with § 30-229F(3).
(2) The development is encouraged to be designed with a road network
with multiple points of ingress and egress so that traffic generated
by the project will be evenly disbursed and will not negatively
impact the surrounding neighborhoods or existing levels of service
for neighborhood roadways. The development must be designed
with an integrated street network system that functions at an
acceptable level of service without connecting to the existing
roadways servicing the adjacent neighborhoods.

(1) Where the proposed development is to occur on infill sites
surrounded partially or completely by preexisting residential
developments, lots and structures shall be laid out to the greatest
extent feasible to be compatible with the surrounding
neighborhood community with regard to architectural design,
disposition and orientation of buildings and the visual integrity of
the natural landscape.
(2) Lots and structures shall be adequately buffered from the
surrounding preexisting residential developments to create an
effective barrier separating the proposed development from the
preexisting residential developments.
F. Performance standards.
(1) The land proposed to be set aside for common open space may be
dedicated by the developer to the City for public use. The City
reserves the right to accept or reject the proposed dedication.
(2) If the common open space is not dedicated to the City and accepted
by the City, the developer shall provide for an organization to own
and maintain the common open space for the benefit of the
residents of the development. These lands shall be owned by one of
the following legal entities: owned jointly or in common by the
owners of the building lots or owned by a land conservation trust.
The agreement of the management organization shall guarantee
continued ownership and maintenance of all of the common open
space.
(3) The applicant shall provide copies of the articles of incorporation,
bylaws, deeds with covenants, deeds with easements, deeds of
trust and the management agreement which provides for the
ownership and maintenance of the common open space.
A. Purpose. A planned riverfront mixed-use development is authorized as
the sole option for development or redevelopment within the Riverfront
Mixed-Use District. The purpose of a planned riverfront mixed-use
development is to provide for a diverse mix of compatible land uses and
density which are consistent with a high quality of development
anticipated by the Master Plan and the Maurice River Development
Plan for the Riverfront Mixed-Use District.
B. Eligibility criteria.
(1) There is no minimum acreage requirement for a project in the
Riverfront Mixed-Use District;
(2) An application for development shall demonstrate that the project
can be served by the municipal wastewater collection and
§ 30-230 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 30-231
1:549
treatment system and the municipal water system and comply with
all stormwater management regulations; and
(3) All applications must comply with general planned development
eligibility criteria set forth in § 30-223 of this chapter.
C. Bulk, coverage and density standards.
(1) Bulk standards. In order to provide full flexibility in the design and
layout of lots and structures and to ensure a compatible
relationship among all land uses, structures and components of the
Maurice River Development Plan, an application for development
shall not be required to meet specific minimum lot size, lot depth or
yard dimensions within the Riverfront Mixed-Use District.
(2) Density.
(a) Base density. Residential density shall be permitted at a base
density of the following dwelling units per gross acre of land
for each individual subarea contained within the zoning
district. For purposes of these regulations, density is
determined by taking the total acreage of a tract of land based
upon a boundary survey and from this figure subtracting
existing rights-of-way and easements to be retained and
riparian waters. The resulting sum shall be the base acreage
and the base density per acre shall be applied to this sum. Base
densities for each subarea are as follows:
[1] Millyard Mixed-Use District: 10 units/acre;
[2] Overlook Arts and Entertainment District: 12 units/acre;
[3] Transit District: 10 units/acre;
[4] Civic and Recreation District: 10 units/acre; and
[5] Glassworks Transit and Marina District: 10 units/acre.
(b) Density bonuses. Additional density may be added to the
underlying base density of the planned development for each
subarea, as provided for in Subsection C(2)(a) above, but in no
event shall density exceed a maximum as indicated below:
[1] Millyard Mixed-Use District: 12 units/acre;
[2] Overlook Arts and Entertainment District: 15 units/acre;
[3] Transit District: 12 units/acre;
[4] Civic and Recreation District: 12 units/acre; and
[5] Glassworks Transit and Marina District: 12 units/acre.
(c) Density bonus menu. The following site amenities, linkages and
priorities shall be considered in negotiating with a developer
§ 30-231 MILLVILLE CODE § 30-231
1:550
for density bonuses as part of the adopted Municipal
Development Agreement:
[1] Establishing a program of public art in the downtown or
within the surrounding neighborhoods;
[2] Provision of a public parking structure or other plan for
public parking;
[3] Open space/recreation facilities beyond the required
thirty-foot waterfront easement for continuation of public
access and trail system;
[4] Artist live/work space within the development or as a
secondary project in a downtown neighborhood;
[5] A downtown cultural or historic preservation component,
which could include the restoration or financing of key
historic properties or the assimilation of other new or
existing cultural facilities into the downtown area;
[6] A community benefit provision as part of the Municipal
Development Agreement dedicating a portion of all new
employment and training opportunities to the residents of
the surrounding neighborhoods;
[7] Use of LEED-certified green building techniques and/or
the use of recycled or renewable materials; and
[8] An innovative program or plan for creative linkages
between the project and the downtown and surrounding
neighborhoods so the new development does not function
as a self-contained community.
(3) Open space.
(a) All common open space shall be designed in a manner so that it
is compatible with the existing design and landscaping theme
established along the waterfront by the existing public
improvements to ensure a uniform appearance in character
and quality;
(b) All projects with frontage along the water shall designate and
permanently preserve a right of way 30 feet wide for the
purposes of creating a public walkway;
(c) The development shall comply with the open space standards
set forth in § 30-210C;
(d) The location of all common open space shall be planned as
much as possible as a contiguous area located for the
maximum benefit of the residents, preserving and, where
possible, enhancing natural features;
§ 30-231 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 30-231
1:551
(e) Wetlands and floodplains and steep slopes may compose up to
a maximum of 30% of the required open space; and
(f) Conservation of natural topographical and geological features,
preventing soil erosion and surface and groundwater
contamination, and preserving significant environmental
features and significant habitat are all priorities to be
addressed by the open space plan.
D. Design standards. The Planning Board shall consider the following
design principles:
(1) Lots and structures shall be laid out to the greatest extent feasible
to allow for the effective use of stormwater management practices
that will reduce the amount of pollutants discharged into the
Maurice River.
(2) Lots and structures shall be laid out to the greatest extent feasible
to minimize the loss of scenic viewsheds to the Maurice River.
(3) Infill residential development shall, to the greatest extent feasible,
comply with the standards for traditional neighborhood
development as set forth in this chapter. Architecture and building
materials must be consistent with the design of the development
and compatible with the adjacent neighborhood. The style and form
should relate to the historic setting and the unique qualities of the
City's waterfront location.
(4) Streets, utilities, parks, public buildings and drainage features
must be designed to have adequate capacity to serve the proposed
development.
(5) The architecture in the Planned Riverfront Mixed-Use District
should strike a balance between creativity and innovation on the
one hand, while avoiding obtrusive, incongruous structures on the
other. Architectural styles that do not build upon and promote the
existing character of the City are strongly discouraged.
(6) Planned development architecture should demonstrate the
cohesive planning of the development and present a clearly
identifiable design feature throughout the project. Buildings should
not be totally uniform in appearance. Rather, cohesion and identity
can be demonstrated in similar building scale or mass; consistent
use of facade materials; similar ground-level detailing, color or
signage; consistency in functional systems, such as roadway or
pedestrian way surfaces, signage or landscaping; the framing of
outdoor open space and linkages or a clear conveyance in the
importance of various buildings and features on the site. The
project shall be integrated into other projects and planned systems
such as pedestrian ways, landscaping patterns, lighting concepts
and traffic movements.
§ 30-231 MILLVILLE CODE § 30-231
1:552
(7) A single, dominant building mass shall be avoided. Where large
structures are required, mass should be broken up through the use
of setbacks, projecting and recessed elements, and similar design
techniques. Monotony of design in single- or multiple-building
projects shall be avoided by varying detail, material and form.
(8) Treatment of river edges should be visually appealing from the
river vantage point as well as from the shore. Maintaining the
existing natural character and contours of grade of the existing
river bank is encouraged.
(9) Each housing component of a mixed-use project shall contain at
least three different types of housing.
(10) An interconnected street system is required for new development
to promote orderly and safe development. Streets should be
interdependent and connected to existing transportation routes,
providing continuous and comprehensive traffic circulation.
(11) Pedestrian circulation shall be provided through internal and
external walkways. Pedestrian movement within the planned
development shall be facilitated by the safe, efficient and
harmonious groupings of structures, uses and facilities with open
spaces with minimal conflicts with vehicular traffic. The pedestrian
network shall provide pathways between and among the
development components and should encourage trips on foot from
the downtown to the waterfront area. The pedestrian systems
should use appropriate lighting, landspacing, graphics, street
furniture and concrete and brick paving systems in compliance
with the existing design within the Central Business District.
(12) Pedestrian lighting should be incorporated into the design of
parking areas and along pedestrian walkways. Lighting for parking
and vehicle queuing areas should provide adequate illumination for
vehicle and pedestrian safety and security while shielding
surrounding areas from excessive light trespass and glare. All light
shall be directed downward. A designated family of fixtures shall be
used along public roadways, site driveways, public sidewalks and
bikeways and parking lots in order to reinforce a unified image.
(13) Shared access driveways and parking areas should be encouraged
wherever possible for mixed use developments and/or adjacent
uses which have different hours, days and/or seasons of peak
parking demand.
(14) Parking areas shall include provisions for the parking of bicycles in
locations that are safely segregated from automobile traffic and
parking.
(15) The design of parking lots should include access and parking lot
entryways to abutting properties across roadways aligned to create
§ 30-231 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 30-231
1:553
direct intersections, providing efficiency and safety for vehicles
entering and exiting the sites.
(16) Mechanical equipment or utility equipment located on the exterior
of a building should be appropriately screened from public view or
designed as an integral part of the overall exterior appearances of
the building facade.
(17) Service areas, refuse collection and storage areas, and loading
docks or zones, should be located away from or screened from
public view and shall not impede on-site vehicular and pedestrian
circulation. On waterfront locations, the service and loading
facilities shall not be located on the water side of the structure and
shall be placed in a manner to minimize and screen such uses from
public view.
(18) All utility services shall be constructed underground. Utility
components required to be aboveground (transformers, meters,
etc.) shall be screened by landscaping away from public view and,
to the extent practicable, located to the rear of buildings.
(19) Affordable housing. Development within the Planned Riverfront
Mixed-Use District shall conform to the statewide standards for
affordable housing for the entirety of the residential and
nonresidential development in accordance with N.J.A.C. 5:94 and
N.J.A.C. 5:95, as amended or superseded, and the Housing Element
and Fair Share Plan of the City of Millville. Applicants may elect to
construct affordable housing on site or within the City's
redevelopment areas or provide a payment in lieu of construction
for up to 50% of the affordable housing obligation.
E. Performance standards.
(1) A plan shall be submitted for the ownership of common areas such
as loading areas, parking lots, pedestrian walkways and other
common open spaces.
(2) The land proposed to be set aside for common open space may be
dedicated by the developer to the City for public use. The City
reserves the right to accept or reject the proposed dedication. If
the common open space is not dedicated to the City and accepted
by the City, the developer shall provide for an organization to own
and maintain the common open space for the benefit of the
residents of the development and for the public. These lands shall
be owned by one of the following legal entities: owned jointly or in
common by the owners of the building lots or owned by a land
conservation trust. The agreement or the management
organization shall guarantee continued ownership and
maintenance of all the common open space.
(3) The applicant shall provide copies of the articles of incorporation,
bylaws, deeds with covenants, deeds with easements, deeds of
§ 30-231 MILLVILLE CODE § 30-231
1:554
trust and the management agreement which provides for the
ownership and maintenance of the common open space.

§ 30-235. General criteria for eligibility.
One of the prime objectives of a residential cluster development of land
is the availability and quantum of open space made possible by deviation
from usual zoning requirements. The following general criteria shall govern
the eligibility of an application for development of this type of planned
development:
A. Article VI of the Municipal Land Use Law69 authorizes municipalities to
adopt an ordinance providing for planned developments in the form of
residential clusters. This form of planned development encourages and
promotes flexibility and economy in layout and design while preserving
substantial open space, including agricultural lands and
environmentally sensitive lands.
B. A residential cluster of single-family dwellings may be permitted as an
alternative form of development in specific zones on contiguous parcels
that are developed as a single entity, according to a plan that preserves
a significant area of open space. Applicants utilizing the cluster
development option must demonstrate that compared to a conventional
layout, the cluster design will benefit the community by reducing
impervious surfaces, conserving natural resources and open space by
minimizing land disturbance from grading and clearing, reducing the
need for roadway and utility infrastructure and reducing the need for
stormwater management basins.
A. Minimum required acreage. The required minimum acreage shall be:

A. General standards.
§ 30-250 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 30-251
1:587
(1) Plan preparation. Plans shall be prepared, signed, and sealed by a
licensed engineer, surveyor, land planner, or landscape architect,
as provided for by law, and in accordance with applicable statutes
thereto.
(2) Drawing sizes. All plans shall be clearly and legibly drawn and shall
be on one of the following standard sheet sizes:
(a) 8 1/2 inches by 13 inches.
(b) 15 inches by 21 inches.
(c) 24 inches by 36 inches.
(d) 30 inches by 42 inches.
B. Standards relating to mining operations.
(1) Size of tract. Any tract of land to be used for a land mining
operation shall be at least 50 acres in size unless it is contiguous to
lands in the same ownership or leasehold interest used for an
active land mining operation at the date of application for a permit,
in which case, the coordination of rehabilitation plans between the
new and existing uses will be required.
(2) Setbacks.
(a) Five hundred feet from boundary of residential zone line.
(b) Earth extraction activities shall not be conducted closer than
300 feet from:
[1] The boundary of any zone where such operations are not
permitted;
[2] The boundary of an adjoining property line unless such
adjoining property is in the same ownership or leasehold
interest as the permit property, and an appropriate
easement or deed restriction is provided such that the
setbacks required by this section are not violated if the
adjoining property is conveyed or separated from the
permit property.
[3] The edge of the right-of-way of any dedicated street, road,
highway or water body when it is determined that such
setback areas are not suitable for future permitted
development proposed due to environmental constraints of
the site, (such as areas subject to flooding, severe
limitations for an on-site sewage disposal systems,
topography, etc.) or when a more desirable layout for the
future land use plan can be achieved; the setback may be
reduced to that deemed necessary by the Planning Board,
provided that an average setback of 300 feet is
§ 30-251 MILLVILLE CODE § 30-251
1:588
maintained, but in no case shall such a setback be reduced
to that 150 feet. Compliance with the total setback
requirement shall be determined by computing the area
between the proposed setback line and the perimeter line
requiring setback as described above, which shall be equal
to or greater than the length of the perimeter line
requiring setback times 300 feet.
(c) Buildings or structures actively used in the mining or
subsequent production and/or processing operations shall not
be located closer than 100 feet to a public right-of-way or
adjoining property lines.
(3) Buffer zones and fencing. On the property covered by the setback
requirements above, there shall be maintained within this setback
undisturbed buffer zones of natural foliage, trees, or other like
plantings of at least 150 feet in width, and such zones are to be
specifically shown on the plans with a complete description of the
type of natural cover contained thereon. The Planning Board may
require, in its discretion, additional screening such as additional
vegetative cover, landscaped earth mounds or dense evergreen
plantings, if necessary, to properly screen or buffer the operation
from surrounding uses. Perimeter of area currently being mined
shall be enclosed by six-foot high chain link fence.
(4) Production and processing operations. All buildings, structures,
and equipment used for mining, shall be constructed, maintained
and operated in compliance with § 30-135 of this chapter and in
such a manner as to reduce, noise, vibration, or dust, in order to
minimize the impact on adjacent or surrounding uses.
(5) Consistency with reclamation plan. All mining operations shall be
conducted in a manner not inconsistent with the reclamation plan
and in such a manner that the objectives of the plan may be
realized after the sand, gravel, and other material has been
removed.
(6) Access roads. Haul roads shall be located in such a manner as to
minimize the impact on existing land uses, and to avoid the routing
of vehicles to and from the mining operation over streets that
primarily serve developed areas. Entrances shall be restricted to as
few as are absolutely necessary, preferably no more than two,
unless warranted by specific conditions of the site or operation.
(7) Signs. Traffic control signs shall be provided and maintained by the
operator on internal roads and at entrances when necessary for
safety reasons. All entrances shall be clearly marked with
identification of operator of facility and type of facility. All
entrances and routes shall be clearly marked in order to guide
workers, haulers, and authorized visitors who may be unfamiliar
with the site, to designated areas, (i.e.: office, loading area, etc.).
§ 30-251 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 30-251
1:589
All areas where access is to be restricted because of safety reasons
shall be clearly marked and maintained.
(8) Security gates. Security gates or other suitable guard mechanisms
shall be provided at all entrances leading to or from public roads or
rights-of-way which shall prohibit access during periods of
nonoperation.
(9) Dust and dirt control. Roads within the site shall be constructed in
such a manner as to minimize and control the amount of dust
created, including the amount of mud and dirt carried onto public
roads by the wheels of vehicles from the site which, when deposited
on roads, will contribute to dust problems over a wider area. If
deemed necessary, the Planning Board may require special
treatment at the point where access roads meet public roads for a
distance not to exceed 300 feet and a width not to exceed 22 feet.
This special treatment may consist of gravel, stone, oil treatment,
or paving, as deemed appropriate.
(10) Spillage. During hauling operations, any spillage of materials on
public roads by owner's or contractor's equipment shall be
promptly and completely removed.
(11) Emergency access. Emergency access for fire, rescue and/or
ambulance equipment shall be provided and maintained at all times
at the plant, office facilities and all working areas.
(12) Fire protection. There shall be provided at the plant and office
facilities and at other locations specifically requested by the
applicable Fire Chief, a water supply hookup facility for fire
equipment use. Such facility shall be reviewed and approved by the
Fire Chief responsible for that particular area of the City.
(13) Grading. The slope of the surface of restored surfaces shall not
exceed one foot vertical to three feet horizontal. Any body of water
created by the resource extraction operation shall have a graded
shoreline with a slope not to exceed one foot vertical to five feet
horizontal.
(14) Topsoil preservation. As an integral part of each land mining
operation a sufficient amount of arable topsoil shall be set aside
and retained within or near the permit site to cover disturbed areas
in accordance with the reclamation plan. The amount required
shall be a quantity which when placed, will provide a maximum
depth of six inches, or an amount equal to that which was removed,
whichever is less, throughout all areas to be restored (six inches is
equivalent to 800 cubic yards per acre). This material shall, where
practical, be used for temporary screening or berming. All topsoil
stockpiles must be treated, planted or graded in accordance with
"Standards for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control in New Jersey"
adopted by the New Jersey Soil Conservation Committee, in order
§ 30-251 MILLVILLE CODE § 30-251
1:590
to minimize the process of erosion by wind or water upon adjacent
property, public roads or streams.
(15) Erosion control. Erosion control methods must be in accordance
with an approved plan based on "Standards of Soil Erosion and
Sediment Control in New Jersey" adopted by the New Jersey Soil
Conservation Committee.
(16) Protection of vegetation. Existing trees, woods, and ground cover
shall be protected and retained to the maximum degree possible.
Clearing shall be strictly limited only to those areas which are
absolutely necessary for the proposed mining operation.
Reestablishment of trees and vegetation shall be required in those
areas which are unnecessarily destroyed. However, this provision
shall not prohibit agricultural or forestry uses as permitted within
the zoning district.
(17) Protection of water tables. Maximum depth of excavation shall not
be below existing groundwater, except in such cases where the
reclamation plan indicated that a lake or lakes will be part of the
final use of the land or where such plan indicates that adequate fill
from overburden is to be used to refill such excavation for
conformance to the approved reclamation plan. No extraction
operations shall be conducted in such a manner as to permanently
alter the water table of surrounding inhabited properties, or to
alter the stability of adjacent lands, or to create a potential
subsidence of adjacent lands. As a monitoring device, the operator
shall install prior to commencement of extraction operations,
observation or monitoring wells in accordance with the following
table based on a total of all permit areas currently applied for and
previously approved under the ordinance.
(a) Zero to 50 acres: two wells.
(b) Fifty to 100 acres: three wells.
(c) Each additional 100 acres or any portion thereof: one
additional well.
These wells shall be located and constructed to a depth and in
accordance with details approved by the Planning Board and
each well shall have a permanent reference bench mark on or
adjacent to the facility. As extraction areas increase for new
permit periods, these wells may have to be relocated in order
to adequately surround the perimeter of the excavated areas.
C. Standards relating to land reclamation.
(1) Exceptions. The parties issued any permit for a land mining
operation are responsible for the reclamation of the area in
compliance with the reclamation plan on file with the City.
§ 30-251 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 30-251
1:591
(2) Progressive reclamation. Land restoration shall be planned and
implemented as contemporaneously as possible with the extraction
of the resource, considering the ultimate use of the area as stated
in the reclamation plan. Typically, it should include the following
steps:
(a) Removal and storage of the topsoil and other overburden.
(b) Terracing or sloping the pit or face walls during the extraction
period.
(c) Final grading and shaping of the worked-out area.
(d) Replacing and contouring the topsoil and other overburden;
and
(e) Replanting.
(3) Timing. Reclamation shall be a continuous process and each
portion of the parcel shall be restored within two years after the
resource extraction is completed for the permitted area.
Restoration shall proceed in the same sequence and time frame as
set out in the extraction schedule.
(4) Dry pit rehabilitation. The dry pit may be backfilled with sand,
gravel, overburden, topsoil or other non-noxious, nonflammable,
nontoxic, noncombustible solids.
(5) Wet pit rehabilitation. Like dry pit rehabilitation, the wet pit may be
filled. Any filling must be accomplished in accordance with the
conditions set forth for dry pit rehabilitation. In the alternative the
wet pit may be converted into a lake in accordance with the
rehabilitation plan and all other applicable standards of this
chapter. If a lake is to be created, pollution and stagnation must be
prevented.
(6) Site clearance. All organic materials, boulders, and other debris
resulting from the excavation or related activities shall be disposed
of by approved methods.
(7) Removal of topsoil. When topsoil is removed sufficient arable soil as
required by § 30-251B(14) of this article shall be set aside on the
site for respreading over the reclamation area. These stockpiles of
topsoil should be used to minimize the effects of erosion of wind or
water upon public roads, streams, or adjacent land uses. No topsoil
shall be removed from the overall tract.

frame and any material or color forming an integral part of the
background of the display used to differentiate the sign from the
backdrop or structure against which it is placed.
(2) The area of a sign with more than one face shall be computed by
adding together the area of all sign faces visible from any one
point. When two identical sign faces are placed back to back so that
both faces cannot be viewed from any one point at the same time,
the area of the sign shall be computed by the measurement of one
of the faces.
(3) The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the
base of the sign at grade to the top of the highest attached
component of the sign.
G. Relief and sign face distance. No sign shall contain characters or
graphics exceeding three inches in relief from the sign face. The
maximum distance between the faces of a double-faced sign shall not

notice to correct the condition within 20 days from the date of the
mailing of the notice. The Zoning Officer may be assisted by the

shall have the right to recover from said owner the full costs of the
removal and disposal of such signs should the owner fail to heed such
correction notice. Signs shall conform to the requirements of the
Uniform Construction Code75 and any other property maintenance code
of the municipality.
J. Number of signs. For the purpose of determining the number of signs, a
sign shall be considered to be a single display device or surface when

the components are displayed in a random manner without organized
elements or where there is a reasonable doubt about the relationship of
the elements, each element shall be considered to be a separate sign.

(1) Design guidelines and standards. In this section, guidelines are
overall principles to be used in the design of signs. Standards are to
be followed in the placement and design of signs unless specifically
waived by the approving authority.
(a) Design guidelines.
[1] Signs should strengthen the architectural diversity of the
City's buildings.
[2] Signs should be appropriate for the era in which the
building was constructed.
§ 30-264 MILLVILLE CODE § 30-264
1:616
[3] Signs should not alter the way in which a building
functions.
[4] Signs should be integrated with a building's architecture
in terms of form, materials and size.
[5] Designers should strive for creativity in the form and
variety of signage within the size limitations set forth
herein.
[6] Designers should include symbols, images and other
objects to convey the type of establishment using the sign.
[7] The typeface used to represent words should convey the
character of the establishment and the era of the building.
The contrast of a sign's lettering and symbols with its
background should be high to convey legibility.
[8] Relief in the sign face is encouraged to create threedimensionality.
[9] Illumination shall be accomplished through external
floodlights only, which shall be trained in a downward
direction on the sign face. Pursuant to these regulations,
internal illumination is not permitted in the Arts District
Overlay Zone. [Amended 8-3-2010 by Ord. No.
14-2010]
(b) Design standards.
[1] Wall sign locations. For single-story buildings the wall sign
should be located on the parapet wall above the storefront
or on an awning or canopy and below the capstone. For
buildings of two stories or more the sign should be located
on the facade above the storefront but below the window
sills of the second floor. If there are cornices or beltlines
separating the first and second stories, the wall sign
should be placed below such horizontal architectural
elements.
[2] Projecting sign locations. Projecting signs for first-floor
establishments should be just below the second-floor
windows. Projecting signs for establishments on the
second floor or higher should be located above the secondstory
windows.
[3] Sign complexity. Facade and freestanding signs oriented
towards motorists should convey no more than seven items
of information. More complex signage should be limited to
projecting signs oriented towards pedestrians.
(c) Sign materials. Sign materials should relate to the
architectural era of the building. Where modern buildings are
§ 30-264 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 30-264
1:617
designed to evoke an earlier era, signage should reflect that
age. Sign materials.
[1] Pre-World War I: painted or carved smooth-surfaced wood;
carved stone; cast brass; tinned and forged metal; and
gold-leafed lettering.
[2] World War I to 1940: any of the above, plus individual
wood or metal letters on building facade.
[3] 1940 to 1970: any of the above, plus neon signs.
[4] 1970 to present: any of the above and sandblasted wooden
or resin signs.
[5] Internally lit neon signs are permitted in post-1940
buildings in the Arts District.
[6] Neon open tubing signs are permitted in all buildings.
(2) Freestanding signs. No use shall be permitted a freestanding
identification sign unless the main building facade is more than 30
feet from the right-of-way line. Where allowed, no more than one
freestanding sign per street frontage shall be permitted; it shall be
no larger than 12 square feet and no more than six feet in height
and set back three feet from the right-of-way line.
(3) Wall signs. Each first-floor use may have one externally illuminated
or nonilluminated wall sign identifying the use, attached flat
against the front of the building, not exceeding an area equal to one
square foot for each lineal front foot of the building or 60 square
feet, whichever is smaller. Where the use is located in a building on
property having frontage on more than one street, one additional
sign identifying the use may be attached flat against the building
for each side of the building fronting on a street. Establishments
with entrances accessible from a rear yard public parking area may
have an additional wall sign not to exceed six square feet in area.
[Amended 8-3-2010 by Ord. No. 14-2010]
(a) In lieu of a wall sign, a permanent window sign shall be
permitted, provided it does not exceed 10% of the total
storefront glass area on the first floor and 50% of any one
window.
(b) Individual letters, symbols, or characters used singularly or in
combination to identify a business or building shall be
considered wall signs and must conform to the size
requirements herein.
(c) In the case of buildings with multiple tenants or multiple uses,
each individual business storefront will be required to meet the
size requirements for wall signs based upon the size in square
§ 30-264 MILLVILLE CODE § 30-264
1:618
feet of their individual frontage in proportion to the entire
building.
(4) Projecting signs. Projecting signs shall be located above secondstory
windows and shall not in any way impede access to the
primary entryway for any business. One projecting sign per
building may be erected facing each street frontage. However,
whenever a building has more than one projecting sign, no more
than one wall sign identifying the main establishment shall be
permitted. The permitted sign area shall be limited to 3% of the
total facade area or a maximum of 16 square feet, whichever is less.
[Amended 8-3-2010 by Ord. No. 14-2010]
(5) Changeable copy. Changeable copy signs shall be permitted for
institutional uses, establishments booking live performances and
for service stations selling motor fuel. Such signs shall not exceed
12 square feet in area and shall be integrated with permanent-copy
freestanding or wall signs as otherwise permitted.

§ 30-271. Purposes.
A. The Federal Communications Act of 1934 as amended by the
Telecommunications Act of 1996 (hereinafter the "Act") grants the
Federal Communications Commission exclusive jurisdiction over:
(1) The regulation of the environmental effects of radio frequency (RF)
emissions from telecommunication facilities; and
(2) The regulation of radio signal interference among users of the RF
spectrum.
B. The city's regulation of towers and telecommunication facilities within
Millville will not have the effect of prohibiting any person from
providing wireless telecommunication services in violation of the Act.
A. The general purpose of this article is to regulate the placement,
construction, and modification of towers and telecommunication
facilities in order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public,
while at the same time not unreasonably interfering with the
development of competitive telecommunications market place as it
relates to the City of Millville.
B. Specifically, the purposes of this article are:
(1) To regulate the location of towers and telecommunication facilities
within the City of Millville;
(2) To protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse
impact of towers and telecommunication facilities;
(3) To minimize adverse visual impact of towers and
telecommunication facilities through careful design, siting,
landscaping and the innovative camouflaging techniques;
(4) To promote and encourage shared use/collocation of towers and
antenna support structures as a primary option rather than
construction of additional single-use towers;
(5) To promote and encourage the utilization of technological designs
that will either eliminate or reduce the need for erection of new
tower structures to support antenna and telecommunication
facilities;
(6) To avoid potential damage to property and personal injury to
residents caused by towers and telecommunication facilities by
ensuring that such structures are soundly and carefully designed,

the modified or demolished and rebuilt tower is conforming.
(3) The height of the modified or rebuilt tower and telecommunications
facilities do not exceed the maximum height allowed under this
article.
B. Except as provided in this section, a nonconforming structure or use
may not be enlarged, increased in size or abandoned. For the purpose of
this article a nonconforming structure which is discontinued for a
period of more than 180 days, unless said discontinuance is for repairs,
shall be considered abandoned. This article shall not be interpreted to
legalize any structure or use existing at the time this article is adopted
which structure or use is in violation of any of the ordinances of the City

located at the proposed site in order to meet the coverage
requirements of the applicant's wireless communications system
and if the person is willing to create approved landscaping and
other buffers to screen the tower from being visible to residentially
zoned properties.
(4) In the case of a request for modification of the height limits for
towers and telecommunications facilities or to the minimum height
requirements for antenna support structures, that the modification
is necessary to:
(a) Facilitate collocation of telecommunications facilities in order
to avoid construction of a new tower;

ARTICLE XXV
Affordable Housing
[Added 8-2-2005 by Ord. No. 29-200576; amended 8-21-2007 by Ord.
No. 23-200777; 7-7-2009 by Ord. No. 21-2009]
§ 30-293. Development fees and regulations.
The governing body of the City of Millville (the Municipality) desires to
adopt an ordinance setting forth regulations for the collection, maintenance
and expenditure of development fees to comply with the regulations
established by the Council on Affordable Housing (COAH) in order to secure
third-round substantive certification for the Municipality.
§ 30-294. Purpose; legislative authority.
§ 30-295. Basic requirements.
A. In Holmdel Builder's Association v. Holmdel Township, 121 N.J. 550
(1990), the New Jersey Supreme Court determined that mandatory
development fees are authorized by the Fair Housing Act of 1985 (the
Act), N.J.S.A. 52:27D-301 et seq., and the State Constitution, subject to
the Council on Affordable Housing's (COAH) adoption of rules.
B. Pursuant to P.L. 2008, c. 46, § 8 (N.J.S.A. 52-27D-329.2) and the
Statewide Non-Residential Development Fee Act (N.J.S.A. 40:55D-8.1
through 40:55D-8.7),78 COAH is authorized to adopt and promulgate
regulations necessary for the establishment, implementation, review,
monitoring and enforcement of municipal affordable housing trust
funds and corresponding spending plans. Municipalities that are under
the jurisdiction of the Council or court of competent jurisdiction and
have a COAH-approved spending plan may retain fees collected from
nonresidential development.
C. These regulations establish standards for the collection, maintenance
and expenditure of development fees pursuant to COAH's regulations
and in accordance with P.L. 2008, c. 46, § 8 and §§ 32 through 38.79 Fees
collected pursuant to these regulations shall be used for the sole
purpose of providing low- and moderate-income housing. These
regulations shall be interpreted within the framework of COAH's rules
on development fees, codified at N.J.A.C. 5:97-8.
76.Editor's Note: This ordinance also repealed former § 30-192, Affordable housing.
77.Editor's Note: This ordinance relocated the provisions pertaining to affordable housing
formerly found in Article XVII, §§ 30-192 and 30-192.1 through 30-192.11, to this new
article.
78.Editor's Note: Pursuant to the New Jersey Economic Stimulus Act of 2009, the Non-
Residential Development Fee Act, which was signed into law on 7-17-2008, was suspended.
For applicable development fees, consult the City offices.
79.Editor's Note: See N.J.S.A. 52:27D-329.2 and N.J.S.A. 40:55D-8.1 through 40:55D-8.7,
respectively.
§ 30-293 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 30-295
1:641
§ 30-296. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the following
meanings unless the context clearly indicates that a different meaning is
intended.
AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOMENT  A development included in the
Housing Element and Fair Share Plan, and includes, but is not limited to,
an inclusionary development, a municipal construction project or a onehundred-
percent affordable development.
COAH or THE COUNCIL  The New Jersey Council on Affordable Housing
established under the Act which has primary jurisdiction for the
administration of housing obligations in accordance with sound regional
planning consideration in the state.
DEVELOPMENT FEE  Money paid by a developer for the improvement of
property as permitted in N.J.A.C. 5:97-8.3.
DEVELOPER  The legal or beneficial owner or owners of a lot or of any
land proposed to be included in a proposed development, including the
holder of an option or contract to purchase, or other person having an
enforceable proprietary interest in such land.
EQUALIZED ASSESSED VALUE  The assessed value of a property divided
by the current average ratio of assessed to true value for the municipality
in which the property is situated, as determined in accordance with §§ 1, 5
and 6 of P.L. 1973, c. 123 (N.J.S.A. 54:1-35a through 54:1-35c).
GREEN BUILDING STRATEGIES  Those strategies that minimize the
impact of development on the environment and enhance the health, safety
and well-being of residents by producing durable, low-maintenance,
resource-efficient housing while making optimum use of existing
infrastructure and community services.
§ 30-297. Residential development fees.
A. These regulations shall not be effective until approved by COAH
pursuant to N.J.A.C. 5:96-5.1.
B. The Municipality shall not spend development fees until COAH has
approved a plan for spending such fees in conformance with N.J.A.C.
5:97-8.10 and N.J.A.C. 5:96-5.3.
A. Imposed fees.
(1) Within all zoning district(s), residential developers, except for
developers of the types of development specifically exempted
below, shall pay a fee of 1.5% of the equalized assessed value for
residential development, provided no increased density is
permitted.
(2) When an increase in residential density pursuant to N.J.S.A.
40:55D-70d(5) (known as a "d" variance) has been permitted,
§ 30-295 MILLVILLE CODE § 30-297
1:642
§ 30-298. Nonresidential development fees.
developers may be required to pay a development fee of 6% of
the equalized assessed value for each additional unit that may be
realized. However, if the zoning on a site has changed during the
two-year period preceding the filing of such a variance application,
the base density for the purposes of calculating the bonus
development fee shall be the highest density permitted by right
during the two-year period preceding the filing of the variance
application. Example: If an approval allows four units to be
constructed on a site that was zoned for two units, the fees could
equal 1.5% of the equalized assessed value on the first two units
and the specified higher percentage up to 6% of the equalized
assessed value for the two additional units, provided zoning on
the site has not changed during the two-year period preceding the
filing of such a variance application.
B. Eligible exactions, ineligible exactions and exemptions for residential
development.
(1) Affordable housing developments, developments where the
developer is providing for the construction of affordable units
elsewhere in the municipality and developments where the
developer has made a payment in lieu of on-site construction of
affordable units shall be exempt from development fees.
(2) Developments that have received preliminary or final site plan
approval prior to the adoption of a municipal development fee
ordinance shall be exempt from development, unless the developer
seeks a substantial change in the approval. Where a site plan
approval does not apply, a zoning and/or building permit shall be
synonymous with preliminary or final site plan approval for this
purpose. The fee percentage shall be vested on the date that the
building permit is issued.
(3) Development fees shall be imposed and collected when an existing
structure undergoes a change to a more intense use or is
demolished and replaced. The development fee shall be calculated
on the increase in the equalized assessed value of the improved
structure.
(4) Developers of structures demolished and replaced as a result of a
natural disaster shall be exempt from paying a development fee.
A. Imposed fees.
(1) Within all zoning districts, nonresidential developers, except for
developers of the types of development specifically exempted, shall
pay a fee equal to 2.5% of the equalized assessed value of the land
and improvements for all new nonresidential construction on an
unimproved lot or lots.
§ 30-297 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 30-298
1:643
§ 30-299. Collection procedures.
(2) Nonresidential developers, except for developers of the types of
development specifically exempted, shall also pay a fee equal to
2.5% of the increase in equalized assessed value resulting from any
additions to existing structures to be used for nonresidential
purposes.
(3) Development fees shall be imposed and collected when an existing
structure is demolished and replaced. The development fee of 2.5%
shall be calculated on the difference between the equalized
assessed value of the newly improved structure, i.e., land and
improvement, at the time the final certificate of occupancy is
issued. If the calculation required under this section results in a
negative number, the nonresidential development fee shall be zero.
B. Eligible exactions, ineligible exactions and exemptions for
nonresidential development.
(1) The nonresidential portion of a mixed-use inclusionary or market
rate development shall be subject to the development fee of 2.5%,
unless otherwise exempted below.
(2) The fee of 2.5% shall not apply to an increase in equalized assessed
value resulting from alterations, change in use within the existing
footprint, reconstruction, renovations and repairs.
(3) Nonresidential developments shall be exempt from the payment of
nonresidential development fees in accordance with the
exemptions required pursuant to P.L. 2008, c. 46, as specified in
Form N-RDF, State of New Jersey Non-Residential Development
Certification/Exemption form. Any exemption claimed by a
developer shall be substantiated by that developer.
(4) A developer of a nonresidential development exempted from the
nonresidential development fee pursuant to P.L. 2008, c. 46 shall be
subject to it at such time the basis for the exemption no longer
applies and shall make the payment of the nonresidential
development fee, in that event, within three years after that event
or after the issuance of the final certificate of occupancy of the
nonresidential development, whichever is later.
(5) If a property which was exempted from the collection of a
nonresidential development fee thereafter ceases to be exempt
from property taxation, the owner of the property shall remit the
fees required pursuant to this section within 45 days of the
termination of the properly tax exemption. Unpaid nonresidential
development fees under these circumstances may be enforceable
by the Municipality as a lien against the real property of the owner.
A. Upon the granting of a preliminary, final or other applicable approval
for a development, the applicable approving authority shall direct its
§ 30-298 MILLVILLE CODE § 30-299
1:644
staff to notify the construction official responsible for the issuance of a
building permit.
B. For nonresidential developments only, the developer shall also be
provided with a copy of Form N-RDF, State of New Jersey Non-
Residential Development Certification/Exemption, to be completed as
per the instructions provided. The developer of a nonresidential
development shall complete Form N-RDF as per the instructions
provided. The construction official shall verify the information
submitted by the nonresidential developer as per the instructions
provided in Form N-RDF. The Tax Assessor shall verify exemptions and
prepare estimated and final assessments as per the instructions
provided in Form N-RDF.
C. The construction official responsible for the issuance of a building
permit shall notify the local tax assessor of the issuance of the first
building permit for a development which is subject to a development
fee.
D. Within 90 days of receipt of that notice, the Municipal Tax Assessor,
based on the plans filed, shall provide an estimate of the equalized
assessed value of the development.
E. The construction official responsible for the issuance of a final
certificate of occupancy notifies the local assessor of any and all
requests for the scheduling of a final inspection on property which is
subject to a development fee.
F. Within 10 business days of a request for the scheduling of a final
inspection, the municipal assessor shall confirm or modify the
previously estimated equalized assessed value of the improvements of
the development; calculate the development fee; and thereafter notify
the developer of the amount of the fee.
G. Should the Municipality fail to determine or notify the developer of the
amount of the development fee within 10 business days of the request
for final inspection, the developer may estimate the amount due and
pay that estimated amount consistent with the dispute process set forth
in Subsection b of § 37 of P.L. 2008, c. 46 (N.J.S.A. 40:55D-8.6).
H. Fifty percent of the development fee shall be collected at the time of
issuance of the building permit. The remaining portion shall be
collected at the issuance of the certificate of occupancy. The developer
shall be responsible for paying the difference between the fee
calculated at building permit and that determined at issuance of
certificate of occupancy.
I. Appeal of development fees.
(1) A developer may challenge residential development fees imposed
by filing a challenge with the County Board of Taxation. Pending a
review and determination by the Board, collected fees shall be

Traffic Controls for Street and Highway Construction and
Maintenance Operations
§ 39-39. Legislative findings and adoption of manual on Uniform
Traffic Control Devices for streets and highways.
The governing body of the City finds and declares that problems of traffic
control occur when street construction, maintenance operations and utility
work are taking place on the City streets. This requires the blocking of the
street and the obstructing of the normal flow of traffic. Such obstructions
can become dangerous when not properly controlled. In order to promote
the public health, safety and welfare, it is necessary to establish controls
and regulations for the safe and efficient movement of traffic through the
construction and maintenance zones. Accordingly, the governing body of
the City hereby adopts by reference and incorporates herein the current
Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices as it controls and regulates
traffic whenever construction, maintenance operations or utility work
obstructs the normal flow of traffic.
§ 39-40. Statutory authority.
In accordance with the provisions of N.J.S.A. 39:4-197.3, the governing body
of the City is authorized to adopt special traffic regulations by resolution

desiring to conduct work on, under or above the street to contact the
traffic safety section of the Millville Police Department to arrange a
preconstruction meeting in order to submit plans for the safe and efficient
movement of traffic during the period of construction or repair. Any person,
contractor or public utility who fails to comply with this section prior to the
start of work or whose plans are not approved by the Traffic Safety Section
of the Millville Police Department is in violation of these regulations.
§ 39-42. Hazardous conditions.
The person, contractor or public utility shall provide the Traffic Safety
Section of the Millville Police Department with at least two emergency
contact telephone numbers to be called in the case of emergency problems
occurring at the construction or maintenance site. These telephone
numbers shall be provided prior to the start of any work. If for any reason
the emergency contact cannot be reached, or if the emergency contact
§ 39-39 LICENSING OF PROFESSIONS AND § 39-42
35:779
person does not respond to the telephone call from the Police Department to
correct a hazardous condition, the City through its personnel may respond
to correct the hazardous condition. The reasonable fees for this emergency
service provided by the City shall be charged to the person, contractor or
public utility responsible for the hazardous condition.
§ 39-43. Hours.
There shall be no construction, maintenance operations, or utility work
performed on any street under local jurisdiction within the City before the
hour of 8:00 a.m. or after the hour of 5:00 p.m. This time limit may be
adjusted to permit work at other times if authorized by the Chief of Police or
his designated representative. However, this time limit shall not be modified
if the Chief of Police or his designated representative determines that work
performed at other times would substantially delay traffic or cause a health
or safety hazard.
§ 39-44. Chief of Police authorized to perform certain actions.
§ 39-45. Site preparation.
No equipment, vehicles or material shall be placed on the street or the
sidewalk area until all construction devices, lights, signs and pavement
markings have been installed for the construction or maintenance area.
§ 39-46. Stop-work order.
The Chief of Police or his designated representative shall have the authority
to stop work in order to abate any nuisance and safety hazard or for any
violation of these regulations. His authority shall include the right to order
the removal of equipment, vehicles and stored material from within the
right-of-way of any street under local jurisdiction, and he may order the
backfilling of open excavations and other related work in order to abate any
nuisance and safety hazard.
§ 39-47. Violations and penalties.
Any person, contractor or public utility convicted of a violation of these
regulations shall receive the following penalties. A separate offense shall be

The Director of Public Safety is hereby authorized to provide by regulation
for the closing of any streets or parts of streets under local jurisdiction to

Director determines that it is necessary for the health, safety or welfare of
the public. Any regulation to close any street under local jurisdiction for
a period of time greater than 48 continuous hours must be approved by
the Commissioner of the Department of Transportation. The Chief of Police
shall erect proper warning signs notifying the public of the closure of the
street.
§ 39-50. Declaration of emergency.
The Director of Public Safety is hereby authorized to declare an emergency
when accidents, fires, public celebrations, road construction or weather
conditions require the avoidance of hazards or other conditions which
interfere with the free flow of traffic. Whenever the Director of Public Safety
declares an emergency, it shall remain in effect until the declaration is
removed. The Director of Public Safety may, through police agencies under
his control, determine and control the direction of the flow of traffic and the
parking of motor vehicles on streets under local jurisdiction. Traffic may be
detoured, diverted or rerouted. Parking of motor vehicles may be prohibited
on certain streets.
§ 39-51. Erection of signs and deployment of personnel.
For the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of this article, the
Chief of Police is authorized to erect directional signals and temporary
"Emergency No-Parking" signs. He also may assign police officers for the
manual direction of traffic if necessary. The effectiveness of these
regulations is contingent upon signs being erected as required by law.
Notification that "Emergency No-Parking" signs are being posted shall be
given to the operator or owner of any vehicle which was parked prior to the
posting of the signs.
§ 39-52. Parking prohibited during emergencies and snow removal.

shall remain in effect after the snow has ceased until the streets have
been plowed sufficiently so that parking will not interfere with the
normal flow of traffic.
C. Any unoccupied vehicle parked in violation of these regulations shall be
deemed a nuisance and a hazard to the safe and proper regulation of
traffic. Any police officer may provide for the removal of such vehicle.
The owner shall pay the reasonable costs of the removal and storage
which may result from the removal before regaining possession of the
vehicle.
D. Unless another penalty is expressly provided by New Jersey statute, any

ARTICLE IV
Alcohol and Drugs
§ 46-21. Policy.
In compliance with the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988, the City of
Millville has a longstanding commitment to providing a safe and productive
work environment consistent with the standards of the community we serve.
Alcohol and drug abuse pose a threat to the health and safety of City
employees and to the security of our equipment and facilities. For these
reasons, the City of Millville is committed to the elimination of drug and/
or alcohol use and abuse in the workplace. This policy outlines the practice
and procedure designed to correct instances of identified alcohol and/or
drug use in the workplace. This policy continues to apply to all employees
and all applicants for employment of the City.
A. Employee assistance and drug-free awareness.
(1) Illegal drug use and alcohol misuse have a number of adverse
health and safety consequences. Information about those
consequences and sources of help for drug/alcohol problems is
available from the City.
(2) The City will assist and support employees who voluntarily seek
help for such problems before becoming subject to discipline and/
or termination under this or other City policies. Such employees
will be allowed to use accrued paid time off, placed on leaves of
absence, referred to treatment providers and otherwise
accommodated as required by law. Such employees may be
required to document that they are successfully following
prescribed treatment and to take and pass follow-up tests if they
hold jobs that are safety-sensitive or require driving, or have
violated this policy previously. Once a drug test has been
scheduled, the employee will have forfeited their right to be
granted a leave of absence for treatment and possible discipline, up
to and including discharge, will be unavoidable.
(3) Employees should report to work fit for duty and free of any
adverse effects of illegal drugs or alcohol. This policy does not
prohibit employees from the lawful use and possession of
prescribed medications. Employees must, however, consult with
their doctors about the medications' effect on their fitness for duty
and ability to work safely and promptly disclose any work
restrictions to their supervisor. Employees should not, however,
disclose underlying medical conditions unless directed to do so by
their supervisor.
B. Work rules.
§ 46-21 LICENSING OF PROFESSIONS AND § 46-21
35:833
(1) Whenever employees are working, are operating any City vehicle,
are present on City premises, or are conducting City related work
off site, they are prohibited from:
(a) Using, possessing, buying, selling, manufacturing or
dispensing an illegal drug (to include possession of drug
paraphernalia);
(b) Being under the influence of alcohol or an illegal drug as
defined in this policy; and
(c) Possessing or consuming alcohol.
(2) The presence of any detectable amount of any illegal drug or illegal
controlled substance in an employee's body system, while
performing City business or while in a City facility, is prohibited.
(3) The City will also not allow any employee to perform their duties
while taking prescribed drugs that are adversely affecting the
employee's ability to safely and effectively perform their job duties.
Employees taking a prescribed medication must carry it in the
container labeled by a licensed pharmacist or be prepared to
produce this if asked. Employees possessing prescription
medication in child-care centers must secure it behind lock and key.
(4) Any illegal drugs or drug paraphernalia will be turned over to an
appropriate law enforcement officer and may result in criminal
prosecution.
C. Required testing.
(1) Pre-employment. All applicants must pass a drug test before
beginning work or receiving an offer of employment. Refusal to
submit to testing will result in disqualification of further
employment consideration.
(2) Reasonable suspicion. Employees are subject to testing based upon
(hut not limited to) observations by supervision or management of
apparent workplace use, possession or impairment. The City
Personnel Officer shall be consulted before sending an employee
for testing. All levels of supervision or management making this
decision must utilize the Reasonable Suspicion Checklist to
document specific observations and behaviors that create a
reasonable suspicion that the person is under the influence of
illegal drugs and/or alcohol. Reasonable suspicion may include (but
are not limited to) where the employee:
(a) Is unable to coordinate their actions;
(b) Has red or bloodshot eyes, or dilated pupils;
(c) Smells of alcohol;
§ 46-21 MILLVILLE CODE § 46-21
35:834
(d) Acts contrary to their normal behavior;
(e) Exceeds alcohol concentration limits applicable to the task
they perform or may be called on to perform;
(f) Is not behaving in a professional and competent manner and in
accordance with City policy standards; or
(g) Otherwise appears to be impaired or affected by drugs or
alcohol; or
(h) Returns a positive alcohol or drug test. If the results of the
Reasonable Suspicion Checklist indicate further action is
justified, the manager/supervisor should confront the
employee with the documentation and with a union
representative present (for all unionized employees) and/or
with another member of management (for all nonunionized
employees). Under no circumstances will the employee be
allowed to drive himself or herself to the testing facility. A
member of supervision/management and a union
representative (if appropriate) must escort the employee; the
supervisor/manager will make arrangements for the employee
to be transported home.
(3) Post-accident. Employees are subject to testing when they are
involved in an accident that damages a City vehicle, machinery,
equipment, or property and/or result in an injury to themselves,
another employee, or client requiring off-site medical attention. A
probable belief circumstance will be presumed to arise in any
instance involving a work-related accident or injury in which an
employee who was operating a motorized vehicle (including, but
not limited to, forklifts, pallet jacks, automobiles, pickups, vans, or
trucks) is found to be responsible for causing the accident. In any of
these instances, the investigation and subsequent testing must take
place within two hours following the accident, if not sooner. Under
no circumstances will the employee be allowed to drive himself or
herself to the testing facility.
(4) Follow-up. Employees who have tested positive, or otherwise
violated this policy, are subject to discipline, up to and including
discharge. Depending upon the circumstances and the employee's
work history/record, the City may offer an employee who violates
this policy or tests positive the opportunity to return to work on a
last-chance basis pursuant to mutually agreeable terms, which
could include follow-up drug testing at times and frequencies
determined by the City for a minimum of one year but not more
than two years as well as a waiver of the right to contest any
termination resulting from a subsequent positive test. If the
employee either does not complete their rehabilitation program or
tests positive after completing the rehabilitation program, they will
be subject to immediate discharge from employment.
§ 46-21 LICENSING OF PROFESSIONS AND § 46-21
35:835
D. Responsibilities of management.
(1) Management is responsible for ensuring that this policy is
implemented in their area.
(2) The Human Resources Department will be the point of contact for
the testing provider.
(3) This includes ensuring that:
(a) All workers are made aware and understand this policy;
(b) Risk assessments are undertaken on work tasks in consultation
workers and/or work health and safety representatives;
(c) The behavior of workers is observed to ensure adherence with
the policy;
(d) Any concerns or issues are addressed proactively and
expediently to ensure the health and safety of all workers;
(e) Support is provided to workers where appropriate; and
(f) Any suspected breaches of this policy are acted on promptly
and in accordance with this policy.
E. Consequences.
(1) Applicants who refuse to cooperate in a drug test or who test
positive will not be hired and will not be allowed to reapply/retest
in the future.
(2) Employees who refuse to cooperate in required tests or who use,
possess, buy, sell, manufacture or dispense an illegal drug in
violation of this policy will be terminated. If the employee refuses to
be tested yet we believe they are impaired, under no circumstances
will the employee be allowed to drive himself or herself home.
(3) The first time an employee tests positive for alcohol or illegal drug
use under this policy, the result will be discipline up to and
including discharge.
(4) Employees will be paid for time spent in alcohol/drug testing and
then suspended pending the results of the drug/alcohol test.
F. Confidentiality. Information and records relating to positive test results,
drug and alcohol dependencies and legitimate medical explanations
provided to the MRO shall be kept confidential to the extent required by
law and maintained in secure files separate from normal personnel files.
Such records and information may be disclosed among managers and
supervisors on a need-to-know basis and may also be disclosed where
relevant to a grievance, charge, claim or other legal proceeding
initiated by or on behalf of an employee or applicant.
§ 46-21 MILLVILLE CODE § 46-21
35:836
G. Inspections. The City reserves the right to inspect all portions of its
premises for drugs, alcohol or other contraband; affected employees
may retain representation during this process, including union
representation for unionized employees. Inspections are to be
conducted by authorized personnel; a member of the senior
management team and/or a supervisor. All employees, contract
employees and visitors may be asked to cooperate in inspections of
their persons, work areas, and property that might conceal a drug,
alcohol, or other contraband. Employees who possess such contraband
or refuse to cooperate in such inspections are subject to appropriate
discipline, up to and including discharge.
H. Crime involving drugs.
(1) The City prohibits all employees from manufacturing, distributing,
dispensing, possessing or using an illegal drug in or on the City
premises or while conducting City business. City employees are
also prohibited from misusing legally prescribed or OTC drugs.
Law enforcement personnel shall be notified, as appropriate, where
criminal activity is suspected.
(2) The City does not desire to intrude into the private lives of its
employees, but recognizes that employee's off-the-job involvement
with drugs and alcohol may have an impact on the workplace.
Therefore, the City reserves the right to take appropriate
disciplinary action for drug usage/sale/distribution or driving while
under the influence of drugs or alcohol (DWI) while off company
premises. All employees who are convicted of, plead guilty to, or
arc sentenced for a crime involving an illegal drug or conviction of
DWI are required to report the conviction, plea or sentence to the
commissioner overseeing their department within five days. Failure
to comply will result in automatic discharge. Cooperation in
complying may result in suspension without pay to allow
management to review the nature of the charges and the
employee's past record with the City.

UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF DRUGS  A confirmed positive test
result for illegal drug use per this policy. In addition, it means the
misuse of legal drugs (prescription and possibly over-the-counter)
where there is not a valid prescription from a physician for the lawful
use of a drug in the course of medical treatment (containers must
include the patient's name, the name of the substance, quantity/amount
to be taken, and the period of authorization).
J. Reasonable suspicion and post-accident testing protocol.
(1) The employee will be advised that the City believes that there is
reasonable suspicion to believe that he/she is affected by illegal
drugs or alcohol (or due to the nature of the accident the policy
mandates this) and that this test is being offered to confirm or deny
this suspicion.
(2) The employee will be transported to a testing facility. One member
of management/designated attendant will accompany the
employee. Under no circumstances will the employee be allowed to
drive himself or herself to the testing facility. In cases where the
supervisor and employee are of the opposite sex, the employee may
request the management staff to arrange for a third management
staff employee to accompany the supervisor and employee to the
testing site.
(3) Prior to leaving for the testing facility, supervision/management
will contact the testing facility to inform them that staff from the
City of Millville will be arriving and will need a drug and/or alcohol
test completed.
(4) The employee to be tested must present a photo ID (i.e., a driver's
license or state ID card) to the testing facility staff before the
specimen can be obtained. Ensure that the employee brings this
with them when leaving the City premises.
(5) The employee to be tested must sign a consent form provided by/at
the testing facility. Refusal to sign is addressed under the
"'Consequences" section of this document.
(6) When leaving the testing facility, the supervisor/manager must
make arrangements to transport the person home, unless testing

results are immediate and negative. Under no other circumstances
will the tested employee be allowed to drive himself or herself
home.

grandparent, daughter-in-law, son-in-law, grandchild, niece, nephew,
uncle, aunt or any person related by blood or marriage residing in the
household of an employee. Employees are required to disclose possible
conflicts so that the City may assess and prevent potential conflicts. If
there are any questions whether an action or proposed course of
conduct would create a conflict of interest, immediately contact the City
Administrator or the City Solicitor to obtain clarification.
B. Since it is impossible to describe all of the situations that may cause or
give the appearance of a conflict of interest, the prohibitions included in
this policy are not intended to be exhaustive and include only some of
the more clear-cut examples.

ethical manner. Thus, employees have an obligation to avoid

for the welfare of the person who has the communicable disease and/or
the welfare of others within the workplace.

"Request for Criminal History Record Information For A
Noncriminal Justice Purpose" will be destroyed immediately after it
has served its authorized purpose, as required by the State Police.

or disclosed in any manner not consistent with the procedures
listed herein. Such information will not be deemed a public record
under P.L. 1963, c.73 (C:47:1A-1, et seq.) as amended and

employer's targeted screening process described above, the City
Administrator will inform the candidate, volunteer, or employee, in
writing, of any information that would disqualify the person from
working with children/youth. In addition, the individual shall be
advised that he/she has the opportunity to explain the criminal
record and to demonstrate why the exclusion based on the
employer's targeted screening process should not apply to him/her
under the circumstances. This information may include evidence of
an error in the criminal record; facts surrounding the conviction;

35:853
§ 46-39. Requests for employment verification and reference
procedure.
§ 46-40. Workplace accommodations and medical leave procedure.
appointment, promotion, or terms and conditions of employment of
any current or prospective officer or employee that will not have an
adverse effect on the individual's employment/potential employment
shall be held in closed session. Discussions by the governing body of
the City concerning demotion, termination, performance evaluation,
discipline, or terms and conditions of employment of any current or
prospective officer or employee that will have an adverse effect on the
individual's employment/potential employment shall be held in closed
session unless the individual requests in writing that the discussion be
held in open session. Such request must be granted.
B. Prior to the discussion by the governing body of the City concerning any
matter that may impose an adverse employment action, the City Clerk
shall notify the affected person of the meeting date, time and place
when and where the matters will be discussed and the person's right to
request that discussion occur in open session ("rice notice"). In the case
where public discussion is already planned, a rice notice does not have
to be provided. If the individual does not request that the discussion be
held in open session, the governing body of the City may, at its sole
discretion, invite the affected individual to attend the applicable portion
of the closed session.
C. In the event more than one person is affected by the discussion and one
of the affected persons does not request that the discussion be held in
open session, then the discussion shall be held in closed session.
A. Inquiries and written requests for references or employment
verification regarding a current or former employee must be referred to
the City Administrator. No City official, department head or employee
may issue a reference letter without the permission of the City
Administrator. Under no circumstances should any information be
released over the telephone.
B. In response to a request for information, the City Administrator or
designee will verify only an employee's name, dates of employment, job
title, department and final salary. No other data or information will be
furnished unless the City is required to release the information by law
or the employee or former employee authorizes the City, in writing, to
furnish this information and releases the City from liability.
A. The City has no light-duty policy. The City does have a temporarymodified-
duty policy for work-related incidents. Requests to
accommodate medical restrictions, both mental and physical, will be
handled on an individual basis in accordance with the federal
Americans with Disability Act (ADA) and the state Law Against
Discrimination (LAD). In the case of an employee breastfeeding her
§ 46-38 MILLVILLE CODE § 46-40
35:854
infant child, the accommodation shall include reasonable break time
each day to the employee and a suitable room or other location with
privacy, other than a toilet stall, in close proximity to work area for
the employee to express breast milk for the child. To be protected by
the ADA, one must have a disability, which is defined by the ADA as
a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more
major life activities, a person who has a history or record of such an
impairment, or a person who is perceived by others as having such an
impairment. The ADA does not specifically name all of the impairments
that are covered.
B. This procedure for handling requests for accommodating medical
restrictions will be managed by the City Administrator or designee. The
administrator will ensure that the appropriate commissioner,
department head, and the employee making the request are involved in
this process.
C. The federal Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and the state Family
Leave Act (FLA) authorize an employer to require a medical
certification from an employee requesting medical leave to curb
possible employee abuse of medical leave. Accordingly, the City
requires that a request for leave based on an employee's own serious
health condition, or the serious health condition of the employee's child,
parent or spouse be supported by a medical certification from the
appropriate health care provider which the employee shall file with the
City Administrator or designee. If the leave is foreseeable and at least
30 days' notice has been provided, the employee shall provide the
medical certification before the leave commences. In all other
circumstances, except emergencies, the medical certification shall be
provided within at least 15 calendar days following the request for
certification from the City Administrator.
D. Type of medical certification required.
(1) When an employee makes a request for an accommodation, the
request must be supported by a medical certification which lists all
of the medical restrictions that affects the employee's ability to
perform his or her job or duties and the projected duration of these
restrictions. The City Administrator or designee may provide a copy
of the employee's job description to the health care provider so that
the medical certification is accurate and comprehensive.
(2) When an employee makes a request for medical leave, the request
must be supported by a medical certification from a health care
provider which includes the following information:
(a) The medical facts that support the criteria of a serious medical
condition;
(b) The date the medical condition began and the expected
duration of the condition;
§ 46-40 LICENSING OF PROFESSIONS AND § 46-40
35:855
(c) Whether leave will be intermittent or on a reduced leave
schedule;
(d) The duration of the leave;
(e) If the serious medical condition is pregnancy or a chronic
condition, whether the patient is presently incapacitated and
the duration and frequency of episodes of incapacity; and
(f) If additional treatments are required, an estimate of the
probable number of such treatments.
(3) If the medical leave is requested because of the employee's own
serious health condition, the medical certification also must state
whether the employee:
(a) Is unable to perform work of any kind;
(b) Is unable to perform any one or more of the essential functions
of the job identifying each; or
(c) Must be absent from work for treatment.
(4) lithe medical leave is requested to care for a child, parent, or
spouse with a serious health condition, the medical certification
also most state whether the patient required assistance for basic
medical needs, personal needs, safety or transportation; or, if not,
whether the employee is needed to provide psychological comfort
to the patient or to assist in the patient's recovery.
(5) The United States Department of Labor has issued regulations and
a model certification form (Form WH-380) for implementing the
FMLA medical certification requirement. Under the statute, an
employer may not acquire the employee's medical records or a
summary medical report that contains any information beyond that
which is set out in the sample certification form.
E. Second opinions and disputes.
(1) Where the City Administrator or designee has reason to question
the original medical certification submitted on behalf of an
employee, the City Administrator may require the employee to
obtain a second certification from a different health care provider
chosen by the City at the City's expense. If there is a conflict
between the first and second medical opinions, the City
Administrator may require the employee to obtain a third
certification from a health care provider jointly approved by the
City Administrator and the employee. The City shall pay for the cost
of the third opinion. The third opinion will be final and binding on
both the City and the employee. The City Administrator and
employee must each act in good faith to reach an agreement on the
third provider. Failure to act in good faith will result in either the
§ 46-40 MILLVILLE CODE § 46-40
35:856
first opinion (City's failure), or second opinion (employee's failure)
binding the parties.
(2) Pending the ultimate resolution of an employee's entitlement to a
reasonable accommodation, the City is not obligated to provide a
reasonable accommodation under federal or state law.
(3) Pending the ultimate resolution of an employee's entitlement to
medical leave, the employee is provisionally entitled to all the
benefits of the federal and state laws including maintenance of
group health benefits. If the certifications ultimately establish that
an employee is not entitled to medical leave, the leave may be
treated as either paid or unpaid leave in accordance with the City's
existing leave policies.
F. Medical privacy.
(1) The City Administrator or designee must take reasonable steps to
safeguard an employee's medical records from any intentional or
unintentional use or disclosure that is in violation of the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the
regulations adopted pursuant thereto. All medical certifications,
recertifications or medical histories of employees or family
members of employees shall be maintained in a separate file from
the official personnel file and stored in a locked cabinet during
periods of the day and night when access is not required.
(2) The medical records must be maintained as confidential according
to privacy requirements and disclosure of the medical information
is restricted as follows:
(a) Managers and supervisors may be informed about necessary
restrictions on the work or duties of an employee and any
necessary accommodations;
(b) First aid and safety personnel may be informed when
appropriate if the employee's mental or physical condition
might require emergency treatment; and
(c) Government officials investigating compliance with federal or
state laws must be provided relevant information upon
request.
(3) Pursuant to United States Department of Labor regulations an
employer may not seek a broad listing of the dates on which the
employee was seen by the health care provider, or a description of
the nature of the treatment provided in most circumstances or
allow the disclosure of a diagnosis.
(4) The ADA and the FMLA authorizes employers to obtain medical
information about their employees for medical certifications and
fitness-for-duty examinations. HIPAA requires the City
§ 46-40 LICENSING OF PROFESSIONS AND § 46-40
35:857
Administrator to obtain a written authorization from the employee
to obtain the medical information for these purposes. The employee
is encouraged to cooperate with the City Administrator in providing
this authorization.
(5) If the City Administrator or designee questions the original medical
certification submitted by the employee, a health care provider
acting on behalf of the City may contact the employee's health care
provider to clarify and confirm the authenticity of the submitted
medical certification. However, this inquiry generally is limited to
those circumstances where the employee consents to such
contacts.
G. Subsequent recertifications. If the minimum duration of the employee's
incapacity specified on a medical certification is more than 30 days, the
City Administrator or designee may not request a recertification until
the minimum duration is past except as hereinafter provided in
Subsection G(1) through (3). If the leave is for a chronic medical
condition, a long-term medical condition, pregnancy, or a serious health
condition, the City Administrator or designee may request a
recertification not more often than every 30 days unless:
(1) Circumstances described by the previous certification have
changed significantly, for example, the duration of the absence has
changed, the frequency of the absences have changed or the
severity of the medical condition has changed.
(2) The City receives information casting doubt upon the employee's
stated reason for the absence.
(3) The employee requests a leave extension.
H. Return to work certification or examination.
(1) As a condition of returning to work after injury leave, medical
leave, or sick leave, the City Administrator or designee may require
a medical certification from the employee's health care provider
that the employee is fit for duty. The City Administrator or designee
also may require that an employee take a fitness-for-duty
examination. The policy regarding return to work certifications and
examinations must be uniformly applied and be based on objective
factors such as:
(a) The chronic nature of the medical condition;
(b) The duration of the absence from work;
(c) The serious nature of the medical condition; and
(d) The job title and job description of the employee.
(2) If the City Administrator or designee requires a fitness-for-duty
certification, the City Administrator or designee must provide the
§ 46-40 MILLVILLE CODE § 46-40
35:858
employee requesting leave with written notice of this requirement
at the time that the leave commences or immediately thereafter.
According to the U.S. Department of Labor regulations, the medical
certification need only be a simple statement that the employee is
able to return to work without restrictions.
(3) With the employee's permission, a health care provider engaged by
the City may contact the health care provider of the employee to
verify the employee's fitness to return to work. If this provision is
invoked, the City may not delay the employee's return to work
while this contact is being made.
I. Failure to satisfy medical certification requirements.
(1) If an employee fails to provide a medical certification which
accurately and comprehensively lists the medical restrictions, the
City shall not be obligated to provide a reasonable accommodation
pursuant to federal and state law.
(2) If an employee's medical leave is foreseeable. failure to provide a
timely medical certification shall result in the City Administrator
delaying the medical leave until the certification is provided. If the
medical leave is not foreseeable, an employee must provide the
certification within 15 calendar days after requested to do so by the
City Administrator, or as soon as reasonably possible under the
particular facts and circumstances. For example, a medical
emergency may prevent the employee from providing the medical
certification within the allotted time. However, if the employee fails
to provide the medical certification within a reasonable time, the
City Administrator shall delay the continuation of the leave. If an
employee never provides the requested medical certification, the
leave shall not be considered an authorized medical leave under
federal or state law.
J. Worker's compensation. Worker's compensation patients are exempt
from the federal HIPAA regulations and all disclosure and handling of
medical records defaults to the state Workers Compensation Act.
Worker's compensation patients do not have the right to restrict access
to their medical records based on HIPAA regulations, where those
medical records are required for handling any aspect of the worker's
compensation case or the injury leave connected with it. This includes
the right of the City to request a return-to-work certification or a
return-to-work examination to determine fitness for duty.

ARTICLE X
Discipline
§ 46-41. Systems of progressive discipline.
A. Employees are expected to devote themselves to the mission of the City,
meet all work standards, and conduct themselves appropriately. Failure
to do so can result in disciplinary action, up to and including discharge.
B. Employees shall be subject to disciplinary action according to the
nature of the offense. A system of progressive discipline shall be utilized
for second and subsequent offenses of a similar or greater gravity.
C. Any infraction of the City's work rules or poor work performance is
investigated. Employees may have another worker present as a witness
during a discussion with management officials who are investigating an
incident of misconduct or a possible serious rule violation. If the results
of the investigation demonstrate that discipline is appropriate, the
appointing authority shall decide on the appropriate penalty, based on
the progressive discipline criteria set forth below.
(1) Under normal circumstances, the City endorses a policy of
progressive discipline in which it attempts to provide employees
with notice of deficiencies and an opportunity to improve. It does,
however, retain the right to administer discipline in any manner it
sees fit. This policy does not modify the status of employees as
employees-at-will or in any way restrict the City's right to bypass
the disciplinary procedures suggested.
(2) The normal application of progressive discipline should be:
(a) Step 1. Counseling and verbal warning.
[1] Step 1 creates an opportunity for the department head to
schedule a meeting with an employee to bring attention to
the existing performance, conduct or attendance issue.
The department head should discuss with the employee
the nature of the problem or the violation of company
policies and procedures. The department head is expected
to clearly describe expectations and steps the employee
must take to improve performance or resolve the problem.
A corrective action plan must be implemented. Should the
department head consider the offense sufficiently serious
to warrant consideration by the City Administrator and/or
the commissioner of the department, the employee will be
so advised and a meeting arranged with the City
Administrator at the earliest possible date. All facts should
be detailed at this meeting and, if possible, a
determination shall be made at that time if disciplinary
action is warranted.
§ 46-41 LICENSING OF PROFESSIONS AND § 46-41
35:861
[2] This meeting should be documented to ensure that the
employee is clear on what the expectations are. The
department head shall prepare written documentation of a
Step 1 meeting. The written documentation shall be filed
with the Personnel Officer as well as with the
commissioner in charge of the department. The employee
will be asked to sign this document to demonstrate his or
her understanding of the issues and the corrective action.
(b) Step 2. Written warning.
[1] Although the City hopes that the employee will promptly
correct any performance, conduct or attendance issues
that were identified in Step 1, the City recognizes that this
may not always occur. The Step 2 written warning involves
more detailed documentation of the performance, conduct
or attendance issues and consequences. When a
department head determines that a written reprimand is
appropriate, the situation must be discussed with the City
Administrator or designee.
[2] During Step 2, the department head and City
Commissioner will meet with the employee to review any
additional incidents or information about the performance,
conduct or attendance issues as well as any prior relevant
corrective action plans. Management will outline the
consequences for the employee of his or her continued
failure to meet performance or conduct expectations.
[3] A formal performance improvement plan (PIP) requiring
the employee's immediate and sustained corrective action
will be issued within five business days of a Step 2
meeting. A warning outlining that the employee may be
subject to additional discipline up to and including
termination if immediate and sustained corrective action is
not taken may also be included in the written warning.
Supervisors/managers are to refer to the PIP document.
(c) Step 3. Suspension and final written warning.
[1] There may be performance, conduct or safety incidents so
problematic and harmful that the most effective action
may be the temporary removal of the employee from the
workplace. When immediate action is necessary to ensure
the safety of the employee or others, the department head
may suspend the employee pending the results of an
investigation as per the rules of the New Jersey Civil
Service Commission.
[2] However, when suspension is recommended it is the City
Administrator and/or the commissioner of the department
that will make the decision and may seek the advice of the
§ 46-41 MILLVILLE CODE § 46-41
35:862
City Attorney, if appropriate, prior to such an action taking
place. Suspensions that are recommended as part of the
normal progression of this progressive discipline policy
and procedure are subject to approval from the appointing
authority. Suspended employees may request a hearing
under the applicable grievance procedure and civil service
procedure.
[3] Depending on the seriousness of the infraction, the
employee may be suspended without pay in full-day
increments consistent with federal, state and local wageand-
hour employment laws. Nonexempt/hourly employees
may not substitute or use an accrued paid vacation or sick
day in lieu of the unpaid suspension. Due to Fair Labor
Standards Act (FLSA) compliance issues, unpaid
suspension of salaried/exempt employees is reserved for
serious workplace safety or conduct issues. The City
Attorney will provide guidance so that the discipline is
administered without jeopardizing the FLSA exemption
status.
[4] Pay may be restored to the employee if an investigation of
the incident or infraction absolves the employee.
(d) Step 4. Recommendation for termination of employment.
[1] The last and most serious step in the progressive discipline
procedure is a recommendation to terminate employment.
Generally, the City will try to exercise the progressive
nature of this policy by first providing warnings, a final
written warning or suspension from the workplace before
proceeding to a recommendation to terminate
employment. However, the City reserves the right to
combine and skip steps depending on the circumstances of
each situation and the nature of the offense. Furthermore,
employees may be terminated without prior notice or
disciplinary action.
[2] Whenever an employee is recommended for dismissal, the
City Administrator and/or the commissioner of the
department will make the decision only after seeking the
advice of the City Attorney. There must be a complete
review of the employee's personnel file and all other facts
to determine if there is sufficient cause for the dismissal.
Terminated employees may request a hearing under the
applicable grievance procedure and civil service
procedure. The City's recommendation to terminate
employment must be approved by the appointing
authority.
D. Performance and conduct issues not subject to progressive discipline.
§ 46-41 LICENSING OF PROFESSIONS AND § 46-41
35:863
§ 46-42. General causes.
(1) Behavior that is illegal is not subject to progressive discipline, and
such behavior may be reported to local law enforcement
authorities. Typically, the City should suspend the employee
immediately (with or without pay) and an investigation of the
incidents leading up to the suspension should be conducted to
determine if any further action, such as termination, should be
taken.
(2) Similarly, theft, substance abuse, intoxication, fighting, behavior
that puts staff, children, parents or the program at risk, and other
acts of violence at work may also not be subject to progressive
discipline and may be grounds for immediate termination.
E. Documentation. The employee will be provided copies of all progressive
discipline documentation, including all PIPs. The employee will be
asked to sign copies of this documentation attesting to his or her
receipt of the corrective action outlined in these documents.
F. All supervisory and managerial employees must follow the progressive
discipline policy set forth in this handbook.
G. Employees can appeal disciplinary actions pursuant to the rules of the
New Jersey Civil Service Commission, with notification to the City
Commissioner.
A. An employee may be subject to discipline for any one or more of the
following general causes:
(1) Falsification of public records, including attendance and other

In every case involving employee discipline, employees will be provided
with an opportunity to respond to charges either verbally or in writing.
§ 46-42 MILLVILLE CODE § 46-43
35:866
§ 46-44. Termination of employment.
An employee may be terminated depending upon the circumstances
including but not limited to the following offenses. All discharges will be
in accordance with federal and state laws, including the New Jersey Civil
Service Act as well as applicable collective bargaining agreements.
§ 46-45. Motor vehicle accidents.
C. In cases of employee misconduct, the City believes in corrective action
for the purpose of correcting undesirable behavior and preventing a

ARTICLE XI
Driver's License
§ 46-46. Work requirements; privacy
A. Any employee whose work requires the operation of City vehicles must
hold a valid New Jersey State driver's license.
B. All new employees who will be assigned work entailing the operating of
a City vehicle will be required to submit to a Department of Motor
Vehicles driving records check as a condition of employment. A report
indicating a suspended or revoked license status may be cause to deny
or terminate employment.
C. Periodic checks of employee's driver's licenses through visual and
formal Department of Motor Vehicles review checks shall be made by
department heads or division supervisors. Any employee who does not
hold a valid driver's license will not be allowed to operate a City vehicle

to drive on City business after refusing to authorize an MVR check or
after authorization to drive on City business has been suspended will be
subject to disciplinary action and/or termination as contained in the
City's personnel policies. Such drivers will be deemed to be acting
outside the scope of their employment and will not be covered by the
City's Defense and Indemnification Policies. In the event of a claim or
suit arising while driving on the City business under these
circumstances, the driver will not be indemnified.
D. Any employee performing work which requires the operation of a City
vehicle must notify the immediate supervisor in those cases where a
license is expired, suspended or revoked and/or who is unable to obtain
an occupational permit from the State Department of Licensing. An

immediately report such revocation or suspension to his/her supervisor
and continues to operate a City vehicle shall be subject to possible
termination.
E. Any information obtained by the City in accordance with this section
shall be used by the City only for carrying out its lawful functions and

ARTICLE XII
Education and Training
§ 46-47. Reimbursement for educational expenses.
The City values the experience that each employee brings to City
government. The City recognizes that continuing education is vital to the
growth of the individual and the changing dynamics of the public sector.
Collective bargaining agreements generally provide for reimbursement of
educational expenses when the course is relevant to City business and the
present or probable future duties of the employee. Courses must be outside
the employee's scheduled work hours.
§ 46-48. Training. [Amended 12-3-2019 by Ord. No. 51-2019]
A. The City recognizes that it has a responsibility to train its employees to
perform the work required of them. The City provides funds through its
budget so that employees can attend conferences, seminars, training
and certification classes which will benefit the employee and the City.
The department head may authorize said training after consultation
with the City Administrator and Commissioner in charge of the
department when funds are available and such training will benefit the
City. The department head, to the extent possible, shall authorize such
training on an equitable basis within the department consistent with
the mission of the department.
(1) All certification coursework will be required to be preapproved by
the department head and the City Administrator utilizing the
Training Request/Requirement Form.
(2) All efforts shall be made for continuing certification classes to be
taken on nonworking hours. In the event a certification course is
not available during nonworking hours, the employee shall utilize
their PTO time unless preapproved by the department head and
City Administrator utilizing the Training Request/Requirement
Form.
(3) All employees requesting to attend nonrequired conferences,
training, seminars and/or certification classes shall use their PTO
time to attend same. All nonrequired requests are to be made
utilizing the Training Request/Requirement Form.

be requested through the department head utilizing the Training
Request/Requirement Form.
(5) All Training Request/Requirement Forms must be executed by both
the department head and the City Administrator.
(6) The City, in conjunction with the City Attorney, will arrange for
employment practice seminars at least annually to train all
managerial and supervisory personnel. The City also will offer
§ 46-47 LICENSING OF PROFESSIONS AND § 46-48
35:871
§ 46-49. Cross-training.
Employees shall be cross-trained to the degree practical to provide for
coverage of work activities when employees arc absent due to sickness,
vacation or other reasons. Cross-training between departments is
encouraged to provide a manpower reserve according to workload levels.
If a department is in need of additional staff to work through an unusual
backlog of work, the department heads shall cooperate in providing
adequate manpower.
nonmandatory training to all other employees with special
emphasis on employee rights and protections under various federal
and state laws as well as the employment practices of the City.
Records shall be maintained in the official personnel files of all
employees trained under the procedure.
(7) Managerial and supervisory personnel also will update employees
periodically by department meetings and memos that should
address specific problems and concerns that may arise. Every
effort shall be made to encourage employee suggestions about
ways to avoid employer-employee disputes and violations of
employment rights.
B. Members of Public Safety and Fire will defer to their own policy on
training.

ARTICLE XIII
Communications Media Policy
§ 46-50. Purpose.
§ 46-51. Use of communication media.
A. Whether or not an employee chooses to create or participate in a blog,
wiki, online social network or any other form of online publishing or
discussion is his or her own decision. However, the City recognizes that
emerging online collaboration platforms are fundamentally changing
the way individuals and organizations communicate, and this policy is
designed to offer practical guidance for responsible, constructive
communications via social media channels for employees. The same
principles and guidelines that apply to the activities of employees in
general, as found in the City's policies and procedures, apply to
employee activities in social media channels and any other form of
online publishing.
B. The City's communication media are the property of the City and, as
such, are to be used for legitimate business purposes only. For purposes
of this communication media policy, "communication media" includes
all electronic media forms provided by the City, such as cell phones,
smart phones, computers, electronic tablets, access to the Internet,
voicemail, e-mail, and fax.
C. All data stored on and/or transmitted through communication media is
the property of the City. For purposes of this policy, "data" includes
electronically stored files, programs, tables, databases, audio and video
objects, spreadsheets, reports and printed or microfiche materials
which serve a City business purpose, regardless of who creates,
processes or maintains the data, or whether the data is processed
manually or through any of the City's mainframe or midrange systems
or workstations; servers, routers, gateways, bridges, hubs, switches
and other hardware components of the City's local- or wide-area
networks.
A. The City respects the individual privacy of its employees. However,
employee communications transmitted by the City's communication
media are not private to the individual. All communication media and all
communications and stored information transmitted, received, or
contained in or through such media may be monitored by the City. The
City reserves the absolute right to access, review, audit and disclose all
matters entered into, sent over or placed in storage in the City's
communication media. By using the City's equipment and/or
communication media, employees consent to have such use monitored
at any time, with or without notice, by City personnel. The existence of
passwords does not restrict or eliminate the City's ability or right to
access electronic communications. However, the City cannot require
the employee to provide his/her password to his/her personal account.
§ 46-50 LICENSING OF PROFESSIONS AND § 46-51
35:873
B. All e-mail, voicemail and Internet messages (including any technologybased
messaging) are official documents subject to the provisions of the
Open Public Records Act (N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1 et seq.). If employees
conduct work-related business on their personal e-mails, cell phones, or
other personal communication media, it is also subject to the provisions
of the Open Public Records Act. Employees of the City are required to
use the assigned municipal e-mail account for all City business and
correspondence. The use of private e-mail accounts for any City
business or during business hours is strictly prohibited. The City
reserves the right to remove employee e-mail access including, but not
limited to, family medical leave.
C. Employees can only use the City's communication media for legitimate
business purposes. Employees are restricted from accessing or using
the company's communication media for personal purposes during
company time on company equipment without prior authorization from
the Administration to do so. Employees may not use the City's
communication media in any way that is defamatory, obscene, or
harassing or in violation of any City rules or policy. Examples of
forbidden transmissions or downloads include sexually explicit
messages; unwelcome propositions; ethnic or racial slurs; or any other
message that can be construed to be harassment or disparaging to
others based on their actual or perceived age, race, religion, sex, sexual
orientation, gender identity or expression, genetic information,
disability, national origin, ethnicity, citizenship, marital status or any
other legally recognized protected basis under federal, state or local,
laws, regulations or ordinances. Further, discriminatory remarks,
harassment, bullying, threats of violence and similar behavior that is
not tolerated in the workplace are also not acceptable through
communication media, whether same is performed on the City's
equipment or on the employee's own personal communication media.
D. All employees who have been granted access to electronically stored
data must use a logon ID assigned by the City. Certain data, or
applications that process data, may require additional security
measures as determined by the City. Employees must not share their
passwords, and each employee is responsible for all activity that occurs
in connection with his or her password. Information security is
necessary to protect the City's information (data and software) from
accidental or intentional unauthorized disclosure, modification, or loss.
Information security is managed under guidelines dealing with
identification, authentication, authorization, production environment,
and ability to audit. All employees should be familiar with such security
measures adopted by the City.
E. All employees may access only data for which the City has given
permission. All employees must take appropriate actions to ensure that
City data is protected from unauthorized access, use or distribution
consistent with these policies. Employees may not access or retrieve
any information technology resource or store information other than
§ 46-51 MILLVILLE CODE § 46-51
35:874
where authorized. All City data must be stored centrally as required by
the City. This provides greater security and ensures backup of all City
data is performed.
F. Employees must not disable antivirus and other implemented security
software for any reason, in order to minimize the risk of introducing
computer viruses into the City's computing environment.
G. Employees may not install, remove, or modify any hardware device,
software application, program code, either active or passive, or a
portion thereof, without the express written permission from the City.
Employees may not upload, download, or otherwise transmit
commercial software or any copyrighted materials belonging to parties
outside of the City or licensed to the City. Employees shall observe the
copyright and licensing restrictions of all software applications and
shall not copy software from internal or external sources unless legally
authorized. Workstation settings and configurations and network
settings must not be modified by unauthorized employees. Internet
security settings (where applicable) must not be changed. The
foregoing includes but is not limited to the systems network ID (or

H. Social media and its uses in government and daily life are expanding
each year, however, only those employees directly authorized by City
Administrator may engage in social media activity during work time
through the use of the City's communication media as it directly relates
to their work and it is in compliance with this policy.
I. Employees must not reveal or publicize confidential City information.
Confidential proprietary or sensitive information may be disseminated
only to individuals with a need and a right to know and where there is
sufficient assurance that appropriate security of such information will
be maintained. Such information includes, but is not limited to, the
transmittal of personnel information such as medical records or related
information. In law enforcement operations, confidential, proprietary or
sensitive information also includes criminal history information,
confidential informant identification, and intelligence and tactical
operations files.
J. No City employee shall post internal working documents to social
media sites. This includes, but is not limited to, screenshots of
computer stations, pictures of monitors and/or actual documents
themselves without the prior approval of the City Administrator; in
addition, photographs, pictures or digital images of any crime scenes,
traffic crashes. arrestees, detainees, people or job-related incidents or
occurrences taken with the City's communication media to any person,
entity, business or media or Internet outlet, whether on or off duty,
without the express written permission of the City Administrator.
Except in emergency situations, employees are prohibited from taking
digital images or photographs with media and equipment not owned by
the City. For purposes of this section, an "emergency situation" involves
§ 46-51 LICENSING OF PROFESSIONS AND § 46-51
35:875
a sudden and unforeseen combination of circumstances or the resulting
state that calls for immediate action, assistance or relief, and may
include accidents, crimes and flights from accidents or crimes and the
employee does riot have access to the City's communication media. If
such situation occurs, the employee agrees that any images belong to
the City and agrees to release the image to the City and ensure its
permanent deletion from media device upon direction from the City.
K. No media advertisement, electronic bulletin board posting, or any other
communication accessible via the Internet about the City or on behalf of
the City, whether through the use of the City's communication media or
otherwise, may be issued unless it has first been approved by the City
Administrator. Under no circumstances may information of a
confidential, sensitive or otherwise proprietary nature be placed or
posted on the Internet or otherwise disclosed to anyone outside the
City. Such authorized communications may result in disciplinary action.
L. Because authorized postings placed on the Internet through use of the
City's communication media will display on the City's return address,
any information posted on the Internet must reflect and adhere to all of
the City's standards and policies.
M. All users are personally accountable for messages that they originate or
forward using the City's communication media. Misrepresenting,
obscuring, suppressing, or replacing a user's identity on any
communication media is prohibited. "Spoofing" (constructing electronic
communication so that it appears to be from someone else without a
legitimate authorized purpose and authorized by the City
Administrator) is prohibited.
N. Employees must respect the laws regarding copyrights, trademarks,
rights of the public and the City and other third-party rights. Any use of
the City's name, logos. service marks or trademarks outside the course
of the employee's employment, without the express consent of the City,
is strictly prohibited. To minimize the risk of a copyright violation,
employees should provide references to the source(s) of information
used and cite copyrighted works identified in online communications.
O. Use of Internet. The City provides Internet access to its employees in
order to make available a vast array of information resources and to
allow participation in and access to increasing county and state
resources.
(1) Employees must comply with all policies adopted by the City
including but not limited to policies regarding prohibition of
discrimination and harassment and all applicable federal, state and
local laws, including laws governing the transmission and
dissemination of information while accessing the Internet.
(2) Employees who are using Internet may not:
§ 46-51 MILLVILLE CODE § 46-51
35:876
§ 46-52. Social media.
The City fully respects the legal rights of the employees, including their
rights under the National Labor Relations Board to engage in concerted
and protected activities, and any part of this policy which interferes with or
"chills" the legal rights of the employees will not be enforced. In general,
what you do on your own time is your affair. However, activities in or outside
of work that affect job performance, the performance of others, or the City's
business interests are a proper focus for the City's policy. To the extent that
employees use social media outside of their employment and, in so doing.
employees identify themselves as the City's employees, or if they discuss
matters related to the City on a social media site, employees must:
(a) Use the network to make unauthorized entry into other
computational, informational or communication services or
resources;
(b) Distribute unsolicited advertising;
(c) Invade the privacy of others;
(d) Make any attempt to damage computer equipment or software;
(e) Engage in any activity that is harassing or defamatory;
(f) Use the Internet for any illegal activity, including violation of
copyright or other rights of third parties, or in a manner
inconsistent with the Township's tax-exempt status or its
proper operation; and/or
(g) Download unauthorized software. fonts, templates or scripts.
(3) The City reserves the right to monitor the employee's Internet
usage. In addition, the City has the right to restrict access to
specific types of prohibited content through the use of a content
filtering system.
A. Employees should not represent themselves as a spokesperson of the
City. Nothing in these policies are designed to interfere with, restrain or
prevent employee communications regarding wages, hours or other
terms and conditions of employment. City employees have the right to
engage in or refrain from such activities. Further, discriminatory
remarks, harassment, bullying, threats of violence and similar behavior
that is not tolerated in the workplace are also not acceptable through
communication media, whether same is performed on the City's
equipment or on the employee's own personal communication media.
B. Employees that maintain personal web pages and web sites, including
but not limited to Facebook, YouTube, Myspace, Twitter etc., shall not
post information on such sites that would constitute a violation of the
personnel policies of the City if expressed or published using any other
medium or in any other manner. The posting of words, phrases,
§ 46-51 LICENSING OF PROFESSIONS AND § 46-52
35:877
§ 46-53. Employee rights of communication.
Nothing in these policies is designed to interfere with, restrain or prevent
employee communications regarding wages, hours or other terms and
conditions of employment. City employees have the right to engage in or
refrain from such activities.
§ 46-54. Electronic surveillance prohibited.
photographs, images or any kind of information on a personal web site
may be grounds for the imposition of disciplinary action against the
employee if the words, phrases, photographs, images or information
adversely reflects on the employee's fitness for duty or constitutes a
violation of the personnel policies of the City. However, nothing in
this social media policy prevents employees from using his/her own
personal communication media during the employee's non-working
hours to engage or participate in protected concerted activities
pursuant to the National Labor Relations Act. Protected concerted
activities include when an employee addresses group concerns with the
employer; forms, joins or helps a labor organization; initiates, induces
or prepares for group action; or speaks on behalf of or represents
other employees. Nevertheless, employees are encouraged to resolve
workplace grievances internally by discussing issues with their
supervisor and/or the Administration, and are asked to refrain from
posting comments or materials on communication media that can be
viewed as malicious, obscene, threatening, intimidating, or that could
create a hostile work environment on the basis of race, sex, disability,
religion or any other status protected by law if the employee chooses to
address their grievances using communication media.
C. Maintain the confidentiality of the City's private or confidential
information. Do not post internal reports, policies, procedures or other
internal business-related confidential communications.
D. Not create a link from your blog, website or other social networking site
to the City's website without identifying yourself as a City associate.
E. Express only your personal opinions. Never represent yourself as a
spokesperson for the City. If the City is a subject of the content you are
creating, be clear and open about the fact that you are an associate and
make it clear that your views do not represent those of the City, fellow
associates or people working on behalf of the City. If you do publish a
blog or post online related to the work you do or subjects associated
with the City, make it clear that you are not speaking on behalf of the
City.
A. The unauthorized electronic surveillance of employees is disruptive to
employee morale and inconsistent with the respectful treatment
required of our employees. For this reason, no employee may record the
conversation of another employee or the public without his or her full
knowledge and consent.
§ 46-52 MILLVILLE CODE § 46-54
35:878
§ 46-55. through § 46-60. (Reserved)
B. No employee may record, by any means, a conversation with another
employee or member of the public unless all of the following criteria are
met:
(1) A legitimate purpose for the recording.
(2) A recording device in plain view
(3) Written authorization from the supervisor of the employee who
wishes to record the conversation, or member of the public who is
being recorded.
C. Surreptitious recordings are strictly prohibited unless authorized in
writing by legal counsel. A violation of this provision may result in
disciplinary action, including termination.

believes to be violation of these policies, or who is involved in the
investigation of the complaint, will not be subject to reprisal or
retaliation. The City prohibits any form of retaliation against filed
complaints or providing information in support of a complaint.

immediately. The report and investigation of allegations of retaliation
will follow the procedures set forth in this policy. Any person found to
have retaliated against an individual for reporting discriminatory
harassment or for participating in an investigation of allegations of
such conduct will be subject to an appropriate disciplinary penalty.
B. The City will, to the maximum extent feasible, maintain the
confidentiality of such complaints on a need-to-know basis. However,
investigation of such complaints may require disclosure to the accused
party and other witnesses in order to gather pertinent facts.
C. Only in the event that an employee's complaint is unreasonable, without
merit, and appears to have been motivated by bad faith, will the City
consider disciplining an employee who has filed a complaint.
A. An employee who believes that he or she has been subjected to or is
aware of wrongdoing in the workplace shall submit a complaint to the
City Administrator within 20 days from the date of the alleged incident.

peril. If you see or hear a commotion or disturbance near your work
station, do not try to intercede or see what is happening. All threats of
(or actual) violence, both direct and indirect, should also be reported

allegations of harassment or any other wrongdoing against a
commissioner, the commissioner who is the subject of the complaint
shall recuse himself or herself from any involvement in the selection or
designation of the person to do the investigation. The Affirmative Action
Officer may be designated by the Board of Commissioners to investigate
the complaint.
C. The investigator shall review the complaint and conduct interviews of
the complainant, other parties involved in the incident having relevant
knowledge, individual(s) accused of wrongdoing, and if necessary, with
individuals who may have observed the incident or conduct. The
investigator also may conduct interviews of all persons who may have
knowledge of relevant information about the matter. Every effort shall
be made to complete the investigation within a reasonable period of
time from the date when the complaint was submitted to the City
Administrator.

the complaint is justified and substantiated, the investigator shall
submit any recommendations he or she has in the report. In the event,
however, the complaint contains allegations of harassment or any other
wrongdoing against a commissioner, then the report shall instead be
submitted to the City Administrator, the City Attorney and the Board
of Commissioners sitting in closed session. In all cases said report

ARTICLE XV
Employment Protection
§ 46-65. Policy.
The City maintains a policy of complying with federal and state laws which
provide employment protection for public employees and applicants seeking
employment with the City. All officers and employees of the City shall act
in accordance with the provisions of the following federal and state laws
which provide employment protection in the workplace because a person
falls within a protected class or which prohibits retaliatory actions in public
employment.
§ 46-66. Antidiscrimination Policy.
A. The City is committed to the principle of equal employment opportunity
and antidiscrimination pursuant to Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act
as amended by the Equal Opportunity Act of 1972 and the New Jersey
Law Against Discrimination98 as amended by the New Jersey Pregnant
Worker's Fairness Act (LAD) and Diane B. Allen Equal Pay Act ("Equal
Pay Act").
B. Under no circumstances will the City discriminate on the basis of sex,
race, creed, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, age, marital or
political status, affectional or sexual orientation, domestic partnership
status, civil union status, atypical heredity, cellular or blood trait,
genetic information, disability (including AIDS or HIV infection),
liability for service in the United States Armed Forces, gender identity
or expression, and/or any other characteristic protected by law.
C. Decisions regarding the hiring, promotion, transfer, demotion or
termination are based solely on the qualifications and performance of
the employee or prospective employee. If any employee or prospective
employee feels he/she has been treated unfairly, he/she has the right to
address his/her concern with his/her supervisor, or if he/she prefers his/
her department head, City Administrator, or Personnel Administrator.
D. The Equal Pay Act prohibits pay disparities based upon characteristics
protected by the LAD and makes it an unlawful employment practice for
an employer to pay any of its employees who is a member of a protected
class at a rate of compensation, including benefits, which is less than
the rate paid by the employer to employees who are not members of the
protected class for substantially similar work, when viewed as a
composite of skill, effort and responsibility. The Equal Pay Act further
provides that, other than instances where a seniority or merit-based
system is utilized, employers may only pay employees a different rate of
compensation for substantially similar work if the employer can show
that:
98.Editor's Note: See N.J.S.A. 10:5-1 et seq.
§ 46-65 LICENSING OF PROFESSIONS AND § 46-66
35:885
(1) The pay differential is based on one or more legitimate, bona fide
factors, such as training, education or experience, or the quantity
or quality of production;
(2) The bona fide factors are not based on, and do not perpetuate a
differential in compensation based on sex, or any other protected
characteristic;
(3) Each of the bona fide factors are applied reasonably;
(4) One or more of the bona fide factors account for the entire wage
differential; and
(5) The bona fide factors are job-related with respect to the position in
question and based on legitimate business necessities. However, a
bona fide factor based on business necessity would not apply if it is
demonstrated that there are alternative business practices that
would serve the same business purpose without producing the
wage differential.
E. An employer who is paying a rate of compensation in violation of the
Equal Pay Act cannot reduce the rate of compensation of any employee
in order to comply with the Equal Pay Act.
F. The Equal Pay Act also extends LAD's anti-retaliation provisions to
equal pay claims. Specifically, the Equal Pay Act prohibits retaliation
against employees for "requesting from, discussing with, or disclosing
to, any other employee or former employee of the employer, a lawyer
from whom the employee seeks legal advice, or any government
agency" equity pay information. Such equity pay information includes
job title, occupational category, rate of compensation, including
benefits, and the gender, race, ethnicity, military status, or national
origin of the employee or any other employee or former employee,
regardless of whether the employee receives a response.
G. The Equal Pay Act also includes new reporting requirements to the
Division of Labor and Workforce Development. Any employer,
regardless of the location of the employer, who enters into a contract
with a public body to provide qualifying services to the public body shall
provide a report to the Commissioner of Labor and Workforce
Development, information regarding the compensation and hours
worked by employees categorized by gender, race, job title ethnicity,
occupational and job category, and total compensation of every
employee of the employer employed in the state in connection with the
contract. The employer shall provide the commissioner, throughout the
duration of the contract or contracts, with an update to the report each
time there is a significant change in any of the information that the
employer is required to report, or other significant change in
employment status, including, but not limited to, medical leave of 12
weeks or more, hiring, termination for any reason, a change in parttime
or full-time status, or a change in "employee" or "contractor"
status. Data regarding compensation and hours worked by employees
§ 46-66 MILLVILLE CODE § 46-66
35:886
§ 46-67. Anti-Disability Discrimination Policy: New Jersey Pregnant
Worker's Fairness Act.
shall be reported in the form by pay bands to be established by
regulation promulgated by the commissioner. The commissioner may
establish a standard presumption for the number of hours worked by a
full-time employee or by a part-time employee for whom an employer
does not track actual hours worked. An employer shall provide a report
for each establishment of the employer.
A. In compliance with the Americans with Disability Act, the ADA
Amendments Act and the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination, as
amended by the New Jersey Pregnant Worker's Fairness Act (LAD), the
City does not discriminate based on disability, pregnancy, pregnancyrelated
medical condition, childbirth or breastfeeding. The City will
endeavor to make every work environment accessible for individuals
with disabilities, and all future construction and renovation of facilities
will be in accordance with applicable barrier-free federal and state
regulations and the Americans with Disabilities Act accessibility
guidelines, as well as the ADA Amendments Act. The ADA makes it
unlawful to discriminate in all employment practices such as:
(1) Recruitment.
(2) Pay.
(3) Hiring.
(4) Firing.
(5) Promotion.
(6) Job assignments.
(7) Training.
(8) Leave.
(9) Lay off.
(10) Benefits.
(11) All other employment-related activities.
B. It is the policy of the City to comply with all relevant and applicable
provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act, the ADA Amendments
Act and the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination. The City will not
discriminate against any employee or job applicant with respect to any
terms, conditions, or privileges of employment on the basis of a known
or perceived disability, pregnancy, childbirth or pregnancy-related
medical condition. The City will also make reasonable accommodations
to known physical or mental limitations of all employees and applicants
with disabilities, provided that the individual is otherwise qualified to
§ 46-66 LICENSING OF PROFESSIONS AND § 46-67
35:887
safely perform the essential functions of the job and also provided that
the accommodation does not impose undue hardship on the City.
C. Reasonable accommodation.
(1) The City Administrator or designee shall engage in an interactive
dialogue with disabled/pregnant employees and prospective
disabled/pregnant employees to identify reasonable
accommodations or their respective physician. In the case of an
employee breastfeeding her infant child, the accommodation shall
include reasonable break time each day to the employee and a
suitable room or other location with privacy, other than a toilet
stall, in close proximity to work area for the employee to express
breast milk for the child. All decisions with regard to reasonable
accommodation shall be made by the City Administrator.
Reasonable accommodation is any change or adjustment to a job or
work environment that permits a qualified applicant or employee
with a disability to participate in the job application process, to
perform the essential functions of a job, or to enjoy benefits and
privileges of employment equal to those enjoyed by employees
without disabilities. For example, reasonable accommodation may
include:
(a) Acquiring or modifying equipment or devices;
(b) Job restructuring;
(c) Part-time or modified work schedules;
(d) Reassignment to a vacant position;
(e) Adjusting or modifying examinations, training materials or
policies;
(f) Providing readers and interpreters; and
(g) Making the workplace readily accessible to and usable by
people with disabilities.
(2) Employees who are assigned to a new position as a reasonable
accommodation will receive the salary for their new position. The
Americans with Disabilities Act and the New Jersey Law Against
Discrimination does not require the City to offer permanent light
duty, relocate essential job functions, or provide personal use items
such as eyeglasses, hearing aids, wheelchairs, etc.
D. Employees should also offer assistance, to the extent possible, to any
member of the public who requests or needs an accommodation when
visiting City facilities. Any questions concerning proper assistance
should be directed to the City Administrator.
E. The ADA and the New Jersey I.aw Against Discrimination prohibits an
employer from retaliating against an applicant or employee for
§ 46-67 MILLVILLE CODE § 46-67
35:888
§ 46-68. Anti-harassment general policy.
asserting his or her rights under the ADA and the New Jersey Law
Against Discrimination. The act also makes it unlawful to discriminate
against an applicant or employee, whether disabled or not, because
of the individual's family, business, social or other relationship or
association with an individual with a disability.
A. It is the City's policy to prohibit harassment of an employee by another
employee, management representative, supplier, volunteer, or business
invitee on the basis of actual or perceived sex, race, creed, color,
religion, national origin, ancestry, age, marital or political status,
affectional or sexual orientation, domestic partnership status, civil
union status, atypical heredity, cellular or blood trait, genetic
information, disability (including AIDS or HIV infection), gender
identity or expression, liability for service in the United States Armed
Forces, and/or any other characteristic protected by law. Harassment of
nonemployees by our employees is also prohibited. While it is not easy
to define precisely what harassment is, it includes slurs, epithets,
threats, derogatory comments, unwelcome jokes, teasing, caricatures
or representations of persons using electronically or physically altered
photos, drawings or images, and other similar verbal, written, printed
or physical conduct.
B. If an employee is witness to or believes to have experienced
harassment, immediate notification of the supervisor or other
appropriate person should take place. See the employee complaint
policy.
C. Harassment of any employees, in connection with their work, by
nonemployees may also be a violation of this policy. Any employee who
experiences harassment by a nonemployee, or who observes
harassment of an employee by a nonemployee should report such
harassment to the supervisor. Appropriate action will be taken against
any nonemployee.
D. Notification of appropriate personnel of any harassment problem is
essential to the success of this policy and the City generally. The City
cannot resolve a harassment problem unless it knows about it.
Therefore, it is the responsibility of all employees to bring those kinds
of problems to the attention of the appropriate officials so that steps are
taken to correct them. An individual who reports incidents, which, in
good faith, he or she believes to be violation of this policy, or who is
involved in the investigation of discriminatory harassment, will not be
subject to reprisal or retaliation. Retaliation is a serious violation of this
policy and should be reported immediately. The report and investigation
of allegations of retaliation will follow the procedures set forth in this
policy. Any person found to have retaliated against an individual for
reporting discriminatory harassment or for participating in an
investigation of allegations of such conduct will be subject to an
appropriate disciplinary penalty.
§ 46-67 LICENSING OF PROFESSIONS AND § 46-68
35:889
§ 46-69. Anti-sexual-harassment policy.
E. Violation of this harassment policy will subject employees to
disciplinary action, up to and including immediate discharge.
F. Discriminatory harassment defined.
(1) For purposes of this policy, discriminatory harassment is defined as
verbal or physical conduct that denigrates or shows hostility or
aversion toward an individual because of his or her race, color,
gender, age, religion, national origin, disability, veteran status or
any other characteristic protected by law, and that:
(a) Creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work
environment; or
(b) Unreasonably interferes with an individual's work
performance.
(2) Some examples of such harassment are: using epithets or slurs;
mocking, ridiculing or mimicking another's culture, accent,
appearance or customs; threatening, intimidating or engaging in
hostile or offensive acts based on an individual's race, color,
gender, religion, national origin, disability, veteran status or any
other characteristic protected by law; displaying on walls, bulletin
boards, or elsewhere in the City, or circulating in the workplace,
written or graphic material that denigrates or shows hostility
toward a person or group because of an individual's race, color,
gender, age, religion, national origin, disability, veteran status or
any other characteristic protected by law. The above list of
examples is not intended to be all-inclusive.
A. It is the City's policy to prohibit sexual harassment of an employee by
another employee, management representative, supplier, volunteer, or
business invitee. The City prohibits sexual harassment from occurring
in the workplace or at any other location at which a City-sponsored
activity takes place. Sexual harassment of nonemployees by the City's
employees is also prohibited. The purpose of this policy is not to
regulate personal morality or to encroach upon one's personal life, but
to demonstrate a strong commitment to maintaining a workplace free of
sexual harassment.
B. Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors and other
verbal, physical or visual conduct of a sexual nature constitute
harassment when:
(1) Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a
term or condition of an individual's employment;
(2) Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used
as the basis for an employment decision affecting the individual; or
§ 46-68 MILLVILLE CODE § 46-69
35:890
(3) Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering
with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating,
hostile or offensive work environment.
C. Regarding unwelcome sexual advances toward nonemployees, requests
for sexual favors and other verbal, physical or visual conduct of a sexual
nature constitute harassment when:
(1) Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly in
exchange for a benefit;
(2) Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used
as the basis for a decision affecting the individual; or
(3) Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering
with an individual's activities or creating an intimidating, hostile or
offensive environment.
D. Sexual harassment may include threatening or taking adverse
employment action, such as discharge or demotion, if sexual favors are
not granted, unwanted sexual advances; offering employment benefits
in exchange for sexual favors; visual conduct (leering, making sexual
gestures, displaying of sexually suggestive objects or pictures, cartoons
or posters); verbal sexual advances, propositions or requests; verbal
abuse of a sexual nature; graphic verbal commentaries about an
individual's body; sexually degrading words used to describe an
individual; suggestive or obscene letters, caricatures or
representations of persons using electronically or physically altered
photos, drawings, or images; notes or invitations; and/or physical
conduct (touching, assault, impeding or blocking movements). The
above list of examples is not intended to be all-inclusive.
E. If an employee is witness to or believes that the employee has
experienced sexual harassment, he/she must immediately notify his/her
supervisor or other appropriate person. See the employee complaint
policy. An individual who reports incidents, which, in good faith, he or
she believes to be violation of this policy, or who is involved in the
investigation of discriminatory harassment, will not be subject to
reprisal or retaliation. Retaliation is a serious violation of this policy and
should be reported immediately. The report and investigation of
allegations of retaliation will follow the procedures set forth in this
policy. Any person found to have retaliated against an individual for
reporting discriminatory harassment or for participating in an
investigation of allegations of such conduct will be subject to an
appropriate disciplinary penalty.
F. Harassment of City employees, in connection with their work, by
nonemployees may also be a violation of this policy. Any employee who
experiences harassment by a nonemployee or who observes
harassment of an employee by a nonemployee should report such
harassment to his/her supervisor. Appropriate action will be taken
against any nonemployee.
§ 46-69 LICENSING OF PROFESSIONS AND § 46-69
35:891
§ 46-70. Conscientious Employee Protection Act (CEPA) complaints.
G. Notification by the employee to appropriate personnel of any
harassment problem is essential to the success of this policy and the
City generally. The City cannot resolve a harassment problem unless it
is reported. Therefore, it is the responsibility of all employees to bring
those kinds of problems to the attention of management so that the
steps necessary to correct them can be taken.
H. Violation of this sexual harassment policy will subject employees to
disciplinary action up to and including immediate discharge.
I. Consensual romantic and/or sexual relationships between a manager or
supervisor, and nonmanagers or supervisors, or between an employee
with supervisory authority and his or her subordinate, will compromise
the City's ability to enforce its policy against sexual harassment.
Consequently, if such relationships arise they will be considered
carefully by the City, and appropriate action will be taken. Such action
may include a change in the responsibilities of the individuals involved
in such relationships or transfer of location within the facility to
diminish or eliminate the supervisory relationship and workplace
contact that may exist. Any manager or supervisory employee involved
in such a relationship is required to report the relationship to the City
Administrator.
A. Employees have the right under the Conscientious Employee Protection
Act (CEPA) to complain about any activity, policy or practice that the
employees reasonably believe is in violation of a law, rule, or regulation
promulgated pursuant to law without fear of retaliation or reprisal. This
right shall be communicated to all employees in an annual letter
outlining the specific employee complaint procedure and in a posted
notice. A written acknowledgment that the employee received, read,
and understood this letter will be included in the employee's official
personnel file. The annual notice shall be in English and Spanish and
must contain the name of the person who is designated to receive
written notification of policies or practices that might violate CEPA.
This right will also be communicated in the employee handbook. All
complaints will be taken seriously and promptly investigated.
B. Retaliatory action prohibited.
(1) The City shall not take any retaliatory action or tolerate any
reprisal against an employee for any of the following:
(a) Disclosing or threatening to disclose to a supervisor,
department head, the City Administrator, other official or to a
public body, as defined in the Conscientious Employee
Protection Act (N.J.S.A. 34:19-1 et seq.) an activity, policy or
practice that the employee reasonably believes is in violation of
a law, a rule or regulation promulgated pursuant to law.
§ 46-69 MILLVILLE CODE § 46-70
35:892
(b) Providing information to, or testifying before any public body
conducting an investigation, hearing, an inquiry into any
violation of law, or a rule or regulation promulgated pursuant
to law.
(c) Objecting to, or refusing to participate in any activity, policy or
practice that the employee reasonably believes is a violation of
a law, rule or regulation promulgated pursuant to law; is
fraudulent or criminal; or is incompatible with a clear public
policy mandate concerning the public health, safety, or
welfare. Before an employee can disclose or threaten to
disclose an unlawful activity, policy or practice to a public body,
the employee must serve written notification of the activity,
policy or practice upon the employer, and allow the employer a
reasonable opportunity to take corrective action. An employee
shall serve such written notification upon the following
individual: City Administrator.
(2) "Retaliatory action" is broadly defined under CEPA as "discharge,
suspension or demotion of an employee, or other adverse
employment action taken against an employee in the terms and
conditions of employment." Simply put, this means any adverse
action affecting the employee's ability to work. Termination and
discipline are easy to understand. The last part of the definition is a
wide-encompassing provision that allows adverse actions to be
decided on a case-by-case analysis depending on multiple factors
that can make up an adverse action.
C. In accordance with the statute, the employee must bring the violation to
the attention of the City Administrator, or other person designated by
the City.
(1) However, disclosure is not required where:
(a) The employee is reasonably certain that the violation is known
to one or more officials;
(b) Where the employee reasonably fears physical harm; or
(c) The situation is emergent in nature.
(2) Employees are encouraged to complain in writing using the
employee complaint form. See employee complaint policy.
D. Under the law, the employee must give the City a reasonable
opportunity to correct the activity, policy or practice. The
administration of whistleblower complaints is not subject to the
limitations in the Grievance Policy.

A. Employees are entitled to personal days off each calendar year in
accordance with the collective bargaining agreement and the rules and

year in anticipation of continued employment. Administrative leave that
is not used during the calendar year shall be forfeited. An employee

C. Overtime work shall be kept to a minimum, and except in cases of
emergency, must be authorized in advance by the department head.
Department heads shall rotate overtime assignments on an equitable
basis among those qualified to perform the necessary work. It is the
policy of the City to approve compensatory time off rather than to pay
cash overtime compensation whenever possible, unless the collective
bargaining agreement provides otherwise.
A. Employees are entitled to convention leave in accordance with N.J.A.C.
4A:6-1.13. Requests for convention leave must be approved by the

N.J.S.A. 38:23-2 or of the New Jersey Civil Service Association shall,
upon request, be granted a leave of absence with pay of up to five days
in any calendar year to attend the State and National Convention. The

and from the convention, provided that such leave shall be for no more
than seven days. Proof of attendance shall be submitted to the
commissioner in charge of the department after the convention, and
filed in the office of the City Administrator.
§ 46-74 MILLVILLE CODE § 46-75
35:896
§ 46-76. Elected office leave.
Employees are entitled to elective office leave in accordance with N.J.S.A.
40A:9-7.2 and N.J.A.C. 4A:6-1.17. Requests for such leave must be made in
writing to the City Clerk and approved by the commissioner in charge of the
department. The request for leave must be submitted within a reasonable
time before the time when the leave is to be taken.
§ 46-77. Family Medical Leave Act.
D. Other convention leave. Except as may be mandated by state law,
request for a leave of absence with pay to attend a convention dealing
with subject matter directly related to the employee's official duties
may be approved in the sole discretion of the commissioner in charge of
the department. If the leave of absence is granted, proof of attendance
shall be submitted to the commissioner in charge of the department
after the convention and filed in the office of the City Administrator.
A. Employees may be eligible for an unpaid family and medical leave
under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act ("FMLA"). Employees
also may be eligible for family and/or medical leave pursuant to the
New Jersey Family Leave Act99 ("FLA"). In order to be eligible for such
leave, employees must have one year of service with the City, and at
least 1,000 hours of work (for New Jersey leave) and 1,250 hours of
work (for federal leave) during the previous 12 months and be
employed at a worksite where 50 or more employees are employed by
the employer within 75 miles of the worksite (for federal leave). Eligible
employees may receive up to 12 weeks of leave per year (FMLA) and up
to 26 weeks of leave in any twelve-month period in compliance with the
expansion of FMLA under The Support for Injured Service Members Act
of 2007, or 12 weeks every 24 months (FLA).
B. During the leave period, the employee's health benefits will be
continued on the same conditions as coverage would have been
provided had the employee been employed continuously during the
entire leave. The employee will not continue to accrue vacation, sick or
personal days for the period of the leave. The employee will receive
seniority credit for the time that the employee has been on leave under
this section. At the conclusion of the leave period, an eligible employee
is entitled to reinstatement to the position the employee previously held
or to an equivalent one with the same terms and benefits that existed
prior to the exercise of leave.
C. Upon written notice, eligible employees are entitled to a family or
medical leave for up to 12 weeks to care for a newly born or adopted
child or a seriously ill immediate family member, including a civil union
partner, or for the employee's own serious health condition that makes
the employee unable to perform the functions of the employee's
position. A serious health condition is defined as a condition that
99.Editors Note: See N.J.S.A. 34:11b-1 et seq.
§ 46-75 LICENSING OF PROFESSIONS AND § 46-77
35:897
requires inpatient care at a hospital, hospice or residential medical care
facility, including any period of incapacity or any subsequent treatment
in connection with such inpatient care or a condition that requires
continuing care by a licensed health care provider. This policy covers
illnesses of a serious and long-term nature, resulting in recurring or
lengthy absences. Generally, a chronic or long-term health condition,
which, if left untreated, would result in a period of incapacity of more
than three days, would be considered a serious health condition.
Employees with questions about what illnesses are covered under this
FMLA policy are encouraged to consult with the Personnel Officer.
Eligible employees who take leave under this policy must use all
accrued available sick, vacation and/or personal days during the leave.
The use of accrued time will not extend the leave period. After
exhausting accrued time, the employee will no longer be paid for the
remainder of the leave.
D. The period of leave must be supported by a physician's certificate. The
employee must respond to such a request within 15 days or provide a
reasonable explanation for the delay. Failure to provide certification
may result in a denial of continuation of leave. Medical certification may
be provided by using the medical certification form through the New
Jersey Department of Labor. Request for a medical certificate must be
made in writing as part of the employer response to employee request
for leave. Certification of the serious health condition shall include the
date when the condition began, its expected duration and a brief
statement of treatment. For medical leave for the employee's own
medical condition, the certification must also include a statement that
the employee is unable to perform work of any kind or a statement that
the employee is unable to perform the essential functions of the
employee's position. For a family member who is seriously ill, the
certification must include a statement that the patient, the family
member, requires assistance and that the employee's presence would
be beneficial or desirable. If the employee plans to take intermittent
leave or work a reduced schedule, the certification must also include
dates and the duration of treatment as well as a statement of medical
necessity for taking intermittent leave or working a reduced schedule.
(1) The City has the right to ask for a second opinion if it has reason to
doubt the certification. The City will pay for the employee to get a
certification from a second doctor, which the City will select. If
necessary to resolve a conflict between the original certification
and the second opinion, the City will require the opinion of a third
doctor. The City and the employee will mutually select the third
doctor, and the City will pay for the opinion. This third opinion will
be considered final. The employee will be provisionally entitled to
leave and benefits under the FMLA pending the second and/or third
opinion.
(2) An extension past 12 weeks can be requested, but a medical
verification explaining the need for such an extension must be
§ 46-77 MILLVILLE CODE § 46-77
35:898
submitted prior to the expiration of the leave. The City reserves the
right to deny any request for extended leave.
(3) Additional information concerning the family leave policy and
eligibility requirements are available from the City's Personnel
Officer.
E. Commencing July 1, 2009, family temporary disability ("FTD")
payments for up to six weeks in a twelve-month period will become
available for eligible employees who are caring for a seriously ill
immediate family member who is incapable of self-care or care of a
newborn or adopted child. To be eligible, the employee must have
worked at least 20 weeks at minimum wage within the last 52 weeks or
earned 1,000 times the minimum wage. The weekly benefit is 2/3 of
weekly compensation up to a maximum of $524 per week. (This amount
is subject to change.) FTD will run concurrently with FMLA and/or FLA
leaves, and there is a one-week waiting period. Employees shall also be
required to use accrued sick, vacation or personal leave for up to two
weeks.
F. Employees taking paid family leave in connection with a family
member's serious health condition may take leave intermittently or
consecutively. Intermittent leave is not available for the care of a
newborn or adopted child. Intermittent leave may be taken in
increments necessary to address the circumstances that precipitated
the need for leave. An employee seeking intermittent paid family leave
is required to provide the City with 15 days' notice unless an emergency
or other unforeseen circumstance precludes prior notice. The employee
seeking intermittent leave shall make a reasonable attempt to schedule
leave in a nondisruptive manner. Employees requesting such leave
shall, if possible, provide the City with a regular schedule of days for
intermittent leave.
G. Employees may also be eligible for an unpaid leave for up to 26
workweeks in a year to care for a family member on active duty in the
military or a covered veteran (A covered veteran is an individual who
was discharged or released under conditions other than a dishonorable
discharge at any time during the five-year period prior to the first date
the eligible employee takes FMLA leave to care for the covered
veteran.) with a serious injury or illness incurred in the line of duty on
active duty for which the service member is undergoing medical
treatment, recuperation, or therapy, is otherwise in outpatient status,
or is otherwise on the temporary disability retired list, or up to 12
weeks in a year for a qualifying exigency. A qualifying exigency occurs
when a military member is called to covered active duty (requires
deployment to a foreign country) and a close member of his/her family
must attend official ceremonies or family support or assistance
meetings, there is a short-notice deployment, a close member of his/her
family must attend to child-care matters or attend to financial and/or
legal matters or counseling. A "serious injury or illness" means an injury
or illness incurred by a covered service member in the line of duty on
§ 46-77 LICENSING OF PROFESSIONS AND § 46-77
35:899
active duty that may render the service member medically unfit to
perform the duties of his or her office, grade, rank, or rating. Employees
requesting this type of service-member FMLA leave must provide
documentation of the family member's or next-of-kin's injury, recovery
or need for care. This documentation may be a copy of the military
medical information, orders for treatment, or other official armed
forces communication pertaining to the service member's injury or
illness incurred on active military duty that renders the member
medically unfit to perform his or her military duties.
H. Serious injury or illness.
(1) A "serious injury or illness" also means an injury or illness that was
incurred by the covered veteran in the line of duty on active duty in
the armed forces or that existed before the veteran's active duty
and was aggravated by service in the line of duty on active duty,
and that is either:
(a) A continuation of a serious injury or illness that was incurred
or aggravated when the veteran was a member of the armed
forces and rendered the service member unable to perform the
duties of the service member's office, grade, rank, or rating;
(b) A physical or mental condition for which the veteran has
received a United States Department of Veterans Affairs
service-related disability rating (VASRD) of 50% or greater,
and the need for military caregiver leave is related to that
condition;
(c) A physical or mental condition that substantially impairs the
veteran's ability to work because of a disability or disabilities
related to military service, or would do so absent treatment; or
(d) An injury that is the basis for the veteran's enrollment in the
Department of Veterans Affairs Program of Comprehensive
Assistance for Family Caregivers.
(2) Any one of these definitions meets the FMLA's definition of a
serious injury or illness for a covered veteran regardless of whether
the injury or illness manifested before or after the individual
became a veteran.
I. Upon an employer's request, an employee must provide a copy of the
covered military member's active duty orders to support the request for
qualifying exigency leave. In addition, upon an employer's request,
certification for qualifying exigency leave must be supported by a
certification containing the following information:
(1) A statement or description of appropriate facts regarding the
qualifying exigency for which leave is needed;
§ 46-77 MILLVILLE CODE § 46-77
35:900
(2) The approximate date on which the qualifying exigency
commenced or will commence;
(3) Beginning and end dates for leave to be taken for a single
continuous period of time;
(4) An estimate of the frequency and duration of the qualifying
exigency if leave is needed on a reduced-schedule basis or
intermittently; and
(5) If the qualifying exigency requires meeting with a third party, the
contact information for the third party and a description of the
purpose of the meeting.
J. Eligible employees may also take leave to care for a military member's
parent who is incapable of self-care when the care is necessitated by
the member's covered active duty. Such care may include arranging for
alternative care, providing care on an immediate basis, admitting or
transferring the parent to a care facility, or attending meetings with
staff at a care facility.
K. Employees who request qualifying exigency leave to spend time with a
military member on rest and recuperation may take up to a maximum of
15 calendar days. Upon an employer's request, an employee must
provide a copy of the military member's rest and recuperation leave
orders or other documentation issued by the military setting forth the
dates of the military member's leave.
L. Domestic violence leave. The New Jersey Security and Financial
Entitlement Act,100 also known as the "NJ SAFE Act" provides
protection for employees and their family members who have been the
victims of domestic violence or sexual assault. Employees are entitled
to 20 days of unpaid protected leave from work to:
(1) Seek medical attention for physical or psychological injuries;
(2) Obtain services from a victim services organization; pursue
psychological or other counseling;
(3) Participate in safety planning for temporary or permanent
relocation;
(4) Seek legal assistance to ensure health and safety of the employee
or the employee's relative; or
(5) Attend, participate in, or prepare for a criminal or civil court
proceeding relating to an incident of domestic or sexual violence.
M. To be eligible for the leave, an employee must meet the following
criteria:
100. Editors Note: See N.J.S.A. 34:11c-1 et seq.

35:901
§ 46-78. Gubernatorial appointment leave.
Employees are entitled to gubernatorial appointment leave without pay in
accordance with N.J.A.C. 4A:6-1.12. Requests for such leave must be made
in writing to the City Administrator and approved by the commissioner in
charge of the department. The request for leave must be submitted within a
reasonable time before the time when the leave is to be taken.
§ 46-79. Holiday leave.
(1) The employee or his or her child, parent, spouse or domestic
partner must be a victim of domestic violence or a sexually violent
offense;
(2) The employee must have worked for the employer for at least 12
months and for at least 1,000 hours during the twelve-month period
immediately preceding the requested leave; and
(3) The twenty-day leave must be taken within one year of the
qualifying event.
N. Employees may take leave on an intermittent basis, but such leave
cannot be shorter than one full day. To the extent the leave is
foreseeable, employees must provide advance notice. In addition,
employees seeking leave must provide proof that they qualify for the
leave. Such proof may include a restraining order, letter from a
prosecutor, proof of conviction, medical documentation or a
certification from an agency or professional involved in assisting the
employee.
O. In certain circumstances, the basis for the leave may also qualify under
the federal Family and Medical Leave Act and/or the New Jersey Family
Leave Act.101 If so, the City will treat the leave concurrently with the
leave under those statutes. Employees may be required to use accrued
paid vacation leave, personal time or sick leave concurrently.
P. The City shall protect the privacy of employees who seek leave by
holding the request for leave, the leave itself or the failure to return to
work "in the strictest confidence."
Q. The City shall not retaliate, harass or discriminate against any
employee exercising his/her right to take the leave provided by this
policy.
A. Employees are entitled to holiday leave in accordance with the
collective bargaining agreement and the rules and regulations
applicable to them. Any department head who finds it necessary to do
so may require some or all employees of his or her department to report
for work on any legal holiday.
101. Editor's Note: See N.J.S.A. 34:11b-1 et seq.
§ 46-77 MILLVILLE CODE § 46-79
35:902
§ 46-80. Injury leave.
§ 46-81. Jury duty leave.
B. Holiday leave shall not be paid for holidays occurring before the first
day of employment with the City, nor for holidays occurring after the
last day of employment with the City. An employee ceases employment
with the City upon death, retirement, resignation or termination.
Holiday leave shall not be paid for holidays occurring during a leave of
absence without pay or during a suspension without pay.
C. If an employee is in a "no pay" status the day before or the day after a
holiday, the employee is not eligible to receive holiday pay.
A. An employee who is disabled due to a compensable work-connected
injury or illness shall be entitled to a leave of absence with pay for the
period of time that he or she is unable to return to work and is eligible
for workers' compensation temporary disability benefits subject to the
maximum time authorized in the collective bargaining agreement and
permitted by state law. The examining physician designated and
compensated by the City must certify to the disability and the injury or
illness as required by state law.
B. The City provides workers' compensation insurance as required by
state law for employees sustaining injuries or illnesses arising out of

service be postponed. Of course, employees are expected to report for
work whenever the court schedule permits.

A. The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act
("USERRA"), 38 U.S.C. § 4301 et seq., applies to all employers,
regardless of size, including foreign employers doing business in the
United States. USERRA requires all employers to grant a leave of
absence for up to five years to any person who is absent from a job
because of uniformed service. USERRA applies to leaves of absence for
all categories of military duty except state active duty or Governor call
ups, which are protected under N.J.S.A. 38:23C-20a. USERRA only
requires the leave of absence; pay for military members is discretionary
with each public and private entity. Requests for military leave must be
approved by the commissioner in charge of the department. Such
requests shall be accompanied with the documents required by state
regulations which include the military orders received by the employee.
B. N.J.S.A. 38A:4-4 provides for a leave of absence with full pay to a public
employee who is a state reservist as follows: for the entire time while
engaged in state active duty; and for up to 90 workdays each calendar
year while engaged in active duty for training or federal active duty.
Thereafter, the leave of absence shall be without pay but without loss of
time.
C. N.J.S.A. 38:23-1 provides for a leave of absence with full pay to a public
employee who is a federal reservist for up to 30 workdays each
calendar year when engaged in any period of federal active duty.

time.
D. N.J.S.A. 38:23-3 authorizes a municipality, but does not require it, to
provide a leave of absence with differential pay to a public employee
during the time that the employee is engaged in a branch of the military
or naval service of the national or state government. If the leave of
absence is authorized by the governing body of the City, the public
employee must provide copies of his or her military pay stubs or other
written documentation which provides clear and convincing proof of
the military pay he or she will receive or is receiving. This
documentation shall be provided to the City Administrator and to the
chief executive officer of the department where the employee works
before any differential pay will be paid by the City.
E. N.J.S.A. 38:23-4 provides for a leave of absence without pay to a public
employee who enters military service in time of war or emergency, or
for any period of training, or pursuant to any selective service system.
The employee shall be entitled to the leave for the period of the service
and three months after honorable discharge. If the employee is
incapacitated, an extended period is authorized by state law.

bargaining agreement or other rule or regulation, pursuant to New
Jersey's Sick Leave Law, effective October 29, 2018, or on employee's
date of hire, whichever is later, the City shall provide an employee with
one hour of sick time for every 30 hours worked.
B. Annual paid sick leave is credited at the beginning of each calendar
year in anticipation of continued employment. Continued employment
shall mean employment without interruption due to death, resignation,
retirement or removal. Paid sick leave shall not accrue after the last day
of employment with the City, nor shall it accrue during a leave of
absence without pay or a suspension without pay. Unused sick leave
shall accumulate from year to year without limit.
C. Sick leave may be used by employees who are unable to work because
of personal illness or injury, exposure to contagious disease, care for a
reasonable period of time for a seriously ill member of the employee's
immediate family, or death in the employee's immediate family for a
reasonable period of time. Employees may use paid sick time for the
diagnosis, care, treatment of, or recovery from, a mental or physical
illness, injury or other adverse health condition, or for preventative
medical care of: 1) the employee; 2) the employee's family member;
and/or 3) an individual whose close association with the employee is the
equivalent of a family relationship. The state's Sick Leave Law also
covers:
(1) Care for covered individuals that were the victim of domestic
violence (under limited circumstances);
(2) Time needed because of a closure of the employee's workplace or
the school or place of care of a child of the employee by order of a
public official due to an epidemic or other public health emergency;
and

child's mental health condition or disability.
D. The department head shall certify to the City Administrator any sick
leave allowance made in each month.
E. A department head, or the commissioner in charge of the department,
may require proof of illness or injury when there is a reason to believe
that an employee is abusing sick leave, an employee has been absent on
sick leave for five or more consecutive workdays, or an employee has
been absent on sick leave for an aggregate of more than 15 days in a
twelve-month period. Proof of illness or injury shall consist of a note,
letter or report from the treating doctor which indicates the nature of

The commissioner in charge of the department may grant a permanent
employee a leave of absence without pay for a period not to exceed one
year. Requests for such leave must be submitted at least 30 days in advance
of the time set for taking it and shall not be approved for a period longer
the medical condition, the date of first treatment, and the date when
the employee is expected to return to work. The City reserves the right
to obtain a medical report from the treating physician, at its expense,
which indicates the nature and extent of the employee's medical
condition, the prognosis for partial or complete recovery, the
limitations, if any, on the performance of employment duties, and any
other information relevant to employment. The employee shall
cooperate in securing the report.
F. When an illness is of a chronic or recurring nature causing occasional
absences of one day or less, one proof of illness shall be required for
every six-month period. The proof of illness must specify the nature of
the illness and that it is likely to cause periodic absences from
employment.
G. In the case of sick leave due to exposure to a contagious disease, death
in the employee's immediate family, or the care of a seriously ill
member of the employee's immediate family, reasonable proof may be
required by the department head or the commissioner in charge of the
department.
H. The department head, or the commissioner in charge of the
department, may require an employee who has been on sick leave to be
examined by a physician designated and compensated by the City as a
condition of the employee's continuation of sick leave or return to work.
Such an examination shall establish whether the employee is capable of
performing his or her work duties and whether return to employment
would jeopardize the health of the employee or that of other employees.
I. Failure to follow the sick leave notification and verification procedures
shall result in a denial of sick leave for the specific absence from work,
may be considered an abuse of sick leave, and may constitute cause for
disciplinary action.
(1) An employee reporting off from work requesting sick leave shall
notify his or her department head, or their designee, before the
scheduled workday begins.
(2) An employee requesting sick leave must have accumulated sick
leave on the books of the City to be eligible for authorized sick
leave.
(3) When an employee fails to comply with the sick leave notification
and verification procedures, the absence from work shall constitute
an unauthorized leave of absence without pay.
§ 46-83 MILLVILLE CODE § 46-84

than six months at one time. The commissioner may extend the leave for an
additional six months or any portion thereof. The commissioner may permit
an employee to return from a leave of absence without pay prior to its
conclusion. Such leave will be granted only after the employee has used
all of his or her accumulated administrative leave, compensatory leave,
sick leave and vacation leave in the case of illness, or all of his or her
accumulated administrative leave, compensatory leave and vacation leave
if the requested leave is for other than illness. If such leave is related to
an illness, medical verification is required to request such leave and any
extensions thereto. During any leave of absence without pay, in excess of 29
days, administrative leave, holiday leave, sick leave, vacation leave, annual
clothing allowance and annual clothing maintenance allowance shall be

in advance of the time when the leave is to be taken.

year in anticipation of continued employment based on the employee's
years of continuous service. Continued employment shall mean
employment without actual interruption due to death, resignation,
retirement or removal. Paid vacation leave shall not accrue after the
last day of employment with the City, nor shall it accrue during a leave
of absence without pay or a suspension without pay.

such as administrative leave, compensatory leave or vacation leave
for an employee when business necessity requires those job
responsibilities to be performed by another employee who will receive

her designee, from requiring an employee who is on a paid leave of
absence to report for work to perform essential services which are

paid leave of absence stops at the time when the employee reports for
work and does not resume until the essential services are completed.

A. Nothing contained herein shall be interpreted to guarantee temporary
modified duty for any public employee who is eligible for such duty. The
chief executive officer of each department of government has the
authority to assign personnel and reassign personnel within the
department in accordance with his or her judgment as to what work is
necessary to maintain the efficient operation of the department and
who is best qualified to perform the available jobs within the

ARTICLE XXVIII
Transitional Duty
§ 46-120. Purpose.
To establish guidelines and procedures for giving transitional duty
assignments to an employee who is recovering from a work-related injury
or illness and has been given temporary physical work restrictions by an
authorized medical provider.
§ 46-121. Delegation of responsibility.
Throughout this procedure, the designation "Transitional Duty Coordinator"
has been used to signify the individual with the ultimate decision-making
authority in this process. As with many other personnel processes, the
Transitional Duty Coordinator may delegate this responsibility to a designee
as deemed appropriate.
§ 46-122. General information regarding transitional duty
assignments.
A. Transitional duty is an opportunity, provided at the sole discretion of
the Transitional Duty Coordinator, for an employee to remain in the
workforce while recuperating from a work-related injury or illness. The
program benefits both the employee and employer by saving employee
leave, accelerating recovery and reducing claim costs. If an employee
with work-related restrictions refuses transitional duty without a
verifiable medical cause, the employee's benefits under workers'
compensation may be adversely affected.
B. The Transitional Duty Coordinator should evaluate the work
restrictions of employees injured on the job to determine if the
employee can be assigned transitional duty. The work restrictions must
be in written form from the authorized medical provider and must
clearly describe the physical restrictions and limitations related to
performing transitional job duties. If the Transitional Duty Coordinator
has questions or needs clarification, he or she should discuss the
restrictions with the authorized medical provider and the Claims
Administrator before making the transitional duty assignment.
C. The Transitional Duty Coordinator's decision to make and/or continue a
transitional duty assignment should take into consideration the
employee's work restrictions including employee's knowledge, skills,
abilities, safety of the motoring public, other employees and the general
public and the availability of work benefitting the department.
D. A transitional duty assignment is temporary in nature. It may be a
combination of various unrelated job tasks. The assignment also does
not need to be for a full forty-hour workweek. Depending upon the
nature of the injury or illness, transitional duty may last from one week
to two months.
§ 46-120 LICENSING OF PROFESSIONS AND § 46-122
35:935
§ 46-123. Making transitional duty assignments.
E. The Transitional Duty Coordinator should make transitional duty
assignments with the goal of returning the employee to full duty as soon
as possible. This may require the addition of or adjustments to duties
included in the assignment as the employee's medical condition
progresses. When a department is unable to assign suitable work, other
departments may be contacted to determine if a suitable work
assignment can be identified.
F. The authorized medical provider must submit a status report to the
Transitional Duty Coordinator and Claims Administrator after each
employee visit; noncompliance with this process should be reported to
the Claims Administrator immediately. The Transitional Duty
Coordinator should review the transitional duty assignment after each
visit with an authorized medical provider and, if advantageous for the
employee and the department, allow the assignment to continue until
maximum medical improvement (MMI) is reached or until the employee
is released to full duty.
G. Employees will be paid in accordance with applicable policies, salary
ordinances and bargaining agreements while on transitional duty. No
overtime will be authorized unless the employee is expressly given
permission by the department head. All overtime assignments must be
approved in advance by the department head and must be in
accordance with the transitional duty assignment set forth by the
authorized medical provider.
H. Where appropriate, the employee's time card should be maintained by
the department to which the employee is regularly assigned.
I. The Transitional Duty Coordinator should notify upper management
and the Claims Administrator if he or she becomes aware that an
injured employee may have permanent medical restrictions. Permanent
restrictions should be handled differently from temporary restrictions.
Permanent restrictions may also be considered as a qualified disability
under the ADA.
A. Making transitional duty assignments is the joint responsibility of the
employer, Claims Administrator and managed care provider. The Claims
Administrator and authorized medical provider should continually
evaluate the availability of transitional duty for all temporarily disabled
employees.
B. The Transitional Duty Coordinator reviews the authorized medical
provider's work restrictions and selects transitional duty assignments
that are of benefit to the department and appear to be within those
restrictions. This may include assignments requiring travel to alternate
work locations. A transitional duty assignment does not have to be a full
forty-hour workweek. The following skills may be necessary to
participate in a transitional duty assignment:
§ 46-122 MILLVILLE CODE § 46-123
35:936
§ 46-124. Communications.
(1) Sit or stand for some tasks.
(2) Understand and follow directions and procedures.
(3) Accept direction and function cooperatively.
(4) Communicate effectively and coherently using telephone, or when
initiating or responding to verbal communications.
(5) Read and comprehend documents.
(6) Exercise independent judgment.
(7) When the Transitional Duty Coordinator and the supervisor
determine that transitional duty is within the employee's work
restrictions, the Transitional Duty Coordinator provides a letter to
the employee offering the transitional duty assignment. The letter
must describe the work to be performed, state the transitional duty
assignment will be reviewed periodically and state that the
assignment is temporary. This letter should be handed to the
employee upon arrival to work the following day. If the employee
does not return to work the next day, the employee should sign and
date the letter noting receipt. If it is necessary to mail the letter to
the employee, it should be mailed certified/return receipt with a
copy placed in the personnel file.
(8) If the employee agrees to the transitional duty assignment, he or
she should sign the transitional duty offer and return it to the
Transitional Duty Coordinator. If the employee declines the
transitional duty assignment, the employee should code his or her
time in accordance with applicable policies, salary ordinances and
bargaining agreements. If an employee with work-related
restrictions declines a transitional duty assignment without a
verified medical cause, the Transitional Duty Coordinator should
immediately notify the Claims Administrator. Refusal of a
transitional duty assignment may adversely affect the employee's
workers' compensation benefits.
C. If the employee's objection to a transitional duty assignment is based on
a disagreement with the authorized medical provider regarding workrelated
restrictions, the Transitional Duty Coordinator should discuss
the case with the authorized medical provider and the Claims
Administrator.
A. The Transitional Duty Coordinator shall maintain the confidentiality of
all medical information related to the transitional duty assignment.
Only individuals with an administrative "need to know" shall be
included in discussions on transitional duty. This includes department
heads and human resources representatives. Where applicable, the
Transitional Duty Coordinator shall limit discussions with the

do not present a business-like appearance. Hair, sideburns, moustaches and
beards must be clean, combed, and neatly trimmed. Employees violating

A central aspect of the Privacy Rule is the principle of minimum necessary
use and disclosure. The City must make reasonable efforts to use, disclose
and request only the minimum amount of protected health information
needed to accomplish the intended purpose of the use, disclosure or
request. The minimum necessary requirement is not applicable in any of the
following circumstances:

must be through the office of the City Administrator. No employees of
the City shall have access to protected health information except as
required to perform their official duties.
B. Any employee having access to protected health information shall be
responsible to maintain the confidentiality of it. No employee shall
discuss protected health information of another employee with anyone
except those persons who are authorized to receive the information and
then only in the context of performing their official duties.
C. Managers and supervisors shall not question employees about their
medical conditions. Instead, all such inquiries and matters shall be
referred to the City Administrator for appropriate processing in
accordance with the policies and procedures of the City and applicable
federal law, rules and regulations.

Workplace Violence Policy
§ 46-145. Purpose.
The City is committed to preventing workplace violence and to maintaining
a safe work environment. Given the increasing violence in society in
general, the City has adopted the guidelines set forth in this policy to deal
with intimidation, harassment, or other threats of (or actual) violence that
may occur during business hours or on its premises. Violent acts or threats
made by an employee against another person or property are justification
for disciplinary action and prosecution. This includes any violence or threats
made on City property, at City events or under circumstances that may
negatively affect the City's ability to conduct business.
§ 46-146. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the following
meanings unless the context indicates otherwise:
ABET  To knowingly give substantial encouragement, by action or
inaction, to another person engaged in conduct prohibited by this policy.
AID  To knowingly give substantial assistance, by action or inaction, to
another person engaged in conduct prohibited by this policy.
§ 46-147. Prohibited conduct.
A. It shall be unlawful for any employee to engage in the following conduct
while on City property or while on City business:
(1) Aggressive or hostile behavior that subjects another person to a
reasonable fear of injury or subjects another person to emotional
distress;
(2) Aggressive or hostile behavior that causes physical injury to
another person;
(3) Committing acts of domestic violence;
(4) Intentionally damaging the property of the City or another
employee;
(5) Making threatening remarks; and
(6) Possession of a weapon except with the authority of the Chief of
Police.
B. It shall be unlawful for any employee or any person doing business with
the City to aid or abet the doing of any acts prohibited under this policy.
C. All employees, including supervisors and temporary employees, should
be treated with courtesy and respect at all times. Employees are
expected to refrain from fighting, horseplay, or other conduct that may
§ 46-145 LICENSING OF PROFESSIONS AND § 46-147
35:955
be dangerous to others. Firearms, weapons, and other dangerous or
hazardous devices or substances are prohibited from the premises of
the City without proper authorization.
D. Conduct that threatens, intimidates, or coerces another employee, a
customer, or a member of the public at any time, including off-duty
periods, will not be tolerated. This prohibition includes all acts of
harassment, including harassment that is based on an individual's sex,
race, age, or any characteristic protected by federal, state, or local law.
E. All threats of (or actual) violence, both direct and indirect, should be
reported as soon as possible to your immediate supervisor. This
includes threats by employees, as well as threats by customers,
vendors, solicitors, or other members of the public. When reporting a
threat of violence, you should be as specific and detailed as possible.
F. All suspicious individuals or activities should also be reported as soon
as possible to a supervisor. Do not place yourself in peril. If you see or
hear a commotion or disturbance near your work station, do not try to
intercede or see what is happening.
G. The City will promptly and thoroughly investigate all reports of threats
of (or actual) violence and of suspicious individuals or activities. The
identity of the individual making a report will be protected as much as
is practical. In order to maintain workplace safety and the integrity of
its investigation, the City may suspend employees, either with or
without pay, pending investigation.
H. Anyone determined to be responsible for threats of (or actual) violence
or other conduct that is in violation of these guidelines will be subject to
prompt disciplinary action up to and including termination of
employment.
I. The City encourages employees to bring their disputes or differences
with other employees to the attention of their supervisors or the City
Administrator before the situation escalates into potential violence. The
City is eager to assist in the resolution of employee disputes and will not
discipline employees for raising such concerns.

§ 50-7. Policy established.
For the convenience of those persons and entities which utilize the services
of off-duty law enforcement officers of the Millville Police Department and

hereby establishes a policy regarding the use of said officers.
§ 50-8. Escrow accounts.
A. Members of the Police Department shall be permitted to accept policerelated
employment for private employers or school districts only
during off-duty hours and at such time as will not interfere with the
efficient performance of regularly scheduled or emergency duty for the
City.
B. Any person or entity wishing to employ off-duty police shall first obtain
the approval of the Chief of Police, which approval shall be granted if in
the opinion of the Chief, such employment would not be inconsistent
with the efficient functioning and good reputation of the Police
Department, and would not unreasonably endanger or threaten the
safety of the officer or officers who are to perform the work.
A. Any person or entity requesting the services of an off-duty law
enforcement officer in the Millville Police Department shall estimate
the number of hours such law enforcement services are required, which
estimate shall be approved in writing by the Chief of Police, and shall
establish an escrow account with the Chief Financial Officer of the City
by depositing an amount sufficient to cover the rates of compensation
and administrative fees set forth in § 50-10 for the total estimated hours
of service.
B. Prior to posting any request for services of off-duty law enforcement
officers, the Chief of Police or his designee shall verify that the balance
in the escrow account of the person or entity requesting services is
sufficient to cover the compensation and fees for the number of hours
specified in the request for services. The Chief of Police shall not post a
request for services from any person or entity unless all fees and
compensation required in the manner described above have been
deposited with the Chief Financial Officer. No officer shall provide any
such services for more hours than are specified in the request for
services.
C. In the event that funds in such an escrow account should become
depleted, services of off-duty law enforcement officers shall cease and
requests for further or future services shall not be performed or posted
until additional funds have been deposited in the escrow account in the
manner prescribed above.

the City shall be treated as an employee of the City provided, however,
that wages earned for outside employment shall not be applied toward the
pension benefits of law enforcement officers so employed, nor shall hours
worked for outside employment be considered in any way compensable as
overtime.
§ 50-10. Rates of compensation; administrative fee; payment for
services. [Amended 5-1-2018 by Ord. No. 25-2018]
D. The person or entity requesting such services shall be responsible for

§ 52-70. Declaration of findings and policy.
§ 52-71. Definitions.
The following words and terms, when used in this article, shall have the
following meanings, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. Terms
not defined in this article have the same meaning as those defined in
N.J.A.C. 7:29.
CONSTRUCTION  Any site preparation, assembly, erection, repair,
alteration or similar action of buildings or structures.
dBC  The sound level as measured using the "C" weighting network with
a sound level meter meeting the standards set forth in ANSI S1.4-1983 or
its successors. The unit of reporting is dB(C). The "C" weighting network is
more sensitive to low frequencies than is the "A" weighting network.
DEMOLITION  Any dismantling, destruction or removal of buildings,
structures, or roadways.
DEPARTMENT  The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection.
EMERGENCY WORK  Any work or action necessary at the site of an
emergency to restore or deliver essential services, including, but not limited
to, repairing water, gas, electricity, telephone, sewer facilities, or public
transportation facilities, removing fallen trees on public rights-of-way,
dredging navigational waterways, or abating life-threatening conditions or
a state of emergency declared by a governing agency.
IMPULSIVE SOUND  Either a single pressure peak or a single burst
(multiple pressure peaks) that has a duration of less than one second.
A. Whereas excessive sound is a serious hazard to the public health,
welfare, safety, and the quality of life; and whereas a substantial body of
science and technology exists by which excessive sound may be
substantially abated; and whereas the people have a right to, and
should be ensured of, an environment free from excessive sound.
B. Now therefore, it is the policy of the City of Millville to prevent
excessive sound that may jeopardize the health, welfare, or safety of the
citizens or degrade the quality of life.
C. This article shall apply to the control of sound originating from sources
within the City of Millville.

a penalty is sought.
D. If the violation is deemed by the Noise Control Officer or Noise Control
Investigator to be a minor violation (as defined in § 52-71 of this article)
an NOV shall be issued to the violator.
(1) The document shall indicate that the purpose of the NOV is
intended to serve as a notice to warn the responsible party/violator
of the violation conditions in order to provide them with an
opportunity to voluntarily investigate the matter and voluntarily
take corrective action to address the identified violation.
(2) The NOV shall identify the time period (up to 90 days), pursuant to
the Grace Period Law, N.J.S.A. 13:1D-125 et seq., where the
responsible party's/violator's voluntary action can prevent a formal
enforcement action with penalties issued by the municipality. It
shall be noted that the NOV does not constitute a formal
enforcement action, a final agency action or a final legal
determination that a violation has occurred. Therefore, the NOV
may not be appealed or contested.
E. If the violation is deemed by the Noise Control Officer or Noise Control
Investigator to be a nonminor violation, the violator shall be notified
that if the violation is not immediately corrected, an NOPA with a civil
penalty of not more than the maximum penalty allowed pursuant to
N.J.S.A. 40:49-5, which is $2,000 as of December 2014, will be issued. If
a nonminor violation is immediately corrected, an NOV without a civil
penalty shall still be issued to document the violation. If the violation
occurs again (within 12 months of the initial violation) an NOPA shall be
issued regardless of whether the violation is immediately corrected or
not.
F. The violator may request from the Noise Control Officer or Noise
Control Investigator an extension of the compliance deadline in the
enforcement action. The Noise Control Officer or Noise Control
Investigator shall have the option to approve any reasonable request for
an extension (not to exceed 180 days) if the violator can demonstrate
that a good faith effort has been made to achieve compliance. If an
extension is not granted and the violation continues to exist after the
grace period ends, an NOPA shall be issued.
G. The recipient of an NOPA shall be entitled to a hearing in a municipal
court having jurisdiction to contest such action.
§ 52-80 MILLVILLE CODE § 52-80
35:1038
§ 52-81. Severability; repealer; construal of provisions.
H. The Noise Control Officer or Noise Control Investigator may seek
injunctive relief if the responsible party does not remediate the
violation within the period of time specified in the NOPA issued.
I. Any claim for a civil penalty may be compromised and settled based on
the following factors:
(1) Mitigating or any other extenuating circumstances;
(2) The timely implementation by the violator of measures which lead
to compliance;
(3) The conduct of the violator; and
(4) The compliance history of the violator.
A. If any provision or portion of a provision of this article is held to be
unconstitutional, preempted by federal or state law, or otherwise
invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions
of the ordinance shall not be invalidated.
B. All ordinances or parts of ordinances which are inconsistent with any
provisions of this article are hereby repealed as to the extent of such
inconsistencies.
C. No provision of this article shall be construed to impair any common
law or statutory cause of action, or legal remedy therefrom, of any
person for injury or damage arising from any violation of this article or
from other law.

It is the policy of the City to protect the public health, safety and welfare.
These regulations reflect a realization of the benefits of connecting existing
properties to the municipal sewer system to protect the public health, safety
and welfare. Where there has been an extension of sewer mains, the owners
of property located within 100 feet of the sewer main measured from their
property line shall be required to connect their premises to the municipal
sewer system within 180 days after notification from the City to make the
connection.

property owner may delay connection to the municipal sewer system if
the property owner already has an existing private subsurface sewage
disposal system servicing the premises that is operating properly.
B. Testing protocol. It is recommended that a test of the private
subsurface sewage disposal system shall be conducted at least once
every three years at the expense of the property owner in accordance
with the Technical Guidance for Inspections of On-Site Wastewater
Treatment and Disposal Systems published by NJDEP. If the property
owner chooses to undertake the test, the test shall be performed by a
licensed professional engineer. A copy of the written report setting
forth the results of the test shall be filed with the Cumberland County
Health Department for review and further action, if required. A copy of

by NJDEP or USEPA for any given class of industries, or those regulator
agencies otherwise limit the discharge of any substance or pollutant,
the users will be required to reduce the discharge of these substances
into the sewers to the levels prescribed by those regulatory agencies.
Additionally, the users shall comply with more stringent standards
necessitated by local conditions as determined by the City of Millville.
F. Compliance with written rules and regulations required. All users of the
wastewater facility shall comply with the requirements of the written
rules and regulations of the Director of Public Works, which regulations
§ 56-15 LICENSING OF PROFESSIONS AND § 56-15
35:1057
shall become effective upon filing in the office of the City Clerk after
the effective date of this article.
G. Certain discharges to natural outlets prohibited. It shall be unlawful to
discharge any wastewater or other polluting material into any natural
outlet within the City of Millville, except where suitable treatment has
been provided and where a NJPDES permit has been obtained from the
appropriate governmental authority where required.
H. Injury to or tampering with wastewater facilities prohibited. No person
shall maliciously, intentionally, or negligently break, damage, destroy,
uncover, deface, or tamper with any structure, appurtenance, or
equipment that is part of the wastewater facilities of the City of
Millville.
I. Notice.
(1) Any user of the City's sewer system shall give notice to the City if
there is:
(a) Any new introduction of pollutants into the City's sewer system
which would be subject to Sections 301 or 306 of the federal
Act if it were directly discharging those pollutants; or
(b) Any substantial change in the volume or character of pollutants
being introduced into the City's system at the time of issuance
of the permit.
(2) For purposes of this article, adequate notice shall include
information on the quality and quantity of effluent introduced into
the City system and any anticipated impact of such change on the
quality or quantity of effluent to be discharged from the City's
wastewater treatment system. Notice shall be based upon sampling
data as required to be collected under NJDEP SIU permit, if
applicable, and/or under § 56-16D(2).
J. Trading credits. The City is committed to fostering a positive business
climate, and the credit trading program will be recognized as an
economic development resource for the City having a priority mission of
attracting new industry, jobs and tax ratables. Industries may apply to
the City to trade pretreatment credits among each other. The City will
entertain trading of pretreatment credits among existing industries or
among existing industries and a prospective industry which is
considering location within the City.
(1) When existing industries desire to trade credits other than BOD5
and TSS, the industries doing the trading must demonstrate that
the traded credit of a certain pollutant will result in the same or
less loading of the particular pollutant from the combined
industrial wastewater of the industries conducting the trading.
§ 56-15 MILLVILLE CODE § 56-15
35:1058
(2) When existing industries desire to trade BOD5 or TSS credits, the
industries can trade BOD5 and TSS credits equivalent to the
difference in actual BOD5 and TSS loading discharged into the
City's sewer system by the industry yielding the credits and the
industry receiving the credits. The difference would be computed
using the maximum loading allowed for the industry yielding the
credits, as defined by the maximum allowed BOD5 and TSS
concentrations in § 56-15D.
(3) When existing industries are trading credits, the industries must
submit 12 effluent wastewater data points that describe their
wastewater characteristics for the pollutant for which trading
rights are being applied. All data must be a composite sample as
defined herein. The data must be temporally spaced over a
minimum of three months.
(4) When an existing industry desires to trade BOD5 or TSS credits to
a prospective industry, the industries can trade BOD5 and TSS
credits equivalent to the difference in actual BOD5 and TSS loading
discharged into the City's sewer system by the industry yielding the
credits and the industry receiving the credits. The difference would
be computed using the maximum loading allowed for the industry
yielding the credits, as defined by the maximum allowed BOD5 and
TSS concentrations in § 56-15D.
(5) When an existing industry is trading BOD5 and TSS credits to a
prospective industry, the same data must be collected as required
by Subsection J(3) above. However, the data would need to be
substantiated by the prospective industry during the first six
months of its operation.
(6) The City reserves the right to request more data from industries
which operate on a cyclical or seasonal basis where the operation
results in the generation of wastewater that is highly variable in
characteristics. A pretreatment credit agreement must be entered
into with the affected industries and the City. Such agreement shall
identify the agreed-upon credit and provide the City with the
means to enforce the new limits for the affected industries.
K. Water conservation. It is the City's policy to encourage water
conservation. Therefore, an industry may apply to the City for a change
to increase its concentration-based limitation if it can demonstrate its
wastewater volume will be reduced and pollutant concentrations
increased as a result of water conservation measures.
(1) The industry's application should consist of a letter signed by the
principal executive officer familiar with the day-to-day operation of
the wastewater treatment facility stating the details of the
requested change. This letter must be accompanied by an
engineering report that addresses the water conservation
measures including an estimate of the water volume reduction and
§ 56-15 LICENSING OF PROFESSIONS AND § 56-15
35:1059
§ 56-16. Sampling, monitoring, inspecting, metering and reporting.
change in wastewater pollutant characteristics. Wastewater flow
data and pollutant data for those pollutants that the industry is
requesting a change of concentration limit, for the preceding
twelve-month period, must be submitted with the application to
define the existing baseline conditions. The flow data must be in the
form of daily flow records, and the pollutant data must be at least
representative of 24 hours' composite sampling once per month.
In all cases, the City will seek to approve only those applications
where water use is the only component of change of wastewater
characteristics. If other process changes are being performed, and
are necessary to be performed to allow the decrease of water use,
calculations must be submitted showing the change of pollutant
concentration resulting from the process changes separate from
the change of pollutant concentration resulting from water
conservation measures.
(2) In no case will the City approve a higher pollutant loading to the
sewage treatment system as a result of the industry's application
for change of concentration limit for that pollutant because of
water conservation measures.
(3) Once approved for a change of concentration limit under this
application procedure, an industry must submit daily wastewater
flow data. Additionally, the industry must submit one time each
month for 12 consecutive months a twenty-four-hour composite
pollutant sample to the City to demonstrate that the changes of its
industrial processes are in accordance with the application which
was approved.
A. Sampling. All industrial users shall provide a structure for the sampling
of wastewater before the point of discharge into a sanitary sewer. The
sampling structure shall be constructed and maintained by the
industrial user at its own expense and shall be kept safe and accessible
at all times to the City of Millville. Sampling structure design shall be
subject to the approval of the City of Millville.
B. Metering and other facilities. When required by the Director of Public
Works, an industrial user shall install and maintain additional facilities
at its own expense including, for example, meters, sealed automatic
monitoring systems, or other appurtenances to facilitate observation,
sampling and measurement of waste. Construction, installation, and
maintenance of such additional facilities shall be the responsibility of
the industrial user which shall keep these facilities safe and accessible
to the City of Millville at all times. Design and construction of such
additional facilities shall be subject to the approval of the City of
Millville.
(1) If a sewage metering device is installed the cost of said installation
shall be the responsibility of the user installing it.
§ 56-15 MILLVILLE CODE § 56-16
35:1060
(2) The metering device shall have an accuracy requirement of +/-
2.0%.
(3) The device shall be calibrated annually.
(4) In the event the device becomes inoperable, the Sewer Utility
should be notified of the date and time it became inoperable along
with the date and time the meter is returned to operation. A
reading, by Sewer Utility personnel, must be done on the date the
meter becomes inoperable and again just before the meter is put
back in operation.
(5) The meter shall be installed in such a manner that easy access is
provided for the purpose of reading and inspection by utility
personnel.
(6) Information such as drawings, manuals, description of the
metering device, etc., should be supplied to the Sewer Utility and
the City Engineer's office for review and approval before
installation.
C. Inspections. As a precondition for the right to discharge waste in any
form into the sewers and wastewater facilities of the City of Millville, all
users shall provide immediate access to their facilities at any time
during which there is a discharge to the wastewater facility. Access
shall be made available to the City for the purpose of checking the
quality of the discharge, taking samples, and making tests of the
discharge, or for the purpose of enforcing this article. All users shall
provide access to property and premises for inspection to determine if
there are any violations of this article. Each industrial user shall be
responsible for all costs incurred by the City of Millville in taking
samples and in making the tests.
D. Submission of information concerning waste discharge required. As
precondition for the right to discharge waste in any form into the
sewers and wastewater facilities of the City of Millville, all persons
subject to this article shall be required to provide information to the
Director of Public Works as needed to determine compliance with this
article. This information may include:
(1) Wastewater discharge rate and volume over a specified time
period.
(2) Chemical analysis of wastewater which shall allow the City to
continually evaluate the appropriateness of its current local limits.
As a minimum the frequency of such analyses shall be once per
quarter for all nonsignificant industrial users. Such chemical
analyses shall be for those pollutants which the City has current
limits in place as found on the table under § 56-15D. However, in
addition, all industries shall submit once per year the results of the
priority pollutant scan of their effluent as analyzed by a New Jersey
certified laboratory using procedures under 40 CFR Part 136. The
§ 56-16 LICENSING OF PROFESSIONS AND § 56-16
35:1061
City Superintendent may waive the requirement for an industrial
user to submit an annual priority pollutant scan upon the showing
of two consecutive priority pollutant scans with nondetection
levels. The Superintendent may also withdraw said waiver if
deemed necessary. Furthermore, all significant industrial users
shall submit a copy of the NJDEP discharge monitoring reports
that are regularly sent to the NJDEP in compliance with their
NJDEP and SIU permit reporting requirements at the time these
reports are sent to the state. [Amended 10-7-2014 by Ord. No.
36-2014]
(3) Information on raw materials, processes and products affecting
wastewater volume and quality including but not limited to
Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for all products that are
discharged into the City's sewer system.
(4) Quantity and disposition of specified liquid, sludge, oil, solvent, or
other materials important to sewer use control.
(5) A plot plan of sewers on the user's property showing sewer
pretreatment facility location.

including a completed copy of the City's industrial wastewater
pretreatment survey and application for new industrial wastewater
connections.
E. Industrial wastewater monitoring and reports.
(1) All significant industrial users who discharge wastewaters to the
treatment works shall maintain such records of production and
related factors, effluent flows, and pollutant amounts of
concentrations as are necessary to demonstrate compliance with
the requirements of this article and any applicable state or federal
pretreatment standards or requirements.
(2) Such records shall be made available upon request to the Director
of Public Works. All such records relating to compliance with
pretreatment standards shall be made available to officials of
NJDEP and the USEPA upon demand.
(3) Each significant industrial user discharging industrial waste into
the system shall install at its own cost and expense suitable
monitoring equipment to facilitate an accurate observation,

(4) Whether constructed on public or private property, the monitoring
facilities shall be constructed in accordance with City of Millville
requirements and all applicable construction standards and
specifications. Plans and specifications for all such work shall be
submitted to the City Engineer for approval prior to construction.
F. Measurements, tests and analyses. All measurements, tests, and
analyses of the characteristics of wastewater, to which reference is
made in this article, shall be determined in accordance with the latest
edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and
Wastewater, published jointly by the American Public Health
Association, the American Water Works Association, and the Water
Environment Federation, or other methods or procedures that may be
acceptable to the governmental authority requiring the measurements,
tests or analyses. Sampling method, location, time, duration and
frequency shall be determined on an individual basis by the City of
Millville.
G. Accidental discharge. If, for any reason, a facility does not comply with
or will be unable to comply with any prohibitions or limitations in these
regulations, the facility responsible for such discharge will take
immediate corrective action to prevent continued harm to the
treatment works system of the City.
H. Discharger reporting. Accidental discharges of toxic pollutants,
incompatible pollutants, or slug loads into the City's sewer system must
be reported to the City in accordance with the following procedures:
(1) Two-hour notice. Within two hours of being aware of the discharge,
the industry representative must telephone the Superintendent at
(856) 825-7000 and report the following information: [Amended
10-7-2014 by Ord. No. 36-2014]
(a) A description of the discharge.
(b) Steps being taken to determine the cause of noncompliance.
(c) Steps being taken to reduce and eliminate the noncomplying
discharge.
(2) Twenty-four-hour notice.
(a) The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times
and return to compliance.

(3) Five-day notice. Written submission of all the above plus steps
taken to reduce, eliminate and prevent recurrence of the
noncomplying discharge and any updating of information already
reported under either the two-hour or the twenty-four-hour notice.
I. Accidental discharge and slug control plans. At least once every two
years, the City shall evaluate whether each significant industrial user
needs an accidental discharge/slug control plan. The City may require
any user to develop, submit for approval, and implement such a plan.
Alternatively, the City may develop such a plan for any user. An
accidental discharge/slug control plan shall address, at a minimum, the
following:
(1) Description of discharge, practices, including nonroutine batch
discharges;
(2) Description of stored chemicals;

ARTICLE III
Sewer User Charges
§ 56-20. Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to impose an annual user charge, as
hereinafter defined, on all domestic, commercial, industrial, and
institutional users of the sewer system of the City of Millville.
§ 56-21. Definitions.
Unless the context specifically indicates otherwise, the meaning of the
terms used in this article shall be as follows:
ANNUAL UNIFORM AMOUNT  The annual sewer charge set by the City
for one residential dwelling unit.
DOMESTIC WASTE  Liquid wastes resulting from residences, buildings,
institutions, septic tanks, holding tanks, and industrial sources, including
the noncommercial preparation, cooking and handling of food, wastewater
consisting of human excrement, gray water and similar wastes from
sanitary conveniences, swimming pool water, but excluding any mixture
which includes any industrial waste, process wastewater, contaminated
stormwater, contaminated groundwater, or boiler blowdown. Any
wastewater with concentrations above the following criteria will not be
considered domestic waste:
EQUIVALENT DWELLING UNIT  The unit of measure that is equal to one
residential dwelling unit based on the average number of gallons of sewer
flow for one residential dwelling.
INDUSTRIAL WASTE  The process wastewater and other liquid wastes
resulting from any industrial manufacturing process defined in the latest
edition of the Standard Industrial Classification Manual, or is not domestic
waste as defined herein, or is any wastewater from any service process
which because of the contaminants it contains is comparable to industrial
wastewater including such wastewater mixed with water or domestic waste.
SEWER FLOW  The volume of wastewater discharged to the sewer
system. Except for equivalent dwelling units, sewer flow shall be measured
by an approved sewer flow meter, or if such a device is not installed, sewer
flow shall be measured by the water consumption of the sewer user. Water
consumption shall be based on water meter readings for City water and
pumping records for private wells, or a combination of both. Sewer users
who dispose of wastewater by means other than into the public sewer
system shall provide accurate measurements of the volume of wastewater
discharged to the public sewer system, otherwise sewer flow shall be the
total water consumption.

Sewer Discharge Control Regulations for Fats, Oils and Greases
[Added 9-4-2007 by Ord. No. 31-2007]
§ 56-73. Purpose and scope.
The City of Millville is the owner and NJDEP permittee of the municipal
wastewater treatment facility and sanitary sewage collection system. The
City has established regulations for sanitary sewage dischargers within the
municipal service area. The following regulations are hereby established
to protect the public health, safety and welfare. These regulations are
established to aid in the prevention of sanitary sewer blockages, odors,
and obstructions from contributions and accumulations of fats, oils, and
greases into the municipal sewer system from commercial or industrial
establishments, particularly food preparation and serving facilities. Such
clogs can result in sewer backups into homes or local waterways and result
in increased maintenance costs of the collection system and treatment
facility.
§ 56-74. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated unless the context clearly indicates that a different meaning is
intended.
COOKING ESTABLISHMENTS  Those establishments primarily engaged
in activities of preparing, serving, or otherwise making available for
consumption, foodstuffs and that use one or more of the following
preparation activities: cooking by frying (all methods), baking (all methods),
boiling, blanching, roasting, toasting, or poaching. Also included are
infrared heating, searing, barbecuing and any other food preparation
activity that produces a hot, nondrinkable food product in or on a receptacle
that requires washing. Users are including, but not limited to, cafeterias,
hospitals, hotels, restaurants (including fast food establishments), church
halls, school kitchen operations, supermarket food processing areas, or
other nonresidential establishments.
FATS, OILS, AND GREASES  Organic polar compounds derived from
animal and/or plant sources that contain multiple carbon chain triglyceride
molecules. These substances are detectable and measurable using
analytical test procedures established in 40 CFR 136, as may be amended
from time to time. All are sometimes referred to herein as F.O.G. (fats, oils,
greases).
GREASE TRAP OR INTERCEPTOR  A device for separating and retaining
waterborne F.O.G. complexes prior to the wastewater exiting the trap and
entering the sanitary sewer collection and treatment facility. These devices
also serve to collect settable solids, generated by and from food preparation
activities, prior to the water exiting the trap and entering the sanitary
sewer collection and treatment system. Grease traps and interceptors are
sometimes referred to as "grease interceptors."
§ 56-73 LICENSING OF PROFESSIONS AND § 56-74
35:1095
MINIMUM DESIGN CAPACITY  The design features of a grease
interceptor and its ability or volume required to effectively intercept and
retain F.O.G. from grease-laden wastewaters discharged to the public
sanitary sewer.
NONCOOKING ESTABLISHMENTS  Those establishments primarily
engaged in the preparation of precooked foodstuffs that do not include any
form of cooling. These include cold dairy and frozen foodstuffs preparation
and serving establishments.
USER  Any person, including those located outside the jurisdictional limits
of the municipality, who contributes, causes or permits the contribution
or discharge of wastewater into the POTW. This includes persons who
contribute such wastewater from mobile sources such as those who
discharge hauled wastewater.
§ 56-75. Grease interceptor maintenance, recordkeeping and grease
removal.
A. Grease interceptors shall be installed by users as required by the City
Engineer, Superintendent of the Sewer Utility or their designee. Grease
interceptors shall be installed at the user's expense, when such user
operates a cooking establishment. Grease interceptors may also be
required in noncooking or cold dairy and frozen foodstuffs
establishments and other industrial or commercial establishments
when they are deemed necessary by the City Engineer, Superintendent
of the Sewer Utility, or their designee for the proper handling of liquid
wastes containing F.O.G. No user shall allow wastewater discharge
concentration from subject grease interceptor to exceed 30 milligrams
per liter. All grease interceptors shall be of a type, design, and capacity
easily accessible for user cleaning and City inspection. All such grease
interceptors shall be inspected and serviced as required in order to
maintain minimum design capacity or effective volume of the grease
interceptor, or not less often than every 30 days.
B. Users who are required to pass water through a grease interceptor
shall:
(1) Provide for a minimum hydraulic retention time at actual peak flow
and at the calculated theoretical peak flow rate as predicted by the
Uniform Plumbing Code fixture criteria, between the influent and
effluent baffles with 20% of the total volume of the grease
interceptor being allowed for sludge to settle and accumulate,
identified hereafter as a "sludge blanket."
(2) Remove any accumulated grease cap and sludge blanket as
required, but at intervals of not longer than 90 days at the user's
expense. Grease interceptors shall be kept free of inorganic solid
materials such as grit, rocks, gravel, sand, eating utensils,
cigarettes, shells, towels, rags, etc., which could settle and thereby
reduce the effective volume of the grease interceptor.
§ 56-74 MILLVILLE CODE § 56-75
35:1096
(3) (Reserved)129
(4) Operate the grease interceptor in a manner so as to maintain said
device such that attainment of the grease limit is consistently
achieved. "Consistently" shall mean any wastewater sample taken
from said grease interceptor shall be subject to terms of numerical
attainment described in Subsection A above. If an establishment
desires, because of documented space constraints, an alternate to
an out-of-building grease interceptor, the request for an alternative
location shall contain the following information:
(a) Location of City sewer main and easement in relation to
available exterior space outside building.
(b) Existing plumbing at or in a site that uses common plumbing
for all services at the site.
(5) Understand and agree that: The use of biological additives as an
F.O.G. degradation agent is conditionally permissible, upon prior
written approval by the City Engineer and the Sewer Utility
Superintendent. Any establishment using this method of F.O.G.
abatement shall maintain the trap or interceptor in such a manner
that attainment of the F.O.G. wastewater discharge limit as
measured from the trap's outlet is consistently achieved.
(6) Understand and agree that: The use of automatic F.O.G. removal
systems is conditionally permissible upon prior written approval by
the City Engineer and the Sewer Utility Superintendent, the Lead
Plumbing Inspector of the City of Millville, the County Department
of Health, and the NJDEP. Any establishment using this equipment
shall operate the system in such a manner that the attainment of
the F.O.G. wastewater discharge limit, as measured from the unit's
outlet, is consistently achieved.
(7) Understand and agree that: F.O.G. recovered on site for off-site
disposal shall meet the following minimum requirements:
(a) All solid wastes shall be stored in appropriate containers.
(b) Users and disposers shall comply with all applicable hazardous
waste regulations of the NJDEP and the NJDOT.
(c) Users shall maintain records of types and volumes of all waste
generated. These records must be maintained for a period of
five years.
(8) Understand and agree that: The City Engineer and the Sewer
Utility Superintendent reserve the right to make determinations of
grease interceptor adequacy and need, based on review of all
relevant information regarding grease interceptor performance,
129. Editor's Note: Former Subsection B(3), regarding reintroduction of treated wastes back
into the Citys wastewater treatment system, was repealed 4-18-2017 by Ord. No. 16-2017.

35:1097
§ 56-76. Violations and penalties.
A person violating any of the provisions of these regulations, any provision
of the pretreatment standards for sewerage, N.J.S.A. 58:11-49 et seq.,
N.J.A.C. 7:14 et seq., or any regulations promulgated thereunder, shall be
liable for a penalty of not more than $50,000 per day (N.J.S.A. 58:11-49). If
the violation is of a continuing nature, each day shall constitute a separate
and distinct violation. The City shall seek penalties as referenced in the
City's Emergency Response Plan. In accordance with N.J.A.C. 7:14-8.1(f),
the City shall assess the following civil administrative penalty assessments:
facility site and building plan review and to require repairs to or
modifications or replacement of such traps.
C. The user shall maintain a written record of grease interceptor
maintenance for five years. All such records will be available for
inspection by the City at all times.
D. Non-F.O.G.-laden sources are not allowed to be connected to sewer
lines intended for grease interceptor service.
E. No wastewater in excess of 140° F. (60° C.) shall be discharged into a
grease interceptor.
F. Grease interceptors shall be installed as required by these regulations.
Except as provided herein, for a period of one year following the
adoption of these regulations, no enforcement actions will be taken
under these regulations for failure to achieve limits on F.O.G.
discharges from grease interceptors. If, during this one-year period, an
obstruction of a City sewer main(s) occurs that causes a sewer overflow
to the extent that an impact on the environment is realized and that said
overflow or failure of the sanitary sewer collection system to convey
sewage can be attributed in part or in whole to an accumulation of
F.O.G. in the City's sewer main(s), the City will take appropriate
enforcement actions as stipulated in § 56-76, Violations and penalties,
against the generator or contributor of such F.O.G.
G. Access manholes, with a minimum diameter of 24 inches, shall be
provided over each chamber and sanitary tee. The access manholes
shall extend at least to finished grade and be designed and maintained
to prevent water inflow or infiltration. The manhole shall also have
readily removable covers to facilitate inspection, residuals removal, and
wastewater sampling activities.
A. The City shall assess a mandatory minimum penalty of not less than
$1,000 for each serious violation as defined in N.J.A.C. 7:14-8.16.
B. The City shall assess a mandatory minimum penalty of not less than
$5,000 for each violation that causes a violator to be, or continue to be,
a significant noncomplier as defined in N.J.A.C. 7:14-8.16.

The City is providing the following information to assist the user in meeting
the requirements set forth in these rules and regulations. The City is not
making any representations or warranties concerning the information being
provided.
C. Each violation, including each parameter that is required to be
monitored, sampled and reported and that is not monitored, sampled
and reported, is an additional, separate and distinct violation. Each day
during which a violation continues shall constitute an additional,
separate distinct violation.
D. The requirement that the City assess penalties pursuant to the City's
Enforcement Response Plan shall in no way be construed to limit the
ability of the City to assess a penalty, bring an action for a penalty for a
violation at any time after a violation occurred, or to assess a more
stringent penalty against a person pursuant to the City's Enforcement
Response Plan.
E. The City Engineer; Sewer Utility Superintendent or their designee shall
issue a notice of violation. The notice of violation shall be sent by
certified mail, return receipt requested, to the offending party. The
offending party will be directed to show why service should not be
terminated or penalties imposed. Notice shall be served on the
offending party to show why enforcement action should not be taken.
A. A sample copy of a grease system cleaning log is attached. Users should
begin utilizing the sample form or one that suits their own requirements
as long as the form used contains all of the information which is on the
sample form. These records shall be maintained on file for review by
inspectors and for later submission to the Municipal Sewer Utility as
provided in these rules and regulations.
B. A list of oil and grease haulers and recyclers who are available to assist
users in cleaning and/or removing accumulated grease is set forth

§ 60-1. Scope and purpose.
§ 60-2. Definitions.
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have
A. Policy statement. Flood control, groundwater recharge, and pollutant
reduction through nonstructural or low-impact techniques shall be
explored before relying on structural BMPs. Structural BMPs should be
integrated with nonstructural stormwater management strategies and
proper maintenance plans. Nonstructural strategies include both
environmentally sensitive site design and source controls that prevent
pollutants from being placed on the site or from being exposed to
stormwater. Source control plans should be developed based upon
physical site conditions and the origin, nature, and the anticipated
quantity or amount of potential pollutants. Multiple stormwater
management BMPs may be necessary to achieve the established
performance standards for water quality, quantity, and groundwater
recharge.
B. Purpose. The purpose of these regulations is to establish minimum
stormwater management requirements and controls for "major
development," as defined in § 60-2.
C. Applicability.
(1) These regulations shall be applicable to all site plans and
subdivisions for the following major developments that require
preliminary or final site plan or subdivision review: Nonresidential
major developments, and aspects of residential major
developments which are not preempted by the Residential Site
Improvement Standards at N.J.A.C. 5:21.
(2) These regulations also shall be applicable to all major
developments undertaken by the City of Millville.
D. Compatibility with other permit and laws. Development approvals
issued for subdivisions and site plans pursuant to these regulations are
to be considered an integral part of development approvals under the
subdivision and site plan review process. These regulations do not
relieve the applicant of the responsibility to secure required approvals
or permits for activities regulated by other laws, rules or regulations.
The provisions of these regulations as interpreted and applied shall be
viewed as the minimum requirements for the promotion of the public
health, safety, and general welfare. These regulations are not intended
to abrogate or annul any other law, rule or regulation with provisions
which contain more restrictive requirements or higher standards.

A. Stormwater management measures for major development shall be
developed to meet the erosion control, groundwater recharge,
stormwater runoff quantity, and stormwater runoff quality standards in
§ 60-4. To the maximum extent practicable, these standards shall be
met by incorporating nonstructural stormwater management strategies
into the design. If these strategies alone are not sufficient to meet these
standards, structural stormwater management measures necessary to
meet these standards shall be incorporated into the design.
B. The standards in these regulations apply only to new development and
are intended to minimize the impact of stormwater runoff on water
quality and water quantity in receiving water bodies and maintain
groundwater recharge. The standards do not apply to new major
development to the extent that alternative design and performance
standards are applicable under a regional stormwater management
plan or water quality management plan adopted in accordance with
Department rules.
A. The development shall incorporate a maintenance plan for the
stormwater management measures incorporated into the design of
major development in accordance with § 60-10.
B. Stormwater management measures shall avoid adverse impacts of
concentrated flow on habitat for threatened and endangered species as

C. The following linear development projects are exempt from the
groundwater recharge, stormwater runoff quantity, and stormwater
runoff quality requirements of Subsections F and G below.
(1) The construction of an underground utility line, provided that the
disturbed areas are revegetated upon completion.
(2) The construction of an aboveground utility line, provided that the
existing conditions are maintained to the maximum extent
practicable; and
(3) The construction of a public pedestrian access, such as a sidewalk
or trail with a maximum width of 14 feet, provided that the access
is made of permeable material.
D. A waiver from strict compliance from the groundwater recharge,
stormwater runoff quantity and stormwater runoff quality requirements
of Subsections F and G below may be obtained for the enlargement of
an existing public roadway or railroad or the construction or
enlargement of a public pedestrian access, provided that the following
conditions are met:
(1) The application demonstrates that there is a public need for the
project that cannot be accomplished by any other means;
(2) The applicant demonstrates through an alternatives analysis that,
through the use of nonstructural and structural stormwater
management strategies and measures, the option selected
complies with the requirements of Subsections F and G below to
the maximum extent practicable;
(3) The applicant demonstrates that, in order to meet the requirements
of Subsections F and G below, existing structures currently in use,
such as homes and buildings, would need to be condemned; and
(4) The applicant demonstrates that it does not own or have other
rights to areas, including the potential to obtain through
condemnation lands not falling under Subsection D(3) above within
the upstream drainage area of the receiving stream, that would
provide additional opportunities to mitigate the requirements of
Subsections F and G below that were not achievable on site.
E. Nonstructural stormwater management strategies.
(1) To the maximum extent practicable, the standards in Subsections F
and G below shall be met by incorporating nonstructural
stormwater management strategies into the design. The applicant
shall identify the nonstructural measures incorporated into the
design of the project. If the applicant contends that it is not feasible
§ 60-4 MILLVILLE CODE § 60-4
35:1108
for engineering, environmental, or safety reasons to incorporate
any nonstructural stormwater management measures identified
below into the design of a particular project, the applicant shall
identify the strategy considered and provide a basis for the
contention.
(2) Nonstructural stormwater management strategies incorporated
into site design shall:
(a) Protect areas that provide water quality benefits of areas
particularly susceptible to erosion and sediment loss;
(b) Minimize impervious surfaces and break up or disconnect the
flow of runoff over impervious surfaces;
(c) Maximize the protection of natural drainage features and
vegetation;
(d) Minimize the decrease in the time of concentration from

discharging into and through stable vegetated areas;
(i) Provide other source controls to prevent or minimize the use or
exposure of pollutants at the site in order to prevent or
minimize the release of those pollutants into stormwater
runoff. Such source controls include, but are not limited to:
[1] Site design features that help to prevent accumulation of
trash and debris in drainage systems, including features
that satisfy § 60-4E(3);
[2] Site design features that help to prevent discharge of trash
and debris from drainage systems;

35:1109
established under the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control
Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq., and implanting rules.
(3) Site design features identified under § 60-4E above shall comply
with the following standard to control passage of solid and floatable
materials through storm drain inlets. For purposes of this
paragraph, "solid and floatable materials" means sediment, debris,
trash, and other floating, suspended, or settleable solids. For
exemptions to this standard see § 60-4E(3)(c) below.
(a) Design engineers shall use either of the following grates
whenever they use a grate in pavement or another ground
surface to collect stormwater from that surface into a storm
drain or surface water body under that grate:
[1] The New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT)
bicycle safe grate, which is described in Chapter 2.4 of the
NJDOT Bicycle Compatible Roadways and Bikeways
Planning and Design Guidelines (April 1996); or
[2] A different grate, if each individual clear space in that
grate has an area of no more than seven square inches, or
is no greater than 0.5 inch across the smallest dimension.
Examples of grates subject to this standard include grates
in grate inlets, the grate portion (non-curb-opening
portion) of combination inlets, grates on storm sewer
manholes, ditch grates, trench grates, and grates of spacer
bars in slotted drains. Examples of ground surface include
surfaces of roads (including bridges), driveways, parking
areas, bikeways, plazas, sidewalks, lawns, fields, open
channels, and stormwater basin floors.
(b) Whenever design engineers use a curb-opening inlet, the clear
space in that curb opening (or each individual clear space, if
the curb opening has two or more clear spaces) shall have an
area of no more than seven square inches, or be no greater
than two inches across the smallest channels, and stormwater
basin floors.
(c) This standard does not apply:
[1] Where the review agency determines that this standard
would cause inadequate hydraulic performance that could
not practicably be overcome by using additional or larger
storm drain inlets that meet these standards;
[2] Where flows from the water quality design storm as
specified in Subsection G(1) below are conveyed through
any device (e.g., end-of-pipe netting facility, manufactured
treatment device, or a catch basin hood) that is designed,
at a minimum, to prevent delivery of all solid and floatable
materials that could not pass through one of the following:
§ 60-4 MILLVILLE CODE § 60-4
35:1110
[a] A rectangular space 4 5/8 inches long and 1 1/2 inches
wide (this option does not apply for outfall netting
facilities); or
[b] A bar screen having a bar spacing of 0.5 inch.
[3] Where flows are conveyed through a trash rack that has
parallel bars with one-inch spacing between the bars to
the elevation of the water quality design storm as specified
in Subsection G(1) below; or
[4] Where the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection determines, pursuant to the New Jersey
Register of Historic Places Rules at N.J.A.C. 7:4-7.2(c), that
action to meet this standard is an undertaking that
constitutes an encroachment or will damage or destroy the
New Jersey Register listed historic property.
(4) Any land area used as a nonstructural stormwater management
measure to meet the performance standards in Subsections F and
G below shall be dedicated to a government agency, subjected to a
conservation restriction filed with the appropriate county clerk's
office, or subject to an approved equivalent restriction that ensures
that measure or an equivalent stormwater management measure
approved by the reviewing agency is maintained in perpetuity.
(5) Guidance for nonstructural stormwater management strategies is
available in the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management
Practices Manual. The BMP Manual may be obtained from the
address identified in § 60-7 or found on the Department's website
at www.njstormwater.org.
F. Erosion control, groundwater recharge and runoff quantity standards.
(1) This subsection contains minimum design and performance
standards to control erosion, encourage and control infiltration and
groundwater recharge, and control stormwater runoff quantity
impacts of major development.
(a) The minimum design and performance standards for erosion
control are those established under the Soil Erosion and
Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq., and
implementing rules.
(b) The minimum design and performance standards for
groundwater recharge are as follows:
[1] The design engineer shall, using the assumptions and
factors for stormwater runoff and groundwater recharge
calculations in § 60-5 either:
[a] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis that the site and its stormwater management
§ 60-4 LICENSING OF PROFESSIONS AND § 60-4
35:1111
measures maintain 100% of the average annual
preconstruction groundwater recharge volume for the
site; or
[b] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis that the increase of stormwater runoff volume
from preconstruction to postconstruction for the twoyear
storm is infiltrated.
[2] This groundwater recharge requirement does not apply to
projects within the urban redevelopment area, or to
projects subject to Subsection F(1)(b)[3] below.
[3] The following types of stormwater shall not be recharged:
[Amended 6-19-2012 by Ord. No. 21-2012]
[a] Stormwater from areas of high pollutant loading. High
pollutant loading areas are areas in industrial and
commercial developments where solvents and/or
petroleum products are loaded/unloaded, stored, or
applied; areas where pesticides are loaded/unloaded
or stored; areas where hazardous materials are
expected to be present in greater than "reportable
quantities" as defined by the United States
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR
302.4; areas where recharge would be inconsistent
with Department-approved remedial action work plan
or landfill closure plan and areas with high risks for
spills of toxic materials, such as gas stations and
vehicle maintenance facitlites; and
[b] Industrial stormwater exposed to source material.
"Source material" means any material(s) or
machinery, located at an industrial facility, which is
directly or indirectly related to process,
manufacturing or other industrial activities, which
could be a source of pollutants in any industrial
stormwater discharge to groundwater. Source
materials include, but are not limited to, raw
materials, intermediate products, final products,
waste materials, by-products, industrial machinery
and fuels, and lubricants, solvents, and detergents
that are related to process, manufacturing, or other
industrial activities that are exposed to stormwater.
[4] The design engineer shall assess the hydraulic impact on
the groundwater table and design the site so as to avoid
adverse hydraulic impacts. Potential adverse hydraulic
impacts include, but are not limited to, exacerbating a
naturally or seasonally high water table so as to cause
surface ponding, flooding of basements, or interference
§ 60-4 MILLVILLE CODE § 60-4
35:1112
with the proper operation of subsurface sewage disposal
systems and other subsurface structures in the vicinity or
downgradient of the groundwater recharge area.
(c) In order to control stormwater runoff quantity impacts, the
design engineer shall, using the assumptions and factors for
stormwater runoff calculations in § 60-5, complete one of the
following:
[1] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
that for stormwater leaving the site, postconstruction
runoff hydrographs for the two-, ten-, and one-hundredyear
storm events do not exceed, at any point in time, the
preconstruction runoff hydrographs for the same storm
events;
[2] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
that there is no increase, as compared to the
preconstruction condition, in the peak runoff rates of
stormwater leaving the site for the two-, ten-, and onehundred-
year storm events and that the increased volume
or change in timing of stormwater runoff will not increase
flood damage at or downstream of the site. This analysis
shall include the analysis of impacts of existing land uses
and projected land uses assuming full development under
existing land use and development regulations in the
drainage area;
[3] Design stormwater management measures so that the
postconstruction peak runoff rates for the two-, ten-, and
one-hundred-year storm events are 50%, 75% and 80%,
respectively, of the preconstruction peak runoff rates. The
percentages apply only to the postconstruction
stormwater runoff that is attributable to the portion of the
site on which the proposed development or project is to be
constructed. The percentages shall not be applied to
postconstruction stormwater runoff into tidal flood hazard
areas if the increased volume of stormwater runoff will not
increase flood damages below the point of discharge; or
[4] In tidal flood hazard areas, stormwater runoff quantity
analysis in accordance with Subsection F(1)(c)[1], [2] and
[3] above shall only be applied if the increased volume of
stormwater runoff could increase flood damages below the
point of discharge.
(2) Any application for a new agricultural development that meets the
definition of major development in § 60-2 shall be submitted to the
appropriate soil conservation district for review and approval in
accordance with the requirements of this section and any
applicable soil conservation district guidelines for stormwater
§ 60-4 LICENSING OF PROFESSIONS AND § 60-4
35:1113
runoff quantity and erosion control. For the purpose of this section,
"agricultural development" means land uses normally associated
with the production of food, fiber and livestock for sale. Such uses
do not include the development of land for the processing or sale of
food and the manufacturing of agriculturally related products.
G. Stormwater runoff quality standards.
(1) Stormwater management measures shall be designed to reduce the
postconstruction load of total suspended solids (TSS) in stormwater
runoff by 80% of the anticipated load from the developed site,
expressed as an annual average. Stormwater management
measures shall only be required for water quality control if an
additional 1/4 acre of impervious surface is being proposed on a
development site. The requirement to reduce TSS does not apply to
any stormwater runoff in a discharge regulated under a numeric
effluent limitation for TSS imposed under the New Jersey Pollution
Discharge Elimination System (NJPDES) rules, N.J.A.C. 7:14A, or in
a discharge specifically exempt under a NJPDES permit from this
requirement. The water quality design storm is 1.25 inches of
rainfall in two hours. Water quality calculations shall take into
account the distribution of rain from the water quality design
storm, as reflected in Table 1. The calculation of the volume of
runoff may take into account the implementation of nonstructural
and structural stormwater management measures.

(2) For purposes of TSS reduction calculations, Table 2 below presents
the presumed removal rates for certain BMPs designed in
accordance with the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management
Practices Manual. The BMP Manual may be obtained from the
address identified in § 60-7, or found on the Department's website
at www.njstormwater.org. The BMP Manual and other sources of
technical guidance are listed in § 60-7. TSS reduction shall be
calculated based on the removal rates for the BMPs in Table 2
below. Alternative removal rates and methods of calculating
removal rates may be used if the design engineer provides
documentation demonstrating the capability of these alternative
rates and methods to the review agency. A copy of any approved
alternative rate or method of calculating the removal rate shall be
provided to the Department at the following address: Division of
Watershed Management, New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection, P.O. Box 418, Trenton, New Jersey 08625-0418.
(3) If more than one BMP in series is necessary to achieve the required
eighty-percent TSS reduction for a site, the applicant shall utilize
the following formula to calculate TSS reduction:
R = = A ÷ B - (AXB)/100
Where:
R = = total TSS percent load removal from application of both
BMPs; and
A = = the TSS percent removal rate applicable to the first
BMP
B = = the TSS percent removal rate applicable to the second
BMP

(4) If there is more than one on-site drainage area, the eighty-percent
TSS removal rate shall apply to each drainage area, unless the
runoff from the subareas converge on site, in which case the
§ 60-4 LICENSING OF PROFESSIONS AND § 60-4
35:1115
removal rate can be demonstrated through a calculation using a
weighted average.
(5) Stormwater management measures shall also be designed to
reduce, to the maximum extent feasible, the postconstruction
nutrient load of the anticipated load from the developed site in
stormwater runoff generated from the water quality design storm.
In achieving reduction of nutrients to the maximum extent feasible,
the design of the site shall include nonstructural strategies and
structural measures that optimize nutrient removal while still
achieving the performance standards in § 60-4F and G.
(6) Additional information and examples are contained in the New
Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual which may
be obtained from the address identified in § 60-7.
(7) In accordance with the definition of FW1 at N.J.A.C. 7:9B-1-4,
stormwater management measures shall be designed to prevent
any increase in stormwater runoff to waters classified as FW1.
(8) Special water resource protection areas shall be established along
all waters designated Category One at N.J.A.C. 7:9B, and perennial
or intermittent streams that drain into or upstream of the Category
One waters shown on the USGS Quadrangle Maps or in the County
Soil Surveys, within the associated HUC14 drainage area. These
areas shall be established for the protection of water quality,
aesthetic value, exceptional ecological significance, exceptional
recreational significance, exceptional water supply significance,
and exceptional fisheries significance of those established Category
One waters. These areas shall be designated and protected as
follows:
(a) The applicant shall preserve and maintain a special water
resource protection area in accordance with one of the
following:
[1] A three-hundred-foot special water resource protection
area shall be provided on each side of the waterway,
measured perpendicular to the waterway from the top of
the bank outwards or from the center line of the waterway
where the bank is not defined, consisting of existing
vegetation or vegetation allowed to follow natural
succession.
[2] Encroachment within the designated special water
resource protection area under Subsection F(8)(a)[1]
above shall only be allowed where previous development
or disturbance has occurred (for example, active
agricultural use, parking area or maintained lawn area).
The encroachment shall only be allowed where applicant
demonstrates that the functional value and overall
condition of the special water resource protection area will
§ 60-4 MILLVILLE CODE § 60-4
35:1116
be maintained to the maximum extent practicable. In no
case shall the remaining special water resource protection
area be reduced to less than 150 feet as measured
perpendicular to the top of the bank of the waterway or
center line of the waterway where the bank is undefined.
All encroachments proposed under this subparagraph
shall be subject to review and approval by the Department.
(b) All stormwater shall be discharged outside of and flow through
the special water resource protection area and shall comply
with the standard for off-site stability in the Standards for Soil
Erosion and Sediment Control in New Jersey, established under
the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et
seq.
(c) If stormwater discharged outside of and flowing through the
special water resource protection area cannot comply with the
standard for off-site stability in the Standards for Soil Erosion
and Sediment Control in New Jersey, established under the Soil
Erosion and Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq.,
then the stabilization measures in accordance with the
requirements of the above standards may be placed within the
special water resource protection area, provided that:
[1] Stabilization measures shall not be placed within 150 feet
of the Category One waterway;
[2] Stormwater associated with discharges allowed by this
section shall achieve a ninety-five-percent TSS
postconstruction removal rate;
[3] Temperature shall be addressed to ensure no impact on
the receiving waterway;
[4] The encroachment shall only be allowed where the
applicant demonstrates that the functional value and
overall condition of the special water resource protection
area will be maintained to the maximum extent
practicable.
[5] A conceptual project design meeting shall be held with the
appropriate Department staff and Soil Conservation
District staff to identify necessary stabilization measures;
and
[6] All encroachments proposed under the section shall be
subject to review and approval by the Department.
(d) A stream corridor protection plan may be developed by a
regional stormwater management planning committee as an
element of a regional stormwater management plan, or by a
municipality through an adopted municipal stormwater
§ 60-4 LICENSING OF PROFESSIONS AND § 60-4
35:1117
§ 60-5. Calculation of stormwater runoff and groundwater recharge.
management plan. If a stream corridor protection plan for
a waterway subject to § 60-4G(8) has been approved by the
Department of Environmental Protection, then the provisions
of the plan shall be the applicable special water resource
protection area requirements for that waterway. A stream
corridor protection plan for a waterway subject to § 60-4G(8)
shall maintain or enhance the current functional value and
overall condition of the special water resource protection area
as defined in § 60-4G(8)(a)[1] above. In no case shall a stream
corridor protection plan allow the reduction of the special
water resource protection area to less than 150 feet as
measured perpendicular to the waterway subject to this
subsection.
(e) Section 60-4G(8) does not apply to the construction of one
individual single-family dwelling that is not part of a larger
development on a lot receiving preliminary or final subdivision
approval on or before February 2, 2004, provided that the
construction begins on or before February 2, 2009.
A. Stormwater runoff shall be calculated in accordance with the following:
(1) The design engineer shall calculate runoff using one of the
following methods:
(a) The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS)
methodology, including the NRCS Runoff Equation and
Dimensionless Unit Hydrograph, as described in the NRCS
National Engineering Handbook Section 4 - Hydrology and
Technical Release 55 - Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds;
or
(b) The Rational Method for peak flow and the Modified Rational
Method for hydrograph computations.
(2) For the purpose of calculating runoff coefficients and groundwater
recharge, there is a presumption that the preconstruction condition
of a site or portion thereof is a wooded land use with good
hydrologic condition. The term "runoff coefficient" applies to both
the NRCS methodology set forth above and the Rational and
Modified Rational Methods set forth above. A runoff coefficient or a
groundwater recharge land cover for an existing condition may be
used on all or a portion of the site if the design engineer verifies
that the hydrologic condition has existed on the site or portion of
the site for at least five years without interruption prior to the time
of application. If more than one land cover have existed on the site
during the five years immediately prior to the time of application,
the land cover with the lowest runoff potential shall be used for the
computations. In addition, there is the presumption that the site is
§ 60-4 MILLVILLE CODE § 60-5
35:1118
§ 60-6. Standards for structural stormwater management measures.
in good hydrologic condition (if the land use type is pasture, lawn,
or park), with good cover (if the land use type is woods), or with
good hydrologic condition and conservation treatment (if the land
use type is cultivation).
(3) In computing preconstruction stormwater runoff, the design
engineer shall account for all significant land features and
structures, such as ponds, wetlands, depressions, hedgerows, or
culverts, that may reduce preconstruction stormwater runoff rates
and volumes.
(4) In computing stormwater runoff from all design storms, the design
engineer shall consider the relative stormwater runoff rates and/or
volumes of pervious and impervious surfaces separately to
accurately compute the rates and volume of stormwater runoff
from the site. To calculate runoff from unconnected impervious
cover, urban impervious area modification as described in the
NRCS Technical Release 55 - Urban Hydrology for Small
Watersheds and other methods may be employed.
(5) If the invert of the outlet structure of a stormwater management
measure is below the flood hazard design flood elevation as defined
at N.J.A.C. 7:13, the design engineer shall take into account the
effects of tailwater in the design of structural stormwater
management measures.
B. Groundwater recharge may be calculated in accordance with the
following:
(1) The New Jersey Geological Survey Report GSR-32, A Method for
Evaluating Ground-Water Recharge Areas in New Jersey,
incorporated herein by reference, as amended and supplemented.
Information regarding the methodology is available from the New
Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual; at
http://www.state.nj.us/dep/nigs/; or at New Jersey Geological
Survey, 29 Arctic Parkway, P.O. Box 427, Trenton, New Jersey
08625-0427; (609) 984-6587.
A. Standards for structural stormwater management measure are as
follows:
(1) Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed to
take into account the existing site conditions, including, for
example, environmentally critical areas, wetlands; flood-prone
areas; slopes depth to seasonal high water table; soil type,
permeability and texture; drainage area and drainage patterns; and
the presence of solution-prone carbonate rocks (limestone).
§ 60-5 LICENSING OF PROFESSIONS AND § 60-6
35:1119
§ 60-7. Sources for technical guidance.
(2) Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed to
minimize maintenance, facilitate maintenance and repairs, and
ensure proper functioning.
(3) Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed,
constructed, and installed to be strong, durable, and corrosionresistant.
Measures that are consistent with the relevant portions

the abutting land to make the necessary repairs. Said repairs shall be made
within 30 days from the date of service of the written notice.
§ 61-17. Failure to repair; work done by City; cost to become lien.
In the event that said repairs are not effected within 30 days after written
notice has been served on the abutting landowner to make the necessary
repairs, the director in charge of streets and roads may procure such
repairs as shall be required at the expense of the City, and all costs
expended therefor shall become a lien upon the abutting lands where
such repairs were made to the same extent that assessments for local
improvements are liens. The cost thereof shall be collected in the manner
provided by law for the collection of such assessments.
§ 61-18. Filing of complaint; restitution.
In the event that the abutting landowner has failed to make the necessary
repairs to the curbs or sidewalks within 30 days of the service of the
written notice, a formal complaint may be filed by the City against said
property owner with the Municipal Court for enforcement of this article.
The Municipal Court, in its discretion, may impose penalties as prescribed

facie evidence of the existence of the debt due from the property owner to
the City.

§ 61-61. Purpose and scope.
A. Pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:66-1, a municipality that establishes a system
