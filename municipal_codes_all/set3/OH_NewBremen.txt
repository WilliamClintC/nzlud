§ 30.01  APPLICATION OF TITLE III.



   Title III of this code of ordinances is designed to include and
incorporate, insofar as is practical, all legislation concerning the
organization, qualifications, appointment or election, terms of office,
compensation, and the powers and duties of the officials, boards, and bodies
of the village.  Pertinent sections of the Revised Code of Ohio relative to
these offices and boards have been assembled and adopted as a part of this
title.  No material changes of the code sections referred to by annotation
have been made.  The purpose of including these sections is to afford easy
reference to the statutory provisions.



§ 30.02  QUALIFICATIONS; OATHS.



   (A)   Except as otherwise provided in division (B) of this section
or in another section of the Revised Code, each officer of the village or of
any department or board of the municipality, whether elected or appointed as
a substitute for a regular officer, shall be an elector of the municipality
and, before entering upon official duties, shall take an oath to support the
constitution of the United States and the constitution of the state, and an

the duties of the office to which elected or appointed.  These provisions as
to official oaths shall extend to deputies, but they need not be electors.

requires, or shall be construed to require, that a Fire Chief be an elector
of the municipality.



(R.C. § 733.68)



§ 30.03  BONDS OF OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES; AMOUNT OF.



   Before entering upon the discharge of his duties, each officer and

office or position.



§ 30.04  ADDITIONAL BOND; WHERE BONDS RECORDED AND KEPT.



   Each officer required by law or ordinance to give bond shall do so
before entering upon the duties of the office, except as otherwise provided
by law.  In its discretion, Council at any time may require each officer to
give a new or additional bond.  Each bond, except that of the Auditor or
Clerk, upon its approval, shall be delivered to the Auditor or Clerk, who
shall immediately record it in a record provided for that purpose, and file
and carefully preserve it in his office.  The bond of the Auditor or Clerk
shall be delivered to the Treasurer, who shall in like manner record and
preserve it.



(R.C. § 733.69)



§ 30.05  APPROVAL OF BONDS.

to the approval of the Mayor, except that the Mayor's bond shall be approved
by the Council, or, if it is not legally organized, by the Clerk of the Court
of Common Pleas of the County.



(R.C. § 733.70)



§ 30.06  SUFFICIENCY OF FORM OF BOND.



   In each bond, the condition that the person elected or appointed shall
faithfully perform the duties of the office shall be sufficient.  The fact
that the instrument is without a seal, that blanks like the date or amount
have been filled subsequent to its execution but before its acceptance,
without the consent of the sureties, that all the obligees named in the
instrument have not signed it, that new duties have been imposed on the
officers or that any merely formal objection exists shall not be available in
any suit on the instrument.



(R.C. § 733.71)



§ 30.07  FILLING VACANCIES IN OFFICES.

elective offices of the village shall be filled by appointment by the Mayor

registered electors residing in the municipality equal in number to not less
than 10% of the total vote cast for all candidates for Governor in the
municipality at the most recent general election at which a Governor was
elected, requesting that the question be placed before the electors whether,
instead of the Legislative Authority appointing legal counsel for the
municipality or for any department or official of the municipality, the Mayor
shall appoint an attorney or law firm as the legal counsel with the advice
and consent of the Legislative Authority. Within two weeks after receipt of
the petition, the Clerk shall certify it to the Board of Elections, which
shall determine its sufficiency and validity. The petition shall be certified
to the Board of Elections not less than 90 days prior to the election at
which the question is to be voted upon.



      (2)   At the election, if a majority of the electors of the
municipality approves the question, then effective immediately when the Mayor
considers it necessary, the Mayor shall appoint, with the advice and consent
of the Legislative Authority, an attorney or law firm as legal counsel for
the municipality, or for any department or official of the municipality, for
a period not to exceed two years. The appointment of legal counsel under this
division shall be pursuant to a contract approved by the Mayor and a majority
vote of the Legislative Authority. The contract shall provide for the
compensation and other terms of the engagement of the legal counsel, and the
Legislative Authority shall provide that compensation for the legal counsel.



   (C)   When acting under this section, the Legislative Authority acts
in its administrative capacity.

§ 32.01  MEMBERS OF COUNCIL; ELECTION; TERMS OF OFFICE.



   (A)   Except as otherwise provided in division (B) or (C) of this
section, the legislative power of each municipality shall be vested in, and
exercised by, a Legislative Authority, composed of six members, who shall be
elected by the electors of the municipality at large, for terms of four years.



   (B)   The Legislative Authority may adopt an ordinance or resolution
that, if approved by a majority of the electors voting on the issue, would
reduce the number of members of the Legislative Authority to five. A
certified copy of the ordinance or resolution shall be filed with the Board
of Elections no later than 4:00 p.m. of the ninetieth day before the day of
the next election at which members of the Legislative Authority are to be
elected.



   (C)   The electors may propose a reduction in the number of members
of the Legislative Authority from six to five by initiative petition in
accordance with the procedure set forth in R.C. § 731.28.



   (D)   If a majority of the votes cast on the question proposed under
division (B) or (C) of this section is in the affirmative, the Legislative
Authority shall be composed of five members, who shall be elected at large,
for terms of four years. If members of the Legislative Authority have
staggered terms of office as required by this section, the decrease in number
of members shall be implemented as necessary over the next two municipal
elections at which members of the Legislative Authority would be elected. If
the Legislative Authority has adopted an ordinance or resolution to eliminate
staggered terms of office under division (E) of this section, the five
members shall be elected as set forth in division (E)(2)(b) of this section.



(R.C. § 731.09)



   (E)   (1)   The Legislative Authority may, by the adoption of an
ordinance or resolution to eliminate staggered terms of office, determine
that all members of the Legislative Authority shall be elected at the same
municipal election as provided for in this section.



      (2)   At the regular municipal election occurring not less
than 90 days after the certification of the ordinance or resolution to the
Board of Elections eliminating staggered terms of office, the following apply:



         (a)   If there are six members of the Legislative
Authority, the number of members eligible for election at that regular
municipal election shall be elected to two-year nonstaggered terms, and all
members of the Legislative Authority shall be elected to four-year
nonstaggered terms at all following municipal elections.



         (b)   If there are five members of the Legislative
Authority, a number of members that is one less than the number of members
that would otherwise be eligible for election at that regular municipal
election but for the first-time implementation of the new membership of five,
or, in the case of a village that has previously reduced its number of
members to five, then the number of members eligible for election at that
regular municipal election shall be elected to two-year nonstaggered terms,
and all members shall be elected to four-year nonstaggered terms at all
following municipal elections.



(R.C. § 731.091)



§ 32.02  PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE OF THE COUNCIL.



   (A)   At the first meeting in January of each year, the Council
shall immediately proceed to elect a President Pro Tempore from its own
number, who shall serve until the first meeting in January next after his
election.  The Council may provide employees for the village as it
determines, and employees may be removed at any regular meeting by a majority
of the members elected to the Council.



   (B)   When the Mayor is absent from the village, or is unable, for
any cause, to perform his duties, the President Pro Tempore shall be the
acting Mayor, and shall have the same powers and perform the same duties as
the Mayor.



(R.C. § 731.10)



§ 32.03  VACANCY WHEN PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE BECOMES MAYOR.



   When the President Pro Tempore of the Council becomes the Mayor, the
vacancy thus created shall be filled as provided in § 32.06, and the Council
shall elect another President Pro Tempore from its own number, who shall have
the same rights, powers, and duties as his predecessor.



(R.C. § 731.11)



§ 32.04  QUALIFICATIONS OF MEMBERS OF COUNCIL.



   Each member of the Council shall have resided in the village one year
immediately preceding the member's election, and shall be an elector of the
village.  No member of the Council shall hold any other public office, be
interested in any contract with the village, or hold employment with the
village, except that the member may be a notary public, a member of the state
militia, or a volunteer fireman of the village, provided that the member
shall not receive any compensation for his services as a volunteer fireman of
the village, in addition to his regular compensation as a member of the
Council.  Any  member who ceases to possess any of these qualifications, or
who removes from the village, shall forfeit the member's office. The purpose
of establishing a one-year residency requirement in this section is to
recognize that the state has a substantial and compelling interest in
encouraging qualified candidacies for election to the office of member of the
Council by ensuring that a candidate for the office has every opportunity to
become knowledgeable with and concerned about the problems and needs of the
area the candidate seeks to represent.  In enacting this requirement, the
general assembly finds that the one-year period is reasonably related to this
purpose, while leaving unimpaired a person's right to travel, to vote, and to
be a candidate for public office.



(R.C. § 731.12)



§ 32.05  COMPENSATION AND BONDS OF VILLAGE OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES.



   The Council shall fix the compensation and bonds of all officers,
clerks, and employees of the village, except as otherwise provided by law. 
The Council shall, in the case of elective officers, fix their compensation
for the ensuing term of office at a meeting held not later than five days
prior to the last day fixed by law for filing as a candidate for such
office.  All bonds shall be made with sureties subject to the approval of
the Mayor.  The compensation so fixed shall not be increased or diminished
during the term for which any officer is elected or appointed.  This section
does not prohibit the payment of any increased costs of continuing to provide
the identical benefits provided to an officer at the commencement of his term
of office.



(R.C. § 731.13)



§ 32.06  VACANCY.



   (A)   Except as otherwise provided in division (B) of this section,
when the office of a member of the Council becomes vacant, the vacancy shall
be filled by election by the Council for the unexpired term. If the Council
fails within 30 days to fill the vacancy, the Mayor shall fill it by
appointment, except that, subject to division (B) of this section, when the
vacancy occurs because of the operation of R.C. § 733.25, the successor
shall hold office only for the period the President Pro Tempore of the
Council holds the office of Mayor.



   (B)   When a vacancy occurs in the office of a member of the
legislative authority of a village with a population of less than 2,000
because of the operation of R.C. § 733.25, at the time the President Pro
Tempore becomes Mayor, the President Pro Tempore shall decide whether he or
she wishes to serve the remainder of his or her unexpired term as a member of
the legislative authority when the Mayor's successor is elected and qualified
in accordance with R.C. § 733.25. If the President Pro Tempore decides to
serve the remainder of his or her unexpired term as a member of the
legislative authority, the vacancy on the legislative authority shall not be
filled and the President Pro Tempore shall resume serving his or her
unexpired term on the legislative authority as soon as the Mayor's successor
is elected and qualified. If the President Pro Tempore decides not to resume
serving the remainder of his or her unexpired term as a member of the
legislative authority as soon as the Mayor's successor is elected and
qualified, then the vacancy in the office of the member of the legislative
authority shall be filled in accordance with this section.



(R.C. § 731.43(A))



§ 32.07  JUDGE OF ELECTION AND QUALIFICATION OF MEMBERS; QUORUM AND SPECIAL
MEETINGS.



   The Council shall be the judge of the election and qualification of its
members.  A majority of all the members elected shall be a quorum, but a
less number may adjourn from day to day and compel attendance of absent
members in a manner and under penalties as are prescribed by ordinance. The
legislative authority shall provide rules for the manner of calling special
meetings.



(R.C. § 731.44)



§ 32.08  RULES; JOURNAL; EXPULSION OF MEMBERS.



   The Council shall determine its own rules, and keep a journal of its
proceedings.  It may punish or expel any member for disorderly conduct or
violation of its rules, and declare his seat vacant for absence without valid
excuse, where the absence has continued for two months. No expulsion shall
take place without the concurrence of all the members elected, and until the
delinquent member has been notified of the charge against him, and has had an
opportunity to be heard.



(R.C. § 731.45)



§ 32.09  MEETINGS.



   (A)   (1)   There will be two regular monthly meetings of the
Council, to be held on the second and fourth Mondays of each month, except
for the month of December, when the Council will conduct one regular meeting
on the second Monday.



      (2)   Should the second meeting in the month of May fall on
the day designated as Memorial Day, the second meeting in May will be the

   (B)   Meetings will be conducted at 6:30 p.m. at the New Bremen
Municipal Building, located at 214 North Washington Street.

powers and duties as are granted to or imposed upon a Mayor under this
division.

costs he collects, including all such fines, forfeitures, fees, and costs
that are transferred to him by a Mayor's Court Magistrate, as provided in
R.C. § 733.40.

   (A)   The Mayor may appoint a person as Mayor's Court Magistrate to
hear and determine prosecutions and criminal cases in the Mayor's Court that
are within the jurisdiction of the Mayor's Court, as set forth in R.C. §
1905.01.  No person shall be appointed as a Mayor's Court Magistrate unless
the person has been admitted to the practice of law in this state and, for a
total of at least three years preceding the person's appointment or the
commencement of the person's service as magistrate, has been engaged in the
practice of law in this state or served as a judge of a court or record in
any jurisdiction in the United States, or both.



      (1)   A person appointed as a Mayor's Court Magistrate under
this division is entitled to hear and determine prosecutions and criminal
cases in the Mayor's Court that are within the jurisdiction of the Mayor's
Court, as set forth in R.C. § 1905.01. If the Mayor is prohibited from
hearing or determining a prosecution or cause that charges a person with a
violation of a village ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under
the influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse or
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol in
the blood, breath, or urine due to the operation of R.C. § 1905.03(C), or is
prohibited from hearing or determining any other prosecution or cause due to
the operation of R.C. § 1905.031(C), the prohibition against the Mayor
hearing or determining the prosecution or causes does not affect and shall
not be construed as affecting the jurisdiction or authority of a person
appointed as a Mayor's Court Magistrate under this division to hear and
determine the prosecution or cause in accordance with this section.  In
hearing and determining such prosecutions and causes, the Magistrate has the
same powers, duties, and authority as does the Mayor when conducting Mayor's
Court to hear and determine prosecutions and causes in general, including,
but not limited to, the power and authority to decide the prosecution or
cause, enter judgement, and impose sentence; the powers, duties, and
authority granted to the Mayor of Mayor's Court by this chapter, in relation
to the hearing and determination of prosecutions and causes in Mayor's Court;
and the powers, duties, and authority granted to the Mayors of Mayor's Court
by any other provisions of the Revised Code, in relation to the hearing and
determination of prosecutions and causes in Mayor's Court.  A judgement
entered and a sentence imposed by a Mayor's Court Magistrate do not have to
be reviewed or approved by the Mayor who appointed him, and have the same
force and effect as if they had been entered or imposed by the Mayor.



      (2)   A person appointed as a Mayor's Court Magistrate under
this division is not entitled to hear or determine any prosecution or
criminal cause other than prosecutions and causes that are within the
jurisdiction of the Mayor's Court, as set forth in R.C. § 1905.01.



      (3)   A municipality that a Mayor's Court Magistrate serves
shall pay the compensation for the services of the Magistrate, which shall be
either a fixed annual salary set by the Council or a fixed annual amount or
fees for services rendered set under a contract the Magistrate and the
village enter into.



   (B)   The appointment of a person as a Mayor's Court Magistrate
under division (A) of this section does not preclude the Mayor that appointed
him, subject to the limitation contained in R.C. § 1905.03 and the
limitation contained in R.C. § 1905.031, from also hearing and determining
prosecutions and criminal causes in the Mayor's Court that are within the
jurisdiction of the Mayor's Court, as set forth in R.C. § 1905.01.

omission of the political subdivision or of any of its employees in
connection with a governmental or proprietary function, as follows:



      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, political
subdivisions are liable for injury, death, or loss to persons or property
caused by the negligent operation of any motor vehicle by their employees
upon the public roads, highways, or streets when the employees are engaged
within the scope of their employment and authority.  The following are full
defenses to such liability:



         (a)   A member of a municipal corporation police
department or any other police agency was operating a motor vehicle while
responding to an emergency call and the operation of the vehicle did not
constitute willful or wanton misconduct;



         (b)   A member of a municipal corporation fire
department or any other firefighting agency was operating a motor vehicle
while engaged in duty at a fire, proceeding toward a place where a fire is in
progress or is believed to be in progress, or in answering any other
emergency alarm and the operation of the vehicle did not constitute willful
or wanton misconduct.



         (c)   A member of an emergency medical service owned or
operated by a political subdivision was operating a motor vehicle while
responding to or completing a call for emergency medical care or treatment,
the member was holding a valid operator's or chauffeur's license issued

willful or wanton misconduct, and the operation complies with the precautions
of R.C. § 4511.03.



      (2)   Except as otherwise provided in R.C. §§ 3314.07 and
3746.24, political subdivisions are liable for injury, death, or loss to
persons or property caused by the negligent performance of acts by their
employees with respect to proprietary functions of the political subdivisions.



      (3)   Except as otherwise provided in R.C. § 3746.24,
political subdivisions are liable for injury, death, or loss to persons or
property caused by their failure to keep public roads, highways, streets, 
avenues, alleys, sidewalks, bridges, aqueducts, viaducts, or public grounds
within the political subdivisions open, in repair, and free from nuisance,
except that it is a full defense to such liability, when a bridge within a
municipal corporation is involved, that the municipal corporation does not
have the responsibility for maintaining or inspecting the bridge.



      (4)   Except as otherwise provided in R.C. § 3746.24,
political subdivisions are liable for injury, death, or loss to persons or

performance of a governmental function, including, but not limited to, office
buildings and courthouses, but not including jails, places of juvenile
detention, workhouses, or any other detention facility, as defined in R.C. §
2921.01.



      (5)   In addition to the circumstances described in divisions
(B)(1) through (4) of this section, a political subdivision is liable for
injury, death, or loss to persons or property when civil liability is
expressly imposed upon the political subdivision by a section of the Revised
Code, including, but not limited to, R.C. §§ 2743.02 and 5591.37.  Civil
liability shall not be construed to exist under another section of this code
or the Revised Code merely because that section imposes a responsibility or
mandatory duty upon a political subdivision, because that section provides
for a criminal penalty, because of a general authorization in that section
that a political subdivision may sue and be sued, or because that section
uses the term “shall” in a provision pertaining to a political
subdivision.



   (C)   An order that denies a political subdivision or an employee of
a political subdivision the benefit of an alleged immunity from liability as
provided in this chapter or any other provision of the law is a final order.

unless the judgment or discretion was exercised with malicious purpose, in
bad faith, or in a wanton or reckless manner.

division (A)(7) of this section and in circumstances not covered by that

§ 36.07  LIABILITY INSURANCE.



   (A)   (1)   A political subdivision may use public funds to
secure insurance with respect to its and its employees' potential liability
in damages in civil actions for injury, death, or loss to persons or property
allegedly caused by an act or omission of the political subdivision or any of
its employees in connection with a governmental or proprietary function. The
insurance may be at the limits, for the circumstances, and subject to the
terms and conditions, that are determined by the political subdivision in its
discretion. The insurance may be for the period of time that is set forth in
specifications for competitive bids or, when competitive bidding is not
required, for the period of time that is mutually agreed upon by the
political subdivision and insurance company. The period of time does not have
to be, but can be, limited to the fiscal cycle under which the political
subdivision is funded and operated.



      (2)   (a)   Regardless of whether a political subdivision
procures a policy of liability insurance pursuant to division (A)(1) of this
section or otherwise, the political subdivision may establish and maintain a
self-insurance program relative to its and its employees' potential liability
in damages in civil actions for injury, death, or loss to persons or property
allegedly caused by an act or omission of the political subdivision or any of
its employees in connection with a governmental or proprietary function. The
political subdivision may reserve such funds as it deems appropriate in a
special fund that may be established pursuant to an ordinance or resolution
of the political subdivision and not subject to R.C. § 5705.12. The
political subdivision may allocate the costs of insurance of a self-insurance
program, or both, among the funds or accounts in the subdivision's treasury
on the basis of relative exposure and loss experience. The political
subdivision may require any deductibles under an insurance or self-insurance
program, or both, to be paid from funds or accounts in the subdivision’s
treasury from which a loss was directly attributable. If it so chooses, the
political subdivision may contract with any person, other political
subdivision, or regional council of governments for purposes of the
administration of such program.



         (b)   Political subdivisions that have established
self-insurance programs relative to their and their employees' potential
liability as described in division (A)(2)(a) of this section may mutually
agree that their self-insurance programs will be jointly administered in a
specific manner.



   (B)   The purchase of liability insurance, or the establishment and
maintenance of a self-insurance program, by a political subdivision does not
constitute a waiver of any immunity or defense of the political subdivision
or its employees, except that the political subdivision may specifically
waive any immunity or defense to which it or its employees may be entitled if
a provision to that effect is specifically included in the policy of
insurance or in a written plan of operation of the self-insurance program, or
if any, the legislative enactment of the political subdivision authorizing
the purchase of the insurance or the establishment and maintenance of the
self-insurance program. Such a specific waiver shall be only to the extent of
the insurance or self-insurance program coverage.



   (C)   The authorizations for political subdivisions to secure
insurance and to establish and maintain self-insurance programs in this
section are in addition to any other authority to secure insurance or to
establish and maintain self-insurance programs that is granted pursuant to
the Revised Code or the Ohio Constitution, and they are not in derogation of
any other authorization.



(R.C. § 2744.08)



   (D)   If a political subdivision, pursuant to division (A)(2)(a) of
this section or a joint self- insurance pool pursuant to R.C. § 2744.081,
has allocated costs to, or required the payment of deductibles from, funds or
accounts in the subdivision’s treasury, the subdivisions’s fiscal
officer, pursuant to ordinance or resolution of the Legislative Authority,
shall transfer amounts equal to those costs or deductibles from the funds or
accounts of the subdivision’s General Fund if both of the following occur:



      (1)   The subdivision requests payment from the employee
responsible for the funds or accounts for those costs or deductibles;



      (2)   The employee receiving the request fails to remit
payment within 45 days after the date of receipt of the request.



   (E)   The provisions of R.C. §§ 5705.14, 5705.15, and 5705.16 do
not apply to transfers made pursuant to division (D) of this section.

regulations.)



      (2)   (a)   Conduct by drivers constituting reasonable
suspicion must be witnessed by one supervisor or company official (two if
possible) trained in the detection of alcohol and drug use.  This
observation for alcohol must be based on the specific, contemporaneous,

odors of the driver. The observation for controlled substances may include
the indications of the chronic and withdrawal effects of controlled
substances.



         (b)   The village must ensure that persons designated to
determine whether reasonable suspicion exists to require a driver to be

test was not properly administered.



      (5)   A written record shall be made documenting the driver's
conduct with respect to an alcohol and/or controlled substance reasonable
suspicion and must be signed by the supervisor or company official who
observed the behavior.



      (6)   Please note that the possession of alcohol does not
constitute a need for a reasonable suspicion test as stated in this policy,

observations concerning the driver's appearance, behavior, speech or body
odors.



   (C)   Random testing.



      (1)   The village will utilize our third party administrator

the driver is performing safety-sensitive functions, immediately prior to or
after performing a safety-sensitive function.



      (4)   Drivers must submit to these tests when selected by a
random selection process utilized by the village.  These tests will not be
announced in advance and will be spread reasonably throughout the year. All
drivers will have an equal chance of getting drawn in every selection.



      (5)   After a driver is randomly selected for a test, the
driver must immediately proceed to the testing site upon notification of
being selected.



      (6)   Once a driver is notified of the requirement to take a
random alcohol and/or controlled substance test, provided that the driver was
performing a safety-sensitive function at the time of the notification, the
village will ensure that the driver ceases to perform the safety-sensitive
function and proceeds to the testing site as soon as possible.



      (7)   If a driver who has been randomly selected for testing
is on vacation or an extended medical absence, the village may either select
another driver (alternate) for testing or keep the original selection
confidential until the driver returns.



   (D)   Post-accident testing.  Important Note: Nothing in this
policy (or the regulations) should be construed as to require the delay of
necessary medical attention for injured persons following an accident, or to
prohibit a driver from obtaining assistance as needed to respond to the
accident or to obtain necessary emergency medical care.



      (1)   Drivers shall provide a breath and urine sample to be
tested for the use of alcohol and controlled substances as soon as possible

      (2)   As soon as practical, a post-accident test must take
place within two hours of the accident. If the alcohol test is not
accomplished within two hours by the village, a written record shall be made
stating the reasons the alcohol test was not promptly administered.  If the
test has not been accomplished within eight hours following the accident, the
village shall stop its attempt to administer the alcohol test and make and
retain in file a record of the reasons the alcohol test was not properly
administered.



      (3)   If a driver has not submitted to a controlled substance
test within 32 hours of the accident, the village shall stop its attempt to
administer the controlled substance test and make and retain in file a record

remain available, or the village will consider the driver to have refused to
submit to testing.



      (7)   The driver subject to post-accident testing must refrain
from consuming alcohol for eight hours following the accident, or until he or
she submits to an alcohol test, whichever comes first.

duty requiring the performance of a safety-sensitive function, after engaging
in prohibited conduct regarding alcohol misuse and/or controlled substance
use, the driver shall be tested for alcohol and/or controlled substances. In
order to return to duty, a driver must test negative for substance abuse and
have a breath alcohol concentration of less than 0.02.



      (2)   In the event that a driver is required to complete a
return-to-duty test, the driver must also be evaluated by a substance abuse
professional (SAP) and participate in the assistance program prescribed by
the SAP.



      (3)   Follow-up testing should be performed by the village on
an unannounced basis as instructed by the SAP. Drivers shall be subject to a
minimum of six follow-up controlled substance and/or alcohol tests in the

lease contract with him/her.



   (B)   The village will notify incumbent drivers of the results of
random, reasonable suspicion and post-accident alcohol and/or controlled

driver to acquire this information.



   (B)   The village will obtain and review the information listed
below from any previous employer the driver performed safety-sensitive
functions for in the previous two years. The village must request and review
this information before the driver first performs a safety-sensitive
function. The information will contain the following:



      (1)   Driver's breath alcohol test that indicated
concentrations of 0.04 or greater.



      (2)   Positive controlled substance tests.

return-to-duty test, and been subject to follow-up testing.



(Ord. 1995-11-34, passed - -95)



PUBLIC RECORDS POLICY



§ 38.30     PUBLIC RECORDS DEFINED; EXEMPTIONS.



   (A)   Under Ohio law, a public office may only create records that
are necessary for the adequate and proper documentation of the organization,
functions, policies, decisions, procedures and essential transactions of the
agency and for the agency's activities.



   (B)   In accordance with the Ohio Revised Code and court rulings,
"records" are defined as those items that meet all of the following:



      (1)   Any document, device, or item, regardless of physical
form or characteristic, including an electronic record (which includes but is
not limited to e-mail or other record created, generated, sent, communicated,
received, or stored by electronic means);



      (2)   That is created or received by, or coming under the
jurisdiction of a public office; and



      (3)   That documents the organization, functions, policies,
decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities of the office.



   (C)   The determination of whether a specific item constitutes a
"record" will depend on the facts and circumstances surrounding the
particular item requested. The Ohio Supreme Court has imposed an actual use
standard in defining a "record," which means that an item is not
automatically a "record" simply because the public office could (but did not)
use a document it received to carry out its duties and responsibilities.
Furthermore, a public office is not required to create new records to respond
to a public records request, even if it is only a matter of compiling
information from existing records.



   (D)   Organization; maintenance; availability.



      (1)   It is the policy of the Village of New Bremen, Ohio,
that, as required by Ohio law, records will be organized and maintained so
that they are made available for inspection to any person at all reasonable
times during regular business hours.



      (2)   Copies will be made available upon request within a
reasonable period of time.



      (3)   A current record retention schedule will be readily
available to the public upon request.



   (E)   Exempt records.



      (1)   Not all of the Village of New Bremen's records are
"public records." Certain records are exempt from the Public Records Act.
Exempt records include records:



         (a)   The release of which is prohibited by state or
federal law, or



         (b)   That are subject to an express exception set forth
in Ohio's Public Records Act, which may be released only if the Village of
New Bremen decides to waive the express exception.



      (2)   Examples of records, the release of which is prohibited
by state or federal law, include, but are not limited to, the following:



         (a)   Attorney-client privileged information;



         (b)   Records of a certified public accountant or public
accountant in the performance of an audit of a public office;



         (c)   Federal tax returns (26 U.S.C. 6103(a));



         (d)   Criminal background information and other law
enforcement information on the LEADS/CCH/NCIC computer database (42 U.S.C.
3789g);



         (e)   Records that have been sealed pursuant to a
statutorily authorized court order;



         (f)   Peace officer's home address during the pendency
of a criminal case in which the officer is a witness or arresting officer; and



         (g)   Employee's and their family members records that
were created for purposes of the Family Medical Leave Act or the Americans
with Disabilities Act (29 CFR 825.500(g) and 1630.14(c)(1)).



      (3)   Examples of records that are subject to an express
exception set forth in Ohio's Public Records Act, which may be released only
if the Village of New Bremen decides to waive the express exception include,
but are not limited to, the following:



         (a)   Peace officer, firefighter, EMT, prosecutor,
assistant prosecutor, children's service worker or corrections officer,
residential and familial information;



         (b)   Records that pertain to a patient's medical
history, diagnosis, prognosis, or medical condition and that were general and
maintained in the process of medical treatment;



         (c)   Records that contain information that was
specifically compiled in reasonable anticipation of, or in defense of, a
civil or criminal action or proceeding; and



         (d)   Records that pertain to a law enforcement matter
of a criminal, quasicriminal, civil, or administrative nature and that, if
released, would create a high probability of disclosing any of the following:



            1.   The identity of an uncharged suspect,



            2.   The identity of a confidential source,



            3.   Specific confidential investigatory
techniques or procedures;



            4.   Specific investigative work product; or



            5.   Information that would endanger the life or
physical safety of law enforcement personnel, a crime victim, a witness, or a
confidential source.



      (4)   The exemptions to the Public Records Act will be
narrowly construed by this office in the favor of disclosure. This office may
seek a legal review prior to determining whether or not an exception applies.

§ 38.31  RECORD REQUESTS.



   Each request for public records should be evaluated for a response
using the following guidelines:



   (A)   Although no specific language is required to make a request,
the requester must at least identify the records requested with sufficient
clarity to allow this office to identify, retrieve, and review the records.
If a requester makes an ambiguous or overly broad request or has difficulty
in making a request for copies or inspection of public records such that this
office cannot reasonably identify what public records are being requested,
then this office may deny the request. In such case, this office will provide
the requester with an opportunity to revise the request by informing him or
her of the manner in which records are maintained by the office and accessed
in the ordinary course of this office's duties.



   (B)   The requester does not have to put a records request in
writing, and does not have to provide his or her identity or the intended use
of the requested public record. However, the records custodian may ask for a
written request and may ask for the requestor's identity and/or intended use
of the information requested if it would benefit the requestor by helping the
public office identify, locate or deliver the records being sought, and the
requestor is informed that a written request and the requestor's identity and
intended use of the information requested are not required.



   (C)   This office will permit a requester to choose to have public
record duplicated upon paper, upon the same medium which this office keeps
it, or upon any other medium which this office determines that it reasonably
can be duplicated as an integral part of the normal operations of this
office. This office is not required to allow the requester to make the copies
of the public record.



   (D)   Public records should be available for inspection at all
reasonable times during regular business hours. Public records should be made
available for inspection promptly. The records of this office will be made
available for inspection during normal administrative hours. Copies of public
records should be made available within a reasonable period of time.  The
determination of the terms "prompt" and "reasonable" take into account the
volume of records requested; the proximity of the location where the records
are stored; and the necessity for any legal review of the records requested.



   (E)   Each request should be evaluated for an estimated length of
time required to gather the records. Routine requests for records should be
satisfied immediately if feasible to do so. Routine requests include, but are
not limited to, meeting minutes (both in draft and final form), resolutions,
budgets, etc.



   (F)   (1)   Upon request, this office will provide copies of
public records to a requester by United States mail or by any other delivery
means or transmission that this office deems reasonable.



      (2)   This office will limit to ten the number of copies of
public records provided per month to a requester by United States Mail,
unless the requester certifies in writing that he or she does not intend to
use or forward the requested records, or the information contained in them,
for commercial purposes. (The word "commercial" should be narrowly construed
and does not include reporting or gathering news, reporting or gathering
information to assist citizen oversight or understanding of the operation or
activities of government, or nonprofit educational research).



   (G)   By Ohio law, this office is not required to permit a person
who is incarcerated pursuant to a criminal conviction or a juvenile
adjudication to inspect or to obtain a copy of any public record concerning a
criminal investigation or prosecution or concerning what would be a criminal
investigation if the subject of the investigation or prosecution were an
adult, unless the judge who imposed the sentence or made the adjudication
with respect to the person, or the judge's successor in office, finds that
the information sought in the public record is necessary to support what
appears to be a justifiable claim of the person.



   (H)   This office, in response to a written request made and signed
by a journalist, which must include the journalist's name and title and the
name and address of the journalist's employer and which states that the
disclosure of the information sought would be in the public interest, will
provide the address of the actual personal residence of anyone employed by
this office as a peace officer, firefighter, EMT, prosecutor, assistant
prosecutor, children's services worker, or corrections officer, and, if such
employee's spouse, former spouse, or child is employed by a public office,
the name and address of that public office.



   (I)   (1)   Any denial of public records requested, in part or in
whole, should include an explanation, including legal authority, as to why
the request was denied. If the initial request was provided in writing, the
explanation for denial will be provided to the requester in writing.



      (2)   If portions of a record are public and portions are
exempt, the exempt portions should be redacted and the rest released. If
there are redactions, the office will notify the requester of any redaction
or make the redaction plainly visible. Each redaction should be accompanied
by a supporting explanation, including legal authority, as to why the
redaction was made.



      (3)   Any denial of a records request in part or in whole, or
any redaction contained on record to be released shall be reviewed and
approved by the Village Solicitor or his or her designee.



   (J)   This office has no duty to provide records acquired after a
request for records is complete.

§ 38.32     COSTS FOR PUBLIC RECORDS.



   Those seeking public records should be charged only the actual cost of
making copies, unless the cost is otherwise set by statute. Employee time
should not be calculated into the charge for copying a public record.
However, in the event that circumstances make it reasonable for this office
to hire an outside contractor to make copies of requested records, the
requester will be charged the actual cost paid to the outside contractor for
the copying service. (R.C. 149.43(F)(2)(a)). These circumstances may include
but not limited to a lack of in-house photocopying resources or labor. This
office has no duty to provide copies of public records free of charge to
someone who indicates an inability or unwillingness to pay for them.



   (A)   The charge for the paper copies is $0.10 per page.



   (B)   This office may require a requester to pay in advance the cost
involved in providing the copy of the public record, as requested.



   (C)   Upon request, this office will provide copies of public
records to a requester by United States mail or by any other delivery means
or transmission that this office deems reasonable. This office may require
such a requester to pay in advance the cost of postage or costs incurred for
other supplies used in the mailing, delivery, or transmission.



   (D)   There may be instances when this office may be able to provide
copies made-in-house without disrupting its normal functions, but only over
an extended period of time. In that instance, this office may offer the
requester the options of:



      (1)   Having the documents produced through a faster method by
employing temporary personnel and equipment,



      (2)   Using an external private contractor, or



      (3)   Having the documents produced in-house by this public
office's normal staff and equipment in a less efficient and more
time-consuming manner.

§ 38.33     FAILURE TO RESPOND TO A PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST.



   This office recognizes the legal and non-legal consequences of failure
to properly respond to public records request. In addition to the distrust in
government that failure to comply may cause, this office's failure to comply
with a request may result in the requester commencing a mandamus action
against this office in either the court of common pleas, in the court of
appeals, or in the Supreme Court of Ohio. The court may order this office to
comply with the Public Records Act, as well as order this office to pay
statutory damages of $100 for each business day (beginning with the day the
requester files the mandamus action) during which this public office failed
to comply (up to a maximum of $1,000), as well as court costs and the
requester's reasonable attorney fees.

IDENTITY THEFT POLICY



§ 38.50  BACKGROUND.



   The risk to the municipality, its employees and customers from data
loss and identity theft is of significant concern to the municipality and can
be reduced only through the combined efforts of every employee and contractor.



(Ord. 2008-10-20, passed 11-25-08)



§ 38.51  PURPOSE.



   (A)   The municipality adopts this sensitive information policy to
help protect employees, customers, contractors and the municipality from

federal law regarding identity theft protection.



   (B)   This policy enables the municipality to protect existing
customers, reducing risk from identity fraud, and minimize potential damage
to the municipality from fraudulent new accounts. The program will help the
municipality:

activity within new or existing covered accounts;



      (2)   Detect risks when they occur in covered accounts;



      (3)   Respond to risks to determine if fraudulent activity has
occurred and act if fraud has been attempted or committed; and



      (4)   Update the program periodically, including reviewing the
accounts that are covered and the identified risks that are part of the
program.

Furthermore, this section should be read in conjunction with the Ohio Public
Records Act and the municipality's open records policy. If an employee is
uncertain of the sensitivity of a particular piece of information, he or she
should contact their supervisor. In the event that the municipality cannot
resolve a conflict between this policy and the Ohio Public Records Act, the
municipality will contact their legal authority.



   (B)   Hard Copy Distribution.  Each employee and contractor
performing work for the municipality will comply with the following policies:

other storage space containing documents with sensitive information will be
locked when not in use.

information and record retention areas will be locked at the end of each
workday or when unsupervised.



      (3)   Desks, workstations, work areas, printers and fax
machines, and common shared work areas will be cleared of all documents
containing sensitive information when not in use.

shredding device. Locked shred bins are labeled "Confidential paper shredding
and recycling." Municipal records, however, may only be destroyed in

using approved municipal e-mail. All sensitive information must be encrypted
when stored in an electronic format.



      (2)   Any sensitive information sent externally must be
encrypted and password protected and only to approved recipients.
Additionally, a statement such as this should be included in the e-mail:



         "This message may contain confidential and/or proprietary
information and is intended for the person/entity to whom it was originally
addressed. Any use by others is strictly prohibited. "



(Ord. 2008-10-20, passed 11-25-08)



§ 38.54  ADDITIONAL IDENTITY THEFT PREVENTION PROGRAM.



   If the municipality maintains certain covered accounts pursuant to
federal legislation, the municipality may include the additional program
details.



   (A)   Covered accounts.  A covered account includes any account
that involves or is designed to permit multiple payments or transactions.
Every new and existing customer account that meets the following criteria is
covered by this program:



      (1)   Business, personal and household accounts for which
there is a reasonably foreseeable risk of identity theft; or



      (2)   Business, personal and household accounts for which
there is a reasonably foreseeable risk to the safety or soundness of the
municipality from identity theft, including financial, operational,
compliance, reputation, or litigation risks.



   (B)   Red flags.



      (1)   The following red flags are potential indicators of
fraud. Any time a red flag, or a situation closely resembling a red flag, is
apparent, it should be investigated for verification.



         (a)   Alerts, notifications or warnings from a consumer
reporting agency;



         (b)   A fraud or active duty alert included with a
consumer report;



         (c)   A notice of credit freeze from a consumer
reporting agency in response to a request for a consumer report; or



         (d)   A notice of address discrepancy from a consumer
reporting agency as defined in § 334.82(b) of the Fairness and Accuracy in
Credit Transactions Act.



      (2)   Red flags also include consumer reports that indicate a
pattern of activity inconsistent with the history and usual pattern of
activity of an applicant or customer, such as:



         (a)   A recent and significant increase in the volume of
inquiries;



         (b)   An unusual number of recently established credit
relationships;



         (c)   A material change in the use of credit, especially
with respect to recently established credit relationships; or



         (d)   An account that was closed for cause or identified
for abuse of account privileges by a financial institution or creditor.



   (C)   Suspicious documents.



      (1)   Documents provided for identification that appear to
have been altered or forged.



      (2)   The photograph or physical description on the
identification is not consistent with the appearance of the applicant or
customer presenting the identification.



      (3)   Other information on the identification is not
consistent with information provided by the person opening a new covered
account or customer presenting the identification.



      (4)   Other information on the identification is not
consistent with readily accessible information that is on file with the
municipality, such as a signature card or a recent check.



      (5)   An application appears to have been altered or forged,
or gives the appearance of having been destroyed and reassembled.



   (D)   Suspicious personal identifying information.



      (1)   Personal identifying information provided is
inconsistent when compared against external information sources used by the
municipality. For example:



         (a)   The address does not match any address in the
consumer report;



         (b)   The Social Security number (SSN) has not been
issued or is listed on the Social Security Administration's Death Master
File; or



         (c)   Personal identifying information provided by the
customer is not consistent with other personal identifying information
provided by the customer. For example, there is a lack of correlation between
the SSN range and date of birth.



      (2)   Personal identifying information provided is associated
with known fraudulent activity as indicated by internal or third-party
sources used by the municipality. For example, the address on an application
is the same as the address provided on a fraudulent application.



      (3)   Personal identifying information provided is of a type
commonly associated with fraudulent activity as indicated by internal or
third-party sources used by the municipality. For example:



         (a)   The address on an application is fictitious, a
mail drop, or a prison; or



         (b)   The phone number is invalid or is associated with
a pager or answering service.



      (4)   The SSN provided is the same as that submitted by other
persons opening an account or other customers.



      (5)   The address or telephone number provided is the same as
or similar to the address or telephone number submitted by an unusually large
number of other customers or other persons opening accounts.



      (6)   The customer or the person opening the covered account
fails to provide all required personal identifying information on an
application or in response to notification that the application is incomplete.



      (7)   Personal identifying information provided is not
consistent with personal identifying information that is on file with the
municipality.



      (8)   When using security questions (mother's maiden name,
pet's name, etc.), the person opening the covered account or the customer
cannot provide authenticating information beyond that which generally would
be available from a wallet or consumer report.



   (E)   Unusual use of, or suspicious activity related to, the covered
account.



      (1)   Shortly following the notice of a change of address for
a covered account, the municipality receives a request for new, additional,
or replacement goods or services, or for the addition of authorized users on
the account.



      (2)   A new revolving credit account is used in a manner
commonly associated with known patterns of fraud patterns. For example, the
customer fails to make the first payment or makes an initial payment but no
subsequent payments.



      (3)   A covered account is used in a manner that is not
consistent with established patterns of activity on the account. There is,
for example:



         (a)   Nonpayment when there is no history of late or
missed payments;



         (b)   A material change in purchasing or usage patterns.



      (4)   A covered account that has been inactive for a
reasonably lengthy period of time is used (taking into consideration the type
of account, the expected pattern of usage and other relevant factors).



      (5)   Mail sent to the customer is returned repeatedly as
undeliverable although transactions continue to be conducted in connection
with the customer's covered account.



      (6)   The municipality is notified that the customer is not
receiving paper account statements.



      (7)   The municipality is notified of unauthorized charges or
transactions in connection with a customer's covered account.



      (8)   The municipality receives notice from customers, victims
of identity theft, law enforcement authorities, or other persons regarding
possible identity theft in connection with covered accounts held by the
municipality.



      (9)   The municipality is notified by a customer, a victim of
identity theft, a law enforcement authority, or any other person that it has
opened a fraudulent account for a person engaged in identity theft.



(Ord. 2008-10-20, passed 11-25-08)



§ 38.55  RESPONDING TO RED FLAGS.



   (A)   Once potentially fraudulent activity is detected, an employee
must act quickly as a rapid appropriate response can protect customers and
the municipality from damages and loss.



      (1)   Once potentially fraudulent activity is detected, gather
all related documentation and write a description of the situation. Present
this information to the New Bremen Police Chief for determination.



      (2)   The designated authority will complete additional
authentication to determine whether the attempted transaction was fraudulent
or authentic.



   (B)   If a transaction is determined to be fraudulent, appropriate
actions must be taken immediately. Actions may include:



      (1)   Canceling the transaction;



      (2)   Notifying and cooperating with appropriate law
enforcement;



      (3)   Determining the extent of liability of the municipality;
and



      (4)   Notifying the actual customer that fraud has been
attempted.



(Ord. 2008-10-20, passed 11-25-08)



§ 38.56  PERIODIC UPDATES TO PLAN.



   (A)   At periodic intervals established in the program, or as
required, the program will be reevaluated to determine whether all aspects of
the program are up to date and applicable in the current business environment.



   (B)   Periodic reviews will include an assessment of which accounts
are covered by the program.



   (C)   As part of the review, red flags may be revised, replaced or
eliminated. Defining new red flags may also be appropriate.



   (D)   Actions to take in the event that fraudulent activity is
discovered may also require revision to reduce damage to the municipality and
its customers.



(Ord. 2008-10-20, passed 11-25-08)



§ 38.57  PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION.



   (A)   Involvement of management.



      (1)   The Identity Theft Prevention Program shall not be
operated as an extension to existing fraud prevention programs, and its
importance warrants the highest level of attention.



      (2)   The Identity Theft Prevention Program is the
responsibility of the governing body. Approval of the initial plan must be
appropriately documented and maintained.



      (3)   Operational responsibility of the program is delegated
to the Utility Office.



   (B)   Staff training.



      (1)   Staff training shall be conducted for all employees,
officials and contractors for whom it is reasonably foreseeable that they may
come into contact with accounts or personally identifiable information that
may constitute a risk to the municipality or its customers.



      (2)   The Utility Office is responsible for ensuring identity
theft training for all requisite employees and contractors.



      (3)   Employees must receive annual training in all elements
of this policy.



      (4)   To ensure maximum effectiveness, employees may continue
to receive additional training as changes to the program are made.



   (C)   Oversight of service provider arrangements.



      (1)   It is the responsibility of the municipality to ensure
that the activities of all service providers are conducted in accordance with
reasonable policies and procedures designed to detect, prevent, and mitigate
the risk of identity theft.



      (2)   A service provider that maintains its own identity theft
prevention program, consistent with the guidance of the red flag rules and
validated by appropriate due diligence, may be considered to be meeting these
requirements.



      (3)   Any specific requirements should be specifically
addressed in the appropriate contract arrangements.

CAPITAL OUTLAY POLICY



§ 38.65  INTRODUCTION.



   Capital outlays are defined as “tangible or intangible outlays that
are used in the operation of the Village and have an initial useful life
extending beyond a minimum reporting period of three fiscal years, such as
land, improvements to land, buildings, building improvements, vehicles,
machinery, equipment, infrastructure, and certain intangible outlays.”
Examples of infrastructure include roads, bridges, curbs, sidewalks, drainage
systems, dams, water and sewer systems, electric generation and distribution
systems, park improvements, and lighting systems. Examples of intangible
outlays include water rights and computer software costs. Ownership is the
basis for reporting capital outlays with the exception of situations where
more than one party is involved. In these cases, the party who has the risks
and benefits of ownership, but not necessarily the title or deed, or who is
primarily responsible for the outlay’s management and maintenance shall
record the capital outlay. In governmental accounting, there are generally
two types of capital outlays. There are outlays that belong to the general
government (i.e. General Capital Outlays) and outlays that belong to
proprietary funds (i.e. Enterprise and Internal Service Funds).



(Ord. 2017-3-7, passed 5-22-17)



§ 38.66  PURPOSE.



   The purpose of this policy is to provide a consistent and accurate
method of accounting for capital outlays of the Village of New Bremen. This
capital outlay policy is designed to maximize the value of the outlay and its
usefulness to the residents and customers of the Village of New Bremen.



(Ord. 2017-3-7, passed 5-22-17)



§ 38.67  PROCEDURE.



   The Village of New Bremen shall keep records of capital outlays having
an estimated or actual value of $2,000 or more and/or an estimated useful
life of three years or more. Expenditures identified by the Village Fiscal
Officer and/or Utility Superintendent as a specific Enterprise Fund capital
project (e.g. rebuild of “Main Street” infrastructure) which, by the
parts/expenditures by themselves may fall under this threshold, will still be
treated as capital expenditures and categorized as capital outlay
accordingly. Also, improvements or replacements to the utility infrastructure
which may by themselves be less than the threshold, will be considered
capital outlay expenditures. Otherwise, outlays falling below this threshold
limit shall be expensed from the appropriate account in the year acquired.
The major classes of capital outlays are laid out in Exhibit A of Ord.
2017-3-7.

§ 40.08  DUTIES OF THE TAX COMMISSIONER.



   (A)   (1)   The Tax Commissioner is hereby charged with the
enforcement of provisions of this chapter and is hereby empowered, subject to
the approval of the Board of Review, to adopt and promulgate and enforce
rules and regulations relating to any matter or thing pertaining to the
collection of taxes and the administration and enforcement of the provisions
of this chapter, for the re-examination and correction of returns.



      (2)   The Commissioner is authorized to arrange for the
payment of unpaid taxes, interest, and penalties on a schedule of installment
payments, when the taxpayer has proven to the Commissioner that due to
certain hardship conditions, he is unable to pay the full amount of the tax
due.  Such authorization shall not be granted until proper returns are filed
by the taxpayer for all amounts owed by him under this chapter.



      (3)   Failure to make any deferred payments when due, shall
cause the total unpaid amount, including penalty and interest, to become

shall apply.



   (B)   It shall be the duty of the Tax Commissioner to prescribe the
form and method of keeping the accounts and reports to be rendered to his
office, and he shall maintain accurate records showing the amount received
from each taxpayer and the date of said receipt.  The Tax Commissioner is
hereby charged with the internal audit of all accounts and returns including
the re-examination and correction of the returns.  The Tax Commissioner
shall further fix the amount of tax due from a taxpayer who fails to file a
return or who has filed a return which does not show the proper amount of tax
due after he has established the same from an audit or examination of the
taxpayer's income and shall send to the taxpayer by certified mail a written
statement showing the amount of tax so fixed, together with the interest and
penalties thereon, if any.

the village and shall make a written report to Council each month of all
monies collected during the preceding month.

the attendance of all persons before him, whether as parties or witnesses,
whenever he believes such persons have knowledge of such income.



   (C)   The refusal to produce books, papers, records, and federal
income tax returns or the refusal to submit to such examination by any
employer subject to tax or required to withhold tax or the failure of any
person to comply with the provisions of this section or with an order of
subpoena of the Commissioner authorized hereby shall be deemed a violation of
this chapter punishable as prescribed in § 40.12.

information in violation of this section shall upon conviction thereof be
deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be subject to a fine or penalty of
not more than $500 or imprisoned not more than six months or both.  Each
disclosure shall constitute a separate offense.

   (C)   A penalty shall not be assessed on an additional tax
assessment made by the Commissioner when a return has been filed in good

penalty nor interest shall be assessed on any additional tax assessment

   (D)   Upon recommendation of the Commissioner, the Board of Review

or in the case of failure to file a return. In other cases in which the
Director of Internal Revenue and the taxpayer have executed a waiver of the
federal statute of limitations, the period within which an additional
assessment may be made by the Tax Commissioner shall be extended three years
from the time of the final determination of the federal tax liability.



   (B)   All delinquent tax accounts outsourced by the village to a law
firm or collection agency shall be assessed a collection fee on the entire
balance due equal to the contingency collection percentage charged by each
law firm or collection agency as set forth in the collection contract with
the village. The balance due prior to the assessment of the collection fee
shall be the principle balance due plus interest, penalties, late fees,
and/or other permissible fines, penalties and charges.  The collection fee
shall be assessed against all payments made by the taxpayer whether or not
the balance due is paid in full with one payment, or over time with more than
one payment. The assessment of the collection fee shall be made by the law
firm or collection agency after the delinquent account has been outsourced
for collection.  Additionally, court costs shall be added to the balance due
as they are incurred but shall not be assessed a collection fee.

A.   Basis.

      a.   In the case of residents of the village, an annual tax of
1.5% is imposed on all salaries, wages, commissions, and other compensation
earned during the effective period of the ordinance.  For the purpose of
determining the tax on the earnings of resident taxpayers taxed under §
40.03, the source of the earnings and the place or places in or at which the
services were rendered, are immaterial.  All such earnings wherever earned
or paid are taxable.



      b.   The following are items which are subject to the tax
imposed by § 40.03(A)(1):



         .1   Salaries, wages, bonuses, and incentive payments
earned by an individual whether directly or through an agent and whether in
cash or in property for services rendered during the tax period as:



            .01   An officer, director, or employee of a
corporation (including charitable and other nonprofit organizations), joint
stock association, or joint stock company;



            .02   An employee (as distinguished from a partner
or member) of a partnership, limited partnership, or any form of
unincorporated enterprise owned by two or more persons;



            .03   An employee (as distinguished from a
proprietor) of a business, trade, or profession conducted by an individual
owner;



            .04   An officer or employee (whether elected,
appointed or commissioned) of the United States government or of a
corporation created and owned or controlled by the United States government,
or any of its agencies; or of the state of Ohio or any of its political
subdivisions or agencies thereof; or any foreign country or dependency,
except as provided in § 40.03;



            .05   An employee of any other entity or person,
whether based upon hourly, daily, weekly, semi-monthly, monthly, annual, unit
of production, or piece work rates; and whether paid by an individual,
partnership, association, corporation (including charitable and other
nonprofit corporations), governmental administration, agency, authority,
board, body, branch, bureau, department, division, subdivision, section or
unit, or any other entity.



         .2   Commissions earned by a taxpayer whether directly
or through an agent and whether in cash or in property for services rendered
during the effective period of the ordinance, regardless of how computed or
by whom or wheresoever paid.



            .01   If amounts received as a drawing account
exceed the commissions earned and the excess is not subject to the demand of
the employer for repayment, the tax is payable on the amounts received as a
drawing account.



            .02   Amounts received from an employer for
expenses and used as such by the individual receiving them are not deemed to
be compensation if the employer deducts such expenses or advances as such
from his gross income for the purpose of determining his net profits taxable
under federal law, and the employee is not required to include such receipts
as income on his federal income tax return.



            .03   If commissions are included in the net
earnings of the trade, business, profession, enterprise, or activity, carried
on by an unincorporated entity of which the individual receiving such
commission is owner or part owner and therefore subject to the tax §§
40.03(A)(3) and (4), they shall not be taxed under § 40.03(A)(1).



         .3   Fees, unless such fees are properly includible as
part of the net profits of a trade, business, profession, or enterprise
regularly carried on by an unincorporated entity owned or partly owned by
said individual and such net profits are subject to the tax under §
40.03(A)(3).



         .4   Other compensation, including tips, bonuses, or
gifts of any type, and including compensation paid to domestic servants,
casual employees, and other types of employees.



         .5   Payments made to employees by an employer as
vacation wages are taxable.  Payments made to an employee by an employer
under a wage continuation plan during periods of disability or sickness, are
taxable.



      c.   Where compensation is paid or received in property, its
fair market value at the time of receipts shall be subject to the tax and to
withholding.  Board, lodging, and similar items received by an employee in
lieu of additional cash compensation shall be included in earnings at their
fair market value.



         .1   In the case of domestics and other employees whose
duties require them to live at their place of employment or assignment, board
and lodging shall not be considered as wages or compensation earned.



   2.   Nonresident employee.



      a.   In the case of individuals who are not residents of the
village, there is imposed under § 40.03(A)(2) a tax of 1.5%) on all
salaries, wages, commissions, and other compensation earned during the
effective period of the ordinance for work done or services performed or
rendered within the village, whether such compensation or remuneration is
received or earned directly or through an agent and whether paid in cash or
in property.  The location of the place from which payment is made is
immaterial.



      b.   The items subject to tax under § 40.03(A)(2) are the
same as those listed and defined in this Article III-A.  (For the methods of
computing the extent of such work or services performed within the village,
in cases involving compensation for personal services partly within and
partly without the village, see Article VI.A.6.)



   3.   Resident unincorporated business.



      a.   Imposition of tax on net profits of resident
unincorporated businesses.



         .1   In the case of resident unincorporated businesses,
professions, enterprises, undertakings, or other entities conducted,
operated, engaged in, prosecuted, or carried on irrespective of whether such
taxpayer has an office or place of business in the village, there is imposed
an annual tax of 1.5% on the net profits earned, accrued or received during
the effective period of the ordinance attributable to village, under the
formula or separate accounting method provided for in § 40.03, derived from
sales made, work done, or services performed or rendered, and business or
other activities conducted in the village.



         .2   The tax imposed on resident associations or other
unincorporated entities owned by two or more persons is upon the entities
rather than the individual members or owners thereof, but the tax imposed on
an unincorporated resident entity owned by one person is upon the individual
owner.  (For tax on that part of a resident owner's distributive share of
net profits not taxed against the entity, see Article III.A.3.b.)



         .3   The tax imposed by § 40.03(A)(3)(a) is imposed on
all resident unincorporated entities having net profits attributable to the
village under the method of allocation provided for in the ordinance,
regardless of where the owner or owners of such resident unincorporated
business entity reside.



         .4   Resident unincorporated entities owned by two or
more persons all of whom are residents of the village shall disregard the
method of allocation provided for in the ordinance and pay the tax on their
entire net profits thereof.  In such case, the tax paid by the entity shall
constitute all tax due from the owners or members of the entity for their
distributive share of such net profits; however, an additional return shall
be required from any such owner or member having taxable income other than
the distributive share of the net profits from the entity.



      b.   Imposition of tax on a resident's distributive share of
profits of a resident unincorporated business entity, not attributable to the
village.



         .1   A resident individual who is sole owner of a
resident unincorporated entity shall disregard the business allocation
formula and pay the tax on the entire net profits of his resident
unincorporated business entity.



         .2   In the case of a resident individual partner or
part owner of a resident unincorporated entity, there is imposed an annual
tax of 1.5% on such individual's distributive share of net profits earned,
accrued, or received during the effective period of the ordinance not
attributable to the village, under the method of allocation provided for in
§ 40.03, and not taxed against the entity.



(See Article XIV.)



   4.   Nonresident unincorporated business.



      a.   Imposition of tax on net profits of nonresident
unincorporated businesses.



         .1   In the case of nonresident unincorporated
businesses, professions, enterprises, undertakings, or other activities
conducted, operated, engaged in, prosecuted, or carried on, there is imposed
an annual tax of 1.5% on the net profits earned, accrued, or received during
the effective period of the ordinance attributable to the village, under the
formula or separate accounting method provided for in the ordinance.



         .2   The tax imposed on nonresident unincorporated
entities owned by two or more persons is upon the entities rather than the
individual members or owners thereof.  (For tax on that part of a resident
owner's distributive share of net profits not taxed against the entity, see
Article III.A.4.b.



         .3   Nonresident unincorporated entities owned by two or
more persons all of whom are residents of the village may elect to disregard
the method of allocation provided for in the ordinance and pay the tax on the
entire net profits.  In such case, the tax paid by the entity shall
constitute all tax due from the owners or members of the entity for their
distributive share of the net profits; however, a return shall be required
from such owner or member having taxable income other than the distributive
share of the net profit from the entity.  (See Article XIV for credits.)



      b.   Imposition of tax on resident's share of profits of a
nonresident unincorporated business entity not attributable to the village. 
(See Article XIV for credits.)



         .1   A resident individual who is sole owner of a
nonresident unincorporated business entity shall disregard the business
allocation formula and pay the tax on the entire net profits of his
unincorporated entity.



         .2   In the case of a resident individual partner or
part owner of a nonresident unincorporated entity, there is imposed an annual
tax of 1.5% on such individual's distributive share of net profits earned,
accrued, or received during the effective period of the ordinance not
attributable to the village under the method of allocation provided for in §
40.03 and not taxed against the entity.



   5.   Imposition of tax on net profits of corporations.



      a.   In the case of corporations, whether domestic or foreign
and whether or not such corporations have an office or place of business in
the village, there is imposed an annual tax of 1.5% on the net profits
earned, received, or accrued during the effective period of the ordinance
attributable to the village under the formula or separate accounting method
provided for in the ordinance.



      b.   In determining whether a corporation is conducting a
business or other activity in the village, the provisions of Article III.B.
of these regulations shall be applicable.



      c.   Corporations which are required by the provisions of R.C.
§§ 5727.38 through 5727.41, inclusive, to pay an excise tax in any taxable
year as defined by the ordinance, may exclude that part of their gross
receipts upon which the excise tax is paid.  In such case, expenses incurred
in the production of such gross receipts shall not be deducted in computing
net profits subject to the tax imposed by the ordinance.



   6.   Amplification.  In amplification of the definition contained
in Article II of these regulations but not in limitation thereof, the
following additional information respecting net business profits is furnished.



      a.   Net profits.



         .1   Net profits as used in the ordinance and these
regulations means net profits derived from any business, profession, or other
activity or undertaking carried on for profit or normally carried on for
profit.



         .2   Net profits as disclosed on any return filed
pursuant to the provisions of the ordinance shall be computed by the same
accounting method used in reporting net income to the federal internal
revenue service (provided that such method does not conflict with any
provisions of the ordinance).  Net profits, shown on returns filed pursuant
to the ordinance must be reconciled with the income reported to the federal
Internal Revenue Service.



      b.   Gross receipts.



         .1   Gross receipts shall include but not be limited to
income in the form of commissions, fees, rentals from real and tangible
personal property, and other compensation for work or services performed or
rendered as well as income from sales of stock in trade.



         .2   From gross receipts there shall be deducted
allowable expenses to arrive at the net profit subject to tax.



      c.   Expenses.



         .1   All ordinary and necessary expenses of doing
business, including reasonable compensation paid employees, shall be allowed,
but no deduction may be claimed for salary or withdrawal of a proprietor or
of the partners, members, or other owners of an unincorporated business or
enterprise.



            .01   If not claimed as part of the cost of goods
sold or elsewhere in the return filed, there may be claimed and allowed a
reasonable deduction for depreciation, depletion, obsolescence, losses
resulting from theft or casualty, not compensated for by insurance or
otherwise of property used in the trade or business, but the amount may not
exceed that recognized for the purpose of the federal income tax, provided,
however, that loss on the sale, exchange, or other disposition of depreciable
property or real estate, used in the taxpayer's business shall not be allowed
as a deductible expense.



            .02   Current amortization of emergency facilities
under the provisions of the internal revenue code, if recognized as such for
federal income tax purposes, may be included as an expense deduction
hereunder.



            .03   Where depreciable property is voluntarily
destroyed only the cost of such demolition and the undepreciated balance
thereof will be allowed as an expense in the year of such demolition, to the
extent allowable for federal income tax purposes.



            .04   Bad debts in a reasonable amount may be
allowed in the year ascertained worthless and charged off, or at the
discretion of the Commissioner (if the reserve method is used), a reasonable
addition to the reserve may be claimed, but in no event shall the amount
exceed the amount allowable for federal income tax purposes.



            .05   Only taxes directly connected with the
business may be claimed as a deduction.  If for any reason the income from
property is not subject to the tax, then taxes on and other expenses of said
property are not deductible.  In any event, the following taxes are not
deductible from income:  (1) the tax under the ordinance;  (2) federal or
other taxes based upon income; (3) gift, estate, or inheritance taxes; and
(4) taxes for local benefits or improvements to property which tend to
appreciate the value thereof.



            .06   In general, nontaxable income and expenses
incurred in connection therewith are not to be considered in determining net
profits.  Income from intangibles, by way of dividends, interest, and the
like shall not be included if such income is subject to taxation under the
intangible personal property laws of the state or is specifically exempt from
taxation under said law.



            .07   If the taxpayer reports income that is
nontaxable under the ordinance and such amounts are deducted in order to
reconcile the village return with the taxpayer's federal income tax return,
expenses attributable to this nontaxable income shall not be allowed.  In
the absence of records showing the actual expenses attributable to such
nontaxable income, and upon approval of the Commissioner, such amount shall
be deemed to equal 5% of such nontaxable income.



            .08   With respect to certain tangible personal
property used in business, the “federal investment credit” for current
year investments, as determined for federal income tax purposes, shall be
treated as a deduction from income with respect to new or used property, 
(subject to federal tax limitations in the case of used property, acquired
after December 31, 1961,) and the remaining costs shall be depreciated in
succeeding years on the same basis used for federal income tax purposes.  In
the event the “federal investment credit” is required to be adjusted by
reason of a sale or other early disposition affecting the original amount of
the “federal investment credit,” such adjustment must be reported and
treated as taxable income under the ordinance in the year of such sale or
other early disposition.



            .09   Capital gains and losses from sale,
exchange, or other disposition of property shall not be taken into
consideration in arriving at net profits earned.  Any amount received on a
sale or other disposition of tangible personal property used in business, in
excess of book value, shall be treated as taxable income under the ordinance
to the extent of depreciation allowable after January 1, 1974.  The balance
shall be treated as a capital gain.



   7.   Rentals from real property.



      a.   Rentals received by the taxpayer are to be included only
if and to the extent that the rental, ownership, management, or operation of
the real estate from which such rentals are derived (whether so rented,
managed, or operated by the taxpayer individually or through agents or other
representatives) constitutes a business activity of the taxpayer in whole or
in part.



      b.   In determining the amount of gross monthly rental of any
real property, periods during which (by reason of vacancy or any other cause)
rentals are not received shall not be taken into consideration by the
taxpayer.



      c.   Rentals received by a taxpayer engaged in the business of
buying and selling real estate shall be considered as part of business income.



      d.   Real property, as the term is used in this regulation,
shall include commercial property, residential property, farm property, and
any and all other types of real estate.



      e.   In determining the taxable income from rentals, the
deductible expenses shall be of the same nature, extent, and amount as are
allowed by the Internal Revenue Service for federal income tax purposes.



      f.   Residents of the village are subject to taxation upon the
net income from rental (to the extent above specified), regardless of the
location of the real property owned.



      g.   Nonresidents of the village are subject to such taxation
only if the real property is situated within the village.



      h.   Corporations owning or managing real estate are taxable
only on that portion of income derived from property located in the village.



   8.   Patents and copyrights.



      a.   Income from patents or copyrights is not to be included
in net profits subject to the tax if the income from such patents or
copyrights is subject to the state intangible tax.  Conversely, such a state
intangible tax is not deductible in determining village tax.  Such items
shall be clearly disclosed on an attachment to be filed with the village tax
return.



B.   Allocation of business profits.



   A request to change the method of allocation must be made in writing
before the end of the taxable year.



   1.   Separate accounting method



      a.   The net profits allocable to the village from business,
professional, or other activities conducted in the village bremen by
corporations or unincorporated entities (whether resident or nonresident) may
be determined from the records of the taxpayer, if taxpayer has bona fide
records which disclose with reasonable accuracy what portion of his net
profits is attributable to that part of his activities conducted within the
village.



      b.   If the books and records of the taxpayer are used as the
basis for apportioning net profits rather than the business allocation
formula, a statement must accompany the return explaining the manner in which
such apportionment is made in sufficient detail to enable the Commissioner to
determine whether the net profits attributable to the village are apportioned
with reasonable accuracy.



      c.   In determining the income allocable to the village from
the books and records of a taxpayer, an adjustment may be made for the
contribution made to the production of such income by headquarters activities
of the taxpayer, whether such headquarters is within or without the village.



   2.   Business allocation percentage method.



      a.   Step 1:  Ascertain the percentage which the average net
book value of real and tangible personal property, including leasehold
improvements owned or used in the business and situated within the village,
is of the average net book value of all real and tangible personal property,
including leasehold improvements owned or used in the business wherever
situated, during the period covered by the return.



         .1   The percentage of taxpayer's real and tangible
personal property within the village is determined by dividing the average
net book value of such property within the village (without deduction of any
encumbrances) by the average net book value of all such property within and
without the village.  In determining such percentage, property rented to the
taxpayer as well as real and tangible personal property owned by taxpayer
must be considered.



            .01   The net book value of real and tangible
personal property rented by taxpayer shall be determined by multiplying gross
annual rents payable by eight.



            .02   Gross rents means the actual sum of money or
other consideration payable, directly or indirectly, by the taxpayer for the
use or possession of property and includes:



               .001   Any amount payable for the use or
possession of real and tangible personal property or any part thereof,
whether designated as a fixed sum of money or as a percentage of sales
profits or otherwise;



               .002   Any amount payable as additional rent
or in lieu of rent such as interest, taxes, insurance, repairs, or other
amounts required to be paid by the terms of a lease or other arrangements.



      b.   Step 2:  Ascertain the percentage which the gross
receipts of the taxpayer derived from sales made and service rendered in the
village is of the total gross receipts wherever derived during the period
covered by the return.



         .1   The following sales shall be considered the village
sales:



            .01   All sales made through retail stores located
within the village to purchasers within or without the village, except such
of said sales to purchasers outside the village that are directly
attributable to regular solicitations made outside the village personally by
taxpayer's employees.



            .02   All sales of tangible personal property
delivered to purchasers within the village if shipped or delivered from an
office, store, warehouse, factory, or place of storage located within the
village.



            .03   All sales of tangible personal property
delivered to purchasers within the village even though transported from a
point outside the village, if the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its
own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the village
and the sale is directly or indirectly the result of such solicitation.



            .04   All sales of tangible personal property
shipped from an office, store, warehouse, factory, or place of storage within
the village to purchasers outside the village, if the taxpayer is not,
through its own employees regularly engaged in the solicitation or promotion
of sales at the place of delivery.



            .05   Charges for work done or services performed
incident to a sale, whether or not included in the price of the property
shall be considered gross receipts from such sale.



         .2   In the application of the foregoing subparagraphs a
carrier shall be considered the agent of the seller regardless of the F.O.B.
point or other conditions of the sale, and the place at which orders are
accepted or contracts legally consummated shall be immaterial.  Solicitation
of customers outside the village by mail or phone from an office, or place of
business within the village shall not be considered a solicitation of sales
outside the village.



      c.   Step 3:  Ascertain the percentage which the total wages,
salaries, commissions, and other compensation of employees within the village
is of the total wages, salaries, commissions, and other compensation of all
the taxpayer's employees within and without the village during the period
covered by the return.



         .1   Salaries and reasonable compensation paid owners or
credited to the account of owners or partners during the period covered by
the return are considered wages for the purpose of this computation.



         .2   Wages, salaries, and other compensation shall be
computed on the cash or accrual basis in accordance with the method of
accounting used in the computation of the entire net income of the taxpayer.



         .3   In the case of an employee who performs services
both within and without the village, the amount treated as compensation for
services performed within the city shall be deemed to be:



            .01   In the case of an employee whose
compensation depends directly on the volume of business secured by him, such
as a salesman on a commission basis, the amount received by him for the
business attributable to his efforts within the village.



            .02   In the case of an employee whose
compensation depends on other results achieved, the proportion of the total
compensation received which the value of his services within the village
bears to the value of all his services; and



            .03   In the case of an employee compensated on a
time basis, the proportion of the total amount received by him which his
working time within the village is of his total working time.



      d.   Step 4:  Add the percentages determined in accordance
with steps 1, 2 and 3 or such of the aforesaid percentages as may be
applicable to the particular taxpayer's business and divide the total so
obtained by the number of percentages used in ascertaining said total.  The
result so obtained is the business allocation percentage.  In determining
the average percentage, a factor shall not be excluded from the computation
merely because said factor is found to be allocable entirely outside the
village. A factor is excluded only when it does not exist anywhere.



      e.   Step 5:  The business allocation percentage determined
in step 4 above shall be applied to the entire taxable net profits of the
taxpayer wherever derived to determine the net profits allocable to the
village.



   3.   Substitute method.



      a.   In the event a just and equitable result cannot be
obtained under the formula, the Board, upon application of the taxpayer or
the Commissioner, may substitute other factors in the formula or prescribe
other methods of allocating net income calculated to effect a fair and proper
allocation.



      b.   Application to the Board to substitute other factors in
the formula or to use a different method to allocate net profits must be made
in writing before the end of the taxable year and shall state the specific
grounds on which the substitution of factors or use of a different method is
requested and the relief sought to be obtained.  A copy thereof shall be
served at the time of filing upon the taxpayer or Commissioner as the case
may be.  No specific form need be followed in making such application. 
Once a taxpayer has filed under a substitute method, he must continue to so
file until given permission to change by the Board of Review.



C.   Operating loss carry forward.



   1.   The portion of a net operating loss, based on income taxable
under the ordinance sustained in any taxable year subsequent to January 1,
1974, allocable to the village, may be applied against the portion of the
profits of succeeding years allocable to the village until exhausted but in
no event of more than five taxable years.  No portion of a net operating
loss shall be carried back against net profits of any prior year.



   2.   In the event net profits are allocable both within and without
the village, the portion of a net operating loss sustained shall be allocated
to the village in the same manner as provided herein for allocating net
profits to the village.  The portion of a net operating loss to be carried
forward shall be determined in the year the net operating loss is sustained,
on the basis of the allocation factors applicable to that year.  The same
method of accounting and allocation must be used in the year to which an
operating loss is carried as was used in the year in which the operating loss
was sustained.



   3.   In the case of fiscal years beginning prior to the effective
date of the ordinance, the net operating loss deduction will be that portion
of the operating loss that the number of months of the fiscal year after the
effective date of the ordinance bears to the total number of months in such
fiscal year.



   4.   A short fiscal year (a fiscal year of less than twelve (12)
months) in cases where there has been a change in accounting period, where a
new taxpayer selects a short fiscal year, or where a new taxpayer operated in
the village for less than his full accounting period, shall be considered as
a full taxable fiscal year.



   5.   In any return in which a net operating loss deduction is
claimed, a schedule should be attached showing:



      a.   Year in which net operating loss was sustained;



      b.   Method of accounting and allocation used to determine
portion of net operating loss allocable to the village;



      c.   Amount of net operating loss used as a deduction in prior
years; and



      d.   Amount of net operating loss claimed as a deduction in
current year.



   6.   The net operating loss of a business which loses its identity
through merger, consolidation, etc. shall not be allowed as a carry-forward
loss deduction to the surviving business entity.



   7.   In the case of a net operating loss in the filing of
consolidated returns, see Article III.D.



D.   Consolidated returns.



   1.   Consolidated returns may be filed by a group of corporations
who are affiliated through stock ownership.  For a subsidiary corporation to
be included in a consolidated return, 80% of its stock must be owned by the
other members of the affiliated group.  A consolidated return must include
all companies which are so affiliated.



   2.   Once a consolidated return has been filed for any taxable year,
the consolidated group must continue to file consolidated returns in
subsequent years unless:



      a.   Permission in writing is granted by the Commissioner to
file separate returns;



      b.   A new corporation other than a corporation created or
organized by a member of the group has become a member of the group during
the taxable year;



      c.   A corporation member of the group is sold or exchanged. 
Liquidating a corporation or merging one of the corporations of the group
into another will not qualify the group for filing separate returns.



   3.   If a corporation becomes a member of the group during the
taxable year, the consolidated return must include the income for the entire
taxable year of the common parent corporation and any subsidiaries which were
members of the group for the entire year, plus the income of each subsidiary
which becomes a member of the group during the year for the period beginning
with the date it became a member of the affiliated group.  For the period
prior to the time any subsidiary became a member of the group, separate
returns must be filed for that subsidiary.  When a subsidiary ceases to be a
member of the affiliated group, the consolidated return must include the
income of such subsidiary for the period during which it was a member of the
group, but for the period after it ceases to be a member, separate returns
must be filed.  If a corporation has been a member of the affiliated group
for less than one month of the taxable year of the group, it may be
considered as not being part of the group.  Similarly, a subsidiary may be
considered as being a member of the affiliated group during the entire
taxable year of the group, if the period during which it was not a member of
the group does not exceed one month.



      If a subsidiary is a member of the consolidated group for only
part of a taxable year, the income considered to be earned in such fractional
part of the year shall be that portion of the net income for the entire year
which the number of days it was a member of the group bears to the total
number of days in the taxable year.



   4.   In determining the allocation fraction where a corporation
becomes a member of the group or ceases to be a member of the group during
the taxable year, the property fraction (step 1 of the formula) shall be
determined on the basis of the average net book value of the property during
the period such corporation was a member of the group.  The rental portion
of the fraction, however, shall be computed at eight times the annual rent. 
The gross receipts and wage fractions shall be based on the actual figures.



   5.   All subsidiary corporations must agree in writing to the filing
of the consolidated return as they will be liable for the tax as well as will
be the parent corporation.



   6.   The net operating loss carryover of a corporation which filed a
separate return in a prior year may be carried over to the consolidated
return but will be limited in amount to the amount of that same corporation's
net income included in the consolidation.  The net operating loss carryover
from a separate year shall be deducted first before application of the
allocation fraction.  After application of the allocation fraction the
consolidated net operating loss carryover allocated to the village shall be
allowed.



   7.   In consolidating the net income, the taxable income of each
corporation shall be computed in accordance with the provisions governing the
taxable income of separate corporations, except that there shall be
eliminated unrealized profits and losses in transactions between members of
the affiliated group.



   8.   In determining expenses that are not allowable because they are
allocable to nontaxable income, such calculations shall be based on the
consolidated net income. As an example,  inter-company dividends which are
eliminated in the consolidation will not be taken into consideration in
determining nontaxable income.



E.   Exceptions.



   The following shall not be considered taxable:



   1.   Poor relief, unemployment insurance benefits, supplemental
unemployment benefits, old age pensions, or similar payments received from
local, state, or federal governments or charitable or religious organizations.



   2.   Proceeds of insurance, annuities, worker's compensation
insurance, social security benefits, pensions, compensation for damages for
personal injuries and like reimbursement, not including damages for loss of
profits.



   3.   Compensation for damage to property by way of insurance or
otherwise.



   4.   Interest and dividends from intangible property.



   5.   Military pay and allowances received as a member of the armed
forces of the United States.



   6.   Any charitable, educational, fraternal, or other type of
nonprofit association or organization enumerated in R.C. § 718.01 which is
exempt from payment of real estate taxes is exempt from payment of the tax
imposed by this ordinance.



   7.   Any association or organization falling in the category listed
in the preceding paragraph not exempt from the payment of real estate taxes
is required to file declarations and final returns and remit the taxes levied
under this ordinance on all business activities of a type ordinarily
conducted for profit by taxpayers operating for profit.



   8.   Where such nonprofit association or organization conducts
income producing business both within and without the corporate limits, it
shall calculate its profits allocable to the village under the method or
methods provided above.



ARTICLE IV:  EFFECTIVE PERIOD OF TAX



A.   Tax imposed by § 40.03(A)(1) and (2).

commissions, fees, and other compensation earned during the effective period
of the ordinance.



B.   Tax imposed by § 40.03(A)(3), (4), and (5).

other activities is on the net profits earned during the effective period of
the ordinance.



ARTICLE V:  RETURN AND PAYMENT OF THE TAX



A.   Date and requirement for filing.



   1.   On or before April 30 of the year following the effective date
of the ordinance and each year thereafter, every person subject to the
provisions of divisions (A)(1) through (A)(5) of § 40.03, inclusive, shall,
except as hereinafter provided, make and file with the Commissioner, a return
on a form prescribed by and obtainable upon request from the Commissioner,
whether or not a tax be due.



   2.   If the return is made for a fiscal year or any period less than
a year, said return shall be made within four months from the end of each
fiscal year or other period.



   3.   Every person subject to the provisions of § 40.03 shall,
except as hereinafter provided, file a return setting forth the aggregate
amount of salaries, wages, commissions, and other personal service
compensation, net profits from business, or other activities, including the
rental from use of real and personal property, and other income taxable under
the ordinance, received for the period covered by the return and such other
pertinent facts and information in detail as the Commissioner may require.



   4.   Where an employee's entire earnings for the tax period as paid
by an employer or employers, and the 1.5% tax thereon has in each instance
been withheld and deducted by the employer or employers from the gross amount
of the entire earnings of such employee/taxpayer, and where the employer of
such employee has filed a report or return in which such employee's entire
and only earnings are reported to the Commissioner, and where such employee
has no taxable income other than such earnings and the tax so withheld has
been paid to the Commissioner, such employee need not file a return.



   5.   An employee who is permitted to deduct business expenses from
gross wages, salaries or commissions must file a return in order to claim
such deductions even though all or part of such wages, salaries, or
commissions are subject to withholding.



   6.   Any taxpayer who received taxable income not subject to
withholding under the ordinance must file a return.



   7.   Any taxpayer having income, wages, or other compensation for
which a return must be filed, and also having net profits from a business
covering the same or a different period, is required to file only one return.



   8.   Trustees of active trusts are required to file returns and pay
the tax on the taxable income thereof.



   9.   Except as provided for herein, the tax is on the partnership or
association as an entity whether resident or nonresident and a return is
required disclosing the net profits allocable to the village and the tax paid
thereon.  However, any resident partner or resident member of an
unincorporated entity is required to make a return and pay the tax in
accordance with Article III.A.3.b..2 of these regulations.



   10.   A husband and wife may, in any tax year, elect to file
separate or joint returns.



   11.   Operating losses from business or professional activities, the
profits of which would be taxable under the ordinance, may be offset against
salaries, wages, commissions, and other personal service compensation or
against net profits from other business or professional activities.  To the
extent that such losses are offset they shall not be allowable as an
operating loss carry forward under § 40.03(C) or Article III.C of these
regulations.



B.   Information required and reconciliation with federal returns.



   1.   In returns filed hereunder, there shall be set forth the
aggregate amount of salaries, wages, bonuses, incentive payments,
commissions, fees, and other compensation subject to the tax earned from each
employer, taxable net profits, and other pertinent information as the
Commissioner may require.



   2.   Where figures of total income, total deductions, and net
profits are included as shown by a federal return, any items of income as are
not subject to the village tax and unallowable expenses shall be eliminated
in determining net income subject to the village.  In the absence of records
showing the actual unallowable expenses, such expenses shall be determined in
accordance with Article III.A.6.c..1.07 of these regulations.  The fact that
any taxpayer is not required to file a federal tax return does not relieve
him from filing a village tax return.



   3.   If a change in federal income tax liability, made by the
federal internal revenue service, or by a judicial decision, results in an
additional amount of tax payable to the village, a report of such change
shall be filed by the taxpayer within three months after receipt of the final
notice from the federal internal revenue service or final court decision.



   4.   If a change in federal income tax liability results in a
reduction of taxes owed and paid to the village a claim for refund shall be
filed with the Commissioner as prescribed in § 40.05 and Article XI.B. of
these regulations.



C.   Extensions.



   1.   Upon written request of the taxpayer made on or before the date
for filing the return, and for good cause shown, the Commissioner may extend
the time for filing such return for a period of not to exceed three months,
or to one month beyond any extension requested of or granted by the federal
internal revenue service.  Whenever he deems such necessary, the
Commissioner may require a tentative return accompanied by payment of the
estimated tax.  No penalty or interest will be assessed in those cases in
which the return is filed and the final tax paid within the period as
extended, provided that all other filing and payment requirements of the
ordinance have been met.



   2.   Information returns, schedules, and statements needed to
support tax returns are to be filed within the time limits set forth for
filing the tax returns.



D.   Payment with return.



   1.   The taxpayer making a return shall, at the time of the filing
thereof, pay to the Commissioner the amount of taxes shown as due thereon,
provided, however, that where any portion of the tax so due shall have been
deducted at the source pursuant to the provisions of § 40.06, or where any
portion of said tax shall have been paid by the taxpayer pursuant to the
provisions of § 40.07, or where an income tax has been paid to another
municipality, credit  for the amount so paid in accordance with § 40.14,
shall be deducted from the amount shown to be due and only the balance, if
any, shall be due and payable at the time of filing said return.



   2.   A taxpayer who has overpaid the amount of tax to which the
village is entitled under the provisions of the ordinance may have such
overpayment applied against any subsequent liability hereunder or, at his
election indicated on the return, such overpayment (or part thereof) shall be
refunded, provided that no additional taxes or refunds of less than $1 shall
be collected or refunded.



E.   Amended returns.



   1.   Where necessary, an amended return must be filed in order to
report additional income and pay any additional tax due, or claim a refund of
tax overpaid, subject to the requirements and/or limitations contained in
§§ 40.11 and 40.12.  Such amended return shall be on a form obtainable on
request from the Commissioner.  A taxpayer may not change the method of
accounting or apportionment of net profits after the due date for filing the
original return.



   2.   Within three months from the final determination of any federal
tax liability affecting the taxpayer's village tax liability, such taxpayer
shall make and file an amended village return showing income subject to the
village tax based upon such final determination of federal tax liability, and
pay any additional tax shown due thereon or make claim for refund of any
overpayment.



ARTICLE VI:  COLLECTION OF TAX AT THE SOURCE



A.   Duty of withholding.



   1.   Except as otherwise provided herein, it is the duty of each
employer within or doing business within the village, who employs one or more
persons whether as an employee, officer, director of otherwise, to deduct
each time any compensation is paid the tax of 1.5%; from:



      a.   The gross amount of all salaries, wages, bonuses,
incentive payments, fees, commissions, or other forms of compensation paid to
residents of the village regardless of the place where the services are
rendered; and



      b.   All compensation paid nonresidents for services rendered,
work performed, or other activities engaged in within the village.



   2.   All employers within or doing business within the village are
required to make the collections and deductions specified in this article,
regardless of the fact that the services on account of which any particular
deduction is required, as to residents of village, were performed outside the
village.



   3.   Employers who do not maintain a permanent office or place of
business in the village, but who are subject to tax on net profits
attributable to the village, under the method of allocation provided for in
the ordinance, are considered to be employers within the village and subject
to the requirement of withholding.



   4.   The mere fact that the tax is not withheld will not relieve the
employee of the responsibility of filing a return and paying the tax on the
compensation paid.  If the employer has withheld the tax and failed to pay
the tax withheld to the Commissioner, the employee is not liable for the tax
so withheld.



   5.   Commissions and fees paid to professional men, brokers, and
others who are independent contractors, and not employees of the payor, are
not subject to withholding or collection of the tax at the source.  Such
taxpayers must in all instances file a declaration and return and pay the tax
pursuant to the provisions of the ordinance and Articles V and VII of these
regulations.



   6.   Where a nonresident receives compensation for personal services
rendered or performed partly within and partly without the village, the
withholding employer shall deduct, withhold, and remit the tax on that
portion of the compensation which is earned within village in accordance with
the following rules of apportionment:



      a.   If the nonresident is a salesman, agent, or other
employee whose compensation depends directly on the volume of business
transacted or chiefly effected by him, the deducting and withholding shall
attach to the portion of the entire compensation which the volume of business
transacted or chiefly effected by the employee within the village bears to
the total volume of business transacted by him within and outside the village.



      b.   The deducting and withholding of personal service
compensation of other non resident employees, including officers of
corporations shall attach to the proportion of the personal service
compensation of such employee which the total number of his working hours
within village is of the total number of working hours.



      c.   The fact that nonresident employees are subject to call
at any time does not permit the allocation of pay for time worked in village
on a seven day per week basis.  The percentage of time worked in village
will be computed on the basis of a 40 hour week, unless the employer notifies
the Commissioner that a greater or lesser number of hours per week is worked.



      d.   The occasional entry into village of a nonresident
employee who performs the duties for which he is employed primarily outside
the village shall not be deemed to take such employee out of the class of
those rendering their services entirely outside village.



   7.   An employer shall withhold the tax on the full amount of any
advances made to an employee on account of commissions.



   8.   An employer required to withhold the tax on compensation paid
to an employee shall, in determining the amount on which the tax is to be
withheld, ignore any amount allowed and paid to the employee for expenses
necessarily and actually incurred by the employee in the actual performance
of his services, provided that such expenses are incurred in earning
compensation, including commissions, and are not deducted as a business
expense by the employee under Article III of these regulations.



   9.   An employer whose records show that an employee is a
nonresident of village and has no knowledge to the contrary, shall be
relieved of the responsibility of withholding the tax on personal service
compensation paid to such employee for services rendered or work done outside
village by such employee, provided, however, that such employer must withhold
the tax on all personal service compensation paid such employee after the
Commissioner notifies said employer in writing that such employee is a
resident of village.  All employees are required to notify the employer of
any change of residence and the date thereof.



   10.   A village employer required to withhold the tax from a village
resident for work done or services performed in another municipality, and who
does so withhold and remit to such other municipality, shall be relieved from
the requirement of withholding the village tax from such village resident,
except that where the rate of tax for such other municipality is less than
the rate of tax imposed by this ordinance, in such case the employer shall
withhold and remit the difference to the village.



   11.   No person shall be required to withhold the tax on the wages
or other compensation paid domestic servants employed exclusively in or about
such person's residence, but such employee shall be subject to all of the
requirements of the ordinance.



B.   Return and payment of tax withheld and status of employers.



   1.   The deductions from salaries, wages, and other compensation
required to be made by employers are to begin with the compensation paid on
and after the effective date of the ordinance.



      The employer (in addition to any return required to be filed with
respect to his own earnings or net profits) shall on or before the last day
of the month next following each quarterly period, make a return and pay to
the Commissioner the full amount of the tax so deducted or withheld with
respect to compensation paid all of his employees subject to the tax under
the ordinance, provided, however, that where he deems such precaution
necessary, the Commissioner may require an employer to remit withholding
taxes at more frequent intervals.



      The return required to be filed under this article shall be made
on a form furnished by or obtainable on request from the Commissioner.



   2.   If more than the amount of tax required to be deducted by the
ordinance is withheld from an employees pay, such excess may be refunded by
the employer or the Commissioner, depending upon the circumstances and the
time when the overwithholding is determined as follows:



      a.   Current employees.



         .1   If the overwithholding is discovered in the same
quarterly period, the employer shall make the necessary adjustment directly
with the employee, and the amount to be reported on the quarterly return as
withheld shall be the corrected amount;



         .2   If the overwithholding is discovered in a
subsequent quarter of the same calendar year, the employer may make proper
adjustment with the employee.  In such case the return for the quarter in
which the adjustment is made shall indicate the total amount actually
withheld, the amount of the adjustment deducted therefrom, and the corrected
amount reported on the return; or



         .3   If the overwithholding is discovered in the
following year, the employer should notify the Commissioner of such
overwithholding and the circumstances thereof.  Upon proper verification,
the Commissioner shall refund to the employee the amount of such excess
withholding.



      b.   Former employees.



         .1   In case too much has been withheld from an employee
who is no longer employed by the employer, the employer shall notify the
Commissioner of the amount and circumstances of such overwithholding, and the
Commissioner shall then refund to the employee the amount of such excess
withholding; or



         .2   If the error is discovered by the employee, such
employee shall file a claim with the Commissioner and, upon verification
thereof by the employer, the Commissioner shall refund to the employee the
amount of such excess withholding;



      c.   Nonresidents employed outside the village.



         .1   Where an employer has withheld the tax from all
wages of a nonresident of the village and such nonresident has been employed
outside of the village for all or a part of the time, such employee shall
file a claim with the Commissioner covering such erroneous withholding, and
the Commissioner shall, upon verification thereof by the employer, refund to
the employee the amount of such excess withholding.



      d.   Insufficient withholding.



         .1   If less than the amount of tax required to be
deducted is withheld from an employee, such deficiency shall be withheld from
subsequent wages.  However, if the employee/employer relationship has
terminated, the employer shall notify the Commissioner of such deficiency and
the reason therefor.



         .2   [Reserved]



         .3   Every employer is deemed to be a trustee for the
village in collecting and holding the tax required under the ordinance to be
withheld, and the funds so collected by such withholding are deemed to be
trust funds.



         .4   Every such employer required to deduct and withhold
the tax at the source is liable directly to the village for payment of such
tax, whether actually collected from such employee or not.



         .5   On or before the January 31, following any calendar
year in which such deductions have been made by an employer, such employer
shall file with the Commissioner, in the form prescribed by the Commissioner,
an information return for each employee from whom village income tax has been
withheld, showing the name, address and social security number of the
employee, the total amount of compensation paid during the year and the
amount of village income tax withheld from such employee.



         .6   For the convenience of employers, the information
return may be made in one of three ways at the election of each employer, as
follows:



            .01   Those employers using form W-2 furnished
commercially may submit a copy of such commercial form W-2, provided that the
copy furnished the village clearly shows the information required in
paragraph 5 immediately preceding.



            .02   Those employers not using form W-2 furnished
commercially may obtain forms upon request from the Commissioner.



            .03   Where the furnishing of this information as
above indicated will create a distinct hardship, the employer upon written
request to the Commissioner may be permitted to furnish a list of all
employees subject to the tax, which list shall show the employees' full name,
last known address, social security number, gross amount of compensation paid
during the year, and the amount of village income tax withheld.  Such list
may be compiled on any mechanical equipment presently used by the employer,
but provisions must be made for spacing equal to at least three lines between
each name.  The employer's name must be indicated on each sheet, each sheet
must be numbered, and the total number of sheets comprising the complete
report indicated on the first page.



            .04   The gross compensation to be reported for
each employee shall be for the full 12 calendar months of the year or such
portion thereof as the employee reported on was employed.



         .7   In addition to such information returns, and at the
time the same are filed, such employer shall file with the Commissioner Form
R-3 to enable the Commissioner to reconcile the sum total of compensation
paid and taxes withheld as disclosed by information return W-2, or list of
employees, and prior returns and remittances made pursuant to the ordinance.



C.   Fractional parts of cent.



   In deducting and withholding the tax at the source and in payment of
any tax due under the ordinance, a fractional part of a cent shall be
disregarded unless it amounts to one-half cent or more, in which case it
shall be increased to one cent.



ARTICLE VII:  DECLARATIONS



A.   Requirement of filing.



   1.   A declaration of estimated tax shall be filed by every taxpayer
who may reasonably be expected to have taxable income, the tax on which is
not or will not be withheld by an employer or employers.  Where required
such declaration shall be filed within four months after the beginning of the
taxable year.



   2.   A taxpayer's final return for the preceding year may be used as
the basis for computing his declaration of estimated tax for the current
year.  In the event a taxpayer has not previously been required to file a
return, a declaration of estimated tax on anticipated income shall be filed
in good faith.



B.   Date of filing.



   1.   A person or other entity conducting a business not previously
subject to the tax, or whose employer does not withhold the tax shall file a
declaration within four months after the date he becomes subject to the tax.



   2.   Those taxpayers having a fiscal year or period differing from
the calendar year shall file a declaration within four months after the start
of each fiscal year or period.



C.   Form for filing.



   1.   Such declaration shall be filed upon a form or forms furnished
by, or obtainable from the Commissioner, provided, however, that credit shall
be taken for the village tax to be withheld from any portion of such
income.  In accordance with the provisions of § 40.14, credit may be taken
for tax to be withheld and remitted to another taxing municipality.



   2.   The original estimate of tax liability or any subsequent
amendment thereof may be increased or decreased by filing an amended
declaration on or before any quarterly payment date as set forth in Article
VII.D.1.  Such amendment may be made on the regular declaration form or on
the back of any quarterly notice form.



D.   Dates of payments.



   1.   The estimated tax may be paid in full with the declaration or
in equal installments on or before the last day of the fourth, seventh,
tenth, and thirteenth month after the beginning of the taxable year.



   2.   The declaration must be accompanied by at least one-fourth of
the estimated tax shown due thereon.



   3.   In the event an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid
balance shown due thereon shall be paid in equal installments over the
remaining payment dates.



E.   Final returns required.



   1.   The filing of a declaration does not relieve the taxpayer of
the necessity of filing a final return even though there is no change in the
declared tax liability.  A final return must be filed to obtain a refund of
any overpayment of over $1.



ARTICLE VIII:  DUTIES OF THE TAX COMMISSIONER



A.   Collection of tax and retention of records.



   1.   It shall be the duty of the Tax Commissioner to receive the tax
imposed by the ordinance in the manner prescribed herein from the taxpayers,
to keep an accurate record thereof, and to report all monies so received.



   2.   It shall be the duty of the Commissioner to enforce payment of
all taxes owing village, to keep accurate records for a minimum of five years
showing the amount due from each taxpayer required to file a declaration
and/or make any return, including taxes withheld, and to show the dates and
amounts of payments thereof.



B.   Enforcement provisions.



   1.   The Commissioner is charged with the administration and
enforcement of the provisions of the ordinance and, subject to the approval
of the Board of Review, is empowered to adopt, promulgate, and enforce rules
and regulations relating to any matter or thing pertaining to the
administration and enforcement of the ordinance.  The Commissioner has the
authority to correct or adjust any return submitted, when a correction or
adjustment is necessary to accomplish the intent of the ordinance.



   2.   Any taxpayer or employer desiring a special ruling or any
matter pertaining to the ordinance or these rules and regulations should
submit to the Commissioner in writing all the facts involved and the ruling
sought.



   3.   These regulations, together with all amendments and supplements
hereto and all changes herein, will be on file at the office of the
Commissioner, municipal building, and will be open to public inspection.



   4.   The Commissioner is authorized to arrange for the payment of
unpaid taxes, interest, and penalties on a schedule of installment payments,
when the taxpayer has proved to the Commissioner that, due to certain
hardship conditions, he is unable to pay the full amount of the tax due. 
Such authorization shall not be granted until proper returns are filed by the
taxpayer for all amounts owed by him under the ordinance.



   5.   Failure to make any deferred payment when due, shall cause the
total unpaid amount, including penalty and interest, to become payable on
demand and the provisions of §§ 40.11 and 40.12 shall apply.



C.   Estimation of tax by Commissioner.



   1.   Whenever the Commissioner has been unable to secure information
from the taxpayer as to his taxable income for any year, he may determine the
amount of tax appearing to be due and assess the taxpayer upon the basis of
such determination, together with the interest and penalties as prescribed in
§ 40.10.



   2.   Such determination of tax may be adjusted upon submission by
the taxpayer of actual records from which his tax may be computed.



D.   Subject to the consent of the Board of Review or pursuant to
regulation approved by said board, the Commissioner shall have the power to
compromise any interest or penalty, or both, imposed by § 40.10 of the
ordinance.



ARTICLE IX:  EXAMINATION OF BOOKS AND RECORDS; INFORMATION SO OBTAINED
CONFIDENTIAL; PENALTY



A.   Investigations by Tax Commissioner.



   1.   The Commissioner, or his duly authorized agent, is authorized
to examine the books, papers, records, and federal income tax returns of any
employer, taxpayer, or person subject to the ordinance, or whom the
Commissioner believes is subject to the provisions of the ordinance, for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made; or, if no return was
made, to ascertain the tax due under the ordinance.



   2.   An employer or taxpayer shall furnish, within ten days
following a written request by the Commissioner, or his duly authorized
agent, the means, facilities, and opportunity for making examinations and
investigations authorized by the ordinance.



B.   Subpoena of records and persons.



   1.   The Commissioner, or any person acting in his capacity, is
authorized to examine any person, under oath, concerning any income which
was, or should have been, returned for taxation, or any transaction tending
to affect such income.  The Commissioner may compel the production of books,
papers and records, and the attendance of all persons before him whether as
parties or witnesses, whenever he believes such persons have knowledge of the
facts concerning any supposed income or supposed transaction of the taxpayer.



   2.   The Commissioner's order to examine any document mentioned in
the preceding paragraph shall state whether the examination is to be at the
office of the taxpayer or at the office of the Commissioner.



   3.   The Commissioner may order the appearance before him, or his
duly authorized agent, of any party whom he believes to have any knowledge of
a taxpayer's income or withholdings, or any information pertaining to the
taxpayer under investigation, whether or not the individual so ordered has
actual custody of the records of the taxpayer being investigated.  The
Commissioner is specifically authorized to order the appearance of the local
manager or representative of any taxpayer.



   4.   Persons required to attend any hearings shall be notified no
less than ten days prior to the time of the hearing.  The notice shall show
the time and place of the hearing and what books, papers, or records the
witness is to make available at such hearing.



   5.   The notice shall be served by the Commissioner, or his duly
authorized agent, by delivering it to the person named personally, or by
leaving the notice at his usual place of business or residence, or by mailing
it to the person by registered mail, return receipt requested, addressed to
his usual place of business or residence.



C.   Penalty for noncompliance.



   Refusal by any employer, supposed employer, taxpayer, or supposed
taxpayer, or the refusal of any such person to appear before the Commissioner
or his duly authorized agent, to submit to such examination and to produce
the records requested constitutes a misdemeanor punishable by fine or
imprisonment, or both, as prescribed by § 40.12.



D.   Confidential nature of examinations.



   Any information gained as a result of any returns, investigations,
verifications, or hearings before the Commissioner or the Board, required by
the ordinance or authorized by these rules and regulations, shall be
confidential and no disclosure shall be made except for official purposes or
as ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction.  Any person divulging such
information shall be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a maximum fine of
$500 or by imprisonment for not more than six months, or both.



   In addition to the above penalty, any employee of the village who
violates the provisions of this section relative to the disclosure of
confidential information shall be guilty of an offense punishable by
immediate dismissal.



E.   Retention of records.



   All employers and taxpayers are required to keep such records as will
enable the filing of true and accurate returns, whether of taxes withheld at
the source or of taxes payable upon earnings or net profits, or both.  Such
records shall be preserved for a period of not less than five years from the
date the final return is filed and paid or the withholding taxes are paid.



ARTICLE X:  INTEREST AND PENALTIES



A.   Interest.



   1.   Except as provided in paragraph C of this article, all taxes
imposed and all monies withheld, or required to be withheld, by employers
under the provisions of this ordinance and remaining unpaid after they have
become due shall bear interest, in addition to the amount of the unpaid tax
or withholdings, at the rate of one-half of one per cent per month or
fraction thereof.



B.   Penalties.



   In addition to interest as provided in paragraph A hereof, penalties
based on the unpaid tax are hereby imposed as follows:



   1.   Five per cent (5%) of the amount of unpaid tax or withholding
for first month after said taxes or withholding becomes due.



   2.   Ten per cent (10%) of the amount of unpaid taxes or withholding
if paid during the second or third month.



   3.   Fifteen per cent (15%) of the amount of unpaid taxes or
withholding after three months past due.



C.   Exceptions.



   1.   No penalty shall be assessed on additional taxes found on audit
to be due when a return was timely filed in good faith and the tax paid
thereon within the prescribed time.



   2.   In the absence of fraud neither, penalty nor interest shall be
assessed on any additional taxes resulting from a federal audit for federal
income tax purposes, provided that an amended return is filed and the
additional tax paid within three months after final determination of the
federal tax liability.



D.   Appeal from assessment.



   1.   Upon recommendation of the Commissioner, the Board of Review
may abate penalty or interest, or both, or upon an appeal from the refusal of
the Commissioner to recommend abatement of penalty and interest, the Board
may nevertheless abate penalty or interest, or both.



ARTICLE XI:  COLLECTION OF UNPAID TAXES AND REFUND OF OVERPAYMENTS



A.   Unpaid sums — a civil debt.



   1.   All taxes imposed by the ordinance and not paid when due
become, together with interest and penalties thereon, a debt due the village
from the taxpayer and are recoverable as are other debts by civil suit. 
Employers who are required, under § 40.06, to withhold and remit the taxes
required to be withheld at the source, and who fail to withhold and/or remit,
become liable to the village in a civil action to enforce the payment of the
debt created by such failure.



   2.   No additional assessment shall be made by the Commissioner
after three years from the time the return was due or filed, whichever is
later, provided, however, there shall be no period of limitation on such
additional assessments in the case of a return that omits a substantial
portion of income, or filing a false or fraudulent return to evade payment of
the tax, or failure to file a return. Failure to report 25% or more of gross
income shall be considered a substantial omission.



   3.   In those cases in which the Commissioner of Internal Revenue
and the taxpayer have executed a waiver of the federal statute of
limitations, the period within which an assessment may be made by the
Commissioner is extended to three years from the time of final determination
of federal tax liability.



B.   Refunds and overpayments.



   1.   Taxes erroneously paid shall not be refunded unless a claim for
refund is made within three years from the date on which such payment was
made, or the return was due, or three months after the determination of the
federal income tax liability, whichever is later.



   2.   No refund shall be made to any taxpayer until he has complied
with all provisions of the ordinance and has furnished all information
required by the Commissioner.



   3.   Overpayments will be either refunded or credited to the
taxpayer's current year's liability at his option.  Where no election has
been made by the taxpayer, overpayments of any year's taxes shall be applied
as follows:



      a.   To taxes owed for any previous years in the order in
which such taxes become due.



      b.   To his current estimated tax liability.



C.   Limitation.



   Where the total amount due or refund claimed for a tax year is less
than $1, such amount shall not be collected or refunded.



ARTICLE XII:  VIOLATIONS; PENALTIES



A.   Enumerated penalties.



   Any person who shall commit any of the following shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor and shall be fined not more than $500 or imprisoned for not more
than six months or both, for each offense:



   1.   Fail, neglect, or refuse to make any return or declaration
required by this ordinance;



   2.   Make any incomplete, false, or fraudulent return;



   3.   Fail, neglect, or refuse to pay the tax, penalties, or interest
imposed by this ordinance;



   4.   Fail, neglect, or refuse to withhold the tax from his employees
or remit such withholding to the Commissioner;



   5.   Refuse to permit the Commissioner or any duly authorized agent
or employee to examine books, records, papers, and federal income tax returns
relating to the income or net profits of a taxpayer;



   6.   Fail to appear before the Commissioner and to produce books,
records, papers, or federal income tax returns relating to the income or net
profits of a taxpayer upon order or subpoena of the Commissioner;



   7.   Refuse to disclose to the Commissioner any information with
respect to the income or net profits of a taxpayer;



   8.   Fail to comply with the provisions of this ordinance or any
order or subpoena of the Commissioner authorized hereby;



   9.   Give to an employer false information as to his true name,
correct social security number, and residence address or fail to promptly
notify an employer of any change in residence address and date thereof;



   10.   Fail to use ordinary diligence in maintaining proper records
of employees' residence addresses, total wages paid, and village tax
withheld, or to knowingly give the Commissioner false information; or



   11.   Attempt to do anything whatever to avoid the payment of the
whole or any part of the tax, penalties, or interest imposed by the ordinance.



B.   Prosecutions.



   Prosecutions under the ordinance must be commenced within five years
from the time of the offense, except that in the case of failure to file a
return or in the case of filing a false or fraudulent return, in which event
the limitation of time within which prosecution must be commenced shall be
ten years from the date the return was due or the date the false or
fraudulent return was filed.



C.   Failure to receive forms not a defense.



   The failure of any employer or person to receive or procure a return,
declaration, or other required form shall not excuse him from making any
information return, declaration, or return, from filing such form, or from
paying the tax.



ARTICLE XIII:  BOARD OF REVIEW OR APPELLATE AUTHORITY



A.   Composition.



   A Board of Review, consisting of a chairman and two other individuals
to be appointed by the mayor of the village is hereby created.  A majority
of the members of the Board shall constitute a quorum.  The Board shall
adopt its own procedural rules and shall keep a record of its transactions. 
Any hearing by the Board may be conducted privately and the provisions of §
40.09 with reference to the confidential character of information required to
be disclosed by the ordinance shall apply to such matters as may be heard
before the Board on appeal.



B.   Duties.



   All rules and regulations and amendments or changes thereto, which are
adopted by the Commissioner under the authority conferred by the ordinance,
must be approved by the Board of Review before the same become effective. 
The Board shall hear and pass on appeals from any ruling or decision of the
Commissioner and, at the request of the taxpayer or Commissioner, is
empowered to substitute alternate methods of allocation.

with the Commissioner.



   2.   The Board, by a majority vote, may affirm, modify, or reverse
in whole or in part any such ruling or decision of the Commissioner.



   3.   Hearings before the Board shall be private unless the taxpayer
requests a public hearing.

A.   Limitation.



   1.   Where a resident of village is subject to a municipal tax, on
or measured by income, in another municipality either located within or
without the state, he shall not pay a total municipal tax on the same income
greater than the tax imposed at the higher rate.



B.   Credits to residents.



   Resident individuals of the village who are required to pay and do pay
tax to another municipality on salaries, wages, commissions, or other
compensation for work done or services performed in such other municipality
or on net profits from businesses, professions, or other activities conducted
in such other municipality may claim a credit of the amount of tax paid by
them or on their behalf to such other municipality but only to the extent of
1.5% tax imposed by the ordinance on such compensation or net profits.



C.   Method of applying for credit.



   1.   No credit will be given unless the taxpayer claims such on his
final return or other form prescribed by the Commissioner and presents such
evidence of the payment of a similar tax to another municipality, as the
Commissioner may require.



   2.   A statement satisfactory to the Commissioner from the taxing
authority of the municipality to which the taxes are paid that a village

(including prosecutions under the criminal sections of the ordinance and

force and effect until such time as all taxes accruing during the term of the
ordinance shall have been fully paid, and all actions, suits, prosecutions,

§ 41.014  STATEMENT OF PROCEDURAL HISTORY; STATE MANDATED CHANGES TO
MUNICIPAL INCOME TAX.



   (A)   Significant and wide-ranging amendments to R.C. Chapter 718
were enacted by Am Sub H.B. 5, passed by the 130th General Assembly, and
signed by Governor Kasich on December 19, 2014.  H.B. 5 required municipal
corporations to conform to and adopt the provisions of R.C. Chapter 718 in
order to have the authority to impose, enforce, administer and collect a
municipal income tax.



   (B)   As mandated by H.B. 5, municipal income tax Ordinance
2015-9-19, effective January 1, 2016, comprehensively amends Chapter 40 and
adopts this chapter in accordance with the provisions of R.C. Chapter 718 to
allow the municipality to continue the income tax and withholding tax

corresponding changes to R.C. Chapter 718, apply to municipal taxable years

   (B)   Ordinance 2015-9-19 does not repeal the existing sections of
Chapter 40 for any taxable year prior to 2016, but rather adopts this chapter
effective January 1, 2016.  For municipal taxable years beginning before
January 1, 2016, the municipality shall continue to administer, audit, and
enforce the income tax of the municipality under R.C. Chapter 718 and
ordinances and resolutions of the municipality as Chapter 40 and those
ordinances and resolutions existed before January 1, 2016.

laws of the United States relating to federal income taxation or in R.C.
Title LVII, unless a different meaning is clearly required.  If a term used
in this chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a
comparable context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal
income tax and in R.C. Title LVII and the use is not consistent, then the use
of the term in the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax
shall control over the use of the term in R.C. Title LVII.



   (B)   For purposes of this section, the singular shall include the
plural, and the masculine shall include the feminine and the gender-neutral.

federal taxable income.  The deduction shall be allowed regardless of
whether the intangible income relates to assets used in a trade or business
or assets held for the production of income.



         (b)   Add an amount equal to 5% of intangible income
deducted under division (C)(1)(a) of this section, but excluding that portion
of intangible income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other
disposition of property described in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue
Code.

         (d)   1.   Except as provided in division (C)(1)(d)2.

other disposition of an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the
Internal Revenue Code;



            2.   Division (C)(1)D.1. of this section does not

(C)(1)(h)2., 3. and 4. of this section, deduct any net operating loss

necessary to reduce municipal taxable income to zero, with any remaining
unused portion of the net operating loss carried forward to not more than
five consecutive taxable years following the taxable year in which the loss
was incurred, but in no case for more years than necessary for the deduction
to be fully utilized.



            2.   No person shall use the deduction allowed by
division (C)(1)(h) of this section to offset qualifying wages.



            3.   a.   For taxable years beginning in 2018,

tax levied by a municipal corporation that levies an income tax before
January 1, 2016, more than 50% of the amount of the deduction otherwise

the end of each calendar quarter.

by the failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to
withhold the tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's,
agent's, or other payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.



      (2)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer to remit to the municipality the tax withheld relieves the
employee from liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the
employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the
tax withheld.



   (F)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to

withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.

making payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a
failure to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax
due.



   (J)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal
income tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and
constituting qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities
are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or
gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by
the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if
the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other
electronic means.



   (K)   A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise
required to be withheld by this chapter to be tax required to be withheld and
remitted for the purposes of this section.

      (6)   Worksite location means a construction site or other
temporary worksite in this state at which the employer provides services for
more than 20 days during the calendar year.  Worksite location does not
include the home of an employee.



      (7)   Principal place of work means the fixed location to
which an employee is required to report for employment duties on a regular
and ordinary basis.  If the employee is not required to report for
employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis to a fixed location,
principal place of work means the worksite location in this state to which
the employee is required to report for employment duties on a regular and
ordinary basis.  If the employee is not required to report for employment

the employee spends the greatest number of days in a calendar year performing
services for or on behalf of the employee's employer.



         If there is not a single municipal corporation in which the
employee spent the greatest number of days in a calendar year performing
services for or on behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more
municipal corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of
days that is greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other
municipal corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's
qualifying wages subject to division (B)(1)(a) of this section among those
two or more municipal corporations.  The allocation shall be made using any
fair and reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal
allocation among such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the
time spent or sales made by the employee in each such municipal corporation.
A municipal corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this
division shall be the employee's principal place of work with respect to
those qualifying wages for the purposes of this section.



         For the purposes of this division, the location at which an
employee spends a particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division
(B)(2) of this section, except that "location" shall be substituted for
"municipal corporation" wherever "municipal corporation" appears in that
division.



   (B)   (1)   Subject to divisions (C), (E), (F), and (G) of this
section, an employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on
qualifying wages paid to an employee for the performance of personal services

such services in the municipal corporation on 20 or fewer days in a calendar
year, unless one of the following conditions applies:



         (a)   The employee's principal place of work is located

temporary worksite in this state at which the employer provides services that
can reasonably be expected by the employer to last more than 20 days in a
calendar year.  Services can reasonably be expected by the employer to last
more than 20 days if either of the following applies at the time the services
commence:



            1.   The nature of the services are such that it
will require more than 20 days of actual services to complete the services;



            2.   The agreement between the employer and its
customer to perform services at a location requires the employer to perform
actual services at the location for more than 20 days.



         (c)   The employee is a resident of the municipality and
has requested that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying
wages as provided in § 41.051.



         (d)   The employee is a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid
for the performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional
athlete, professional entertainer, or public figure within the municipality.



      (2)   For the purposes of division (B)(1) of this section, an
employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a
municipal corporation only if the employee spent more time performing
services for or on behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than
in any other municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of
determining the amount of time an employee spent in a particular location,
the time spent performing one or more of the following activities shall be
considered to have been spent at the employee's principal place of work:



         (a)   Traveling to the location at which the employee
will first perform services for the employer for the day;



         (b)   Traveling from a location at which the employee
was performing services for the employer to any other location;



         (c)   Traveling from any location to another location in
order to pick up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery,
property that has been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired,
refurbished, processed, remanufactured, or improved by the employee's
employer;



         (d)   Transporting or delivering property described in
division (B)(2)(c) of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the
property, the employee does not temporarily or permanently affix the property
to real estate owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the
employee's employer;



         (e)   Traveling from the location at which the employee
makes the employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the
employee's principal place of work or a location at which the employee will
not perform services for the employer.



   (C)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division
(B)(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and
remits tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.



   (D)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D)(2) of this
section, if, during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends
performing personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the 20-day
threshold described in division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall
withhold and remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days
in that calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the
employee for personal services performed in that municipal corporation.



      (2)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for a
municipal corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to
withhold tax for that municipal corporation for the first 20 days on which
the employer paid qualifying wages to the employee for personal services
performed in that municipal corporation.



      (3)   If an employer makes the election described in division
(D)(2) of this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer
during those first 20 days to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.



   (E)   Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on
which an employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an
employer shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's
qualifying wages for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal
corporation in which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer
qualifies as a small employer as defined in § 41.03.  To determine whether
an employer qualifies as a small employer for a taxable year, a Tax
Administrator may require the employer to provide the Tax Administrator with
the employer's federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year.



   (F)   Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to
the extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of § 41.051.



   (G)   In the case of a person performing personal services at a
petroleum refinery located in a municipal corporation that imposes a tax on
income, an employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on the
qualifying wages of such a person if the person performs those services on 12
or fewer days in a calendar year, unless the principal place of work of the
employer is located in another municipal corporation in this state that
imposes a tax applying to compensation paid to the person for services
performed on those days and the person is not liable to that other municipal
corporation for tax on the compensation paid for such services.  For the
purposes of this division, a petroleum refinery is a facility with a standard
industrial classification code facility classification of 2911, petroleum
refining.



      Notwithstanding division (D) of this section, if, during a
calendar year, the number of days an individual performs personal services at
a petroleum refinery exceeds 12, the employer shall withhold tax for the
municipal corporation for the first 12 days for which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the individual and for all subsequent days in the
calendar year on which the individual performed services at the refinery.

operator, as defined in Section 6(C)(9) of Article XV, Ohio Constitution, and
R.C. § 3772.01, respectively, or a lottery sales agent conducting video
lottery terminals sales on behalf of the state to withhold and remit
municipal income tax with respect to amounts other than qualifying wages as
provided in this section.



   (B)   If a person's winnings at a casino facility are an amount for
which reporting to the Internal Revenue Service of the amount is required by
section 6041 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the casino operator
shall deduct and withhold municipal income tax from the person's winnings at
the rate of the tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the casino
facility is located.



   (C)   Amounts deducted and withheld by a casino operator are held in
trust for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is owed.



      (1)   On or before the tenth day of each month, the casino
operator shall file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of the

person from whose winnings amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount of
each such deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the
amount of the winnings from which each such amount was withheld, the type of
casino gaming that resulted in such winnings, and any other information
required by the Tax Administrator. With this return, the casino operator

Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the casino facility is
located, indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the
preceding calendar year.  The casino operator shall remit electronically
with the annual return any amount that was deducted and withheld and that was
not previously remitted.  If the name, address, or Social Security number of
a person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was
omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall
be indicated on the annual return.



      (3)   Annually, on or before the 31st day of January, a casino
operator shall issue an information return to each person with respect to
whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar
year.  The information return shall show the total amount of municipal
income tax deducted from the person's winnings during the preceding year. 
The casino operator shall provide to the Tax Administrator a copy of each
information return issued under this division.  The Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.



      (4)   A casino operator that fails to file a return and remit

withheld and not remitted.  Such personal liability extends to any penalty
and interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of
tax deducted and withheld.



      (5)   If a casino operator sells the casino facility or
otherwise quits the casino business, the amounts deducted and withheld along
with any penalties and interest thereon are immediately due and payable. 
The successor shall withhold an amount of the purchase money that is
sufficient to cover the amounts deducted and withheld along with any
penalties and interest thereon until the predecessor casino operator produces
either of the following:



         (a)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that
the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have
been paid;



         (b)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator
indicating that no amounts are due.  If the successor fails to withhold
purchase money, the successor is personally liable for the payment of the
amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon.



      (6)   The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold
the required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person
from liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.



   (D)   If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an
amount for which reporting to the Internal Revenue Service is required by

the amount deducted and withheld, and shall obtain from the person receiving
a prize award the person's name, address, and Social Security number in order
to facilitate the preparation of returns required by this section.



      (2)   On or before the tenth day of each month, the video
lottery sales agent shall file a return electronically with the Tax
Administrator of the municipality providing the names, addresses, and Social
Security numbers of the persons from whose prize awards amounts were deducted
and withheld, the amount of each such deduction and withholding during the
preceding calendar month, the amount of the prize award from which each such
amount was withheld, and any other information required by the Tax
Administrator.  With the return, the video lottery sales agent shall remit
electronically to the Tax Administrator all amounts deducted and withheld
during the preceding month.



      (3)   A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of
all receipts issued under division (E) of this section and shall make those
records available to the Tax Administrator upon request.  Such records shall
be maintained in accordance with R.C. § 5747.17 and any rules adopted
pursuant thereto.



      (4)   Annually, on or before the 31st day of January, each
video lottery terminal sales agent shall file an annual return electronically
with the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the facility
is located indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the
preceding calendar year.  The video lottery sales agent shall remit
electronically with the annual return any amount that was deducted and
withheld and that was not previously remitted.  If the name, address, or
Social Security number of a person or the amount deducted and withheld with
respect to that person was omitted on a monthly return for that reporting
period, that information shall be indicated on the annual return.



      (5)   Annually, on or before the 31st day of January, a video
lottery sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with
respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year.  The information return shall show the total amount of
municipal income tax deducted and withheld from the person's prize award by
the video lottery sales agent during the preceding year.  A video lottery
sales agent shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal
corporation a copy of each information return issued under this division. 
The Tax Administrator may require that such copies be transmitted
electronically.



      (6)   A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return
and remit the amounts deducted and withheld is personally liable for the
amount deducted and withheld and not remitted.  Such personal liability
extends to any penalty and interest imposed for the late filing of a return
or the late payment of tax deducted and withheld.



   (F)   If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable.  The successor of the
video lottery sales agent that purchases the video lottery terminals from the
agent shall withhold an amount from the purchase money that is sufficient to
cover the amounts deducted and withheld and any penalties and interest
thereon until the predecessor video lottery sales agent operator produces
either of the following:



      (1)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the
amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been
paid;



      (2)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that
no amounts are due.



         If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the
successor is personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and
withheld and penalties and interest thereon.



   (G)   The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and
withhold the required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve
that person from liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that
prize award.



   (H)   If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return
late, fails to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or
fails to remit amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section,
the Tax Administrator of a municipal corporation may impose the following
applicable penalty:

§ 41.061  DETERMINING MUNICIPAL TAXABLE INCOME FOR TAXPAYERS WHO ARE NOT

   Municipal taxable income for a taxpayer who is not an individual for
the municipality is calculated as follows:



   (A)   Income reduced by exempt income to the extent otherwise
included in income, multiplied by apportionment, further reduced by any
pre-2017 net operating loss carryforward equals municipal taxable income.



      (1)   Income for a taxpayer that is not an individual means
the net profit of the taxpayer.



         (a)   Net profit for a person other than an individual
is defined in § 41.03(C)(23).



         (b)   Adjusted federal taxable income is defined in §

APPORTIONMENT.



   This section applies to any taxpayer engaged in a business or
profession in the municipality unless the taxpayer is an individual who
resides in the municipality or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined
company, or telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports
under R.C. Chapter 5745.



   (A)   Net profit from a business or profession conducted both within
and without the boundaries of the municipality shall be considered as having
a taxable situs in the municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation
in the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:



      (1)   The average original cost of the real property and
tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or
profession in the municipality during the taxable period to the average
original cost of all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used
by the taxpayer in the business or profession during the same period,
wherever situated.



         As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or
real property shall include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the
value of such property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental
thereon by eight;



      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the
taxable period to individuals employed in the business or profession for
services performed in the municipality to wages, salaries, and other
compensation paid during the same period to individuals employed in the
business or profession, wherever the individual's services are performed,
excluding compensation from which taxes are not required to be withheld under
§ 41.052;



      (3)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from
sales and rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in
the municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during
the same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.



   (B)   (1)   If the apportionment factors described in division
(A) of this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's
business activity in the municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax
Administrator of the municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with
respect to all or any portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative
apportionment method involving one or more of the following:



         (a)   Separate accounting;



         (b)   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;



         (c)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors
that would provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the
taxpayer to the municipality;



         (d)   A modification of one or more of the factors.



      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment
method shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed
appeal of an assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may
use the requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the
request in an assessment issued within the period prescribed by § 41.19(A).



      (3)   A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this
section only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period
prescribed by § 41.19(A).



      (4)   Nothing in division (B) of this section nullifies or
otherwise affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.



   (C)   As used in division (A)(2) of this section, wages, salaries,
and other compensation includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation
paid to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:



      (1)   A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented
to, or under the possession of one of the following:



         (a)   The employer;



         (b)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the
employer, or a related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;



         (c)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person
described in division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such
a vendor, customer, client, or patient.



      (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing,
investigation, inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative,
judicial, or legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided
that the compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of,
the employer or that the employee's presence at the location directly or
indirectly benefits the employer;



      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines
that the employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other
location in lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (C)(2) of this
section solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income
tax liability. If a Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the
employer may dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of
the evidence, that the Tax Administrator's determination was unreasonable.



   (D)   For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts
from sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a
municipal corporation as follows:



      (1)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale
originated. For the purposes of this division, a sale of property originates
in a municipal corporation if, regardless of where title passes, the property

         (c)   The property is shipped from a place within the

group as defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that,

beginning with the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change
in the reporting method is required under federal law;



         (b)   The election continues to be binding for each
subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing

taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return
for a taxable year shall file a consolidated municipal income tax return for
all subsequent taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives
written permission from the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a
taxpayer has experienced a change in circumstances.

(E)(3), and (E)(4) of this section, corporations that file a consolidated
municipal income tax return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as
defined in § 41.03(C)(1), by substituting "consolidated federal taxable
income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income"
appears in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of
corporation's" for "a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears

      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income
tax return shall make any adjustment otherwise required under § 41.03(C)(1)
to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise subject to the
adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the computation of
consolidated federal taxable income.



      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity
having at least 80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is

entity's net profit or loss for that taxable year:



         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or
loss from the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group
and, for the purpose of making the computations required in § 41.062,
exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through entity
in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the
entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.



         (b)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or
loss in the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and,
for the purpose of making the computations required in § 41.062, include the
property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through entity in the
computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a municipal
corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the entity
shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.



      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity
having less than 80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:



         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal
income tax return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss
from the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for
the purposes of making the computations required in § 41.062, exclude the
property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through entity in the
computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a municipal
corporation;

chapter on the basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be
included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.



   (F)   Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make the computations required under § 41.062 by substituting
"consolidated federal taxable income attributable to" for "net profit from"
wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by substituting
"affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears
in that section.



   (G)   Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax
return is jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties,
fines, charges, or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in
accordance with this chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which
the corporation is a member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one
or more members of such an affiliated group.



   (H)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or
entered into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1,
2016, to file a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal
corporation may continue to file consolidated or combined tax returns in
accordance with such election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and
after January 1, 2016.

§ 41.061.81  DEFINITIONS.



   (A)   If a term used in §§ 41.061.80 to 41.061.95 that is not
otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a comparable context in both the
laws of the United States relating to federal income tax and in R.C. Title
LVII and the use is not consistent, then the use of the term in the laws of
the United States relating to federal income tax shall have control over the
use of the term in R.C. Title LVII, unless the term is defined in R.C.
Chapter 5703, in which case the definition in that chapter shall control. Any
reference in this chapter to the Internal Revenue Code includes other laws of
the United States related to federal income taxes. If a term is defined in
both this section and sections of this code, the definition in this section
shall control for all uses of that term in §§ 41.061.80 to 41.061.95.

held for the production of income.



         (b)   Add an amount equal to 5% of intangible income
deducted under division (B)(1) of this section, but excluding that portion of
intangible income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other
disposition of property described in § 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code.



         (c)   Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the
computation of federal taxable income if the losses directly relate to the
sale, exchange, or other disposition of an asset described in § 1221 or §

         (d)   1.   Except as provided in division (B)(1)(d)2.

excluded in computing federal taxable income, any income derived from a
transfer agreement or from the enterprise transferred under that agreement

         (h)   Deduct exempt income to the extent not otherwise
deducted or excluded in computing adjusted federal taxable income.



         (i)   Deduct any net profit of a pass-through entity
owned directly or indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's
federal taxable income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes
that net profit in the group's federal taxable income in accordance with
division E(3)(b) of § 41.061.86.



         (j)   1.   Add any loss incurred by a pass-through
entity owned directly or indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the

that has made the election described in division (D)(5) of § 41.01 of this
code, the taxpayer shall compute adjusted federal taxable income under this
section as if the taxpayer were a C corporation, except guaranteed payments
and other similar amounts paid or accrued to a partner, former partner,
shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member shall not be
allowed as a deductible expense unless such payments are in consideration for
the use of capital and treated as payment of interest under § 469 of the
Internal Revenue Code or United States Treasury Regulations. Amounts paid or
accrued to a qualified self-employed retirement plan with respect to a

shall be construed as allowing the taxpayer to add or deduct any amount more
than once or shall be construed as allowing any taxpayer to deduct any amount
paid to or accrued for purposes of federal self-employment tax.

this code, except that TAXPAYER does not include natural persons or entities
subject to the tax imposed under R.C. Chapter 5745. TAXPAYER may include
receivers, assignees, or trustees in bankruptcy when such persons are
required to assume the role of a taxpayer.



      (5)   TAX RETURN or RETURN. The notifications and reports
required to be filed pursuant to §§ 41.061.80 to 41.061.95 for the purpose

      (6)   TAXABLE YEAR. The calendar year or the taxpayer's fiscal
year ending during the calendar year, or fractional part thereof, upon which
the calculation of the taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income is based
pursuant to this chapter. If a taxpayer's taxable year is changed for federal
income tax purposes, the taxable year for purposes of §§ 41.061.80 to
41.061.95, §§ 41.061.80 to 41.061.95 is changed accordingly but may consist
of an aggregation of more than one taxable year for federal income tax
purposes. The Tax Commissioner may prescribe by rule an appropriate period as
the taxable year for a taxpayer that has had a change of its taxable year for
federal income tax purposes, for a taxpayer that has two or more short
taxable years for federal income tax purposes as the result of a change of
ownership, or for a new taxpayer that would otherwise have no taxable year.

      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment
method shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed
appeal of an assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may
use the requested alternative method unless the Tax Commissioner denies the
request in an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A)
of § 41.061.90.



      (3)   The Tax Commissioner may require a taxpayer to use an

         (c)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person
described in division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such
a vendor, customer, client, or patient.



      (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing,
investigation, inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative,
judicial, or legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided
that the compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of,
the employer or that the employee's presence at the location directly or
indirectly benefits the employer;



      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Commissioner determines
that the employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other
location in lieu of a location described in divisiond (1) or (2) of this
section solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income
tax liability. If the Tax Commissioner makes such a determination, the
employer may dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of
the evidence, that the Tax Commissioner's determination was unreasonable.



   (D)   For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts
from sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to the
Village as follows:

property shall be sitused to the Village only if, regardless of where title
passes, the property meets either of the following criteria:



         (a)   The property is shipped to or delivered within the
Village from a stock of goods located within the Village.



         (b)   The property is delivered within the Village from
a location outside the Village, provided the taxpayer is regularly engaged
through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within
the Village and the sales result from such solicitation or promotion.



      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be
sitused to the Village to the extent that such services are performed in the
Village.



      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from
the sale of real property located in the Village shall be sitused to the
Village of New Bremen.

rents and royalties from real property located in the Village shall be
sitused to the Village of New Bremen.



      (5)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible
personal property shall be sitused to the Village based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the Village of New Bremen.



   (E)   Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating
to the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the
Village in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real
estate agent or broker shall be allocated to the Village based upon the ratio
of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase, or
lease of real estate located in the Village to the commissions received from
the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the taxable year.



   (F)   (1)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal
taxable income, the taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock
option granted to an employee, and if the employee is not required to include
in the employee's income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is
exempted from taxation under divisions (C)(12) and (R)(1)(d) of § 41.01 by
the Village or substantially similar provision of this code of another
municipal corporation, the taxpayer shall add the amount that is exempt from
taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to the Village of
New Bremen. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to its net profit
that was apportioned to the Village any amount other than the amount upon
which the employee would be required to pay tax were the amount related to
the stock option not exempted from taxation.



      (2)   This division applies solely for the purpose of making
an adjustment to the amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned
to the Village under this section.



   (G)   When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this
section for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section,
the owner of a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the
property, payroll, and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.

   (D)   The information described under divisions (B) and (C) of this
section shall be provided to the individual or individuals designated by the
Village Tax Administrator under R.C. § 718.83(D).



   (E)   (1)   The Village expects that the Tax Commissioner will,
pursuant to R.C. § 718.84(E), provide tax returns and other information it
receives in the performance of its administration of the municipal net
profits tax for taxpayers making the election provided in § 41.061.80. The
Tax Administrator shall review these returns and information, as well as the
information received pursuant to divisions (B) and (C) of this section, and
has discretion to refer any taxpayer for audit by the Tax Commissioner. Such
referral shall be made on a form prescribed by the Commissioner and shall
include any information that forms the basis for the referral.



      (2)   If the Tax Commissioner declines to audit a taxpayer
referred by the Tax Administrator under this section, the Village of New

in equity, to ensure that the correct tax liability has been calculated and
paid by the taxpayer.

relevant documents or other information.



         (b)   A taxpayer that files an annual tax return
electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in another manner as

electronically submitting the documents required under this division on or
before January 1, 2019.

automatically receive an extension for the filing of a tax return with the
Commissioner under this section. The extended due date of the return shall be
the 15th day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates.



         (b)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a
six-month extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may
request that the Commissioner grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the
date for filing the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the
Commissioner receives the request on or before the date the municipal income
tax return is due, the Commissioner shall grant the taxpayer's extension
request.



         (c)   An extension of time to file under division (D)(1)
of this section is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the
Tax Commissioner grants an extension of that date.



      (2)   If the Commissioner considers it necessary in order to
ensure payment of a tax imposed in accordance with § 41.04, the Commissioner
may require taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as
provided in this section, including taxpayers not otherwise required to file
annual returns.



   (D)   Each return required to be filed in accordance with this
section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize another
person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Commissioner about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Commissioner to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the
examination or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or
other person only to provide the Commissioner with information that is
missing from the return, to contact the Commissioner for information about

primarily engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone
service in this state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent
local exchange carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.



      (2)   CONSOLIDATED FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN means a
consolidated return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to § 1501
of the Internal Revenue Code.



      (3)   CONSOLIDATED FEDERAL TAXABLE INCOME means the

computed for the purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return,
before consideration of net operating losses or special deductions.
CONSOLIDATED FEDERAL TAXABLE INCOME does not include income or loss of an
incumbent local exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group
under division (A)(1) of this section.



      (4)   INCUMBENT LOCAL EXCHANGE CARRIER  has the same meaning
as in R.C. § 4927.01.

   (B)   (1)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of
corporations may elect to file a consolidated tax return for a taxable year
if at least one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to
municipal income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of
corporations filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to
that taxable year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning
with the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the
reporting method is required under federal law. The election continues to be
binding for each subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to
discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under division (B)(2) of this
section or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Commissioner. The Tax
Commissioner shall approve such a request for good cause shown.



      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated tax
returns under this section must be made on or before the 15th day of the
fourth month of the year following the last year of a five-year consolidated
tax return election period in effect under division (B)(1) of this section.
The election to discontinue filing a consolidated tax return is binding for a
five-year period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.



      (3)   An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this
section is binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations
subject to a municipal income tax.



      (4)   When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under §
41.061.80, a valid election made by the taxpayer under division (B)(1) or (2)
of § 41.06 is binding upon the Tax Commissioner for the remainder of the
five-year period.



      (5)   When an election made under § 41.061.80 is terminated,
a valid election made under this section is binding upon the Tax

   (C)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of
corporations that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a
taxable year shall file a consolidated tax return for that taxable year if
the Tax Commissioner determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
inter- company transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to a municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated tax return for a taxable year shall file a
consolidated tax return for all subsequent taxable years unless the taxpayer

(3), and (4) of this section, corporations that file a consolidated tax

41.061.81, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income" for "federal
taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division
and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C
corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.



      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall
make any adjustment otherwise required under division (B) of § 41.061.81 to
the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise subject to the
adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the computation of
consolidated federal taxable income.



      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity
having at least 80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or
loss for that taxable year:



         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or
loss from the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group
and, for the purpose of making the computations required in § 41.061.82,
exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through entity
in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the
entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.



         (b)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or
loss in the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and,
for the purpose of making the computations required in § 41.061.82, include
the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through entity in the
computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a municipal
corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the entity
shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.



      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity
having less than 80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:



         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated tax return
shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in § 41.061.82, exclude the
property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through entity in the
computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a municipal
corporation;



         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to
municipal income taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with §§
41.061.80 to 41.061.95 on the basis of the entity's net profits that would
otherwise be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the
affiliated group.



   (F)   Corporations filing a consolidated tax return shall make the
computations required under § 41.061.82 of this code by substituting
"consolidated federal taxable income attributable to" for "net profit from"
wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by substituting
"affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears
in that section.



   (G)   Each corporation filing a consolidated tax return is jointly
and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges, or
other amounts applicable under §§ 41.061.80 to 41.061.95 of this code or
R.C. Chapter 5703 to the corporation, an affiliated group of which the
corporation is a member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or
more members of such an affiliated group.

fails to pay any tax as required under §§ 41.061.80 to 41.061.95, or any
portion of that tax, on or before the date prescribed for its payment,
interest shall be assessed, collected, and paid, in the same manner as the
tax, upon such unpaid amount at the rate per annum prescribed by R.C. §
5703.47 from the date prescribed for its payment until it is paid or until
the date an assessment is issued under § 41.061.90, whichever occurs first.

      (2)   Except as provided in division (B)(4) of this section, a
taxpayer having a taxable year of less than 12 months shall make a
declaration under rules prescribed by the Commissioner.



      (3)   The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or
before the 15th day of the fourth month after the beginning of the taxable
year or on or before the 15th day of the fourth month after the taxpayer
becomes subject to tax for the first time.



      (4)   The Tax Commissioner may waive the requirement for

with, and remit estimated taxes to, the Tax Commissioner at the times and in
the amounts prescribed in division (C)(1) of this section. Remitted taxes

      (2)   If the taxpayer determines that its declaration of
estimated taxes will not accurately reflect the taxpayer's tax liability for
the taxable year, the taxpayer shall increase or decrease, as appropriate,
its subsequent payments in equal installments to result in a more accurate
payment of estimated taxes.



      (3)   (a)   Each taxpayer shall report on the declaration
of estimated taxes the portion of the remittance that the taxpayer estimates
that it owes to each municipal corporation for the taxable year.



         (b)   Upon receiving a payment of estimated taxes under
this section, the Commissioner shall immediately forward the payment to the
Treasurer of State. The Treasurer shall credit the payment in the same manner

of underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as
described in division (E) of this section. The amount of the underpayment
shall be determined as follows:



         (a)   For the first payment of estimated taxes each
year, 22.5% of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by
the date prescribed for that payment;



         (b)   For the second payment of estimated taxes each
year, 45% of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the
date prescribed for that payment;



         (c)   For the third payment of estimated taxes each
year, 67.5% of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by
the date prescribed for that payment;



         (d)   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each
year, 90% of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the
date prescribed for that payment.



      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day
the estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the
payment is made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes
on or before any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous
underpayment only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the
amount of the payment presently due.



      (3)   All amounts collected under this section shall be
considered as taxes collected under §§ 41.061.80 to 41.061.95 and shall be
credited and distributed to municipal corporations in accordance with R.C. §
718.83.



   (E)   An underpayment of any portion of a combined tax liability
shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty imposed by this section
shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if any of the following
apply:



      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at
least 90% of the combined tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end
of the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.



      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at
least 100% of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for the
preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable year
reflected a period of 12 months and the taxpayer filed a municipal income tax
return for that year.

§ 41.061.89  ADDITIONAL PENALTIES.



   (A)   In addition to any other penalty imposed by §§ 41.061.80 to
41.061.95 of this code or R.C. Chapter 5703, the following penalties shall
apply:



      (1)   If a taxpayer required to file a tax return under §§
41.061.80 to 41.061.95 fails to make and file the return within the time
prescribed, including any extensions of time granted by the Tax Commissioner,
the Commissioner may impose a penalty not exceeding $25 per month or fraction
of a month, for each month or fraction of a month elapsing between the due
date, including extensions of the due date, and the date on which the return
is filed. The aggregate penalty, per instance, under this division shall not
exceed $150.



      (2)   If a person required to file a tax return electronically
under §§ 41.061.80 to 41.061.95 fails to do so, the Commissioner may impose
a penalty not to exceed the following:



         (a)   For each of the first two failures, 5% of the
amount required to be reported on the return;



         (b)   For the third and any subsequent failure, 10% of
the amount required to be reported on the return.



      (3)   If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under
§ 41.061.80  fails to timely pay an amount of tax required to be paid under
this chapter, the Commissioner may impose a penalty equal to 15% of the
amount not timely paid.



      (4)   If a taxpayer files what purports to be a tax return
required by §§ 41.061.80 to 41.061.95 that does not contain information
upon which the substantial correctness of the return may be judged or
contains information that on its face indicates that the return is
substantially incorrect, and the filing of the return in that manner is due
to a position that is frivolous or a desire that is apparent from the return
to delay or impede the administration of §§ 41.061.80 to 41.061.95, a
penalty of up to $500 may be imposed.



      (5)   If a taxpayer makes a fraudulent attempt to evade the
reporting or payment of the tax required to be shown on any return required
under §§ 41.061.80 to 41.061.95, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the
greater of $1,000 or 100% of the tax required to be shown on the return.



      (6)   If any person makes a false or fraudulent claim for a
refund under § 41.061.91, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the greater
of $1,000 or 100% of the claim. Any penalty imposed under this division, any
refund issued on the claim, and interest on any refund from the date of the
refund, may be assessed under this code without regard to any time limitation
for the assessment imposed by division (A) of that section.



   (B)   For purposes of this section, the tax required to be shown on
a tax return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax paid on or
before the date, including any extensions of the date, prescribed for filing
the return.



   (C)   Each penalty imposed under this section shall be in addition
to any other penalty imposed under this section. All or part of any penalty
imposed under this section may be abated by the Tax Commissioner. The
Commissioner may adopt rules governing the imposition and abatement of such
penalties.



   (D)   All amounts collected under this section shall be considered
as taxes collected under §§ 41.061.80 to 41.061.95 and shall be credited
and distributed to municipal corporations in the same proportion as the
underlying tax liability is required to be distributed to such municipal
corporations under R.C. § 718.83.



(Ord. 2018-02-06, passed 3-12-18)



§ 41.061.90  ASSESSMENTS AGAINST TAXPAYER.



   (A)   (1)   If any taxpayer required to file a return under §§
41.061.80 to 41.061.95 fails to file the return within the time prescribed,
files an incorrect return, or fails to remit the full amount of the tax due
for the period covered by the return, the Tax Commissioner may make an
assessment against the taxpayer for any deficiency for the period for which
the return or tax is due, based upon any information in the Commissioner's
possession.



      (2)   The Tax Commissioner shall not make or issue an
assessment against a taxpayer more than three years after the later of the
date the return subject to assessment was required to be filed or the date
the return was filed. Such time limit may be extended if both the taxpayer
and the Commissioner consent in writing to the extension. Any such extension
shall extend the three-year time limit in section § 41.061.91 for the same
period of time.



      (3)   There shall be no bar or limit to an assessment against
a taxpayer that fails to file a return subject to assessment as required by
§§ 41.061.80 to 41.061.95, or that files a fraudulent return. The
Commissioner shall give the taxpayer assessed written notice of the
assessment as provided in R.C. § 5703.37. With the notice, the Commissioner
shall provide instructions on how to petition for reassessment and request a
hearing on the petition.



   (B)   Unless the taxpayer assessed files with the Tax Commissioner
within 60 days after service of the notice of assessment, either personally
or by certified mail, a written petition for reassessment signed by the
authorized agent of the taxpayer assessed having knowledge of the facts, the
assessment becomes final, and the amount of the assessment is due and payable
from the taxpayer to the Treasurer of State. The petition shall indicate the
taxpayer's objections, but additional objections may be raised in writing if
received by the Commissioner prior to the date shown on the final
determination. If the petition has been properly filed, the Commissioner
shall proceed under R.C. § 5703.60.



   (C)   (1)   After an assessment becomes final, if any portion of
the assessment remains unpaid, including accrued interest, a certified copy
of the Tax Commissioner's entry making the assessment final may be filed in
the office of the Clerk of the Court of Common Pleas in the county in which
the taxpayer has an office or place of business in this state, the county in
which the taxpayer's statutory agent is located, or Franklin county.



      (2)   Immediately upon the filing of the entry, the Clerk
shall enter a judgment against the taxpayer assessed in the amount shown on
the entry. The judgment may be filed by the Clerk in a loose-leaf book
entitled "special judgments for municipal income taxes," and shall have the
same effect as other judgments. Execution shall issue upon the judgment upon
the request of the Tax Commissioner, and all laws applicable to sales on
execution shall apply to sales made under the judgment.



      (3)   If the assessment is not paid in its entirety within 60
days after the day the assessment was issued, the portion of the assessment
consisting of tax due shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by
R.C. § 5703.47 from the day the Commissioner issues the assessment until the
assessment is paid or until it is certified to the Attorney General for
collection under R.C. § 131.02, whichever comes first. If the unpaid portion
of the assessment is certified to the Attorney General for collection, the
entire unpaid portion of the assessment shall bear interest at the rate per
annum prescribed by R.C. § 5703.47 from the date of certification until the
date it is paid in its entirety. Interest shall be paid in the same manner as
the tax and may be collected by issuing an assessment under this section.



   (D)   All money collected under this section shall be credited to
the municipal income tax fund and distributed to the municipal corporation to
which the money is owed based on the assessment issued under this section.



   (E)   If the Tax Commissioner believes that collection of the tax
will be jeopardized unless proceedings to collect or secure collection of the
tax are instituted without delay, the Commissioner may issue a jeopardy
assessment against the taxpayer liable for the tax. Immediately upon the
issuance of the jeopardy assessment, the Commissioner shall file an entry
with the Clerk of the Court of Common Pleas in the manner prescribed by
division (C) of this section. Notice of the jeopardy assessment shall be
served on the taxpayer assessed or the taxpayer's legal representative in the
manner provided in  R.C. § 5703.37 within five days of the filing of the
entry with the Clerk. The total amount assessed is immediately due and
payable, unless the taxpayer assessed files a petition for reassessment in
accordance with division (B) of this section and provides security in a form
satisfactory to the Commissioner and in an amount sufficient to satisfy the
unpaid balance of the assessment. Full or partial payment of the assessment
does not prejudice the Commissioner's consideration of the petition for
reassessment.



   (F)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that a petition for
reassessment is pending, the taxpayer may pay all or a portion of the
assessment that is the subject of the petition. The acceptance of a payment
by the Treasurer of State does not prejudice any claim for refund upon final
determination of the petition.



      (2)   If upon final determination of the petition an error in
the assessment is corrected by the Tax Commissioner, upon petition so filed
or pursuant to a decision of the Board of Tax Appeals or any court to which
the determination or decision has been appealed, so that the amount due from
the taxpayer under the corrected assessment is less than the portion paid,
there shall be issued to the taxpayer, its assigns, or legal representative a
refund in the amount of the overpayment as provided by § 41.061.91 of this
code, with interest on that amount as provided by that section.



(Ord. 2018-02-06, passed 3-12-18)



§ 41.061.91  REFUND APPLICATIONS.



   (A)   An application to refund to a taxpayer the amount of taxes
paid on any illegal, erroneous, or excessive payment of tax under §§
41.061.80 to 41.061.95, including assessments, shall be filed with the Tax
Commissioner within three years after the date of the illegal, erroneous, or
excessive payment of the tax, or within any additional period allowed by
division (A) of § 41.061.90. The application shall be filed in the form
prescribed by the Tax Commissioner.



   (B)   (1)   On the filing of a refund application, the Tax
Commissioner shall determine the amount of refund to which the applicant is
entitled. The amount determined shall be based on the amount overpaid per
return or assessment. If the amount is greater than $10 and not less than
that claimed, the Commissioner shall certify that amount to the Director of
Budget and Management and the Treasurer of State for payment from the tax
refund fund created in R.C. § 5703.052. If the amount is greater than $10
but less than that claimed, the Commissioner shall proceed in accordance with
R.C. § 5703.70.



      (2)   Upon issuance of a refund under this section, the
Commissioner shall notify each municipal corporation of the amount refunded
to the taxpayer attributable to that municipal corporation, which shall be
deducted from the municipal corporation's next distribution under R.C. §
718.83.



   (C)   Any portion of a refund determined under division (B) of this
section that is not issued within 90 days after such determination shall bear
interest at the rate per annum prescribed by R.C. § 5703.47 from the 91st
day after such determination until the day the refund is paid or credited. On
an illegal or erroneous assessment, interest shall be paid at that rate from
the date of payment on the illegal or erroneous assessment until the day the
refund is paid or credited.



(Ord. 2018-02-06, passed 3-12-18)



§ 41.061.92  AMENDED RETURNS.



   (A)   If any of the facts, figures, computations, or attachments
required in an annual return filed by a taxpayer that has made the election
allowed under § 41.061.80 and used to determine the tax due under §§
41.061.80 to 41.061.95 must be altered as the result of an adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal income tax return, whether initiated by the taxpayer or
the internal revenue service, and such alteration affects the taxpayer's tax
liability under those sections, the taxpayer shall file an amended return
with the Tax Commissioner in such form as the Commissioner requires. The
amended return shall be filed not later than 60 days after the adjustment is
agreed upon or finally determined for federal income tax purposes or after
any federal income tax deficiency or refund, or the abatement or credit
resulting therefrom, has been assessed or paid, whichever occurs first. If a
taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal income tax return,
or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a consolidated
return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax return, the
taxpayer shall notify the Commissioner before filing the amended return.



   (B)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. An amended return required by this section is a
return subject to assessment under § 41.061.90 for the purpose of assessing
any additional tax due under this section, together with any applicable
penalty and interest. The amended return shall not reopen those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed return no
longer subject to assessment that are not affected, either directly or
indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's federal tax return.



   (C)   In the case of an overpayment, an application for refund may
be filed under this division within the 60 day period prescribed for filing
the amended return, even if that period extends beyond the period prescribed
in § 41.061.91, if the application otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that section. An application filed under this division shall claim refund of
overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts, figures,
computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return that
are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal income tax return unless it is also filed within the time
prescribed in § 41.061.91. The application shall not reopen those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments that are not affected, either directly
or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax return.

§ 41.061.93  EXAMINATION OF RECORDS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS AND PERSONS.



   (A)   The Tax Commissioner, or any authorized agent or employee
thereof, may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income
tax returns of any taxpayer or other person that is subject to §§ 41.061.80
to 41.061.95 for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or,
if no return was filed, to ascertain the tax due as required under those
sections. Upon written request by the Commissioner or a duly authorized agent
or employee thereof, every taxpayer or other person subject to this section
is required to furnish the opportunity for the Commissioner, authorized
agent, or employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records,
and federal and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place
designated in the request.



   (B)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer or other
person that is subject to §§ 41.061.80 to 41.061.95 shall be open to the
Tax Commissioner's inspection during business hours and shall be preserved
for a period of six years following the end of the taxable year to which the
records or documents relate, unless the Commissioner, in writing, consents to
their destruction within that period, or by order requires that they be kept
longer. The Commissioner may require any person, by notice served on that
person, to keep such records as the Commissioner determines necessary to show
whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such liability, for
the income tax levied by a municipal corporation.



   (C)   The Tax Commissioner may examine under oath any person that
the Commissioner reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that
was or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to
affect such income. The Commissioner may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and federal income tax returns in such person's possession or
control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.



   (D)   No person issued written notice by the Tax Commissioner
compelling attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books,
papers, records, or federal income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.

the taxpayer's tax return, documentation issued by the Village of New Bremen
granting the credit that confirms the eligibility of the taxpayer for the
credit, the amount of the credit for which the taxpayer is eligible, and the
tax year to which the credit is to be applied.



      (2)   Such documentation shall be provided in the form
prescribed by the Tax Commissioner.



      (3)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize
the Tax Commissioner to enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to grant a
credit, to determine if a taxpayer meets the conditions of a tax credit
agreement entered into by the Village of New Bremen and taxpayer under §
41.18.15 and § 41.18.151, or to modify the terms or conditions of any such
existing agreement.

misdemeanor of the first degree and shall be subject to a fine of not more
than $1,000 or imprisonment for a term of up to six months, or both.



   (B)   Each instance of access or disclosure in violation of division
(A) of § 41.061.84 constitutes a separate offense.



   (C)   These specific penalties shall not be construed to prevent the
Village of New Bremen from prosecuting any and all other offenses that may
apply.

§ 41.07  DECLARATION OF ESTIMATED TAX.



   (A)   As used in this section:



      (1)   Estimated taxes means the amount that the taxpayer
reasonably estimates to be the taxpayer's tax liability for a municipal
corporation's income tax for the current taxable year.



      (2)   Tax liability means the total taxes due to a municipal
corporation for the taxable year, after allowing any credit to which the
taxpayer is entitled, and after applying any estimated tax payment,
withholding payment, or credit from another taxable year.



   (B)   (1)   Every taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated
taxes for the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax
Administrator, if the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least $200. 
For the purposes of this section:



         (a)   Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be
considered as paid to the municipal corporation for which the taxes were
withheld in equal amounts on each payment date.  If the taxpayer establishes
the dates on which all amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld
shall be considered as paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually
withheld.



         (b)   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a
subsequent taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark
stamped on the cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is
made by electronic funds transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used
in this division, date of the postmark means, in the event there is more than
one date on the cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal
service.



         (c)   A taxpayer having a taxable year of less than 12
months shall make a declaration under rules prescribed by the Tax
Administrator.



         (d)   Taxes withheld by a casino operator or by a
lottery sales agent under R.C. § 718.031 are deemed to be paid to the
municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld on the date the taxes
are withheld from the taxpayer's winnings.



      (2)   Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint
declarations of estimated taxes.



      (3)   The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or
before the date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns
under § 41.091(G) or on or before the 15th day of the fourth month of the
first taxable year after the taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the first
time.



      (4)   Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a
declaration on or before the 15th day of the fourth month after the beginning
of each fiscal year or period.



      (5)   The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may
be increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day
as provided in this section.



   (C)   (1)   The required portion of the tax liability for the
taxable year that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the
municipality or Tax Administrator, including the application of tax refunds
to estimated taxes and withholding on or before the applicable payment date,
shall be as follows:



         (a)   On or before the 15th day of the fourth month
after the beginning of the taxable year, 22.5% of the tax liability for the
taxable year;



         (b)   On or before the 15th day of the sixth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, 45% of the tax liability for the taxable

         (d)   On or before the 15th day of the 12th month of the
taxable year, 90% of the tax liability for the taxable year.



      (2)   A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules
prescribed by the Tax Administrator. When an amended declaration has been
filed, the unpaid balance shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid
in equal installments on or before the remaining payment dates. The amended
declaration must be filed on the next applicable due date as outlined in
divisions (C)(1)(a) through (C)(1)(d) of this section.



      (3)   On or before the 15th day of the fourth month of the
year following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was
filed, an annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall
be paid with the return in accordance with § 41.091.



         (a)   For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not
individuals and are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual
tax return is due on the same date as the filing of the federal tax return,
unless extended pursuant to division (G) of R.C. § 5747.08.

reporting and filing on a fiscal year basis or any period other than a
calendar year, the annual return is due on the 15th day of the fourth month
following the end of the taxable year or period.



      (4)   An amended declaration is required whenever the
taxpayer's estimated tax liability changes during the taxable year. A change
in estimated tax liability may either increase or decrease the estimated tax
liability for the taxable year.



   (D)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a
tax liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to § 41.10 upon
the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless the
underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (E) of this
section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:



         (a)   For the first payment of estimated taxes each
year, 22.5% of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;



         (b)   For the second payment of estimated taxes each
year, 45% of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;



         (c)   For the third payment of estimated taxes each
year, 67.5% of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;



         (d)   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each
year, 90% of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.



      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day
the estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the
payment is made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes
on or before any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous
underpayment only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the
amount of the payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.



   (E)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined
under division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the
penalty imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the
taxable year if any of the following apply:



      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at
least 90% of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by
annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.



      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at
least 100% of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for the
preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable year
reflected a period of 12 months and the taxpayer filed a return with the
municipal corporation under § 41.091 for that year.



      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the
municipality but was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the
calendar year that includes the first day of the taxable year.



   (F)   A Tax Administrator may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.

§ 41.081  CREDIT ALLOWED FOR TAX PAID IN ANOTHER MUNICIPALITY.



   (A)   Limitation.  Where a resident of the village is subject to a
municipal tax, on or measured by income, in another municipality either
located within or without the state, he shall not pay a total municipal tax
on the same income greater than the tax imposed at the higher rate.



   (B)   Credits to residents.  Resident individuals of the village
who are required to pay and do pay tax to another municipality on salaries,
wages, commissions, or other compensation for work done or services performed
in such other municipality or on net profits from businesses, professions, or
other activities conducted in such other municipality may claim a credit of
the amount of tax paid by them or on their behalf to such other municipality
but only to the extent of 1.5% tax imposed by the ordinance on such
compensation or net profits.



   (C)   Method of applying for credit.



      (1)   No credit will be given unless the taxpayer claims such
on his final return or other form prescribed by the Commissioner and presents
such evidence of the payment of a similar tax to another municipality, as the
Commissioner may require.



      (2)   A statement satisfactory to the Commissioner from the
taxing authority of the municipality to which the taxes are paid that a
village resident or his employer is paying the tax shall be considered as
fulfilling the requirements of this section.

§ 41.082  REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR QUALIFYING LOSS.



   (A)   As used in this section:



      (1)   Nonqualified deferred compensation plan means a
compensation plan described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue
Code.



      (2)   (a)   Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) of
this section, qualifying loss means the excess, if any, of the total amount
of compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has
recognized for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a
cumulative basis as compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of
money and property attributable to distributions in connection with the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.



         (b)   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer
has not paid to one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the
entire amount of compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a
nonqualified deferred compensation plan, then the qualifying loss is the
product of the amount resulting from the calculation described in division
(A)(2)(a) of this section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of
this section and a fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such
compensation on which the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more
municipal corporations and the denominator of which is the total amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.



         (c)   With respect to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan, the taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the
taxable year in which the taxpayer receives the final distribution of money
and property pursuant to that nonqualified deferred compensation plan.



      (3)   Qualifying tax rate means the applicable tax rate for
the taxable year for which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal
corporation with respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan. If different tax rates applied for different taxable
years, then the qualifying tax rate is a weighted average of those different
tax rates. The weighted average shall be based upon the tax paid to the
municipal corporation each year with respect to the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.



   (B)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a
refundable credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a
municipal corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during
the taxable year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of
the qualifying loss and the qualifying tax rate.



      (2)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this
section from each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal
income tax with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one
or more taxable years.



      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal
corporation with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
amount of the credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal
corporation shall be calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's
proportionate share of the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the
taxpayer to all municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.



      (4)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under
this section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.



   (C)   (1)   For purposes of this section, municipal corporation
income tax that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.



      (2)   Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or
otherwise credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a
nonqualified deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been
paid to the municipal corporation by the taxpayer.



   (D)   The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the
extent the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:



      (1)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had
established the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or



      (2)   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of
the employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified
deferred compensation.

resident of the municipality who works in a joint economic development zone
created under R.C. § 715.691 or a joint economic development district
created under R.C. § 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 to the same extent that it

§ 41.084  CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.



   (A)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the
municipality, but should have been deposited or paid to another municipal
corporation, is allowable by the municipality as a refund, but is subject to
the three-year limitation on refunds as provided in § 41.096.



   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation,
shall be subject to collection and recovery by the municipality. To the
extent a refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on
refunds as provided in § 41.096, the municipality will allow a
non-refundable credit equal to the tax or withholding paid to the other
municipality against the income tax the municipality claims is due. If the
municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax representing the net difference of
the tax rates is also subject to collection by the municipality, along with
any penalty and interest accruing during the period of nonpayment.



   (C)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the
overpayment is beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as
provided in § 41.096.



   (D)   Nothing in this section requires a municipality to allow
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation if the municipality has
reduced credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation. Section 41.081
regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail.

      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall accept on behalf of all
nonresident individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an
employer, or other payer located in the municipality under § 41.051(C) when
the nonresident individual taxpayer's sole income subject to the tax is the
qualifying wages reported by the employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer, and no additional tax is due to the municipality.



      (3)   All resident individual taxpayers, 18 years of age and
older, shall file an annual municipal income tax return with the

   (C)   If an individual is unable to complete and file a return or
notice required by the municipality in accordance with this chapter, the
return or notice required of that individual shall be completed and filed by
the individual's duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or
other person charged with the care of the person or property of that
individual. Such duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or
other person charged with the care of the person or property of that
individual shall provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate
documentation to support that they are authorized to file a return or notice
on behalf of the taxpayer. This notice shall include any legally binding
authorizations, and contact information including name, address, and phone
number of the duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or
other person.



   (D)   Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be
completed and filed by the fiduciary of the estate or trust. Such fiduciary
shall provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to
support that they are authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the
taxpayer. This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and
contact information including name, address, and phone number of the
fiduciary.



   (E)   No municipal corporation shall deny spouses the ability to
file a joint return.



   (F)   (1)   Each return required to be filed under this section
shall contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized
agent and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer, and shall
include the taxpayer's Social Security number or taxpayer identification
number. Each return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of
perjury.



      (2)   A taxpayer who is an individual is required to include,
with each annual return, amended return, or request for refund required under
this section, copies of only the following documents: all of the taxpayer's
Internal Revenue Service form W-2, "Wage and Tax Statements," including all
information reported on the taxpayer's federal W-2, as well as taxable wages
reported or withheld for any municipal corporation; the taxpayer's Internal
Revenue Service form 1040 or, in the case of a return or request required by
a qualified municipal corporation, Ohio IT 1040; and, with respect to an
amended tax return or refund request, any other documentation necessary to
support the refund request or the adjustments made in the amended return. An
individual taxpayer who files the annual return required by this section
electronically is not required to provide paper copies of any of the
foregoing to the Tax Administrator unless the Tax Administrator requests such
copies after the return has been filed.



      (3)   A taxpayer that is not an individual is required to
include, with each annual net profit return, amended net profit return, or
request for refund required under this section, copies of only the following
documents: the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form 1065, form

annual net profit return electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or
in some other manner shall either mail the documents required under this
division to the Tax Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic
submission is available, submit the documents electronically through the Ohio
Business Gateway or a portal provided by municipality. The Department of
Taxation shall publish a method of electronically submitting the documents
required under this division through the Ohio Business Gateway on or before
January 1, 2016. The Department shall transmit all documents submitted
electronically under this division to the appropriate Tax Administrator.



      (5)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax
Administrator shall request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information,
statements, or documents required by the municipality to determine and verify
the taxpayer's municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under
division (F) of this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files
on a generic form or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.



      (6)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other
municipal income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to
verify credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return
shall also be included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the
Tax Administrator of undocumented credits or losses.



   (G)   (1)   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this
chapter, each individual income tax return required to be filed under this
section shall be completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on
or before the date prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax
returns under division (G) of R.C. § 5747.08.  The taxpayer shall complete
and file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or
on generic forms, together with remittance made payable to the municipality
or Tax Administrator.



         (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
annual net profit income tax return required to be filed under this section
by a taxpayer that is not an individual shall be completed and filed as
required by the Tax Administrator on or before the 15th day of the fourth
month following the end of the taxpayer's taxable year or period. The
taxpayer shall complete and file the return or notice on forms prescribed by
the Tax Administrator or on generic forms, together with remittance made
payable to the municipality or Tax Administrator.



         (c)   In the case of individual income tax return
required to be filed by an individual, and net profit income tax return
required to be filed by a taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is
required if the amount shown to be due is $10 or less.



      (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order
to ensure the payment of the tax imposed by the municipality in accordance
with this chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file
returns and make payments otherwise than as provided in this section,
including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual returns.



      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom § 41.092 applies, to
the extent that any provision in this division conflicts with any provision
in § 41.092, the provision in § 41.092 prevails.



   (H)   (1)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the
municipality shall not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net
profits if the amount due is $10 or less.



      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the
municipality for a taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section
shall file with the municipality an annual net profit return under division
(F)(3) and (F)(4) of this section.



   (I)   This division shall not apply to payments required to be made
under § 41.051(B)(1)(b) or (B)(1)(c).



      (1)   If any report, claim, statement, or other document
required to be filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed
period or on or before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered
after that period or that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official with which the report, claim, statement, or other document is
required to be filed, or to which the payment is required to be made, the
date of the postmark stamped on the cover in which the report, claim,
statement, or other document, or payment is mailed shall be deemed to be the
date of delivery or the date of payment. The date of postmark means, in the
event there is more than one date on the cover, the earliest date imprinted
on the cover by the postal service.



      (2)   If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds
transfer, the payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited
to an account designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax
payments, except that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is
delayed due to circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the
payment is considered to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. For
purposes of this section, submitted the payment means the date which the
taxpayer has designated for the delivery of payment, which may or may not be
the same date as the date the payment was initiated by the taxpayer.



   (J)   The amounts withheld for the municipality by an employer, the
agent of an employer, or other payer as described in § 41.051 shall be
allowed to the recipient of the compensation as credits against payment of
the tax imposed on the recipient unless the amounts withheld were not
remitted to the municipality and the recipient colluded with the employer,
agent, or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the amounts
withheld.



   (K)   Each return required by the municipality to be filed in
accordance with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check
to authorize another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the
return, to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to
the return.  The return or instructions accompanying the return shall
indicate that by checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax
Administrator to contact the preparer or other person concerning questions
that arise during the examination or other review of the return and
authorizes the preparer or other person only to provide the Tax Administrator
with information that is missing from the return, to contact the Tax
Administrator for information about the examination or other review of the
return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or payments, and to respond to
notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or return preparation that the
taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator and has shown to the
preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of another person to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return
does not preclude the Tax Administrator from contacting the taxpayer
regarding such matters.



   (L)   The Tax Administrator of the municipality shall accept for
filing a generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required
by the municipality in accordance with this chapter, provided that the
generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the information
required by ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the municipality or
Tax Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer
filing the generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this
chapter and of the municipality's ordinance or resolution governing the
filing of returns, reports, or documents.



   (M)   When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require
the signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.



   (N)   (1)   As used in this division, worksite location has the
same meaning as in § 41.052.



      (2)   A person may notify a tax administrator that the person
does not expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation
for a taxable year if both of the following conditions apply:



         (a)   The person was required to file a tax return with
the municipal corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because
the person performed services at a worksite location within the municipal
corporation, and the person has filed all appropriate and required returns
and remitted all applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided
by this chapter. The Tax Administrator is not required to accept an affidavit
from a taxpayer who has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.



         (b)   The person no longer provides services in the
municipal corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal
corporation's income tax for the taxable year.



            The person shall provide the notice in a signed
affidavit that briefly explains the person's circumstances, including the
location of the previous worksite location and the last date on which the
person performed services or made any sales within the municipal corporation.
The affidavit also shall include the following statement: "The affiant has no
plans to perform any services within the municipal corporation, make any
sales in the municipal corporation, or otherwise become subject to the tax
levied by the municipal corporation during the taxable year. If the affiant
does become subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation for the
taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly
register as a taxpayer with the municipal corporation, if such a registration
is required by the municipal corporation's resolutions, ordinances, or
rules." The person shall sign the affidavit under penalty of perjury.



         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in
division (N)(2) of this section, the Tax Administrator shall not require the
person to file any tax return for the taxable year unless the Tax
Administrator possesses information that conflicts with the affidavit or if
the circumstances described in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has
engaged in activity which results in work being performed, services provided,
sales made, or other activity that results in municipal taxable income
reportable to the municipality in the taxable year. It shall be the
responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the provisions of this chapter
relating to the reporting and filing of municipal taxable income on an annual
municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit has been filed with the Tax
Administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in division (N) of this section
prohibits the Tax Administrator from performing an audit of the person.

of the municipality for both an extension of time for filing of the return
and an extension of time for payment of taxes required by the municipality in
accordance with this chapter during the period of the member's or civilian's
duty service and for 180 days thereafter. The application shall be filed on
or before the 180th day after the member's or civilian's duty terminates. An
applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax Administrator considers
necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.



   (B)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant
is qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the 181st day after the applicant's active duty or

pay any tax otherwise due to the municipality before the 181st day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates.



      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under

extension of time in which to make any payment of taxes required by the
municipality in accordance with this chapter. The length of any extension
granted under division (C)(2)(a) of this section shall be equal to the length
of the corresponding extension that the taxpayer receives under the Internal
Revenue Code. As used in this section, qualifying taxpayer means a member of

§ 41.095  AMENDED RETURNS.



   (A)   (1)   A taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax
Administrator in such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's
annual return to determine the tax due levied by the municipality in
accordance with this chapter must be altered.



      (2)   Within 60 days after the final determination of any
federal or state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax
liability, that taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return
showing income subject to the municipal income tax based upon such final

municipal income tax shown due thereon or make a claim for refund of any
overpayment, unless the tax or overpayment is $10 or less.



      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated
municipal income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate
return to a consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal
income tax return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before
filing the amended return.



   (B)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return
shall be accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together
with any penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is
$10 or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as
provided under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless the
applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under §
41.19 has not expired for a previously filed return.



      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the
amount of tax that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and
attachments were reopened.



   (C)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund
may be filed under this division within the period prescribed by §
41.19(A)(2) for filing the amended return even if it is filed beyond the
period prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the
requirements of that division. If the amount of the refund is $10 or less, no
refund need be paid by the municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set forth
in division (C)(2) of this section, a request filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in § 41.096. Except as set forth in division
(C)(2) of this section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures,
computations, or attachments that are not affected, either directly or
indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax
return.



      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of

      (1)   Overpayments of more than $10;



      (2)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds

setting forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator,
within three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation,
including schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and/or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.



      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator
shall determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the
appropriate municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in
division (B)(3) of this section, the Administrator shall issue an assessment
to any taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The
assessment shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons
for the denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.



      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a
refund request included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income
tax return, the Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of
the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and
instructions for requesting an assessment that may be appealed under § 41.18.



   (C)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for
filing specified in division (B) of this section shall be considered to have
been filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:



      (1)   The request is delivered by the postal service, and the
earliest postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is
enclosed is not later than the last day for filing the request.

such last day.



      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no

received within seven days of the last day for making the request.



   (D)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a
taxpayer of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the
overpayment until the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if
any overpayment is refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the
annual return or 90 days after the completed return is filed, whichever is
later, no interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of
computing the payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for
any taxable year shall be considered to have been paid before the date on
which the return on which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any
extension of time for filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the
interest rate described in § 41.10(A)(4).

   (B)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or
other person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is
subject to, the provisions of this chapter shall be open to the Tax
Administrator's inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a
period of six years following the end of the taxable year to which the
records or documents relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing,
consents to their destruction within that period, or by order requires that
they be kept longer. The Tax Administrator of a municipal corporation may
require any person, by notice served on that person, to keep such records as
the Tax Administrator determines necessary to show whether or not that person
is liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax levied by the
municipality or for the withholding of such tax.



   (C)   The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that
the Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income
that was or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending
to affect such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel
any such person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books,
papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's
possession or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such
hearing or examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law
by a person who is not an attorney.



   (D)   No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator
compelling attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books,
papers, records, or federal and state income tax returns under this section
shall fail to comply.

document with the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which
may include the person's Social Security number, federal employer
identification number, or other identification number requested by the Tax
Administrator. A person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information that has experienced any change with respect to that
information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon,
filing the next tax document requiring the identifying information.



   (B)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for
identifying information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid
identifying information within 30 days of making the request, nothing in this

person to whom the request was directed pursuant to § 41.10, in addition to
any applicable penalty described in § 41.99.



      (2)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change
with respect to that information as required under division (A) of this

identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to § 41.100.



      (3)   The penalties provided for under divisions (B)(1) and
(B)(2) of this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the
tax or fee with respect to which the identifying information is sought and
are in addition to any applicable criminal penalties described in § 41.99
for a violation of § 41.15 and any other penalties that may be imposed by
the Tax Administrator by law.

Administrator of the municipality or a designee thereof may furnish copies of
returns filed or otherwise received under this chapter and other related tax
information to the Internal Revenue Service, the State Tax Commissioner, and

§ 41.16  OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.



   (A)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator means an opinion issued
under this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax
liability. It does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax
Administrator.



   (B)   A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the
Tax Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the
Tax Administrator shall be an opinion of the Tax Administrator and shall bind
the Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (C), (G), and (H) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:



      (1)   The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes
the specific facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the
taxability of the income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if
an activity or transaction, all parties involved in the activity or
transaction are clearly identified by name, location, or other pertinent
facts.



      (2)   The request relates to a tax imposed by the municipality
in accordance with this chapter.



      (3)   The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax
Administrator and designated as an opinion of the Tax Administrator.



   (C)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and
shall protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who
reasonably relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest
otherwise chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the
Tax Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the
opinion, or until the earliest of the following dates:



      (1)   The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax
Administrator sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt
requested. The effective date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date
of receipt or one year after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;



      (2)   The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a
relevant section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the
municipality's income tax ordinance that would substantially change the
analysis and conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;



      (3)   The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing
or changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code,
uncodified state law, or the municipality's income tax ordinance;



      (4)   If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the
relevant federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues
an opinion establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal
statutes or regulations;



      (5)   The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's
material facts or circumstances;



      (6)   The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if
specified in the opinion.



   (D)   (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any
activity or transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained
any misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.



      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the
pertinent facts or omitted material facts with intent to defraud the
municipality in order to obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be
in violation of § 41.15.



   (E)   If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this
section, the opinion shall include a statement that:



      (1)   The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be
subject to change for any of the reasons stated in division (C) of this
section;



      (2)   It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such
changes.

opinions of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.



   (H)   An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator
only with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does
not bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.



   (I)   A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all
opinions issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a
taxpayer who has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential.
In no event shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax
Administrator has removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and
any other parties involved in the activity or transaction.



   (J)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section
or a refusal to offer an opinion under division (F) of this section may not
be appealed.

§ 41.17  ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.



   (A)   (1)   The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment
either by personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service
authorized under R.C. § 5703.056.



      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.



      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within 60
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in R.C. § 718.18 is prima facie evidence that
delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.



   (B)   (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery
and service as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption
of delivery and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was
sent was not an address with which the person was associated at the time the
Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the
purposes of this section, a person is associated with an address at the time
the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the
person was residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the
address; or if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the
address and, when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the
person's affiliate was conducting business at the address. For the purposes
of this section, a person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time
the assessment was mailed, owned or controlled at least 20%, as determined by
voting rights, of the addressee's business.



      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis
described in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is
subject to collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so
within 60 days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other
municipal official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in
this division prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering
into a compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such
an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review.

§ 41.18  LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.



   (A)   (1)   The legislative authority of the municipality shall
maintain a Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in R.C.
Chapter 718.



      (2)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three
members.  Two members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the
municipality, and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors
with the municipality at any time during their term or in the five years
immediately preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed
by the top administrative official of the municipality. This member may be an
employee of the municipality, but may not be the Director of Finance or
equivalent officer, or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an
employee directly involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct
subordinate thereof.



      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review
appointed by the legislative authority of the municipality shall be two
years. There is no limit on the number of terms that a member may serve
should the member be reappointed by the legislative authority. The Board
member appointed by the top administrative official of the municipality shall
serve at the discretion of the administrative official.



      (4)   Members of the Board of Tax Review appointed by the
legislative authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set
forth in R.C. § 718.11(A)(4).



      (5)   A member of the Board who, for any reason, ceases to
meet the qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall
resign immediately by operation of law.



      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the
same manner as the original appointment within 60 days of when the vacancy
was created. Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the
expiration of the term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall
hold office for the remainder of such term. No vacancy on the Board shall
impair the power and authority of the remaining members to exercise all the
powers of the Board.



      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the Board
due to a conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the
legislative authority or top administrative official that appointed the
member shall appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the Board in
the member's place. This appointment shall be subject to the same
requirements and limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the
member temporarily unable to serve.



      (8)   No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the Board.



      (9)   A member of a Local Board of Tax Review shall not be
appointed to or serve on another such board simultaneously.



   (B)   Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer
may appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be
directed, and to whom the appeal should be directed.



   (C)   Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the Board by filing a request with the Board. The request shall
be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should
be deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within 60 days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.



   (D)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be
held within 60 days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division
(C) of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare
or waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer
may appear before the Board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The Board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within 120 days after the first day of the
hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.



   (E)   The Board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax
Administrator's assessment or any part of that assessment. The Board shall
issue a final determination on the appeal within 90 days after the Board's
final hearing on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by
ordinary mail to all of the parties to the appeal within 15 days after
issuing the final determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may
appeal the Board's final determination as provided in R.C. § 5717.011.



   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section
shall adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related
costs, and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the
Local Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended
as needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public
records available for inspection under R.C. § 149.43.  For this reason, any
documentation, copies of returns or reports, final determinations, or working
papers for each case must be maintained in a secure location under the
control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local Board of Tax Review
may remove such documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers from the hearing. Hearings requested by a
taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section
are not meetings of a public body subject to R.C. § 121.22.  For this
reason, such hearings shall not be open to the public, and only those parties
to the case may be present during the hearing.

            1.   Three years after the tax was due or the
return was filed, whichever is later; or



            2.   One year after the conclusion of the

      (2)   As used in this section, qualifying deferral period
means a period of time beginning and ending as follows:



         (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by
an assessment files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in
§ 41.18.  That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision,
finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the Local Board
of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did not have
jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part of that
assessment.



         (b)   Ending the later of the 60th day after the date on
which the final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final
or, if any party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax
Review, the 60th day after the date on which the final determination of the
Local Board of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part
or ultimately reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in
whole or in part, or that reversal is available or taken.

   (D)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending,
the petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject
of the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the municipality does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.



      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in
the assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed
or pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under § 41.18, of the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals, or any court to which the
decision of the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals has been appealed, so that the
amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less
than the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the
appellant's assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the
overpayment as provided by § 41.096, with interest on that amount as
provided by division (D) of this section.

the imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;



      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.

§ 50.04  DISCONNECTION PROCEDURES.



   (A)   Disconnection of utility service shall not occur after 12:30

§ 50.06  PROPERTY OWNERS OF REAL ESTATE MUST GUARANTEE PAYMENT OF UTILITY
ACCOUNTS.



   (A)   Beginning with the effective date of this section, no utility
account may be transferred or opened without first requiring the owner of the
real estate for which the utilities are to serve to sign a written “Utility
Account Guarantee” (attached to Ordinance No. 1996-3-11, passed April 23,
1996, as Exhibit A) guaranteeing payment of all bills for utility services
and granting a lien upon all real estate which they own if the utility bills
under that account become past due.



   (B)   No new utility accounts will be opened for a location unless
all utility bills for services provided to that location are paid current.



   (C)   Any tenant wishing to open a new utility account will sign an
“Assumption of Liability to Pay Utility  Bill” (attached to  Ordinance
1996-3-11, passed  April 23, 1996,  as Exhibit B) indicating they will
assume responsibility for payment of the utility bills. This assumption,
however, will not relieve the land owner of the guarantee to pay the utility
account in the event that the tenant failed to make the utility bill payment.



   (D)   The Village Administrator is prohibited from authorizing
service to a location without the signed “Assumption of Liability to Pay
Utility Bill” and/or “Utility Account Guarantee” being on file with the
Village Clerk-Treasurer. This policy may only be waived by the express
written approval of the Mayor of the village.



   (E)   Where utility service is being provided to a real estate
location which would require the “Utility Account Guarantee” under
division (A) of this section, and the owner refuses to sign the “Utility
Account Guarantee”, the Village Administrator is to start procedure for
termination of utility services under the policy for termination of utility
services adopted by this Council.



   (F)   No utility service will be provided to a real estate location
where the landowner or the tenant has a previous unpaid utility account with
New Bremen Utilities.



(Ord. 1996-3-11, passed 4-23-96)

§ 50.23  REGULATIONS FOR WELLS.



   (A)   Should any land owner within the village desire to drill or
excavate a well, said land owner must submit an application which contains
the purpose of the well, the expected drilling depth of the well, and the
name of the driller who will be doing the drilling and excavating work, along
with a permit fee of $500 to the Village Administrator. The Village
Administrator will then schedule a public hearing of the Village Utility
Committee to determine whether the well is of such a nature that it could
contaminate or endanger the village water system or its water reserves.



      (1)   If the well is not of the nature that could endanger the
village water system or reserves, the Utility Committee will advise the
Village Administrator within two working days after the public hearing, and
the Village Administrator will submit said application to an Ohio licensed
engineering firm qualified to advise the village on subterranean water supply
issues, who will be hired by the village to advise the Administrator as to
whether the planned well could in any way interfere or contaminate the
village's current water supply. The application fee of $500 will be used to
offset the fee for the engineer's review. If the engineer advises the Village
Administrator that there is no possible danger to the village water supply,
the Village Administrator shall approve the application and allow the well to
be drilled.



      (2)   If the well is of the nature that could endanger the
village water supply, then the Utility Committee will advise the Village

is denied and the reason for said denial.

drilling of a well pursuant to this section shall prohibit any effluent from
the well from being discharged into the village sanitary sewer system.



   (C)   Any person who violates this section shall be fined not less
than $100, nor more than $1,000 for each day that a well exists on the
property, beginning with the day drilling or excavation has begun for a well
and continuing until the well is sealed as defined in R.C. § 1521.05(A)(6).
Each day shall be a separate violation.

   (A)   Should an industrial or commercial customer within the village
be engaged in manufacturing procedures that involve substantial amounts of
process water, the customer shall, at his or her own expense, install
necessary plumbing and metering to determine the amounts of water consumed
that do not require sewage treatment.



   (B)   Said customers must be located in the areas designated on the
Official Zoning Map of the village as I-1 or I-2 zones.



   (C)   The village must approve the specific plumbing arrangement and
metering equipment used in order to achieve accurate metering and billing and

for the installation of appliances used in connection therewith, and will
hold the Utility harmless from and against all claims for injury or damage to
persons or property occasioned by or in any way resulting from such service
or the use thereof on the customer's side of the point of delivery.



   (B)   Overhead.  When service is supplied from an overhead system,
the customer must first submit a plan to the village so that the village can
approve the location of the delivery point. Once the village has approved the
location, the village will provide the customer's electrician with the
necessary meter base. After the customers electrician has installed the meter
base and weather head, the customer's electrician must install the
appropriate conductor up the weather head and extend it 18 inches beyond the
end so that the utility can make proper electric connection. Once the
installation has passed all the necessary inspections, the village will
install the necessary equipment to complete the electric service to the
facility.



   (C)   Underground.  When service is supplied from an underground
distribution system, the customer must first submit a plan to the village so
that the village can approve the location of the delivery point. Once the
village has approved the location, the village will provide the customers
electrician with the necessary meter base. It is the customer's
responsibility to install the necessary equipment from the facility to the
village's step down transformer or nearest utility junction box.  The
village will make final connection of these conductors to its electric
equipment.



   (D)   All inside wiring must be grounded in accordance with the
requirements of the National Electrical Code, and the requirements of any
local inspection service authorized by the Village of New Bremen. When a
customer desires that energy be delivered at a point or in a manner other
than that designated by the Utility, the customer shall pay the additional
cost of same.



(Ord. 2002-12-43, passed 1-28-03)



§ 51.35  CONTINUITY OF SERVICE.



   (A)   The Utility shall furnish necessary and adequate service and
facilities. The Utility shall not be liable in damages for failure to supply
electricity or for interruptions in service, and shall be relieved of its
obligation to serve and may discontinue or modify service, if such failure or
interruption is due to acts of God, public enemy, military actions, wars,
insurrections, riots, civil disturbances, vandalism, strikes, fires, floods,
washouts, explosions, acts or orders of any civil, judicial or military
authorities, and without limitation by the foregoing accidents, contingencies
or other causes beyond the control of the Utility.



   (B)   Without incurring any liability therefore, the Utility may
also suspend service for such periods as may be reasonably necessary in order
to make repairs to or changes in its facilities or other property; provided
that the Utility shall keep a record of any interruption of service affecting
its entire system, or a major division thereof, including a statement of
time, duration and cause of interruption. It will also notify customers
affected by the interruption in advance of the contemplated work, and
approximately how long the interruption will last.



   (C)   Subject to 51.38, the Utility shall not discontinue service to
any customer without giving the customer reasonable notice. Such notice shall
be delivered either personally or telephonically when possible and practical.
In circumstances, however caused, when time does not permit the giving of
such notice in advance of a discontinuance of service or a change in service
caused by circumstances beyond the control of the Utility, reasonable notice
shall be given whenever possible and practical to all customers affected
advising them that service is off and of the time at which service is
expected to be restored.



   (D)   In the event that there has been an interruption of service to
any premises, however caused, the Utility shall, before restoring such
service, ascertain and assure itself that precautions have been taken to
prevent accidents.

Utility. No one except the agents of the Utility shall be allowed to make any
internal or external adjustments of any meter or other piece of apparatus,
which shall be the property of the Utility. The Utility shall have the right

§ 51.37  SERVICE NOT TO BE DISTURBED.



   No customer shall attach or use any appliance, which may result in the
altering of service provided through the Utility's lines. Without prior
approval from the Utility, no customer shall attach or use any appliance or
device, which will increase, decrease, or otherwise alter service provided

continuous service to other customers.



(Ord. 2002-12-43, passed 1-28-03)



§ 51.38  NO CUSTOMER SHALL SELL TO ANOTHER.



   Service furnished by the Utility is for the sole use of the customer
and shall not be resold by the customer except on written permission obtained
from the Utility. The renting of premises with the cost of service included
in the rental as an incidence of tenancy will not be considered a resale of
such services.



(Ord. 2002-12-43, passed 1-28-03)



§ 51.39  ACCESS TO PREMISES.

interior of any structures on the premises of a customer without the express
permission of such customer except in cases of emergency. Any agent or
employee seeking entrance into or upon the premises of a customer shall have
and show symbols of identification. Any agent or employee seeking entrance to
the interior of any structures on the premises shall advise the owner or
occupant as to his purpose in doing so. Except in cases of emergency, no

(Ord. 2002-12-43, passed 1-28-03)



§ 51.40  RIGHT-OF-WAY.



   The customer, without reimbursement, will make or procure conveyance to
the Utility of right-of-way or right of entry and installed lines
satisfactory to the Utility to permit the Utility to cross property between
the Utility's lines and the customer's property at the location where service
is to be furnished, including property owned or controlled by the customer
for the Utility's distribution lines, extensions thereof or appurtenances
necessary or incidental to the supplying of service to the customer.



(Ord. 2002-12-43, passed 1-28-03)



§ 51.41  METER LOCATION AND METER TAMPERING.



   (A)   Meter Furnished.  The Utility will furnish each customer with
a meter of such size and type as the Utility may determine will adequately
serve the customer's requirements. Such meter shall be and remain the
property of the Utility, and the Utility shall have the right to replace it,
as the Utility may deem necessary.



   (B)   Meter Location.  The Utility shall determine the location of
the meter. When changes in buildings or arrangements therein render the meter
inaccessible or exposed to hazards, the Utility may require the customer, at
the customer's expense, to relocate the meter setting together with any
portion of the customer's service line necessary to accomplish such
relocation.



   (C)   Only Utility can connect meter.  As used in this section,
TAMPER means to interfere with, damage, or by-pass a utility meter, conduit,
or attachment with the intent to impede the correct registration of a meter
or the proper functions of a conduit or attachment so as to reduce the amount
of utility service that is registered on the meter.



      (1)   No customer shall tamper with a meter, conduit, or
attachment of the Utility that has been disconnected by the Utility.  The
owner or customer shall not permit anyone who is not an authorized agent of
the Utility to connect or disconnect the Utility's meters, or in any way
alter or interfere with the Utility's meters. Proof that a meter, conduit, or
attachment of a utility has been tampered with is prima-fascia evidence that
a person who is obligated to pay for the service rendered through the meter,
conduit, or attachment is in possession or control of the meter, conduit, or
attachment at the time the tampering occurred and has caused the tampering
with intent to commit a theft offense.



      (2)   Tampering with or bypassing a meter constitutes a theft
offense that could result in the imposition of criminal sanctions.



   (D)   Meter Test. 



      (1)   All meters shall be tested at such intervals and use
such methods as may be prescribed by generally accepted standards. The meter
shall be removed from the customer's premises for such test and a substitute
meter, newly tested, shall be installed in its place. After the meter has
been tested and before it is returned to service at the same or a different
location, it shall be adjusted to be accurate within 3% plus or minus.



      (2)   The Utility shall also test the meter at any time, at
the request of the customer. Such test shall be performed in the presence of
the customer if he so requests. If the meter is found to be correct, as
defined below, the customer shall pay the Meter Testing Fee, as stated in
51.17.



      (3)   The date of inspection shall be stamped on the meter.



   (E)   Correct Meter.  A meter registering between 3% fast and 3%
slow shall be deemed for all purposes to be registering correctly.  A meter
registering incorrectly shall be replaced by the Utility at its expense.



   (F)   Indoor Wiring.  The customer shall install and maintain, at
the customers expense, indoor wiring from the outlet of the meter electrical
appliances.  The Utility shall have no obligation to install, maintain, or
repair said wiring.



(Ord. 2002-12-43, passed 1-28-03)



§ 51.42  ELECTRICAL APPLIANCES.



   The customer shall install and maintain all electrical appliances. 
The Utility shall have no obligation to install, maintain, or repair
appliances.



(Ord. 2002-12-43, passed 1-28-03)



§ 51.43  INSPECTION OF ALTERED WIRING.



   It shall be the duty of the customer to notify the Utility promptly of
any additions, changes, alterations, remodeling, or reconstruction affecting
service on the customer's premises.



(Ord. 2002-12-43, passed 1-28-03)



§ 51.44  EXTENSION OF DISTRIBUTION LINES.



   (A)   Inside the Village.  If a customer is developing a new
facility in the village limits, the Village of New Bremen will install the
necessary equipment to provide overhead or underground electric service
(see51.34 for more information) to this new facility.  The village will
extend its equipment to the approved delivery point.  It is the customer's
responsibility to install all the necessary equipment from the delivery point
in to its facility.



   (B)   Outside the Village.  If a customer is requesting electric
service that falls outside the village limits, the potential customer must
submit a written request to the Service Representative for review.  The
Service Representative will forward the request on to the Village Council for
review.  It is the Council's soul responsibility to accept or reject any
request.  If a request is approved, the Council will set forth the necessary
line extension costs, security deposits, as well as establish the rate of
service for the new customer.



(Ord. 2002-12-43, passed 1-28-03)



METERING AND BILLING



§ 51.55  QUANTITY OF SERVICE DELIVERED BY METER.



   A meter installed by the Utility, which shall be and remain the
property of the Utility, will measure electricity.  Subject to certain
exceptions, enumerated below, consumption shall be determined on the basis of
the meter registration and bills shall reflect the consumption so registered.



(Ord. 2002-12-43, passed 1-28-03)



§ 51.56  BILLING PERIODS.



   Bills will be rendered by the Utility to the customer on a monthly
basis.  Non-receipt of bills by customer does not release or diminish the
obligation of customer with respect to payment thereof.  Meters are
ordinarily read at monthly intervals, but may be read more or less frequently
at the Utility's option.



(Ord. 2002-12-43, passed 1-28-03)



§ 51.57  ESTIMATED BILL.



   When the meter is not read, the Utility may estimate the quantity of
electricity consumed and render a bill for such quantity.



(Ord. 2002-12-43, passed 1-28-03)



§ 51.58  INCORRECT METER READINGS/BILLING.



   (A)   During any period that an incorrect meter reading is
established, the meter reading and bills based thereon shall be adjusted by
the Utility on the basis of all available information concerning the use of
service by the customer.



   (B)   Whenever the Utility has overcharged any customer as the
result of a meter or metering inaccuracy or other continuing problem under
its control, the Utility will only credit the customer for the
overcompensated amount of electricity rendered in the 365 days immediately
prior to the date the Utility remedies the meter inaccuracy.  The
reimbursement of overcharges shall take the form of a credit to the
customer's account or by direct payment to the customer, at the customer's
direction.



   (C)   Except as provided below, any underpayment as a result of a
meter or metering inaccuracy, or other continuing problem, will be billed to
the customer. The Utility will, at the customer's request, attempt to arrange
a reasonable payment schedule in the event of underpayment. Should the amount
of the adjustment be under bona fide dispute, the Utility shall continue to
supply service and the customer shall continue to pay all amounts billed
until a final determination is made.



   (D)   Whenever the Utility has undercharged any customer as the
result of a meter or metering inaccuracy or other continuing problem under
its control, the Utility may only bill the customer for the amount of the
unmetered electricity rendered in the 365 days immediately prior to the date
the Utility remedies the meter inaccuracy.  The Utility, in the first bill
to collect the amount for unmetered electric service, shall state the entire
amount that it seeks to collect. The maximum portion of the undercharge for
unmetered electricity rendered that may be recovered from the customer in any
billing month shall be determined by dividing the amount of the undercharge
by 12 (or the corresponding number of adjustable months) and the quotient is
the maximum portion of the undercharge that the company may recover from the
customer in any billing month, in addition to either regular monthly charges
of any type or regular level payment amounts billed in accordance with an
agreement between the customer and the Utility. The time period over which
the undercharge may be billed shall be 12 (or the corresponding number of
adjustable months) consecutive months.



   (E)   The Utility shall not recover any interest charge, service
charge, or fee, whether or not a percentage is utilized for its computation,
for the portion of billings due to incorrect meter readings as provided for
under this section.



   (F)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the
customer from paying an undercharge or any portion thereof in a time shorter
than that stated in this section. Nothing in this section shall be construed
to prevent the Utility from collecting an undercharge or any portion thereof
in a time longer than that stated in this section.



   (G)   This section does not apply to any act that is a theft
offense, as defined in this chapter, that involves tampering with utility
equipment or theft of utility service, or where a physical act of a customer
or its agent causes inaccurate or no recording of the meter reading, or
inaccurate or no measurement of the gas or electricity rendered.

§ 51.60  INITIAL AND FINAL METER READINGS.



   (A)   When service is terminated for any reason, the Utility will
render a final bill addressed to the customer's forwarding address, if known,
or to the last known address, for the entire balance of the account,
including a calculation from the last reading date to the requested final
bill date. The customer may request that the Utility attempt to obtain an
actual final meter reading. However, the Utility may estimate the reading for
the final bill date, or allow the customer to provide the final meter read
subject to the Utility's review for reasonableness, and if necessary the
actual reading.



   (B)   When the customer begins use of service, an initial bill is
normally rendered for the period from the initial date of service to the
first regular meter reading date, this period normally being less than 30
days, except no bill will be rendered if the period is less than three
days.  However, the customer's usage for that unbilled period will be
included and billed in the next month's bill.



   (C)   The Utility may estimate the reading for the initial date of
service.  However, upon customer request, the Utility will attempt to obtain
an actual reading at the initial date of service or allow the customer to
provide the initial meter read.

   (A)   In addition to regular payments for electricity used, the
customer shall pay the cost for all material, labor, and other necessary
expense incurred by the Utility in supplying service to the customer at his
request for any temporary purpose or use. The Utility may, at its option,
require that any customer requesting temporary service to deposit with the
Utility a sum equal to the Utility's estimate of the cost to be incurred by
it for the requested, temporary service.



   (B)   After the service has been discontinued and all actual costs
determined, any sum deposited by the customer in excess of the actual cost
shall be refunded to him.  If the Utility elects to leave in place any or
all of the facilities provided, constructed or installed to render such
temporary service, an amount of the customer's deposit shall be returned to
the customer such that the customer shall only be charged for the facilities
not retained.

contamination or pollution by isolating within the consumer's water system
contaminants or pollutants which could backflow through the service
connection into the public potable water system.



      (2)   To promote the elimination or control of existing
cross-connections, actual or potential, between the public or consumer's
potable water system and non-potable water systems, plumbing fixtures and
sources or systems containing process fluids.



      (3)   To provide for the maintenance of a continuing program
of cross-connection control which will systematically and effectively prevent
the contamination or pollution of the public and consumer's potable water
systems.



   (B)   Application.  These rules and regulations shall apply to all
premises served by the public potable water system of the village.



   (C)   Policy.  The village shall be responsible for the protection
of the public potable water system from contamination due to backflow of

making a stop at a stop sign.



      (2)   (a)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
signal indication shall not enter the intersection to make the movement
indicated by the arrow and, unless entering the intersection to make another
movement permitted by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly
marked stop line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk
on the near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then
before entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal
indication or other traffic control device permitting the movement indicated
by such red arrow is displayed.



         (b)   When a traffic control device is in place
permitting a turn on a steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic
facing a steady red arrow indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter
the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a
one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the
direction indicated by the arrow and shall be subject to the provisions that
are applicable after making a stop at a stop sign.



      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal
indication as provided in R.C. § 4511.14 or other traffic control device,

indication shall not enter the roadway.



      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of
Transportation on state highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against
a steady red signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs
giving notice thereof are posted at the intersection.



   (D)   Flashing green signal indication. A flashing green signal
indication has no meaning and shall not be used.



   (E)   Flashing yellow signal indication.



      (1)   (a)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an
intersection, facing a flashing circular yellow signal indication, is
permitted to cautiously enter the intersection to proceed straight through or
turn right or left or make a u-turn movement except as such movement is
modified by lane-use signs, turn prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway
design, separate turn signal indications, or other traffic control devices.
Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a
u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:

immediate hazard during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across
or within the intersection.



      (2)   (a)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an
intersection, facing a flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or other such movement as is permitted by other signal indications
displayed at the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles
turning right or left or making a u-turn, shall yield the right-of-way to
both of the following:



            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated
crosswalk;



            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the

message contained thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other
traffic control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are
currently applicable. Use of this signal indication shall be limited to
supplementing stop, do not enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications
where compliance with the supplemented traffic control device requires a stop
at a designated point.



   (G)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their
nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or
marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.

the lane over which the signal indication is located because a lane control
change is being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.



   (C)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow. A road user is
permitted to use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a
left turn, but not for through travel, with the understanding that common use
of the lane by oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.



   (D)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow. A road user is
permitted to use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a

   Whenever special pedestrian-control signals exhibiting the words
“walk,” or “don't walk,” or the symbol of a walking person or an
upraised palm are in place, these signals shall indicate the following
instructions:



   (A)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes
“walk”, means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted
to start to cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication,
possibly in conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the walking person signal indication is first shown.



   (B)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes
“don't walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the
roadway in the direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian
who has already started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication
shall proceed to the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway,
unless otherwise directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the
median of a divided highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge

a moving violation during the six-month period commencing on the date on
which the person is issued the probationary driver’s license, the court
with jurisdiction over the violation may order that the holder must be
accompanied by the holder’s parent or guardian whenever the holder is

of having committed a second or subsequent moving violation, the court with

operated on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole
purpose of determining whether each occupant of the motor vehicle is wearing
all of the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining
device as required by division (F) of this section, or for the sole purpose
of issuing a ticket, citation or summons if that requirement has been or is

neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor any deputy registrar shall accept
any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any motor

   (B)   Suspension of a commercial driver’s license under this

or injured in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a
demand is properly made, and the operator has the operator’s driver’s
license on or about the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to
display the license. A person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence
that the person is licensed under R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not
have the person’s license on or about the person’s person shall be prima
facie evidence of the person’s not having obtained a driver’s license.

section, whoever violates this section is guilty of an unclassified

§ 2929.28(A)(2)(a), the offender may be fined up to $1,000; and,
notwithstanding § 130.99(F)(1)(c) and R.C. § 2929.27(A)(3), the offender
may be ordered pursuant to § 130.99(F)(3) or R.C. § 2929.27(C) to serve a
term of community service of up to 500 hours. The failure of an offender to
complete a term of community service imposed by the court may be punished as
indirect criminal contempt under R.C. § 2705.02(A) that may be filed in the
underlying case.



         (b)   If, within three years of the offense, the
offender previously was convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more
violations of division (B)(1) of this section, or any combination of two or
more violations of division (B)(1) of this section, R.C. § 4510.11, 4510.111
or 4510.16, or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, and the offender shall provide the court
with proof of financial responsibility as defined in R.C. § 4509.01. If the
offender fails to provide that proof of financial responsibility, then in
addition to any other penalties provided by law, the court may order
restitution pursuant to R.C. § 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding $5,000 for
any economic loss arising from an accident or collision that was the direct
and proximate result of the offender’s operation of the vehicle before,
during, or after committing the offense for which the offender is sentenced
under this section.



(R.C. § 4510.111)



   (C)   Repeat traffic offender; point system suspension. Any person
whose driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident
operating privileges are suspended as a repeat traffic offender under R.C. §
4510.037 and who, during the suspension, operates any motor vehicle upon any
public roads and highways is guilty of driving under a twelve-point
suspension, a misdemeanor of the first degree. The court shall sentence the
offender to a minimum term of three days in jail. No court shall suspend the
first three days of jail time imposed pursuant to this division.



(R.C. § 4510.037(J))



   (D)   It is an affirmative defense to any prosecution brought under
this section that the alleged offender drove under suspension, without a
valid permit or driver's or commercial driver's license, or in violation of a
restriction because of a substantial emergency, and because no other person
was reasonably available to drive in response to the emergency.



(R.C. § 4510.04)



§ 71.18  OPERATING MOTOR VEHICLE OR MOTORCYCLE WITHOUT VALID LICENSE.



   (A)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under R.C.
§§ 4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a
public road or highway or any public or private property used by the public
for purposes of vehicular travel or parking in this municipality unless the
person has a valid driver's license issued under R.C. Chapter 4507 or a
commercial driver's license issued under R.C. Chapter 4506.



      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under R.C.
§§ 4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a
public road or highway or any public or private property used by the public
for purposes of vehicular travel or parking in this municipality unless the
person has a valid license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon
application by the registrar of motor vehicles under R.C. Chapter 4507. The
license shall be in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the
registrar, upon a driver's or commercial driver's license, if the person has
a valid license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in
the form of a restricted license as provided in R.C. § 4507.14, if the
person does not have a valid license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial
motor vehicle.



   (B)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
non-certified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
non-certified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows
the name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with
a violation of division (A)(1) or (A)(2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged
violation of division (A)(1) of this section or a valid license as a
motorcycle operator either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or a restricted license at the time of the
alleged violation of division (A)(2) of this section. The person charged with
a violation of division (A)(1) or (A)(2) of this section may offer evidence
to rebut this prima facie evidence.



   (C)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor
vehicle or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as
follows:



      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has
held a valid driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state
or any other jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a
motorcycle by the offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as
a motorcycle operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license,
except as otherwise provided in this division, the offense is an unclassified
misdemeanor. When the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender
shall be sentenced pursuant to § 130.99 or R.C. §§ 2929.21 to 2929.28,
except that the offender shall not be sentenced to a jail term; the offender
shall not be sentenced to a community residential sanction pursuant to §
130.99(E) or R.C. § 2929.26; notwithstanding § 130.99(G)(1)(b)1. and R.C.
§ 2929.28(A)(2)(a), the offender may be fined up to $1,000; and,

may be ordered pursuant to § 130.99(F)(3) or R.C. § 2929.27(C) to serve a
term of community service of up to 500 hours. The failure of an offender to
complete a term of community service imposed by the court may be punished as
indirect criminal contempt under R.C. § 2705.02(A) that may be filed in the
underlying case. If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to any violation of this section or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.



      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by
the offender, the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license
bearing the motorcycle endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was
expired at the time of the offense, except as otherwise provided in this
division, the offense is a minor misdemeanor. If within three years of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to
two or more violations of this section or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.



   (D)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first
violation of this section or if more than three years have passed since the
offender's last violation of R.C. § 4510.12, this section, or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.



   (E)   If the offender is sentenced under division (B)(2) of this
section, if within three years of the offense the offender previously was
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one or more violations of R.C. § 4510.12,
this section, or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance within the
past three years, and if the offender's license was expired for more than six
months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class seven
suspension of the offender's driver license, commercial driver's license,
temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident operating
privilege from the range specified in R.C. § 4510.02 (A)(7).

days of house arrest with electronic monitoring. A period of house arrest
with electronic monitoring imposed under this division shall not exceed six
months. If the court imposes a mandatory three-day jail term under this
division, the court may impose a jail term in addition to that term, provided

six months;



         (b)   A fine of not less than $250 and not more than

and impoundment shall be issued and enforced in accordance with R.C. §
4503.233.



      (2)   If, within six years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of this

misdemeanor of the first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to all
of the following:



         (a)   A mandatory jail term of 10 consecutive days.
Notwithstanding the jail terms provided in R.C. §§ 2929.21 to 2929.28, the
court may sentence the offender to a longer jail term of not more than one
year. The 10-day mandatory jail term shall be imposed unless, subject to
division (C) of this section, the court instead imposes a sentence of not
less than 90 consecutive days of house arrest with electronic monitoring. The
period of house arrest with electronic monitoring shall not exceed one year;



         (b)   Notwithstanding the fines provided for in R.C.

         (c)   A license suspension under division (E) of this
section;



         (d)   If the vehicle the offender was operating at the

of this section or two or more equivalent offenses, driving under OVI
suspension is a misdemeanor. The court shall sentence the offender to all of
the following:



         (a)   A mandatory jail term of 30 consecutive days.
Notwithstanding the jail terms provided in R.C. §§ 2929.21 to 2929.28, the

         (c)   A license suspension under division (E) of this
section;

shall be issued and enforced in accordance with R.C. § 4503.234. If title to
a motor vehicle that is subject to an order for criminal forfeiture under
this division is assigned or transferred and R.C. § 4503.234(B)(2) or (3)
applies, the court may fine the offender the value of the vehicle as
determined by publications of the national automobile dealers association.
The proceeds from any fine so imposed shall be distributed in accordance with
division R.C. § 4503.234(C)(2).



   (C)   (1)   No court shall impose an alternative sentence of
house arrest with electronic monitoring under division (B)(1) or (2) of this
section unless, within 60 days of the date of sentencing, the court issues a
written finding on the record that, due to the unavailability of space at the
jail where the offender is required to serve the jail term imposed, the
offender will not be able to begin serving that term within the 60-day period
following the date of sentencing.



      (2)   An offender sentenced under this section to a period of
house arrest with electronic monitoring shall be permitted work release

   (E)   In addition to or independent of all other penalties provided
by law or ordinance, the trial judge of any court of record or the mayor of a
mayor's court shall impose on an offender who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to a violation of this section a class seven suspension of the
offender's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in R.C. § 4510.02 (A)(7). 



      (1)   When permitted as specified in R.C. § 4510.021, if the
court grants limited driving privileges during a suspension imposed under
this section, the privileges shall be granted on the additional condition
that the offender must display restricted license plates, issued under R.C.
§ 4503.231, on the vehicle driven subject to the privileges, except as
provided in R.C. § 4503.231(B).



      (2)   A suspension of a commercial driver's license under this

holding a commercial driver's license under R.C. § 4506.16 shall be issued a
driver's license under R.C. Chapter 4507 during the period for which the
commercial driver's license was suspended under this section, and no person

   (F)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in R.C. § 4509.01. If the offender fails to
provide that proof of financial responsibility, then, in addition to any
other penalties provided by law, the court may order restitution pursuant to
§ 130.99(G) or R.C. § 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding $5,000 for any
economic loss arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and
proximate result of the offender’s operation of the vehicle before, during,

pursuant to any provision of the Ohio Revised Code.



(R.C. § 4510.14)



   (H)   It is an affirmative defense to any prosecution brought under
this section that the alleged offender drove under suspension, without a
valid permit or driver's or commercial driver's license, or in violation of a
restriction because of a substantial emergency, and because no other person
was reasonably available to drive in response to the emergency.

a violation of division (A) or (B) of this section may be admitted into

      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously was convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of

      (2)   It is an affirmative defense to any prosecution brought
under this section that the order of suspension resulted from the failure of
the alleged offender to respond to a financial responsibility random
verification request under R.C. § 4509.101(A)(3)(c) and that, at the time of

non-certified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows

section. The person charged with a violation of division (A) of this section
may offer evidence to rebut this prima facie evidence.

§ 72.001  LANES OF TRAVEL UPON ROADWAYS.



   (A)   Upon all roadways of sufficient width, a vehicle shall be
driven upon the right half of the roadway, except as follows:



      (1)   When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding
in the same direction, or when making a left turn under the rules governing
such movements;



      (2)   When an obstruction exists making it necessary to drive
to the left of the center of the highway; provided, any person so doing shall
yield the right-of-way to all vehicles traveling in the proper direction upon
the unobstructed portion of the highway within such distance as to constitute
an immediate hazard;



      (3)   When driving upon a roadway divided into three or more
marked lanes for traffic under the rules applicable thereon;



      (4)   When driving upon a roadway designated and posted with

      (5)   When otherwise directed by a police officer or
traffic-control device.



   (B)   (1)   Upon all roadways any vehicle proceeding at less than
the prevailing and lawful speed of traffic at the time and place and under
the conditions then existing shall be driven in the right-hand lane then
available for traffic, and far enough to the right to allow passing by faster
vehicles if such passing is safe and reasonable, except under any of the
following circumstances:



         (a)   When overtaking and passing another vehicle
proceeding in the same direction;



         (b)   When preparing for a left turn;



         (c)   When the driver must necessarily drive in a lane
other than the right-hand lane to continue on the driver’s intended route.



      (2)   Nothing in division (B)(1) of this section requires a
driver of a slower vehicle to compromise the driver’s safety to allow
overtaking by a faster vehicle.



   (C)   Upon any roadway having four or more lanes for moving traffic
and providing for two-way movement of traffic, no vehicle shall be driven to
the left of the center line of the roadway, except when authorized by
official traffic-control devices designating certain lanes to the left of the
center of the roadway for use by traffic not otherwise permitted to use the
lanes, or except as permitted under division (A)(2) of this section.  This
division shall not be construed as prohibiting the crossing of the center
line in making a left turn into or from an alley, private road, or driveway.



   (D)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, whoever
violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year

of this section, signal to the vehicle to be overtaken, shall pass to the
left thereof at a safe distance, and shall not again drive to the right side
of the roadway until safely clear of the overtaken vehicle.  When a motor
vehicle overtakes and passes a bicycle, three feet or greater is considered a
safe passing distance.



      (2)   Except when overtaking and passing on the right is
permitted, the operator of an overtaken vehicle shall give way to the right
in favor of the overtaking vehicle at the latter’s audible signal, and the
operator shall not increase the speed of the operator’s vehicle until
completely passed by the overtaking vehicle.

   (A)   No vehicle shall be driven to the left of the center of the
roadway in overtaking and passing traffic proceeding in the same direction,

a sufficient distance ahead to permit the overtaking and passing to be
completely made, without interfering with the safe operation of any traffic
approaching from the opposite direction or any traffic overtaken. In every
event, the overtaking vehicle must return to an authorized lane of travel as

   (A)   The Department of Transportation may determine those portions
of any state highway where overtaking and passing other traffic or driving to
the left of the center or center line of the roadway would be especially
hazardous, and may, by appropriate signs or markings on the highway, indicate
the beginning and end of such zones. When signs or markings are in place and
clearly visible, every operator of a vehicle shall obey the directions of the
signs or markings, notwithstanding the distances set out in R.C. § 4511.30.

marked lanes for traffic, or wherever within municipal corporations traffic
is lawfully moving in two or more substantially continuous lines in the same
direction, the following rules apply:



      (1)   A vehicle shall be driven, as nearly as is practicable,

      (2)   Upon a roadway which is divided into three lanes and
provides for the two-way movement of traffic, a vehicle shall not be driven
in the center lane, except when overtaking and passing another vehicle where
the roadway is clearly visible and the center lane is clear of traffic within
a safe distance, or when preparing for a left turn, or where the center lane

      (2)   The driver of any truck, or motor vehicle drawing
another vehicle, when traveling upon a roadway outside a business or
residence district, shall maintain a sufficient space, whenever conditions

   (A)   All state routes are hereby designated as through highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through highways, by the Department of
Transportation as to highways under its jurisdiction, and by local
authorities as to highways under their jurisdiction, except as otherwise
provided in this section.  Where two or more state routes that are through
highways intersect, and no traffic-control signal is in operation, stop signs
or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the
Department or by local authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise
provided in this section.  Whenever the Director of Transportation
determines on the basis of an engineering and traffic investigation that stop
signs are necessary to stop traffic on a through highway for safe and
efficient operation, nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent
such installations.  When circumstances warrant, the Director also may omit
stop signs on roadways intersecting through highways under his
jurisdiction.  Before the Director either installs or removes a stop sign
under this division, he shall give notice, in writing, of that proposed
action to the affected local authority at least 30 days before installing or
removing the stop sign.



   (B)   Other streets or highways, or portions thereof, are hereby

highway or portion thereof, and if they have stop or yield signs or
traffic-control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting
streets or highways.  For purposes of this section, the limits of the street
or highway, or portion thereof, shall be the municipal corporation line, the
physical terminus of the street or highway, or any point on the streets or
highway at which vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to
stop or yield to traffic on the intersecting street, provided, that in
residence districts, the village may by ordinance designate said street or
highway, or portion thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the
affected residence district shall be indicated by official traffic-control
devices. Where two or more through highways designated under this division
intersect and no traffic-control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield
signs shall be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Department or
by local authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in
this section.



   (C)   The Department or local authorities having jurisdiction need
not erect stop signs at intersections they find to be so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through highway without coming to a stop. 
Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator of
a vehicle shall yield the right-of-way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through highway.



   (D)   Local authorities, with reference to highways under their
jurisdiction, may designate additional through highways, and shall erect stop
signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals at all streets and highways
intersecting such through highways, or may designate any intersection as a
stop or yield intersection, and shall erect like signs at one or more
entrances to the intersection.

by the trier of fact in a tort action as evidence of negligence or
contributory negligence. But, the trier of fact may determine based on
evidence admitted consistent with the Ohio Rules of Evidence that the failure
contributed to the harm alleged in the tort action and may diminish a
recovery of compensatory damages that represents non-economic loss, as
defined in R.C. § 2307.011, in a tort action that could have been recovered
but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of the available elements of a
properly adjusted occupant restraining device. Evidence of that failure shall

consistent with the Rules of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not
wearing the available occupant restraining device, was not wearing all of the
available elements of such a device, or was not wearing such a device as
properly adjusted is admissible in evidence in relation to any claim for
relief in a tort action to the extent that the claim for relief satisfies all
of the following:



         (a)   It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to
the occupant;

the applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of division

or a qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist of the person’s own
choosing administer a chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in
addition to any administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If
the person was under arrest as described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the

§ 4511.19(G)(1)(c), (d), or (e), the law enforcement officer shall request
the person to submit, and the person shall submit, to a chemical test or
tests of the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine
for the purpose of determining the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled
substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination content of
the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine. A law
enforcement officer who makes a request pursuant to this division that a
person submit to a chemical test or tests is not required to advise the
person of the consequences of submitting to, or refusing to submit to, the
test or tests and is not required to give the person the form described in
division (C) of this section, but the officer shall advise the person at the
time of the arrest that if the person refuses to take a chemical test the
officer may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary to ensure that the
person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole blood or blood
serum or plasma. The officer shall also advise the person at the time of the
arrest that the person may have an independent chemical test taken at the
person’s own expense. Divisions (A)(3) and (A)(4) of this section apply to
the administration of a chemical test or tests pursuant to this division.



         (b)   If a person refuses to submit to a chemical test
upon a request made pursuant to division (A)(5)(a) of this section, the law
enforcement officer who made the request may employ whatever reasonable means
are necessary to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the
person’s whole blood or blood serum or plasma. A law enforcement officer
who acts pursuant to this division to ensure that a person submits to a
chemical test of the person’s whole blood or blood serum or plasma is
immune from criminal and civil liability based upon a claim for assault and
battery or any other claim for the acts, unless the officer so acted with
malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a wanton or reckless manner.



(R.C. § 4511.191(A))



   (B)   Except as provided in division (A)(5) of this section, the
arresting law enforcement officer shall give advice in accordance with this
section to any person under arrest for a violation of § 73.01(A) or (B), §
73.03, R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal OVI ordinance. The
officer shall give that advice in a written form that contains the
information described in division (C) of this section and shall read the
advice to the person. The form shall contain a statement that the form was
shown to the person under arrest and read to the person by the arresting
officer. One or more persons shall witness the arresting officer’s reading
of the form, and the witnesses shall certify to this fact by signing the
form. The person must submit to the chemical test or tests, subsequent to the
request of the arresting officer, within two hours of the time of the alleged
violation and, if the person does not submit to the test or tests within that
two-hour time limit, the failure to submit automatically constitutes a
refusal to submit to the test or tests.



   (C)   Except as provided in division (A)(5) of this section, if a
person is under arrest as described in division (B) of this section, before
the person may be requested to submit to a chemical test or tests to
determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a
controlled substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood,
blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine, the arresting officer shall read the
following form to the person:



      You now are under arrest for (specifically state the offense
under state law or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which
the person was arrested – operating a vehicle under the influence of
alcohol, a drug, or a combination of them; operating a vehicle while under
the influence of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a
controlled substance; operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption;
or having physical control of a vehicle while under the influence).



      If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your
Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to
pay a fee to have the privileges reinstated. If you have a prior conviction
of OVI, OVUAC, or operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed
controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance under
state or municipal law within the preceding 20 years, you are now under
arrest for state OVI, and, if you refuse to take a chemical test, you will
face increased penalties if you subsequently are convicted of the state OVI.



      (Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely
having physical control of a vehicle while under the influence.) If you take
any chemical test required by law and are found to be at or over the
prohibited amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in your whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or
urine as set by law, your Ohio driving privileges will be suspended
immediately, and you will have to pay a fee to have the privileges reinstated.



      If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical
test taken at your own expense.



   (D)   If the arresting law enforcement officer does not ask a person
under arrest as described in division (B) of this section or division (A)(5)
of this section to submit to a chemical test or tests under R.C. § 4511.191
or this section, the arresting officer shall seize the Ohio or out-of-state
driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit of the person and
immediately forward it to the court in which the arrested person is to appear
on the charge. If the arrested person is not in possession of the person’s
license or permit or it is not in the person’s vehicle, the officer shall
order the person to surrender it to the law enforcement agency that employs
the officer within 24 hours after the arrest, and, upon the surrender, the
agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the court in which
the person is to appear on the charge. Upon receipt of the license or permit,
the court shall retain it pending the arrested person’s initial appearance
and any action taken under R.C. § 4511.196.



   (E)   (1)   If a law enforcement officer asks a person under
arrest as described in division (A)(5) of this section to submit to a
chemical test or tests under that division and the test results indicate a
prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite
of a controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or
plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, or if a law
enforcement officer asks a person under arrest as described in division (B)
of this section to submit to a chemical test or tests under R.C. § 4511.191
or this section, if the officer advises the person in accordance with this
section of the consequences of the person’s refusal or submission, and if
either the person refuses to submit to the test or tests or, unless the
arrest was for a violation of § 73.03, R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submits to the test or tests and
the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense, the arresting officer shall do all of the following:



         (a)   On behalf of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles,
notify the person that, independent of any penalties or sanctions imposed
upon the person, the person’s Ohio driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit or nonresident operating privilege is suspended
immediately, that the suspension will last at least until the person’s
initial appearance on the charge, which will be held within five days after
the date of the person’s arrest or the issuance of a citation to the
person, and that the person may appeal the suspension at the initial
appearance or during the period of time ending 30 days after that initial
appearance;



         (b)   Seize the driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit of the person and immediately forward it to the Registrar.
If the arrested person is not in possession of the person’s license or
permit or it is not in the person’s vehicle, the officer shall order the
person to surrender it to the law enforcement agency that employs the officer
within 24 hours after the person is given notice of the suspension, and, upon
the surrender, the officer’s employing agency immediately shall forward the
license or permit to the Registrar;



         (c)   Verify the person’s current residence and, if it
differs from that on the person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit, notify the Registrar of the change;



         (d)   Send to the Registrar, within 48 hours after the
arrest of the person, a sworn report that includes all of the following
statements:



            1.   That the officer had reasonable grounds to
believe that, at the time of the arrest, the arrested person was operating a
vehicle in violation of R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B) or a municipal OVI
ordinance or for being in physical control of a stationary vehicle in
violation of R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance;



            2.   That the person was arrested and charged with
a violation of R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance;



            3.   Unless division (E)(1)(d)5. of this section
applies, that the officer asked the person to take the designated chemical
test or tests, advised the person in accordance with this section of the
consequences of submitting to, or refusing to take, the test or tests, and
gave the person the form described in division (C) of this section;



            4.   Unless division (E)(1)(d)5. of this section
applies, that either the person refused to submit to the chemical test or
tests or, unless the arrest was for a violation of R.C. § 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submitted to the
chemical test or tests and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense.



            5.   If the person was under arrest as described
in division (A)(5) of this section and the chemical test or tests were
performed in accordance with that division, that the person was under arrest
as described in that division, that the chemical test or tests were performed
in accordance with that division, and that test results indicated a
prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite
of a controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or
plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense.



      (2)   Division (E)(1) of this section does not apply to a
person who is arrested for a violation of § 73.03, R.C. § 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, who is asked by a law
enforcement officer to submit to a chemical test or tests under this section,
and who submits to the test or tests, regardless of the amount of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance that the test
results indicate is present in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or
plasma, breath, or urine.



   (F)   The arresting officer shall give the officer’s sworn report
that is completed under this section to the arrested person at the time of
the arrest, or the Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall send the report to the
person by regular first class mail as soon as possible after receipt of the
report, but not later than 14 days after receipt of it. An arresting officer
may give an unsworn report to the arrested person at the time of the arrest
provided the report is complete when given to the arrested person and
subsequently is sworn to by the arresting officer. As soon as possible, but
not later than 48 hours after the arrest of the person, the arresting officer
shall send a copy of the sworn report to the court in which the arrested
person is to appear on the charge for which the person was arrested.



   (G)   The sworn report of an arresting officer completed under this
section is prima facie proof of the information and statements that it
contains. It shall be admitted and considered as prima facie proof of the
information and statements that it contains in any appeal under R.C. §
4511.197 relative to any suspension of a person’s driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege that results
from the arrest covered by the report.

driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege under this
section for the time described in R.C. § 4511.191(B) or (C) is effective
immediately from the time at which the arresting officer serves the notice of
suspension upon the arrested person. Any subsequent finding that the person
is not guilty of the charge that resulted in the person’s being requested
to take the chemical test or tests under division (A) of this section does
not affect the suspension.



      (2)   If a person arrested for operating a vehicle in
violation of § 73.01(A) or (B), R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), or any other
municipal OVI ordinance, or for being in physical control of a vehicle in
violation of § 73.03 or R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, regardless of whether the person’s driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege is
or is not suspended under R.C. § 4511.191(B) or (C) or R.C. Chapter 4510,
the person’s initial appearance on the charge resulting from the arrest
shall be held within five days of the persons’ arrest or the issuance of
the citation to him or her, subject to any continuance granted by the court
pursuant to R.C. § 4511.197 regarding the issues specified in that section.

   (A)   No  person shall operate a motor vehicle at a  speed
greater  or  less  than is  reasonable  or proper, having due regard to
the traffic, surface, and width of the street or highway and any other
conditions, and no person shall drive any motor vehicle, or streetcar in and
upon any street or highway at a greater speed than will permit him to bring
it to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead.



   (B)   It is prima facie lawful, in the absence of a lower limit
declared or established pursuant to this section by the Director of
Transportation or local authorities, for the operator of a motor vehicle to
operate the same at a speed not exceeding the following:



      (1)   (a)   Twenty miles per hour in school zones during
school recess and while children are going to or leaving school during the
opening or closing hours, and when 20 mph school speed limit signs are

right-of-way line fence has been erected without pedestrian opening, the
speed shall be governed by division (B)(4) of this section and on freeways,
if the right-of-way line fence has been erected without pedestrian opening,
the speed shall be governed by divisions (B)(10) and (B)(11) of this
section.  The end of every school zone may be marked by a sign indicating
the end of the zone.  Nothing in this section or in the Manual and
Specifications for a Uniform System of Traffic-control Devices shall be
construed to require school zones to be indicated by signs equipped with
flashing or other lights, or giving other special notice of the hours in
which the school zone speed limit is in effect.



         (b)   As used in this section, SCHOOL means any school
chartered under R.C. § 3301.16 and any nonchartered school that during the

3301-35-08 of the Ohio Administrative Code, a copy of the school's report for
the parents of the school's pupils certifying that the school meets Ohio
minimum standards for nonchartered, nontax-supported schools and presents
evidence of this filing to the jurisdiction from which it is requesting the
establishment of a school zone. SCHOOL also includes a special elementary

at the location of the school. Upon receipt of such written request, the
County Engineer shall create a school zone at that location by erecting
appropriate signs.

their jurisdiction and that portion of a state highway under the jurisdiction
of the Director of Transportation or a request from a County Engineer in the
case of a school zone for a special elementary school, the Director may
extend the traditional school zone boundaries.  The distances in divisions
(B)(1)(c)1. through (B)(1)(c)3. below shall not exceed 300 feet per approach
per direction, and are bounded by whichever of the following distances or
combination thereof the Director approves as most appropriate:



            1.   The distance encompassed by projecting the
school building lines normal to the fronting highway and extending a distance
of 300 feet on each approach direction;



            2.   The distance encompassed by projecting the
school property lines intersecting the fronting highway and extending a
distance of 300 feet on each approach direction;

invalidate the director's initial action on  August 9, 1976, establishing
all  school zones at the traditional school zone boundaries defined by
projecting school property lines, except when those boundaries are extended
as provided in divisions (B)(1)(a) and (B)(1)(c) of this section.

engineering, traffic, and other information as the Director considers
necessary, designate a school zone on any portion of a state route lying
within the municipality that includes a crosswalk customarily used by
children going to or leaving a school during recess and opening and closing
hours, whenever the distance, as measured in a straight line, from the school
property line nearest the crosswalk to the nearest point of a crosswalk is no
more than 1,320 feet. Such a school zone shall include the distance
encompassed by the crosswalk and extending 300 feet in each appropriate
direction of the state route.

the special elementary school annually sends a report to the superintendent
of the school district in which the special elementary school is located
indicating the total number of students enrolled at the school, but otherwise
the principal or other person in charge does not report any other information
or data to the superintendent.

respect to highways under its jurisdiction, upon application in writing and
for good cause shown, may issue a special permit in writing authorizing the
applicant to operate or move a vehicle or combination of vehicles of a size
or weight of vehicle or load exceeding the maximum specified in R.C. §§
5577.01 through 5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with R.C. §§

reimburse the village for the administrative costs incurred in issuing the
permit, and also to cover the cost of normal and expected damage caused to
the roadway or a street or highway structure as the result of the operation
of the nonconforming vehicle or combination of vehicles. The Director, in

municipality to compensate for or to repair excess damage caused to the
roadway by travel under the permit.



   (F)   Every permit issued under this section shall be carried in the
vehicle or combination of vehicles to which it refers and shall be open to

   (G)   The Director of Transportation may debar an applicant from
applying for a special permit under this section upon a finding based on a
reasonable belief that the applicant has done any of the actions specified in
R.C. § 4513.34(F).

law enforcement officer or authorized agent of the issuing authority.



   (J)   A permit issued by the municipality under this section for the
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles is valid for the purposes
of the vehicle operation in accordance with the conditions and limitations
specified on the permit. Such a permit is voidable by law enforcement only
for operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles in violation of the
weight, dimension, or route provisions of the permit. However, a permit is
not voidable for operation in violation of a route provision of a permit if
the operation is upon the order of a law enforcement officer.

disabilities that limit or impair the ability to walk, also known as

and designated by all political subdivisions and by the state and all
agencies and instrumentalities  thereof at all offices and facilities where
parking is provided, whether owned, rented, or leased, and at all publicly
owned parking garages.  The locations shall be designated through the
posting of an elevated sign, whether permanently affixed or movable,
imprinted with the international symbol of access and shall be reasonably
close to exits, entrances, elevators, and ramps.  All elevated signs posted
in accordance with this division and R.C. § 3781.111(C) shall be mounted on
a fixed or movable post, and the distance from the ground to the bottom edge
of the sign shall measure not less than five feet. If a new sign or a
replacement sign designating a special parking location is posted on or after
October 14, 1999, there also shall be affixed upon the surface of that sign
or affixed next to the designating sign a notice that states the fine
applicable for the offense of parking a motor vehicle in the special
designated parking location if the motor vehicle is not legally entitled to
be parked in that location.



   (F)   (1)   (a)   No person shall stop, stand, or park any
motor vehicle at special parking locations provided under division (E) of
this section, or at special clearly marked parking locations provided in or

designated in accordance with that division, unless one of the following
applies:



            1.   The motor vehicle is being operated by or for
the transport of a person with a disability that limits or impairs the
ability to walk and is displaying a valid removable windshield placard or

         (b)   Any motor vehicle that is parked in a special
marked parking location in violation of division (F)(1)(a)1. or (F)(1)(a)2.
of this section may be towed or otherwise removed from the parking location
by the law enforcement agency of the municipality.  A motor vehicle that is
so towed or removed shall not be released to its owner until the owner
presents proof of ownership of the motor vehicle and pays all towing and
storage fees normally imposed by the municipality for towing and storing
motor vehicles.  If the motor vehicle is a leased vehicle, it shall not be
released to the lessee until the lessee presents proof that that person is
the lessee of the motor vehicle and pays all towing and storage fees normally
imposed by the municipality for towing and storing motor vehicles.



         (c)   If a person is charged with a violation  of
division (F)(1)(a)1. or (F)(1)(a)2. of this section, it is an affirmative
defense to the charge that the person suffered an injury not more than 72
hours prior to the time the person was issued the ticket or citation and
that, because of the injury, the person meets at least one of the criteria
contained in R.C. § 4503.44(A)(1).



      (2)    No person shall stop, stand, or park any motor vehicle
in an area that is commonly known as an access aisle, which area is marked by
diagonal stripes and is located immediately adjacent to a special parking
location provided under division (E) of this section or at a special clearly
marked parking location provided in or on a privately owned parking lot,
parking garage, or other parking area and designated in accordance with that
division.



   (G)   When a motor vehicle is being operated by or for the transport
of a person with a disability that limits or impairs the ability to walk and
is displaying a removable windshield placard or a temporary removable
windshield placard or special license plates, or when a motor vehicle is
being operated by or for the transport of a handicapped person, and is
displaying a parking card or special handicapped license plates, the motor
vehicle is permitted to park for a period of two hours in excess of the legal
parking period permitted by local authorities, except where local ordinances
or police rules provide otherwise or where the vehicle is parked in such a
manner as to be clearly a traffic hazard.



   (H)   No owner of an office, facility, or parking garage where
special parking locations are required to be designated in accordance with
division (E) of this section shall fail to properly mark the special parking
locations in accordance with that division or fail to maintain the markings
of the special locations, including the erection and maintenance of the fixed
or movable signs.



   (I)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require a person
or organization to apply for a removable windshield placard or special
license plates if the parking card or special license plates issued to the
person or organization under prior law have not expired or been surrendered
or revoked.



   (J)   As used in this section:



      (1)   HANDICAPPED PERSON means any person who has lost the use

      (2)   PERSON WITH A DISABILITY THAT LIMITS OR IMPAIRS THE
ABILITY TO WALK has the same meaning as in R.C. § 4503.44.



      (3)   SPECIAL LICENSE PLATES and REMOVABLE WINDSHIELD PLACARD
mean any license plates or removable windshield placard or temporary
removable windshield placard issued under R.C. §§ 4503.41 or 4503.44, and
also mean any substantially similar license plates or removable windshield
placard or temporary removable windshield placard issued by a state,

but the offender or the person neglected to display the placard or license
plates as described in division (F)(1)(a)1. of this section.



            2.   At the time of the violation of division
(F)(1)(a)2. of this section, the offender or the person for whose transport

described in division (F)(1)(a)2. of this section.



         (b)   In no case shall an offender who violates division
(F)(1)(a)1. or (F)(1)(a)2. be sentenced to any term of imprisonment.



         (c)   An arrest or conviction for a violation of
division (F)(1)(a)1. or (F)(1)(a)2. of this section does not constitute a
criminal record and need not be reported by the person so arrested or
convicted in response to any inquiries contained in any application for
employment, license, or other right or privilege, or made in connection with
the person’s appearance as a witness.

who violates division (F)(2) of this section be sentenced to any term of
imprisonment. An arrest or conviction for a violation of division (F)(2) of
this section does not constitute a criminal record and need not be reported
by the person so arrested or convicted in response to any inquiries contained
in any application for employment, license, or other right or privilege, or
made in connection with the person’s appearance as a witness.

written waiver form that complies with division (B)(7) of this section and
that attests that the dog is not a dangerous dog.

jurisdiction over the residence of the owner, keeper, or harborer of a dog
shall conduct any hearing concerning the designation of the dog as a nuisance
dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog.



      (2)   If a person who is authorized to enforce this chapter
has reasonable cause to believe that a dog in the person’s jurisdiction is
a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, the person shall notify the
owner, keeper, or harborer of that dog, by certified mail or in person, of
both of the following:

request a hearing regarding the designation in accordance with this division
(C). The notice shall include instructions for filing a request for a hearing
in the county in which the dog’s owner, keeper, or harborer resides.



      (3)   If the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog disagrees
with the designation of the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious
dog, as applicable, the owner, keeper, or harborer, not later than ten days

regarding the determination. The request for a hearing shall be in writing
and shall be filed with the municipal court or county court that has
territorial jurisdiction over the residence of the dog’s owner, keeper, or
harborer. At the hearing, the person who designated the dog as a nuisance
dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog has the burden of proving, by clear and
convincing evidence, that the dog is a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or
vicious dog. The owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog or the person who
designated the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog may
appeal the court’s final determination as in any other case filed in that
court.

the possession of the owner, keeper, or harborer until the court makes a
final determination under this section or during the pendency of an appeal,
as applicable. Until the court makes a final determination and during the
pendency of any appeal, the dog shall be confined or restrained in accordance
with the provisions of division (B)(4) that apply to dangerous dogs
regardless of whether the dog has been designated as a vicious dog or a
nuisance dog rather than a dangerous dog. The owner, keeper, or harborer of
the dog shall not be required to comply with any other requirements
established in this Code or the Ohio Revised Code that concern a nuisance
dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, as applicable, until the court makes a
final determination and during the pendency of any appeal.



      (5)   If a dog is finally determined under this division (C),
or on appeal as described in this division (C), to be a vicious dog, §

the dog and the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog as if the dog were a
dangerous dog, and § 90.36 applies with respect to the dog as if it were a
dangerous dog, and the court shall issue an order that specifies that those
provisions apply with respect to the dog and the owner, keeper, or harborer
in that manner. As part of the order, the court shall require the owner,
keeper, or harborer to obtain the liability insurance required under division
(B)(5)(a) in an amount described in division (D)(4)(b) of this section.



      (6)   As used in this division (C), NUISANCE DOG, DANGEROUS

village pursuant to § 114.04(A), or request for information pursuant to §
114.04(B) requires the production of proprietary information, the cable
operator shall produce the information.  However, at the time the allegedly
proprietary information is submitted, a cable operator may request that
specific, identified portions of its response be treated as confidential and
withheld from public disclosure.  The request must state the reason why the
information should be treated as proprietary and the facts that support those
reasons.  The request for confidentiality will be granted if the village
determines that the preponderance of the evidence shows that nondisclosure is
consistent with the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 USC S
552.  The village shall place in a public file for inspection and decision
that results in information being withheld.  If the cable operator requests
confidentiality and the request is denied, where the cable operator is
proposing a rate increase, it may withdraw the proposal, in which case the
allegedly proprietary information will be returned to it; or the cable
operator may seek review within five working days of the denial in any
appropriate forum.  Release of the information will be stayed pending review.



   (B)   Any interested party may file a request to inspect material
withheld as proprietary with the village.  The village shall weigh the
policy consideration favoring nondisclosure against the reasons cited for
permitting inspection in light of the facts of the particular case.  It will
then promptly notify the requesting entity and the cable operator that
submitted the information as to the disposition of the request.  It may
grant, deny or condition a request.  The requesting party or the cable
operator may seek review of the decision by filing an appeal with any
appropriate forum.  Disclosure will be stayed pending resolution of any
appeal.



   (C)   The procedures set forth in this section shall be construed as
analogous to and consistent with the rules of the FCC regarding requests for
confidentiality including, without limitation, 47 CFR § 0.459.

2913.49 shall be commenced within five years after discovery of the offense
either by an aggrieved person or the aggrieved person’s legal
representative who is not a party to the offense.



   (C)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in division
(A)(1) or (A)(3) of this section has expired, prosecution shall be commenced
for the following offenses during the following specified periods of time:



         (a)   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a
public servant at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or
within two years thereafter;



         (b)   For an offense by a person who is not a public
servant but whose offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of
a public servant, at any time while that public servant remains a public
servant, or within two years thereafter.



      (2)   As used in this division:



         (a)   The phrase OFFENSE IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE
MISCONDUCT IN OFFICE OF A PUBLIC SERVANT includes, but is not limited to, a
violation of R.C. § 101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, 102.03(F) or (H),
2921.02(A), 2921.43(A) or (B), or 3517.13(F) or (G), that is directly related
to an offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant, or a
violation of any municipal ordinance substantially equivalent to those Ohio
Revised Code sections listed in this division (C)(2)(a).



         (b)   PUBLIC SERVANT has the same meaning as in R.C. §
2921.01.



   (D)   (1)   If a DNA record made in connection with the criminal
investigation of the commission of a violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03
is determined to match another DNA record that is of an identifiable person
and if the time of the determination is later than 25 years after the offense
is committed, prosecution of that person for a violation of the section may
be commenced within five years after the determination is complete.



      (2)   If a DNA record made in connection with the criminal
investigation of the commission of a violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03
is determined to match another DNA record that is of an identifiable person
and if the time of the determination is within 25 years after the offense is
committed, prosecution of that person for a violation of the section may be
commenced within the longer of 25 years after the offense is committed or
five years after the determination is complete.



      (3)   As used in this division, DNA RECORD has the same
meaning as in R.C. § 109.573.



   (E)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense
occurs. In the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course
of conduct, the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course
of conduct or the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever
occurs first.



   (F)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is
returned or an information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a
warrant is made, or on the date a warrant, summons, citation, or other
process is issued, whichever occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by
the return of an indictment or the filing of an information unless reasonable
diligence is exercised to issue and execute process on the same. A
prosecution is not commenced upon issuance of a warrant, summons, citation,
or other process unless reasonable diligence is exercised to execute the same.



   (G)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when
the corpus delicti remains undiscovered.



   (H)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when
the accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused departed
this municipality or conceals the accused's identity or whereabouts is prima
facie evidence of the accused's purpose to avoid prosecution.



   (I)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a
prosecution against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this
state, even though the indictment, information, or process that commenced the
prosecution is quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information, or
process are set aside or reversed on appeal.



   (J)   The period of limitation for a violation of this Title or
Title XXIX of the Ohio Revised Code that involves a physical or mental wound,
injury, disability, or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse
or neglect of a child under 18 years of age or of a child with a
developmental disability or physical impairment under 21 years of age shall
not begin to run until either of the following occurs:



      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.



      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or
county peace officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the
county in which the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is
occurring or has occurred has been notified that abuse or neglect is known,
suspected, or believed to have occurred.



   (K)   As used in this section, PEACE OFFICER has the same meaning as
in R.C. § 2935.01.



   (L)   The amendments to divisions (A) and (D) of this section apply
to a violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03 committed on and after July 16,
2015, and apply to a violation of either of those sections committed prior to
July 16, 2015, if prosecution for that violation was not barred under this
section as it existed on July 15, 2015.



(R.C. § 2901.13)



§ 130.07  REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY; VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.



   (A)   Except as provided in division (B) of this section, a person
is not guilty of an offense unless both of the following apply:



      (1)   The person's liability is based on conduct that includes
either a voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the
person is capable of performing;



      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for
each element as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language
defining the offense.



   (B)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any
degree of culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
criminal liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability
is not required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one
division of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability
for an offense defined in that division does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
divisions of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.



   (C)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that
is related to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be
applied neither specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to
impose strict liability, the element of the offense is established only if a
person acts recklessly.



      (2)   Division (C)(1) of this section does not apply to
offenses defined in R.C. Title XLV.



      (3)   Division (C)(1) of this section does not relieve the
prosecution of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by
any definition incorporated into the offense.



   (D)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense.  Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act
if failure to act constitutes a criminal offense.  Evidence that a person
was voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the
person was physically capable of performing the act with which the person is
charged.



   (E)   As used in this section:



      CULPABILITY. Purpose, knowledge, recklessness, or negligence, as
defined in § 130.08.



      INTOXICATION.  Includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.



      INVOLUNTARY ACTS. Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during
unconsciousness or sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product
of the actor's volition are involuntary acts.



      POSSESSION.  A voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of
the thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.



(R.C. § 2901.21)



§ 130.08  CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.



   (A)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific
intention to cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a
prohibition against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the
offender intends to accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific
intention to engage in conduct of that nature.



   (B)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the
person is aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain
result or will probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of
circumstances when the person is aware that such circumstances probably
exist. When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of
an offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes
that there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry
or acts with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.



   (C)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to
the consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk
that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a
substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to
exist.



   (D)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the
person’s conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain
nature.  A person is negligent with respect to circumstances when, because
of a substantial lapse from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a
risk that the circumstances may exist.



   (E)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence
suffices to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge, or
purpose is also sufficient culpability for the element.  When recklessness
suffices to establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose
issue also sufficient culpability for the element.  When knowledge suffices
to establish an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient
culpability for the element.



(R.C. § 2901.22)



§ 130.09  ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.



   (A)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of
the following circumstances:



      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an
officer, agent, or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and
within the scope of the officer's, agent's, or employee's office or
employment, except that if the section defining the offense designates the
officers, agents, or employees for whose conduct the organization is
accountable or the circumstances under which it is accountable, such
provisions shall apply.



      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly
appears in the section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by
an officer, agent, or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and
within the scope of the officer's, agent's, or employee's office or
employment, except that if the section defining the offense designates the
officers, agents, or employees for whose conduct the organization is
accountable or the circumstances under which it is accountable, those
provisions shall apply.



      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a
specific duty imposed by law on the organization.



      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise
required for the commission of the offense, its commission was authorized,
requested, commanded, tolerated, or performed by the board of directors,
trustees, partners, or by a high managerial officer, agent, or employee
acting in behalf of the organization and within the scope of such a board's
or person's office or employment.



   (B)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an
offense, a purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed,
unless the contrary plainly appears.



   (C)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than
one for which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high
managerial officer, agent, or employee having supervisory responsibility over
the subject matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its
commission.  This defense is not available if it plainly appears
inconsistent with the purpose of the section defining the offense.



   (D)   As used in this section, ORGANIZATION means a corporation for
profit or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust, or other commercial or
legal entity.  ORGANIZATION does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.



(R.C. § 2901.23)



§ 130.10  PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.



   (A)   An officer, agent, or employee of an organization as defined
in § 130.09 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization,
if he acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the
offense, and any of the following apply:



      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he
engages in conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in
such conduct, or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has
direct responsibility;



      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty
imposed on the organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.



   (B)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this
section, he is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own
behalf.



(R.C. § 2901.24)



§ 130.11  ATTEMPT.



   (A)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or
knowledge is sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall
engage in conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the
offense.



   (B)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in
retrospect, commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was
either factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if
that offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been
as the actor believed them to be.



   (C)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense,
of complicity in the commission of an offense, or of conspiracy to commit an
offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to commit the same offense in
violation of this section.



   (D)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section
that the actor abandoned the actor's effort to commit the offense or
otherwise prevented its commission, under circumstances manifesting a
complete and voluntary renunciation of the actor's criminal purpose.



   (E)   (1)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt
to commit an offense.  An attempt to commit aggravated murder, murder, or an
offense for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for life is a felony of
the first degree.  An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the
penalty is determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled
substance involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree
as the drug abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had
been committed and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the
controlled substance that is within the next lower range of controlled
substance amounts than was involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any
other offense is an offense of the next lesser degree than the offense
attempted. In the case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a
violation of R.C. Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an
attempt is a misdemeanor of the first degree if the offense attempted is a
felony, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor.  In the case of an attempt to commit a violation of any
provision of R.C. Chapter 3734, other than R.C. § 3734.18, that relates to
hazardous wastes, an attempt is a felony punishable by a fine of not more
than $25,000 or imprisonment for not more than 18 months, or both.  An
attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor, or to engage in conspiracy, is not an
offense under this section.



      (2)   In addition to any other sanctions imposed pursuant to
division (E)(1) of this section for an attempt to commit aggravated murder or
murder in violation of division (A) of this section, if the offender used a
motor vehicle as the means to attempt to commit the offense, the court shall
impose upon the offender a class two suspension of the offender’s
driver’s license, commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction
permit, probationary license, or nonresident operating privilege as specified
in R.C. § 4510.02(A)(2).



      (3)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to
attempted rape and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a specification
of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1418, 2941.1419, or 2941.1420, the
offender shall be sentenced to a prison term or term of life imprisonment
pursuant to R.C. § 2971.03.



   (F)   As used in this section:



      DRUG ABUSE OFFENSE has the same meaning as in R.C. § 2925.01.



      MOTOR VEHICLE has the same meaning as in R.C. § 4501.01.



(R.C. § 2923.02)



§ 130.12  COMPLICITY.



   (A)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for
the commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:



      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;



      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;



      (3)   Conspire with another to commit the offense in violation
of R.C. § 2923.01;



      (4)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the
offense.



   (B)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person
with whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal
offender.



   (C)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section
unless an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of
complicity in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of § 130.11.



   (D)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against
the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in
the commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense, or an offense, the court shall charge the jury in accordance with
R.C. § 2923.03(D).



   (E)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section
that, prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.



   (F)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were
a principal offender.  A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.



(R.C. § 2923.03)



§ 130.99  PENALTY FOR TITLE XIII.



   (A)   Except where otherwise specifically classified within the body
of the section of a chapter of this title, a violation of such section shall
be deemed a misdemeanor punishable upon conviction by a fine of not more than
$500, or imprisonment of not more than six months, or both.



(R.C. § 715.67)



   (B)   Considerations in misdemeanor sentencing.



      (1)   A court that sentences an offender for a misdemeanor or
minor misdemeanor violation of any provision of the Ohio Revised Code, or of
any municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent to a misdemeanor or
minor misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, shall be
guided by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing. The overriding
purposes of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect the public from future
crime by the offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those
purposes, the sentencing court shall consider the impact of the offense upon
the victim and the need for changing the offender’s behavior,
rehabilitating the defender, and making restitution to the victim of the
offense, the public, or the victim and the public.



      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of
a municipal ordinance that is subject to division (B)(1) of this section
shall be reasonably calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of
misdemeanor sentencing set forth in division (B)(1) of this section,
commensurate with and not demeaning to the seriousness of the offender’s
conduct and its impact upon the victim, and consistent with sentences imposed
for similar offenses committed by similar offenders.



      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision
or for a violation of a municipal ordinance that is subject to division
(B)(1) of this section shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic
background, gender, or religion of the offender.



      (4)   Divisions (B)(1) and (B)(2) of this section shall not
apply to any offense that is disposed of by a traffic violations bureau of
any court pursuant to Traffic Rule 13 and shall not apply to any violation of
any provision of the Ohio Revised Code that is a minor misdemeanor and that
is disposed of without a court appearance. Divisions (B)(1) to (B)(3) of this
section do not affect any penalties established by the municipality for a
violation of its ordinances that are not substantially equivalent to a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised
Code.



(R.C. § 2929.21)



   (C)   Misdemeanor jail terms.



      (1)   Except as provided in § 133.99 of this Code or R.C.
§§ 2929.22 or 2929.23  or division (C)(5) or (C)(6) of this section and
unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
elects or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this
chapter, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of the
following:



         (a)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more
than 180 days;



         (b)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more
than 90 days;



         (c)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more
than 60 days;



         (d)   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more
than 30 days.



      (2)   (a)   A court that sentences an offender to a jail
term under division (C) of this section may permit the offender to serve the
sentence in intermittent confinement or may authorize a limited release of
the offender as provided in division (E)(2) of this section.  The court
retains jurisdiction over every offender sentenced to jail to modify the jail
sentence imposed at any time, but the court shall not reduce any mandatory
jail term.



         (b)   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in R.C. §
2935.01, has filed a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be
notified about a particular case and if the court is considering modifying
the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the court shall notify the
prosecutor that the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of the
offender in that case. The prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the
court’s consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in
that case, and, if the prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify
the eligible offender of the hearing.



            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing
regarding the court’s consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the
offender in that case, the court shall hold the hearing before considering
whether or not to release the offender from the offender’s jail sentence.



      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under
division (C) of this section and the court assigns the offender to a county
jail that has established a county jail industry program pursuant to R.C. §
5147.30, the court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the
offender may be considered for participation in the program. During the
offender’s term in the county jail, the court retains jurisdiction to
modify its specification regarding the offender’s participation in the
county jail industry program.



      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to
division (C) of this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence
pursuant to R.C. § 2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local
detention facility in which the term is to be served is covered by a policy
adopted pursuant to R.C. §§ 307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02,
753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and R.C. § 2929.37, both of the
following apply:



         (a)   The court shall specify both of the following as
part of the sentence:



            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized
bill pursuant to R.C. § 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the
person is required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.



            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill
described in division (C)(4)(a)1. of this section and does not pay the bill
by the times specified in R.C. § 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a
certificate of judgment against the person as described in that section.



         (b)   The sentence automatically includes any
certificate of judgment issued as described in division (C)(4)(a)2. of this
section.



      (5)   If an offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
violation of R.C. § 4511.19(B), or any substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, also is convicted of or also pleads guilty to a specification of
the type described in R.C. § 2941.1414 and if the court imposes a jail term
on the offender for the underlying offense, the court shall impose upon the
offender an additional definite jail term of not more than six months. The
additional jail term shall not be reduced pursuant to any provision of the
Revised Code. The offender shall serve the additional jail term consecutively
to and prior to the jail term imposed for the underlying offense and
consecutively to any other mandatory term imposed in relation to the offense.



      (6)   (a)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty
to a misdemeanor violation of R.C. § 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25,
or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification
of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail
term on the offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon
the offender an additional definite jail term as follows:



            1.   Subject to division (C)(6)(a)2. of this
section, an additional definite jail term of not more than 60 days;



            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted
of or pleaded guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of R.C.
§ 2907.22, 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty
to a specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1421 regarding one
or more of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more
than 120 days.



         (b)   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail
term under division (C)(6)(a) of this section, the court may directly impose
on the offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time
processing, continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period
of time specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court
shall equal the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have
imposed upon the offender under division (C)(6)(a) of this section. A
sanction imposed under this division shall commence on the date specified by
the court, provided that the sanction shall not commence until after the
offender has served the jail term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of
R.C. § 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and any residential sanction imposed for the
violation under division (E) of this section or R.C. § 2929.26. A sanction
imposed under this division shall be considered to be a community control
sanction for purposes of division (D) or this section or R.C. § 2929.25, and
all provisions of this Code and the Ohio Revised Code that pertain to
community control sanctions shall apply to a sanction imposed under this
division, except to the extent that they would by their nature be clearly
inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs associated with a sanction
imposed under this division, including the cost of the use of the monitoring
device.



      (7)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of R.C. § 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads
guilty to a specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1423 that
charges that the victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew
was pregnant at the time of the violation, the court shall impose on the
offender a mandatory jail term that is a definite term of at least 30 days.



      (8)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under
this division (C), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the
offender and the jail term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s
own motion, the court, in the court’s sole discretion and as the
circumstances warrant, may substitute one or more community control sanctions
under division (E) or (F) of this section for any jail days that are not
mandatory jail days.



(R.C. § 2929.24)



   (D)   Misdemeanor community control sanctions.



      (1)   (a)   Except as provided in § 133.99 of this Code or
R.C. §§ 2929.22 and 2929.23 or when a jail term is required by law, in
sentencing an offender for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, the
sentencing court may do either of the following:



            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of
one or more community control sanctions authorized by divisions (E), (F), or
(G) of this section. The court may impose any other conditions of release
under a community control sanction that the court considers appropriate. If
the court imposes a jail term upon the offender, the court may impose any
community control sanction or combination of community control sanctions in
addition to the jail term.



            2.   Impose a jail term under division (C) of this
section from the range of jail terms authorized under that division for the
offense, suspend all or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the
offender under a community control sanction or combination of community
control sanctions authorized under divisions (E), (F), or (G) of this section.



         (b)   The duration of all community control sanctions
imposed upon an offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not
exceed five years.



         (c)   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a
community control sanction or combination of community control sanctions
pursuant to division (D)(1)(a)1. of this section, the court shall state the
duration of the community control sanctions imposed and shall notify the
offender that if any of the conditions of the community control sanctions are
violated the court may do any of the following:



            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community
control sanction if the total time under all of the offender’s community
control sanctions does not exceed the five-year limit specified in division
(D)(1)(b) of this section;



            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control
sanction under division (E), (F), or (G) of this section, but the court is
not required to impose any particular sanction or sanctions;



            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of
jail terms authorized for the offense under division (C) of this section.



      (2)   If a court sentences an offender to any community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to
division (D)(1)(a)1. of this section, the sentencing court retains
jurisdiction over the offender and the period of community control for the
duration of the period of community control. Upon the motion of either party
or on the court’s own motion, the court, in the court’s sole discretion
and as the circumstances warrant, may modify the community control sanctions
or conditions of release previously imposed, substitute a community control
sanction or condition of release for another community control sanction or
condition of release previously imposed, or impose an additional community
control sanction or condition of release.



      (3)   (a)   If a court sentences an offender to any
community control sanction or combination of community control sanctions
authorized under division (E), (F), or (G) of this section, the court shall
place the offender under the general control and supervision of the court or
of a department of probation in the jurisdiction that serves the court for
purposes of reporting to the court a violation of any of the conditions of
the sanctions imposed. If the offender resides in another jurisdiction and a
department of probation has been established to serve the municipal court or
county court in that jurisdiction, the sentencing court may request the
municipal court or the county court to receive the offender into the general
control and supervision of that department of probation for purposes of
reporting to the sentencing court a violation of any of the conditions of the
sanctions imposed. The sentencing court retains jurisdiction over any
offender whom it sentences for the duration of the sanction or sanctions
imposed.



         (b)   The sentencing court shall require as a condition
of any community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not
leave the state without the permission of the court or the offender’s
probation officer. In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the
offender, and ensuring the offender’s good behavior, the court may impose
additional requirements on the offender.  The offender’s compliance with
the additional requirements also shall be a condition of the community
control sanction imposed upon the offender.



      (4)   (a)   If the court imposing sentence upon an offender
sentences the offender to any community control sanction or combination of
community control sanctions authorized under division (E), (F), or (G) of
this section, and the offender violates any of the conditions of the
sanctions, the public or private person or entity that supervises or
administers the program or activity that comprises the sanction shall report
the violation directly to the sentencing court or to the department of
probation or probation officer with general control and supervision over the
offender. If the public or private person or entity reports the violation to
the department of probation or probation officer, the department or officer
shall report the violation to the sentencing court.



         (b)   If an offender violates any condition of a
community control sanction, the sentencing court may impose upon the violator
one or more of the following penalties:



            1.   A longer time under the same community
control sanction if the total time under all of the community control
sanctions imposed on the violator does not exceed the five-year limit
specified in division (D)(1)(b) of this section;



            2.   A more restrictive community control sanction;



            3.   A combination of community control sanctions,
including a jail term.



         (c)   If an offender was acting pursuant to R.C. §
2925.11(B)(2)(b), or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and in
so doing violated the conditions of a community control sanction based on a
minor drug possession offense, as defined in R.C. § 2925.11, the sentencing
court may consider the offender’s conduct in seeking or obtaining medical
assistance for another in good faith or for self or may consider the offender
being the subject of another person seeking or obtaining medical assistance
in accordance with that division as a mitigating factor before imposing any
of the penalties described in division (D)(4)(b) of this section.



         (d)   If the court imposes a jail term upon a violator
pursuant to division (D)(4)(b) of this section, the total time spent in jail
for the misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community
control sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the
offense for which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may
reduce the longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under
the longer sanction or the more restrictive sanction imposed under division
(D)(4)(b) of this section by all or part of the time the violator
successfully spent under the sanction that was initially imposed.



      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an
offender, for a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a
community control sanction imposed pursuant to division (E), (F), or (G) of
this section in an exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time
under the community control sanction or impose a less restrictive community
control sanction. Fulfilling the conditions of a community control sanction
does not relieve the offender of a duty to make restitution under division
(G) of this section.



(R.C. § 2929.25)



   (E)   Community residential sanction.



      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law,
the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor
misdemeanor, may impose upon the offender any community residential sanction
or combination of community residential sanctions under this division (E). 
Community residential sanctions include, but are not limited to, the
following:



         (a)   A term of up to 180 days in a halfway house or a
term in a halfway house not to exceed the longest jail term available for the
offense, whichever is shorter, if the political subdivision that would have
responsibility for paying the costs of confining the offender in a jail has
entered into a contract with the halfway house for use of the facility for
misdemeanor offenders;



         (b)   If the offender is an eligible offender, as
defined in R.C. § 307.932, a term in a community alternative sentencing
center or district community alternative sentencing center established and
operated in accordance with that section, in the circumstances specified in
that section, with one of the conditions of the sanction being that the
offender successfully complete the portion of the sentence to be served in
the center.



      (2)   A sentence to a community residential sanction under
division (E)(1)(b) of this section shall be in accordance with R.C. §
307.932. In all other cases, the court that sentences an offender to a
community residential sanction under this division (E) may do either or both
of the following:



         (a)   Permit the offender to serve the offender’s
sentence in intermittent confinement, overnight, on weekends or at any other
time or times that will allow the offender to continue at the offender’s
occupation or care for the offender’s family;



         (b)   Authorize the offender to be released so that the
offender may seek or maintain employment, receive education or training,
receive treatment, perform community service, or otherwise fulfill an
obligation imposed by law or by the court. A release pursuant to this
division shall be only for the duration of time that is needed to fulfill the
purpose of the release and for travel that reasonably is necessary to fulfill
the purposes of release.



      (3)   The court may order that a reasonable portion of the
income earned by the offender upon a release pursuant to division (E)(2) of
this section be applied to any financial sanction imposed under division (G)
of this section.



      (4)   No court shall sentence any person to a prison term for
a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor or to a jail term for a minor misdemeanor.



      (5)   If a court sentences a person who has been convicted of
or pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor to a community residential sanction as
described in division (E)(1) of this section, at the time of reception and at
other times the person in charge of the operation of the halfway house,
community alternative sentencing center, district community alternative
sentencing center, or other place at which the offender will serve the
residential sanction determines to be appropriate, the person in charge of
the operation of the halfway house, community alternative sentencing center,
district community alternative sentencing center, or other place may cause
the convicted offender to be examined and tested for tuberculosis, HIV
infection, hepatitis, including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C,
and other contagious diseases. The person in charge of the operation of the
halfway house, community alternative sentencing center, district community
alternative sentencing center, or other place at which the offender will
serve the residential sanction may cause a convicted offender in the halfway
house, community alternative sentencing center, district community
alternative sentencing center, or other place who refuses to be tested or
treated for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis, including, but not
limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C, or another contagious disease to be tested
and treated involuntarily.



      (6)   The municipality may enter into a contract with a
halfway house for use of the halfway house to house misdemeanor offenders
under a sanction imposed under division (E)(1)(a) of this section.



(R.C. § 2929.26)



   (F)   Nonresidential sanction where jail term is not mandatory.



      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law,
the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor
misdemeanor, may impose upon the offender any nonresidential sanction or
combination of nonresidential sanctions authorized under this division. 
Nonresidential sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:



         (a)   A term of day reporting;



         (b)   A term of house arrest with electronic monitoring
or continuous alcohol monitoring or both electronic monitoring and continuous
alcohol monitoring, a term of electronic monitoring or continuous alcohol
monitoring without house arrest, or a term of house arrest without electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring;



         (c)   A term of community service of up to  500 hours
for misdemeanor of the first degree or 200 hours for a misdemeanor of the
second, third, or fourth degree;



         (d)   A term in a drug treatment program with a level of
security for the offender as determined necessary by the court;



         (e)   A term of intensive probation supervision;



         (f)   A term of basic probation supervision;



         (g)   A term of monitored time;



         (h)   A term of drug and alcohol use monitoring,
including random drug testing;



         (i)   A curfew term;



         (j)   A requirement that the offender obtain employment;



         (k)   A requirement that the offender obtain education
or training;



         (l)   Provided the court obtains the prior approval of
the victim, a requirement that the offender participate in victim-offender
mediation;



         (m)   If authorized by law, suspension of the
offender’s privilege to operate a motor vehicle, immobilization or
forfeiture of the offender’s motor vehicle, a requirement that the offender
obtain a valid motor vehicle operator’s license, or any other related
sanction;



         (n)   A requirement that the offender obtain counseling
if the offense is a violation of R.C. § 2919.25 or a substantially similar
municipal ordinance or a violation of R.C. § 2903.13 or a substantially
similar municipal ordinance involving a person who was a family or household
member at the time of the violation, if the offender committed the offense in
the vicinity of one or more children who are not victims of the offense, and
if the offender or the victim of the offense is a parent, guardian,
custodian, or person in loco parentis of one or more of those children. This
division does not limit the court in requiring that the offender obtain
counseling for any offense or in any circumstance not specified in this
division.



      (2)   If the court imposes a term of community service
pursuant to division (F)(1)(c) of this section, the offender may request that
the court modify the sentence to authorize the offender to make a reasonable
contribution, as determined by the court, to the general fund of the county,
municipality, or other local entity that provides funding to the court. The
court may grant the request if the offender demonstrates a change in
circumstances from the date the court imposes the sentence or that the
modification would otherwise be in the interests of justice. If the court
grants the request, the offender shall make a reasonable contribution to the
court, and the clerk of the court shall deposit that contribution into the
general fund of the county, municipality, or other local entity that provides
funding to the court. If more than one entity provides funding to the court,
the clerk shall deposit a percentage of the reasonable contribution equal to
the percentage of funding the entity provides to the court in that entity’s
general fund.



      (3)   In addition to the sanctions authorized under division
(F)(1) of this section, the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor,
other than a minor misdemeanor, upon an offender who is not required to serve
a mandatory jail term may impose any other sanction that is intended to
discourage the offender or other persons from committing a similar offense if
the sanction is reasonably related to the overriding purposes and principles
of misdemeanor sentencing.



      (4)   The court imposing a sentence for a minor misdemeanor
may impose a term of community service in lieu of all or part of a fine. The
term of community service imposed for a minor misdemeanor shall not exceed 30
hours.  After imposing a term of community service, the court may modify the
sentence to authorize a reasonable contribution, as determined by the court,
to the appropriate general fund as provided in division (F)(2) of this
section.



(R.C. § 2929.27)



   (G)   Financial sanctions.



      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to R.C. §
2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor,
including a minor misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial
sanction or combination of financial sanctions authorized under this division
(G). If the court in its discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions,
the financial sanctions that may be imposed pursuant to this section include,
but are not limited to, the following:



         (a)   Restitution.



            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor
misdemeanor or could be disposed of by the Traffic Violations Bureau serving
the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of
the offender’s crime or any survivor of the victim, in an amount based upon
the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose restitution as a
sanction pursuant to this division if the offense is a minor misdemeanor or
could be disposed of by the Traffic Violations Bureau serving the court under
Traffic Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order
that the restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult
probation department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court
on behalf of the victim.



            2.   If the court imposes restitution, the court
shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by the offender. If the
court imposes restitution, the court may base the amount of restitution it
orders on an amount recommended by the victim, the offender, a presentence
investigation report, estimates or receipts indicating the cost of repairing
or replacing property, and other information, provided that the amount the
court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of economic loss
suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the commission of
the offense. If the court decides to impose restitution, the court shall hold
an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim, or survivor
disputes the amount of restitution. If the court holds an evidentiary
hearing, at the hearing the victim or survivor has the burden to prove by a
preponderance of the evidence the amount of restitution sought from the
offender.



            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited
against any recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim
or any survivor of the victim against the offender.  No person may introduce
evidence of an award of restitution under this section in a civil action for
purposes of imposing liability against an insurer under R.C. § 3937.18.



            4.   If the court imposes restitution, the court
may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not more than 5% of the
amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for
collecting and processing restitution payments.



            5.   The victim or survivor of the victim may
request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion, or the offender may
file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any restitution
ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment terms as
it determines appropriate.



         (b)   Fines. A fine of the type described in divisions
(G)(1)(b)1. and 2. of this section payable to the appropriate entity as
required by law:



            1.   A fine in the following amount:



               A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree,
not more than $1,000;



               B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree,
not more than $750;



               C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree,
not more than $500;



               D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree,
not more than $250;



               E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than
$150.



            2.   A state fine or cost as defined in R.C. §
2949.111.



         (c)   Reimbursement.



            1.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all
of the costs of sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not
limited to, the following:



               A.   All or part of the costs of
implementing any community control sanction, including a supervision fee
under R.C. § 2951.021;



               B.   All or part of the costs of confinement
in a jail or other residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per
diem fee for room and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and
the costs of repairing property damaged by the offender while confined;



               C.   All or part of the cost of purchasing
and using an immobilizing or disabling device, including a certified ignition
interlock device, or a remote alcohol monitoring device that a court orders
an offender to use under R.C. § 4510.13.



            2.   The amount of reimbursement under division
(G)(1)(c)1. of this section shall not exceed the total amount of
reimbursement the offender is able to pay and shall not exceed the actual
cost of the sanctions. The court may collect any amount of reimbursement the
offender is required to pay under that division. If the court does not order
reimbursement under that division, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant
to a repayment policy adopted under R.C. § 2929.37. In addition, the
offender may be required to pay the fees specified in R.C. § 2929.38 in
accordance with that section.



      (2)   (a)   If the court determines a hearing is necessary,
the court may hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay
the financial sanction imposed pursuant to this division (G) or court costs
or is likely in the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.



         (b)   If the court determines that the offender is
indigent and unable to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court
shall consider imposing and may impose a term of community service under
division (F)(1) of this section in lieu of imposing a financial sanction or
court costs. If the court does not determine that the offender is indigent,
the court may impose a term of community service under division (F)(1) of
this section in lieu of or in addition to imposing a financial sanction under
this division (G) and in addition to imposing court costs. The court may
order community service for a minor misdemeanor pursuant to division (F)(4)
of this section in lieu of or in addition to imposing a financial sanction
under this section and in addition to imposing court costs. If a person fails
to pay a financial sanction or court costs, the court may order community
service in lieu of the financial sanction or court costs.



      (3)   (a)   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed
upon the offender pursuant to division (G)(1)(c) of this section to pay the
costs incurred by a county pursuant to any sanction imposed under division
(E), (F), or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine
offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this section
to the county treasurer. The county treasurer shall deposit the
reimbursements in the county’s general fund. The county shall use the
amounts deposited in the fund to pay the costs incurred by the county
pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (E), (F), or (G) of this
section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders pursuant to a
sanction imposed under division (E) of this section.



         (b)   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon
the offender pursuant to division (G)(1)(c) of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division  (E), (F), or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used
to confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of
this section to the treasurer of the municipal corporation. The treasurer
shall deposit the reimbursements in the municipal corporation’s general
fund. The municipal corporation shall use the amounts deposited in the fund
to pay the costs incurred by the municipal corporation pursuant to any
sanction imposed under division (E), (F), or (G) of this section or in
operating a facility used to confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed
under division (E) of this section.



         (c)   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed
pursuant to division (G)(1)(c) of this section for the costs incurred by a
private provider pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E), (F), or
(G) of this section to the provider.



      (4)   In addition to any other fine that is or may be imposed
under this division (G), the court imposing sentence upon an offender for
misdemeanor domestic violence or menacing by stalking may impose a fine of
not less than $70 nor more than $500, which shall be transmitted to the
Treasurer of Ohio to be credited to the address confidentiality program fund

restitution imposed pursuant to division (G)(1)(a) of this section is an
order in favor of the victim of the offender’s criminal act that can be
collected through a certificate of judgment as described in division

(G)(5)(b)3. of this section and the offender shall be considered for purposes

political subdivision may do any of the following:



            1.   Obtain from the clerk of the court in which
the judgment was entered a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same
manner and form as a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;

county court or a municipal court operated by a county, or by any other
reasonable method, in any time, and on any terms that the court considers
just, except that the maximum time permitted for payment shall not exceed
five years. If the court is a county court or a municipal court operated by a
county, the acceptance of payments by any financial transaction device shall
be governed by the policy adopted by the board of county commissioners of the
county pursuant to R.C. § 301.28. If the court is a municipal court not
operated by a county, the clerk may pay any fee associated with processing an
electronic transfer out of public money or may charge the fee to the offender.



         (c)   To defray administrative costs, charge a
reasonable fee to an offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump
sum payment of any financial sanction.



      (8)   No financial sanction imposed under this division (G)
shall preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.



(R.C. § 2929.28)

      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then such penalty shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty
provided in this section.



      (3)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
that provided in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be pursuant to
the penalty provided for violation of the section defining the offense.



      (4)   This section does not prevent the imposition of
available civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense
pursuant to § 130.09, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed
pursuant to this section.

   (A)   When a person is charged with a violation of § 131.02,
involving property value or an amount of physical harm of $500 or more, the
jury or court trying the accused shall determine the value of the property or
amount of physical harm and, if a guilty verdict is returned, shall return
the finding as part of the verdict.  In any such case it is unnecessary to
find or return the exact value or amount of physical harm (R.C. § 2945.75
applies), and it is sufficient if the finding and return is to the effect
that the value or amount of physical harm was $500 or more.



   (B)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value
of property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of § 131.02:



      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's
item, antique, museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing
that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of
substantial time, effort, or money, the value of the property or the amount
of physical harm involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for
its loss.



      (2)   If the property is not covered under division (B)(1) of
this section, and the physical harm is such that the property can be restored
substantially to its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved
is the reasonable cost of restoring the property.



      (3)   If the property is not covered under division (B)(1) of
this section, and the physical harm is such that the property cannot be
restored substantially to its former condition, the value of the property, in
the case of personal property, is the cost of replacing the property with new
property of like kind and quality, and in the case of real property or real
property fixtures, is the difference in the fair market value of the property
immediately before and immediately after the offense.



   (C)   As used in this section, FAIR MARKET VALUE has the same
meaning as in § 131.20.



   (D)   Prima facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in
§ 131.20(E), may be used to establish the value of property pursuant to this

violations of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, whether committed against one
victim or more than one victim, involving a victim who is an active duty
service member or spouse of an active duty service member pursuant to a
scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single
offense. If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the value of the
property or services involved for the purpose of determining the value as
required by R.C. § 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property and
services involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.



      (3)   When a series of two or more offenses under R.C. §
2913.40, 2913.48, or 2921.41 is committed by the offender in the offender’s
same employment, capacity, or relationship to another, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value as required by R.C. § 2913.61(A) is the aggregate
value of all property and services involved in all of the offenses in the
series of two or more offenses.



      (4)   In prosecuting a single offense under division (B)(1),
(B)(2) or (B)(3) of this section, it is not necessary to separately allege
and prove each offense in the series. Rather, it is sufficient to allege and
prove that the offender, within a given span of time, committed one or more
theft offenses or violations of R.C. § 2913.40, 2913.48, or 2921.41 in the
offender’s same employment, capacity, or relationship to another as
described in division (B)(1) or (B)(3) of this section, or committed one or
more theft offenses that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in division
(B)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
division (B)(1), (B)(2), or (B)(3) of this section, it remains necessary in
prosecuting them as a single offense to prove the aggregate value of the
property or services in order to meet the requisite statutory offense level
sought by the prosecution.



   (C)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value
of property or services involved in a theft offense:



      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector’s item,
antique, museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing that has
intrinsic worth to its owner and that either is irreplaceable or is
replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time, effort, or money, is
the amount which would compensate the owner for its loss.



      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and
of materials, supplies, equipment, and fixtures used in the profession,
business, trade, occupation, or avocation of its owner, which property is not
covered under division (C)(1) of this section, and which retains substantial
utility for its purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of
replacing such property with new property of like kind and quality.



      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not
covered under division (C)(1) or (C)(2) of this section, and the value of
services, is the fair market value of the property or services. As used in
this section, FAIR MARKET VALUE is the money consideration which a buyer
would give and a seller would accept for property or services, assuming that
the buyer is willing to buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are
fully informed as to all facts material to the transaction, and that neither
is under any compulsion to act.



   (D)   Without limitation on the evidence which may be used to
establish the value of property or services involved in a theft offense:



      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for
sale at wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for
sale is prima facie evidence of its value.



      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity
traded on an exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price,
the asked price, given in the latest marked quotation prior to the offense,
is prima facie evidence of the value of the security or commodity.



      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry, or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima facie evidence of the value
of the livestock, poultry, or products.



      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument,
the face value is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.



      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill
of lading, pawn ticket, claim check, or other instrument entitling the holder
or bearer to receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value,
the value of the property covered by the instrument less any payment
necessary to receive the property, is prima facie evidence of the value of
the instrument.



      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission,
ticket for transportation, coupon, token, or other instrument entitling the
holder or bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there
is no face value, the value of the property or services which may be received
by the instrument is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.



      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water,
telephone, transportation, shipping, or other services for which the rate is
established by law, the duly established rate is prima facie evidence of the
value of the services.



      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the
rate is not established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to
the offense of the rate for the services, either in writing, or orally, or by
posting in a manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of
potential offenders, the rate contained in the notice is prima facie evidence
of the value of the services.

any time period not specified on its license. This division does not prohibit
the sale of instant bingo tickets beginning at 9:00 a.m. for a bingo session
that begins at 10:00 a.m. If circumstances make it impractical for the
charitable organization to conduct a bingo session at the premises, or on the
day of the week or at the time specified on its license or if a charitable
organization wants to conduct bingo sessions on a day of the week or at a
time other than the day or time specified on its license, the charitable
organization may apply in writing to the Attorney General for an amended
license pursuant to R.C. § 2915.08(F). A charitable organization may apply
twice in each calendar year for an amended license to conduct bingo sessions

person regarding a possible violation of this section, for a traffic stop, or
for any other law enforcement purpose, if the person surrenders a firearm to
the officer, either voluntarily or pursuant to a request or demand of the
officer, and if the officer does not charge the person with a violation of
this section or arrest the person for any offense, the person is not
otherwise prohibited by law from possessing the firearm, and the firearm is
not contraband, the officer shall return the firearm to the person at the
termination of the stop.  If a court orders a law enforcement officer to
return a firearm to a person pursuant to the requirement set forth in this
division, R.C. § 2923.163(B) applies.

identity, and weight or the existence and number of unit dosages of the
substance. In any criminal prosecution for a violation of R.C. § 2925.041 or
a violation of this chapter, R.C. Chapter 2925 or R.C. Chapter 3719 that is

or established as described in this division that is signed by the person
performing the analysis, stating that the substances that are the basis of
the alleged offense have been weighed and analyzed and stating the findings
as to the content, weight, and identity of each of the substances, is prima
facie evidence of the content, identity, and weight of the substances.

of the substances that are, the basis of the alleged violation preserved for
the benefit of independent analysis performed by a laboratory analyst
employed by the accused person, or, if the accused is indigent, by a
qualified laboratory analyst appointed by the court.  Such portion shall be
a representative sample of the entire substance that is, or of each of the
substances that are, the basis of the alleged violation and shall be of
sufficient size, in the opinion of the court, to permit the accused's analyst
to make a thorough scientific analysis concerning the identity of the
substance or substances.  The prosecuting attorney shall provide the
accused's analyst with the sample portion at least 14 days prior to trial,
unless the trial is to be held in a court not of record or unless the accused
person is charged with a minor misdemeanor, in which case the prosecuting
attorney shall provide the accused's analyst with the sample portion at least
three days prior to trial.  If the prosecuting attorney determines that such
a sample portion cannot be preserved and given to the accused's analyst, the
prosecuting attorney shall so inform the accused person, or the accused's
attorney.  In such a circumstance, the accused person is entitled, upon
written request made to the prosecuting attorney, to have the accused's
privately employed or court appointed analyst present at an analysis of the
substance that is, or the substances that are, the basis of the alleged
violation, and, upon further written request, to receive copies of all
recorded scientific data that result from the analysis and that can be used
by an analyst in arriving at conclusions, findings, or opinions concerning
the identity of the substance or substances subject to the analysis.

misdemeanor violation, that involves marihuana, is entitled, upon written
request made to the prosecuting attorney, to have a laboratory analyst of the
accused's choice, or, if the accused is indigent, a qualified laboratory
analyst appointed by the court, present at a measurement or weighing of the
substance that is the basis of the alleged violation.  Also, the accused
person is entitled, upon further written request, to receive copies of all
recorded scientific data that result from the measurement or weighing and
that can be used by an analyst in arriving at conclusions, findings, or
opinions concerning the weight, volume, or number of unit doses of the
substance subject to the measurement or weighing.

on any substance that was the basis of, or involved in, the offense to
determine whether the substance contained any amount of a controlled
substance if the results of the tests indicate that the substance tested
contained any controlled substance. No court shall order an offender under
this section to pay the costs of tests performed on a substance if the
results of the tests do not indicate that the substance tested contained any
controlled substance. The court shall hold a hearing to determine the amount
of costs to be imposed under this section. The court may hold the hearing as
part of the sentencing hearing for the offender.

buildings, and other structures within the village.

provision of the code involved, and shall set forth exactly the
interpretation that is claimed, the use for which special exception is
sought, a clear description of the land involved, or the details of the
variance that is applied for and the grounds upon which it is claimed that
the variance should be granted, as the case may be.



   (A)   Filing appeals.  An appeal to the Board may be taken by any
property owner or tenant, other person aggrieved, or by a governmental
officer, department, board or bureau affected.  Such appeal, in a form
approved by the Board, shall be filed within 20 days after the decision of
the Zoning Administrator, or Planning Commission. The appeal shall be filed

the scale plot drawings, plans, specifications, and other papers pertaining
to the appeal, to the Secretary of the Board of Appeals.



   (B)   Hearings; dates and notices.  When an appeal has been filed
in proper form and with the required data, the Secretary of the Board shall
immediately notify the Chairman, who will send notices stating the time,

furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the Zoning Administrator
certifies to the Board, after notice of appeal shall have been filed with
him, that by reason of facts stated in the appeal, a stay would, in his
opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case, proceedings
shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may, on due
cause shown, be granted by the Board after notice to the Zoning
Administrator, or by judicial proceedings.



(Ord. 1969-11-22, passed 11- -69)



§ 152.60  POWERS OF BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS.



   (A)   In exercising its powers, the Board, in conformity with the
provisions of statute and this chapter, may reverse or affirm, wholly or in
part, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or determination
appealed from, and may make such order, requirement, decision or
determination as in its judgment ought to be made, and to that end shall have
all powers of the office from which the appeal is taken. The Board shall have
and shall be limited strictly to the powers and duties prescribed by law and
by this chapter. Appeals from the decision of the Board of Appeals may be
heard by a court of law.



   (B)   Upon appeal from a decision by the Zoning Administrator, the
Board shall have the power to decide any question involving the
interpretation of the zoning text or map, as follows:



      (1)   In case there is a question as to the intended meaning
of any provision of the Zoning text, the Board may interpret its meaning as
it applies to a particular property.  Before reaching a decision in response
to any request, the Board may obtain the opinion of the Village Solicitor
thereon.



      (2)   Where the street or lot layout actually on the ground or
as recorded, differs from the street and lot lines as shown on the zoning
map, the Board, after notice of public hearing, shall interpret the map in
such a way as to carry out the intent and purpose of this chapter for the
particular section or district in question.  In case of any question as to
the location of any boundary line between zoning districts, an application
for interpretation of the zoning map may be made to the Board, and a
determination shall be made by the Board by following the procedure
established in § 152.59.



   (C)   The Board may hear and decide, in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter, appeals from the Planning Commission for
applications for conditionally permitted uses.  In considering an
application for a conditional use, the Board shall give due regard to the
nature and condition of all adjacent uses and structures and the consistence
therewith of the proposed use and development. Before authorizing a use as a
conditional use, the Board shall determine whether the  proposed exception
or use would be hazardous, harmful, noxious, offensive, or a nuisance to the
surrounding neighborhood by reason of noise, smoke, odor, vibration, dust and
dirt, cinders, noxious gases, glare and heat, fire and safety hazards, sewage
wastes and pollution, transportation and traffic, aesthetic and psychological
effects.  Upon authorizing a conditional use, the Board may impose such
requirements and conditions with respect to location, construction,
maintenance and operation, in addition to those expressly stipulated in this
chapter for the particular conditional use, as the Board may deem necessary
for the protection of adjacent properties and public interest.



   (D)   The Board shall have the power to authorize upon appeal from
the Planning Commission, such variances from the provisions or requirements
of this chapter as will not be contrary to the public interest, whereby
strict application of such provisions or requirements would result in
practical difficulty and unnecessary hardship that would deprive the owner of
the reasonable use of the land or buildings involved, but in no other case. 
No variance from the strict application of any provision of this chapter
shall be granted by the Board unless it finds, beyond reasonable doubt, that
all the following facts and conditions exist.



      (1)   That special conditions and circumstances exist which
are peculiar to the land, structure, or building involved, and which are not
applicable to other lands, buildings, or structures within the same district.



      (2)   That literal interpretation of the provisions of this
chapter would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other
properties in the same district under the terms of this chapter.



      (3)   That the special conditions and circumstances do not
result from the actions of the applicant.



      (4)   That granting the variance requested will not confer on
the applicant any special privilege which is denied by this chapter to other
lands, structures, or buildings in the same district.



      (5)   That granting of the variance will be in harmony with
the general purpose and intent of this chapter and will not be injurious to
the neighborhood or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare.



   (E)   In no case, shall the Board of Appeals approve a variance for
a use which is not a permitted use in the district in which the property,
building, or structure is located.



(Ord. 1969-11-22, passed 11- -69)



§ 152.61  EXPIRATION OF SPECIAL PERMITS.



   Every conditional permit or variation of the application of the literal
provisions of this chapter, allowed or granted, as provided in this chapter,
shall expire and be of no force or effect after the expiration of six months
from the date thereof, unless the beneficiary of such variation or
conditional permit shall have actually, within such period, put the subject
property to the purpose for which such variation or conditional permit use
shall have been granted or allowed.



(Ord. 1969-11-22, passed 11- -69)



§ 152.62  PROSECUTION OF VIOLATIONS.



   Where the owner and/or occupant of any premises fails to comply with a
notice of violation of any of the provisions of this chapter, the owner or
occupant shall be considered to be in violation of this chapter and the
Zoning Administrator shall proceed at law to compel compliance and to
prosecute the violation.

ADULT ENTERTAINMENT FACILITIES



§ 152.700  INTENT.



   The intent of this subchapter is to regulate adult uses, also known as
sexually-oriented businesses, through the application of uniform zoning and
licensing requirements to promote the health, safety, morals and general
welfare of the citizens of New Bremen and to establish reasonable and uniform
regulations for the operation of sexually-oriented businesses with the goal
of reducing or eliminating the adverse secondary effects associated with
sexually-oriented businesses. It is not the intent of this zoning code to
limit or restrict the content of communicative materials, including
sexually-oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of
this zoning code to restrict or deny access by adults to materials protected
by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors

that faces a public street and such sign may not extend into any required
setback line or above or below the wall surface. Wall signs shall be limited
to one per each street for which the structure fronts for single-occupant

required setback. However, in no case shall the wall sign be permitted to be
larger than 64 square feet.



   (B)   Projecting signs.  Projecting signs are permitted only in the
Central Commercial Districts (C-1). One projecting sign is permitted per
building per street frontage. Projecting signs shall project not more that
four feet outward from the wall of the structure, shall not exceed 20 square
feet and shall be perpendicular to the wall to which they are attached. All
projecting signs shall be located not less than nine feet above the sidewalk

incidental to places of worship, libraries, museums and schools are permitted

they serve. All ground signs of this type shall meet the setback requirements
of the chapter.



      (5)   Off-premises ground signs are permitted in the
commercial and industrial districts. A single location in these districts may
have up to two off-premises ground signs. Each sign face intended for viewing
from the street shall be considered a sign. No single off-premises ground
sign shall exceed 64 square feet in area and shall not exceed the height
regulations for the zoning district in which it is located. Off-premises
ground signs shall meet the setback requirements for structures of the
appropriate district in which they are located.

is being used to provide shelter from inclement weather for patrons entering
or exiting a building. Such signs shall be permitted as long as the maximum
height of the lettering or numbers affixed to the awning is no larger than
eight inches in height. Awning signs that are lit from the back will not be
permitted. This standard for awning signs may also include awnings placed
over windows and containing letters or numbers, provided they do not exceed

   (G)   Canopy signs.  Canopy signs are permitted in commercial and
industrial districts as long as they are attached to or are an integral part
of the canopy. Canopy signs may be erected on a canopy that faces a public
street, and such sign may not extend into any required building setback line
or above or below the canopy surface. Letters or numerals mounted on a canopy
shall be considered a canopy sign. Signs shall be attached parallel to the
canopy face and extend outward perpendicular from the canopy face a maximum
of eight inches. Canopy signs shall not exceed a maximum area of 36 square
feet. Canopy signs shall not be illuminated.



   (H)   Reader boards.  Reader boards are those signs that contain
provisions or capabilities that allow or enable the text to be readily
changed. Such signs are used to promote weekly sales, new product or
services, or features. The use of such signs shall be permitted, provided the
reader boards are permanently affixed to the structure or the support system
used for any freestanding or pylon sign. The sign area used for the reader
board shall be included in the calculated sign area permitted under divisions
(A) and (C) of this section.  Reader boards shall not be more than 30% of
